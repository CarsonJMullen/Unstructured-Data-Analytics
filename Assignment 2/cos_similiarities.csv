3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Blind tasting: Amber gold. Ornate tiny-bubbled white head is rocky and extremely persistent. Mesmerizing nose of peaches and lactobacillus. Equally proportionate hints of clay, iron, horseblanket and musty minerals and oak. Vigorous swirls unveil an astonishingly lustrous fruitiness as well as some band-aid phenols. Fine carbonation massages the palate. Slickly bodied. Tongue-buckling acidity slowly yields to an explosively juicy, flavorsome and bright peach-fuzz acidity. Unbelievably polished from the get-go. Harsh phenols take a backseat to the supple fruitiness. Oak is clean and artfully restrained, allowing the dizzying array of nuances to fully bloom.  Oak tugs on the palate and dries things out, beautifully contrasting with the fruity esters which coat and gently embrace the tongue. Fusion of oak and hay-like malt is in perfect harmony as are the seamlessly interwoven slick fruitiness and cleansing dryness. Finishes with a gorgeous flash of acetic acid which is adorned with clean oak and bouncy notes of nutty and hay-like malt. World-class stuff all the way. Easily one of the most well-rounded and extravagant beers I’ve ever experienced. Thanks for sharing, cquiroga!",0.0

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"two bottles shared in june 2006, purchased from Heeren van Lindekerke 



Much more funk in the nose compared to the Roze... some rich, stinky cheese, and starchy sour cream.  Much more lively carbonation as well, very active on the tongue, peppy.  Creamy acidity, flavor is a little subdued (but I had allergies this day).  Rich and sweet tasting, with some really funky, cheese-like funky flavors of horseblanket, lemons, hay and wheat.  Aroma is amazingly rich and ""funked"", more so than any other gueuze I’ve had.  Really a different animal than most old gueuze, over-funked, over-cheesed, fresh and lively, simply amazing.




third sample from may 2010: chewy, fatty bile, soft and thick like dough.  pungent mold and pork fat bile... easily the best of the night up against roze, crianza helena, 07 3F and 06 hanssens.",0.05581455721859476

Slightly cloudy straw colored with a large white fizzy head that clears quickly to reveal nice lacing.  Amazing carbonation for a 6+ year old brew.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"A: The pour is orange/amber in color with a towering white head and a staggering level of carbonation.

S: Seems to be a bit more composed than the Roos. Lots of wet oak, hay, lemon, green apple, and grass. There’s a nice acidity to the nose along with plenty of ""green"" funk.

T: The lemon, green apple, and lactic acidity is more pronounced on the palate than the nose lets on. Plenty of must, oak, along with hay and grass. A definite funkiness that I would put under the ""barnyard"" umbrella.

M: The body is medium with a high level of carbonation and a bone dry finish.

D: Again, the better of the two (Roos and Blauw), but one that I wish I had a bit more frame of reference on (meaning, I wish I’d tried them when they were younger). Still, a really great gueuze.",0.0

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Drank next to the ’02 Vintage. Cork blasted off but there was only the smallest amount lost before pouring a rich gold body with large, unshakable fluffy white head. “Funk” is a vague word, but it best describes perhaps the most complex nose I’ve sniffed in a geuze, the first 6-7 swirls each giving a new element: mushroom, earth, leaves and grass, lemon, lime, leather. The flavor keeps this up, trading element after element in a funky earth way that never compromises yet never breaks from the balance. Like Mingus leading a 10-piece band, this is at once chaotic and sublime while simultaneously tight as all hell and brooding like sin. The massive funk rules out any easy fruit acidity or pale malt as havens to run for when expecting a traditional lambic. By my experience, this is geuze at its most hardcore and earthy. I could imagine studying this one for a lifetime, that is if I could get another bottle.",0.058621038176054935

Gold, maybe a hint of cloudiness.  Head is as dense as would be expected on a Heife - looks like it should be atop an ice cream float.  Nose is lemon, dusty green apple, mustyness I haven’t gotten from a geuze in a long time.  Flavor is a sublime combination of bitterness, acidity & sweetness.  Lemon pits, pepperiness.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"- The cork pops out loudly and we were are a little surprised by the bottle gushing. This beer is almost 7 years old and still has plenty of carbonation. Pours copper gold with a pillowy white head that leaves a web and decent lacing.

S - Blauw brings the funk, a soaking wet horse rolling on a blue cheese blanket in a barn. The citric aroma of lemon peel is there with a light oak.

T - A perfect balance is what describes the taste. Not as funky as the nose, nice lemon, oak, white grapes, with a tannic finish.

M/D - high carbonation, tannic dry finish, with decent acidity that does not wear on the palate. The only reason I stopped sipping on this beer was to enjoy the assortment of funky cheeses.

A beautiful blend of lambics that has easily stood up to 7 years, and my favorite gueuze to date.",0.0
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"[Bottle] shared with tytoanderso with a HUGE thanks to yespr! Pours a hazy gold with a massive khaki head. Aroma has tons of barnyard and brett, loads of lactic acid, as it warms, tons of bitter grapefruit peel come forward. Really a rich and full aroma with a surprising amount of sweetness still evident. Flavor is quite tart and sour, but not nearly the most sour I’ve had. Somehow the beer manages to be dry and sweet at the same time. The flavor has lots of bitter grapefruit peel, various citric fruit rinds, funk, and lots of other citric juciness. Full mouthfeel and surprisingly smooth and creamy. The yeast pour doesn’t change the beer a whole lot other than to add a little more citrus to the nose and a little more creaminess to the mouthfeel.

Doesn’t look impressive in any way, but rustic and sort of sexy anyway. Lightly dusty on the nose, with some vinegar hints, overall more intense than the Roze, especially on the funky side. More lemon, more barnyard, but without the rubbery touch from the female of the two. Intensely tart and dry on the palate, with lemony, funky flavors lasting for a good while. Even though there was a slightly unpleasant rubbery note in the Roze, I prefer that one. Both are certainly good beers, but I also think they’re overrated, probably due to the rare-factor. Really pleased to have tasted them though. 111229",0.0

The aroma is really nice and funky showing notes of sour citrus fruit and acidity from the likes of orange, grapefruit, and lemons. The musty, horse blanket barnyard yeast lends a funky, spicy, earthy quality as well. The oak barrel imparts some vanilla that smooths out the citric acidity. The flavor follows with the intense sour citrus acidity with the lemons, grapefruits, and some soft peach pushing their way through. Some white grapes and tannins from the oak come next and seem to balance out the intense sourness. The funky, barnyard yeast really shines though and lends some earthiness to it all.

Dry/deep green fruity aroma with the perfect blend of lambics. Keeps this side that I had previously found at Cantillon in their lambic.
On the palate, we find this unique aspect of lambics, moreover for this one, with 7 years of age. Keeps a fruity side with a fine acidity. Remains dry in the mouth with notes of wheat, white grapes and a palate that still leaves many years to mature.

Unclear orange with a medium diminishing white head that leave’s a small forever lasting white head and superb lacing. Beautiful beer!  Aroma is lemony with herbal/floral notes and mild Gueuze aroma characteristics. Taste is incredibly smooth and wonderfully complex. Fruits (lemon, grapefruit, apple, pineapple), wood, barnyard and leather. Dry and citric mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Except for the aroma that could have been a little more complex (probably mellowed with age though), there’s no flaws in this beer. Perfect balance, amazing complexity and great drinkability . It’s the nearest thing from a perfect Gueuze (and beer) that I’ve drank so far. The saddest things about this beer is that it would be the perfect ""go to"" gueuze but it’s rarer than Pope’s sh**.  

Updated: Bottle (750 ml). Tasted again at De Heeren van Liedekercke on April 20th 2014 just before Roze and Heerengueuze. My rating stay the same as the one up here.

Pours a dark golden yellow color with pale golden straw colored hues and a two finger soapy white head. Good retention, slowly fading into a lasting cap that leaves sporadic spots of lace in it’s wake.

Earthy, musty aroma that isn’t overly funky with barrel/wood character as well as some barnyard/horsey notes, crisp light fruit and subtle citrus.

Medium bodied with a soft, earthy funkiness that isn’t harsh, solvent-like or overpowering allowing the citrus notes and vinegary acetic acids to shine through. Very clean, complex and smooth with a well balanced flavor profile that makes it very easy too drink. This beer has aged very gracefully, retaining it’s puckering, funky character while remaining clean and quaffable.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Cloudy golden body with bright white and orange outlying hues, very bold looking, like it’s awake.

A gently caressing nose is very expressive, even in its mellowed state. Notes of must and dust peel back slowly to reveal a blend of citrus fruits, sour barnyard, wheat, minerals, tart cherries, apples and ascorbic acid(chewable vitamin C), grassy notes and a full-on assault of yeast. What an experience. Flavor is mildly acidic and heavily fruity. Sweetness is just apparent enough to provide a sense of balance. Bitterness sets in late and with a full coating near the finish. Medium to medium-full bodied mouthfeel, zesty and refined at once. The palate is perfectly wrought, an intense maze of carbonation and yeasty particulates, with a dab of lemon juice acidity for good measure. Spicy and warming, the swallow leads to a finish of neverending complexity, lengthy and sublime. Light bitterness counterbalances a marauding sweetness that builds with each sip.

Aroma is nice and complex with an amazing earthiness and herbal note to it. Light citric acidity to compliment the beer. Musty hay and barnyard notes to compliment. Almost no acetic note. Herbal character is a touch minty. 
Pours a fairly clear pale golden color with a fairly big, light pillowy head that recedes until it is just a film along the top and edges. The film persists for quite some time. 
Flavor has a bit more citrus than the aroma and has a touch less barnyard character. Flavor still has quite a bit of that earthy, herbal note. Really pleasant balance of acidity and funk. The moderate acidic note is clean and citrusy while very smooth and not in your face. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Such a nice silkiness to this beer which is shocking for an acidic beer. 
Overall an amazingly complex beer with so much nice earthy notes, barnyard notes, some hay and really light, pleasant acidity.

We were all ready with glasses for the rush, so it was a pleasant surprise when this beer opened with a healthy pop and no explosion. Pour is a golden orangey straw with a fluffy but not quite rocky white head that fades to half a finger. Aroma is classic farmyard brett-dominated, with musty floral and vitamin notes. Taste is much more balanced than expected -- no bitterness, but incredibly dry. Tart cherry and citrus flavors initially dominate, and as it warms it becomes more floral/grassy and distinctly mineral. Carbonation is high but not overpowering, and mouthfeel is surprisingly rich. Zero astringency.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"The legendary special blend made in 1998 for the fiftieth anniversary of the Drie Fonteinen blendery, released in 2000 as a one-off, and the first to bear Felix De Boeck's ""Nightlights"" (a Flemish 1977 painting) on its label, later reused on the Oude Geuze Vintage. Never thought I would ever get the chance to taste this legend, but Akkurat had a few bottles left apparently and I was more than happy to pay the 1295 SEK they charged per bottle - considering the skyrocketing prices whales like this generate on the black market, it seemed proportionally very reasonable. Fun to see how nervous the waiter was when he had to open the bottle, quite a solemn moment really. And after twenty years, this geuze was still very much alive: some gushing was apparently inevitable but with minimal loss (not more than, say, 5 SEK or so…).

Ancient damp cellar and decades old wine from said cellar cover the original profile like an ornamental blanket, a profile consisting of ripe peaches, sour apple, oxidized white wine, haystack, very old dry sherry, moldy lemon peel, moist jute cloth, green plum peel, sour grapes, old artisanal cider, barnyard, faint hint of chlorine - all the fine elements I am looking for in a top quality 'oude' geuze. Softly and complexely estery onset, wryness of grape and plum peel soaked in gooseberry and crabapple sourness with a softer pear- and peach-like edge, yet nowhere descending into a harshly burning acidity and enlivened by a perfectly measured, cava-like sparkling on the tongue. A soft, bready 'soil' carries the esters onwards with pear and gooseberry remaining the most prominent impressions, towards a 'brut', highly complex, dense but still refreshing finish in which the musty cellar and very old wine notes are accompanied by hayish and leathery Brettanomyces effects on top and wet wood tannins below, the latter quite long-stretched and eventually bittered by a dim, structurally essential and perfectly positioned, very late hop bitter touch. The tartness carries on, adorned by the woody effects and the noble effects of elegant aging. I have held this producer in very high esteem ever since I first put a Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze to my lips a couple of decades ago, but this absolute masterpiece of a geuze was a real honour to taste, all the more so because age has not demolished its basic structure: on the contrary, the ancient wine and musty cellar merely oversee the funky, estery complexity with great care and nobility. Underneath these charming old age aspects still lies a perfectly refreshing, perfectly solid, complex and bright geuze, internally untouched by age, like the roguishly twinkling blue eyes of a weather-beaten old man's face still betraying his soul's eternal youth. Before I get even more lyrical: among the most masterful geuzes I ever had the pleasure to taste, one I had been dreaming of for a long time, and one to reverentially bow one's head for when it happens to cross one's path. Granting it a perfect score is the only option I have on this site.",0.05044332723053186

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle at the DC Lambic & Sour Tasting on April 14, 2012. Served in an old-school Drie Fonteinen fountains gueuze tumbler. Huge thanks to Brad for this one.

Pours a clear golden color with a bit of a tawny hue to the background. The head is white and small, falling somewhat quickly and leaving behind some sparse lacing as it lays down in a thin collar.

The nose brings some heavy earth and funk with lightly-oxidized malt. Some interesting light herbal characteristics in the background that I’ve never gotten from a Drie Fonteinen gueuze before.

The flavor is much more complex and integrated, with the funk, earth, and light herbal character headed to the next level. Average flavor duration with light acidity and moderate funk through the finish.

The body is medium and slightly-chewy with light carbonation. Really great feel and complexity.

We had this side-by-side with the Oude Geuze 1999 blend (supposedly one of Armand’s favorites) and Millennium, and both of those quite handily beat out this bottle. With that said, this beer was still very, very good.",0.05006261743217588

Mouth is refined to perfection, just a lovely collage of dry champagne, cheesy funk, floral and herbal qualities on the finish.

I don’t feel so bad about leaving my 2004 Speedway behind now. Once again Clark’s review is much more detailed that mine but I will add my two cents to a rating of this brew:  Poured surprisingly clean and was topped by a big foamy white head and had excellent strings of lace work upon the glass. The nose detected lots of barnyard and brett yeast character along with fleeting vapors of floral meadows and lemongrass. There was also a strange corky and steel nature to the nose that shows some damage in aging.  The flavors are very rustic and farmyard up front with some lingering acidic fruit. I too found the metallic finish but unlike Clark, Chris and Mike (sorry guys you are wrong) I did not seem to mind it as much as my rating proves. The mouth feel is soft yet does have a crisp around the edge bite to keep things interesting. I loved this beer and would truly freak out for another chance to try it.

Dark golden colour with big, frothy, white head. Fruity, sourish nose with notes of barnyard, horse blanket, grapefruit, sour green grapes, funky yeast and a slight oxidation. Fruity, tart taste with tart fruit, grapefruit, sour grapes, lemon, gooseberries, barnyard, cellar notes, funky yeast and a dry and tart finish, with a light bitterness coming through. Medium body, dry. Has survived 20 years nicely and has retained lots of flavour and excellent balance. A benchmark for gueuze. Lovely beer!",0.11433239009500588
3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Hazy pale yellow. Tightly-woven sticky foam with some rockiness. Alluringly aromatic nose of cedar and must. Swirl of the glass yields lemon, oak, and airy elements. Creamy with a well-rounded softness. Initially firm with musty oak and a brett-laced blast of lactic acidity and vinegar. Soft bodied, yet remarkably brisk at the same time, with a staunch foundation of crushed minerals. Rich toasty oakiness thwarts much of the irony tartness, while the brett virtually fades into a mere afterthought. Vague sparkle of perfume and husky Pils malt. Less tongue-grippingly tart, though, showing trace peach acidity and tannins, which are shortened by the body’s softness. Ends woodily firm and dry, but insistently soft and seemingly low-attenuated, with a muted mix of white grapes and honeyed malt. It’s undoubtedly on the oaky end of the Lambic spectrum, which you gotta love, but it needs a lengthier malt character and certainly more influence from the acidity and brett, to be flawless.",0.0

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle @ Mikkeller Bar in San Francisco. One of the last few bottled 3F beer I have yet to track down. Flipped my crap when i saw this on the shelf. $180 for a 75CL bottles split 1 way with me, myself and I and like all good Lambic, savored for 3 hours. Delicious. I believe it was around 50F temp when served.



A - First pour was a burnt dark orange / gold appearance. The cork had a HUGE pop exploding but not gushing. GREAT SIGN! First pour was a 5 finger solid white huge bubbly head. Subsequent pours got more cloudy obviously. Dregs were dark brown w/ hints of red.



S - Nose is a mix of blue cheese, cardboard basement musk and funk with a lot of wood, mold and more cheese the 3F funk with lemon nose is there but super subdued. Reminds of the same funky moldy basement funk that I got from Blauw.



T - a know what....taste is pretty freaking awesome. Yes a lot of cardboard and shoe polish. A lot of leather and wood and moldy grapes. But it’s incredibly tart and well done. Lots of lemon, cloth aged old cheddar and funk classic 3 F. Tart overall. 



M - Bursting classic 3F mouthfeel. Bubbly, filling and huge.



O - Great beer. Like all 10+ year old Gueuze, it’s not wonderful as super fresh stuff but it’s still fantastic. I’m happy having had the chance to try this delicious beer.",0.0

750 mL bottle.  Thanks to OhioDad via Jonathan.  Pours with a deep deep black with a thick dark brown head.  Left considerable lacing.  Aroma was absolutely dominated with espresso coffee though plenty of roasted malt and caramel made it’s way through though chocolate was supressed from the big coffee presence.  In the flavor, chocolate was able to be perceived, though the coffee was still big in the profile.  Some slight crystal malt sweetness come through along with roasted malt and some douginess.  Flavor was fairly dry for an Imperial Stout, especially in the finish.  Hops made its way through the ruckus both in flavor and bitterness though a considerable amount of that bitterness was from roasted malts I believe.  Alcohol was there, but not overpowering with just a bit of warmth in the finish.  Mouthfeel was a notch below DL, but still considerably thick and smooth but not as coating as DL.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"My second visit to this fine beer, which I believe is the same vintage 5 months later, was somewhat more fruitful a venture... Literally, the strong coffee flavor were backed up magnificently by a fruity raisin and dark chocolate backbone. Much more complex and even more drinkable. My compliments to this beer still stand. My criticism does not.

Original: So here it is, direct from Hi-Times wines mail order, the legendary Speedway Stout. Though, I find myself questioning why it’s so  legendary. Yes, it’s huge. Yes, it’s loaded with coffee and good old fashioned imperial stout flavor. It’s quality sipper for sure--big, warming, well-covered alcohol, silky smooth mouthfeel, well-balanced--an expertly brewed beer. Trouble is: there’s just not much going aside from coffee and a little bit more coffee. It’s an excellent beer but it leaves me in a bit of a bind to rate it as it’s a bit--for the lack of a better word--boring. Ok. Simple might be better. Really, how much you like this beer is gonna depend on how much you like coffee. I like coffee a lot but I like beer better. High marks but not top marks. Good day.",0.0

Pours an inky black, with a retroactive head: the beer pours without a head, then the head rises up of its own volition. Very cool! Great lacing as well. Held up to the light, it remains equally black, light does not penetrate this beer. Nose is milk chocolate, coffee of many shades, fruit, a certain vinous character. Not as complex as say Struise Black Albert, but huge and immensely pleasing. The palate is so much better than the nose, good as it was. Coffee beans, milk chocolate, espresso, malt, roast, mouthcoating, very well-ntegrated hops. This beer transistions from swet to bitter, then sweet and bitter.

Palate is a nice thick creamy well carbonated even body.  Flavor is a nice sweet malty coffee flavor lots of coffee in this brew there is also some vanilla bean in it and a light bitter swallow as well as a nice warm sensation.  This is some GOOD stuff.

Sampled this on tap now at The Liars Club.  Wow.. yeah.. it just went from an 8->10 in flavor.  Stuff is amazing fresh the flavors all just pop out.",0.0

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"regular Speedway 750mL bottle many times, pours black with a tan head. Aroma is HUGE on espresso beans.

Single Variety Speedway at AleSmith for Speedway Grand Prix 2013. On tap at AleSmith, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma brings out potent coffee and heavy roast. Flavour brings out complex coffee notes, a little bit of spice, and roast. Very complex and coffee-dominated. Very little residual sweetness, with a very roasted and coffee centric finish. Excellent stuff.  Rating: 4.4/5 11/9/2013. 


Hammerhead Speedway at AleSmith for Speedway Grand Prix 2013. On tap at AleSmith, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma brings out loads of coffee, and subtler roast - quite potent coffee but not as much as the Kopi Luwak version. Flavour isn’t as roasted as the other alternate coffee versions of Speedway, but is more spicy and earthy coffee. Great stuff, but inferior to the other coffee Speedways, including the regular.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Finally decided to crack open one of my bottles.  2006 (I think - possibly early 07) 750ml - 55 degrees, Black pour with a nice looking tan head.  Aroma has an incredible creamy essence with lots of rich coffee, chocolate, and a nice roastiness.  Flavor is fantastic - coffee, chocolate, cream, vanilla, finely roasted malts, just a hint of hops and alcohol - this is great even at a younger age!  Mouthfeel is simply incredible, ranging from silky smooth to tingly.  Just about perfect - The best use of coffee in a beer by far.  Alcohol is barely noticeable and the experience is fantastic.  What a beer!",0.0

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"2016 vintage. Appearance: deep dark brown/Black, opaque, with a low lying khaki head and nice lacing
Aroma: All malt, with rich dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, and light roast
Taste: Rich dark chocolate with a light toffee and roast. Beautifully balanced with just enough bitterness to balance
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a light creaminess and a light carbonation 
Finish: Roasted malt and bitterness lingers on the finish with a touch of dark chocolate 
Overall: Beautifully balanced for an imperial story with coffee. Profile is insanely smooth throughout, from aroma thru the finish. Dark chocolate and toffee are most prevalent, but a lightly roasted coffee note balances while remaining smooth. A light creaminess tonthe body helps blend the flavors together.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Big thanks to kpresley77 for this gem. Pours dark as night, with a half-inch thick light brown dense head. Aroma is intoxicating in itself, a pot of melted chocolate, with a strong alcohol aroma that fits in perfectly, strong espresso coffee, and candy sugars. Wonderful nose. The texture and flavors of the beer coat your palate and don’t let go. Oily, and dense as the alcohol and hops initially bits your tongue, next the dark roast  flavors sooth you mouth and make you want to drink this all night.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"750 ml bottle.  Pours blacker than a thousand midnights.  Like a black hole devouring all light that attempts to pass through.  A thin, small but creamy head forms slowly.  At the onset the aroma is so obviously coffee, but then it begins to divide itself into many different coffees.  Dark roast, espresso, even  mild.  Hints of chocolate?  Can the taste ever live up to its bouquet?  As I slowly tip the glass I’m at first leery, and fearful of disappointment.  But then I’m taken away and actually get chills across my shoulders and back.  All the complexity and wonderful diversity of the aroma is maintained … no … surpassed as I get near giddy at the sheer joy of the experience.  All the while, that wonderful coffee presence at its core.  Soft carbonation, a bit sticky, it leaves me smacking and licking my lips wanting to make sure that I don’t miss a single opportunity for pleasure.  I bought this about a month ago, and it states right on the bottle that it’s best if aged 6 to 24 months.  Bottled on 8/4/2009 would have meant I’d have to wait until around March of 2010!  Alas … I wasn’t strong enough.  Then again, if waiting meant it could be even better, I’m not sure I could have survived the experience.",0.0
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Much thanks to Joebrew for sharing this excellent beer.  Very comparable to Peche Mortel.  Aroma is strong with coffee and roasted malt.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,Pours like motor oil with a really high viscosity. Only way to get a head is to pour really fast and the head is dark brown. Aroma of coffee and burnt nuts. The flavor is of coffee and some chocolate but somethings missing. No rum-raisin flavors. Never would guess that this is 12% either. A great brew but might be a little over the top as far as body. I prefer Rogue's Chocolate Imperial as well as DFH's WWS.,0.0

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Color pours out a typical leathery brown to settle a thickly burnt black with a purply-brown plum-like hint in tone, absolutely no head produced, just a few bubbles from a vigorous pour, no real lace either.

Just loved the smell of this, so chocolatey and absolutely yummy on the nose. Makes your mouth water - so time to quench! Taste starts with a smooth chocolate tone thats very dark and rich, stays mellow for a good portion of its stand, oh then the finish, oh the finish! Everything is noted here starting strong with espresso and some hoppy bitterness. Then gets quite complex with warming alcohol, molasses, tangy dark roastyness thats bittering deep and long; turning to a slightly burnt chocolate cake with espresso and chocolatey drying lately lingering for a good while. Absolutely amazing great finish! Feel is full and hefty, good little help of creamyness with some major finishing of both a strong chocolatey dryness and some espresso/coffee bittering, souring sweetness on the tongue.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"400th rating, had to be something special, so I kept this bottle for some months away, and today at the start of my birthday (30 years, here it was 00u passed at the 26th) It was time to open this bottle and enjoy it together with my wife. Poured it at a ""gulden draak"" glass, so think that is ok. Thanx to NoiZe for sending this beer to me. Pours out like expected, black with a good head. The head is even very big, and sticks nice to the glass. Medium dark brown coloured, and holds pretty good. Smell is coffee, but with a bit of something unpleasant inside. Roastiness, coffee, some chocolate and hops, and something that goes slightly sour (not overwhelming, but its there slightly). Taste is roasted coffee, an oily body, but less then expected. Some weird, even a bit unpleasant ""sourish""- berry’s comes up, that changes to a bitter coffee-chocolate aftertaste. Lots of chocolate at the aftertaste also, maybe some nespresso? It’s not completely the beer I hoped for, I’ve tasted better imperial stouts for sure. In my opinion it’s overrated, but it’s still a very decent beer. But to buy it again... specially at this price... no... A bit of a disappointment. It gets a bit better while warming up, but still...

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bottle in snifter.  Very thick viscous pour.  Jet black in color with a pretty big brown head that fades quickly.  Big lacing on the glass.  Huge fresh coffee aroma to go with toasted malt and dark chocolate.  Taste is rich coffee and chocolate up front, mildly sweet.  Slight bitterness hits in the middle along with big toasty malts.  Finish adds thick caramel to the flavors.  Somewhat dry finish.  Coffee and caramel linger on the tongue for a very long time.  Big thick and chewy mouthfeel.  Very slight alcohol warming.  This is a great Imperial Stout.  Glad I finally got to try.  One of my new favorites.  Re-rate 3/21/13 - Love this stuff and want to bump it up a little.  I still feel like the nose could be just a tad better but the taste and mouthfeel are top notch.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"750ml Bottle

Recieved this from Taynor a couple months back, thanks Dana! Speedway Stout is black as night when poured into my snifter letting no light pass through whatsoever. A short but dense one finger beige head formed on the pour, quickly falling to a skimming with a thick ring around the glass. Leaves respectable lacing after each tip of the glass.

The aroma hits hard with big doses of roasty malt and anise. I didn’t expect so much anise in a coffee stout. There’s more creaminess than coffee in this particular bottle and a some dark berriness wafts through the more pronounced aromas. All this makes for an inviting stout but I was hoping to get a little more coffee. A mild boozy spiciness brings up the backend creating a bit more depth in the aroma.

Now this is a tasty stout! Roasty malts are quickly followed by mild bittersweet coffee, anise, and a pleasant spicy alcohol that brings some of that peppery berriness. There’s still not a great deal of coffee involved but this is a top shelf stout without it. The finish is a perfect comcination of bitter coffee, dark berries, and roasty malts creating a bit more bitterness. I love my stouts with a bitter finish and this one brings it.

The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of the spectrum. This is just my picky side but it could use a touch more creaminess. Leaves some residue, without being sticky, that helps the flavor linger.

As big as this stout is the drinkability is up toward the top of the ladder. The lack of creaminess actually helps the the drinkability. 

This is, without a doubt, an excellent stout! I just don’t think it’s a World beater! I would like to get my paws on another bottle for more extensive testing but as it stands I feel there’s better examples out there.

Secondary flavors of stone fruits, red wine sour and lingering coffee/mild hop bitterness--No ""bite,"" just a nice smooth, clinging aftertaste.  Very slick/creamy, oily mouthfeel that leaves a slight coating on the palate.  Ultra fine carbonation with a medium body.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Tap at AleSmith Brewery Tap Room

Aroma: well rounded roasted aroma, caramel, coffee. But this beer really have a great balanced flavor. The coffee, malt and bourbon scents are all there and very distinct. High definition, and great smell. Usually, a stout will have multiple levels of smells and they would be blended together, but this stout have all scents and they are very easy to pick out. And it's the authentic coffee, authentic roasty smell. 4.6/5

Appearance: At a certain stage when everything is correct, I look for the corners. This beer hits all the marks, and what I have to say is the lace. Truly beautiful. Great lace retention. 4.6/5

Flavor: again, very similar to the aroma, this beer is great on all flavors, and the barrel aging just make all the flavors more balanced and all rounded. I can clearly take the bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coffee, malt. I would say this is indeed THE BEST STOUT I have tried so far. 4.75/5

Mouthfeel: smooth, thick, full body, but with all the good sides on bourbon. 4.5/5

Overall: The reason why I love this beer is because it just brings all the designed flavors in a very great way. Since they have another blue mountain coffee stout version, and this Vietnamese coffee is just a bit better. I don't wanna give it a 10/10 since you never know if there are more good stuff outta there. 18/20.",0.0

The barrel character makes itself known, but does not smell hot....lingering sweetness of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate and a final dose of heavy roast. Taste is delicate, yet bold. Nice medley of coffee and chocolate out of the gate. Simmers into oak, vanilla and fudge....and then the bourbon creeps in to take the sweetness of the edges. Great mouthfeel, thick but not chewy...seems the barrel thinned this out in comparison to the non-BA Vietnamese version I had.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988 for his 1000th rating. Congrats buddy. The pour is a nice oily black with a thin head of dark khaki that falls to a ring, leaving no lace. The aroma is a huge chocolate bomb. It’s awesome. There is such a big chocolate malt presence. There is a strong barrel character as well. The bourbon is big and it does offer a nice addition of vanilla. The coffee is quite subdued, which I’m not that much of a fan of. The flavor is good, but lightly disappointing. The coffee again is lacking. The chocolate is big once more and the bourbon is nice. There is a strong woodiness to it that I just don’t care too much for. The head and chocolate balance well though. The mouth feel is a little light. It’s viscous, but you have to work the carbonation out and I’m not crazy about that. This one is good, but it’s not quite as good as some of the other BA variants. The aftertaste is chocolatey and malty and carries a little bourbon to it. It’s tasty",0.0

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Pours a completely black color, with a small, light brown head.

Full of fudge and ground coffee on the nose with lots of dough cream and a warming barrel appearance. Coffee is extremely well pronounced, revealing a flowery berry quality, gently wrapped up into fudge and charred malts. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth, very soft on the tongue with an intense barrel infusion, creating a hot bite during the finish, together with bitter coffee.

Tastes of sweeter fudge, immediately coated up by earthy, silk coffee with a faint berry quality to it. This foundation gets joined by a prominent, vanilla heavy, warming barrel, adding smoky oak, camp fire warmth, resin and a whiff of hazelnuts to the taste. Finishes with present, hot, dry bourbon among cream, coated by coffee and fudgy booze.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"This is the 40th Imperial Stout from the RateBeer Top50 that I have the opportunity to taste. I once promised myself that after trying 40 RISs from the top RB, I would stop chasing the beer hype ;)
I didn't expect that this day would come so quickly and that I would reach this level quite quickly.
Heck! I don't even intend to back down and I continue in search of the so-called beer whalez. 
There are really few of them left (of course I'm talking about those not checked off in the Top50 RB ;). Some will be extremely hard to get, but I believe that one day I will manage to fill the ranking to, say, the 45/50 level. 
Cheers! 🍻

Alcohol: 12% vol.

Version: 2016

Color: Black as the devil's eyes. Complete lack of transparency.

Foam: Difficult to identify, because after uncapping, strong gushing appeared. Beige color and structure consisting of small, beige eyes. 

It quickly shrank to a ring, leaving pretty discs on the walls. 

Smell: An unforgettable, omnipresent aroma. 

There are many layers of initiation here. 

The bourbon barrel brings an intense scent of chocolate, cuckoo candies, vanilla and burnt caramel. 
It is closely followed by aromatic, strongly roasted coffee. 

The accents of cream ice cream, cocoa, marzipan and wet oak also keep pace. In the final stretch, cane sugar and molasses reach. 

The smell is arranged in individual layers and opens up over time like a flower. 

Taste: On the tongue, smooth, silky from the first sip. 
Milk chocolate, cocoa, almond nuts, Nutella and burnt caramel melt in the mouth. The coffee has a sweet profile and a moderate degree of roasted notes. 
The sweetness of coconut wafers, oak wood and barrel vanilla fills and caresses the palate.
The aftertaste of Kopiko and Kukułki candies filled with crunchy caramel and chocolate lingers in the mouth for a long time. Although the beer has a high fullness and is extremely full and substantial, it is characterized by a rather distinct roasted finish.
The texture, as I mentioned earlier, is as thick as engine oil.
The concealment of alcohol content - masterful.

Pure joy! A shot worth its hype!

Saturation: Low.

Summary:

BBVSS seduces with its taste and overwhelms with its aroma.
It conceals a wealth of various flavor and aroma notes.

The barrel profile is unforgettable, although the coffee is not as essential as I expected.

Balance and multi-layeredness are the two most important features of this drink.

Probably AleSmith's best beer and 100% the best from the Speedway Stout series.",0.0

Misc.: N/A

This was pretty much my most sought after beer. Absolutely loved the regular Vietnamese Coffee version (4.53) and expect this one to be the best beer I ever tried. That good. Was lucky enough to get a free pour while going to Emily’s birthday party. A huge thanks to Chris and Lesley for probably a huge tab. Rushed this, but here’s to heaven.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head when I got it. Very serene setting underneath the chaos. Excellent spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled smooth buttery bourbon, milk chocolate syrup, cocoa, some malt chocolate, creamy espresso, vanilla, toffee and sweet caramel. (Smell - 4.75)

Wow on the taste. Still than milky chocolate syrup, malt chocolate, smooth bourbon, creamy vanilla, touch of oak, espresso, lactose and coffee creamer. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Just as awesome as I hoped it would be. So glad I got the chance to have it. Unfortunately I feel like I slightly overrated it a tad. (Overall - 4.75)

The flavor follows suit with the notes of rich dark chocolate and darkly roasted coffee and earthy bitterness up front and backed up nicely by the burnt caramel and the dark roasted malt base. As it warms the bourbon and oak laden vanilla really shine along with a nice nutty character. Really nice balance between the rich and roasty coffee and the bourbon barrel.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Appearance: Pours black with a quickly faded head.



Aroma: Honey grahams, bourbon, milk chocolate.



Taste: Woody bourbon. Acidic dark roasted coffee, tannins, dark chocolate.



Mouthfeel: Full bodied, astringent, mild carbonation.



Overall: This is an amazing variation on Speedway Stout. One of the most balanced barrel aged versions I’ve had as well. The booze, the roast, the chocolate and the coffee were all in perfect balance on this batch. Tremendous work. Those who snagged the bottles oughta think twice before trading it away for some midwest shelf beer.",0.0

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle saved from 2003 and shared by danielcurtis81 at his wedding reception. Pours pitch black with thin fading tan head. Nose contains some sweet chocolate and bourbon. The flavor is soft and smooth, a little sticky and creamy, not much to be said for carbonation but that just makes it taste more like a fine liquor. Very complex taste with bourbon, vanilla, sweet chocolate/cocoa, faint oak, caramel/nutty. Everything about this beer was simply amazing and it blew me away considering it was 6 years old. Best aged beer I have ever had...this is truly an example of how flavors improve with age.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle thanks to boutip, 2009 vintage. Appearance is a nice full black with decent brown mocha head. Aroma is quite straightforward with bourbon, vanilla, the usual Alesmith divine caramel and molasses. You can definitly feel the high alcohol content which brings the ripe fruits upfront along with bourbon and caramel notes. Flavors are hard to describe as they aren’t amazingly complex but so well integrated and intense. Bourbon and age seem to have completly taken over coffee from the regular version. As much as I like the regular version, BA speedway lifts this one to a new level without being over the top. Exactly what I expect from a bourbon barrel version.

Side-by-side with Black Note with BA speedway being a close winner. Although I prefered Black Note’s palate and aroma, BA speedway’s flavors were out of this world. My favorite stout aside from BCS Rare.",0.0
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"A Mes rate. 2007 bottle no. 236/447 thanks hugely to Thomas. Legend.
I’ve had a sip of this a few years back and was bloody impressed, I’ve been close to trying this a few times since but it’s always missed me for one reason or another. Now it’s here, I was worried I’d built it up to something too big in my head. One sniff made me think that wouldn’t be the case. One taste made me sure. It’s bloody excellent. Hugely wooden, like some bourbon and calvados soaked wood chips. Superb coffee character as always but it gels really well with the coconut. It has a hint of posh coffee accented dessert about it. Slight rubber in the nose holds it back a little if I’m going to be picky but not much. Glorious sour barrelly hints in the finish work beautifully. Slight marmite, not a full bodied as I was expecting. Excellent wood and caramel and coconut. God I’m loving this one. Can feel plenty boozy little worms making their way into my belly too. Ace ace ace. Worthy of the hype. At least, this bottle certainly is. All that said, it’s just too boozy to really enjoy.",0.051434449987363975
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2008-08-15. Pitch black body with a nice creamy chocolate mild coloured head that does not last long. Aroma is pretty boozy, dusty roast malt, bourbon barrel. (7+) Flavour is also fairly alcoholic, dry lightly acidic roast, sweet malt undertones. Average to medium palate is lightly carbonated, and is lighter on the tongue than expected. I like that it has a lot less coffee than the regular Speedway, but there doesn’t seem to be enough malt to stand up to the booze and barrel character for my liking. Pretty good. 2006 vintage bottle #57/235, shared by Garthicus

Heavy vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate and coffee in the nose.  Oily black pour.  Flavor is burnt coffee and bourbon, alcohol is definitely present, fig, and dark chocolate.

2007 vintage. Bottle number 205 of 447. This was sampled side-by-side with a regular Speedway Stout. The beer pours dark brown to black with a brown head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is awesome. I get bourbon, oak, semi-sweet chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla. The oak and tannic notes are very tart or bitter, giving the beer an almost sour quality. The coffee has completely faded. Medium-thick mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2006 bottle shared by shawnm213 and tried side-by-side with my 2009 Speedway stout. Thanks, Shawn! Pours a deep, dark brown, mostly opaque but not black by any means. Small brown head. Really nice barrel notes complement the regular Speedway notes; vanilla, bourbon, and oak go nicely with the cocoa, coffee, herbal hops, and earth. The flavor is also a smooth balance of those notes, and I’m liking that the hops aren’t completely buried by the barrel notes. Full-bodied and smooth, with fairly minimal carbonation and a thick mouthfeel. It’s not quite as oily, slick, or dark as the regular. I absolutely loved this, and it’s a notch above the normal Speedway. Re-Rate, 11/1/11: 2009 vintage. Just as good as I remembered. Blew the regular Speedway Stout next to it away. Great barrel notes.

Medium, creamy mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finishes medium boozy, moderate sweet, a bit roasty, with cocoa powder, chocolate, tobacco, wood, bourbon, some liquorice.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Original Sample from Bottle 102 out of 115 (2002): This stout pours with a black as night body topped by a thin to medium thick brown head witha good amount of lacing. Wow, what a different aroma.  The aroma is slightly sweet yet bitter and full of alcohol.  A slightly smokey, woody character shows throuhg reminding me of a nice bourbon.  The flavor is equally unique.  It starts out slightly sweet and malty with a slight alcohol note and turns woody, smokey and roasty with a more prevelent alcohol note.  After drinking half the bottle, the vanilla and licorice notes start showing through.  This is a great beer.  It’s full bodied, slightly tingly and warming.  Definately a great beer to celebrate Christmas with.

The ’standard’ Speedway’s coffee roastiness is mellowed into this and the oak and wood, the vanilla and a bourbon (is it bourbon barrel or just oak?) depth pour through.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"A pitch-black beer with brown, quickly reducing foam to a ring that adheres to the walls of the glass.

This nuttiness is also distinct in the taste. In addition, you can feel coffee, chocolate, pralines, almonds, a bit of wet wood, coconut, vanilla. It tastes like a chocolate cake doused with bourbon and washed down with espresso. The beer is rather sweet, but not overly so. A lot of body, alcohol in the taste in the form of warming, carbonation could be lower. I was a little afraid that this beer would be overrated, but I was positively surprised.

This beer pours a rich, deep black with a dark tan head. Plenty of carbonation left in this gem. This aroma is not subtle. Bourbon and rich roasted malt, with a slight alcohol note emit huge scents I can detect from a few feet away. The beer is absolutely fabulous. Although it is very strong and forward, it drinks very smoothly. It definitely has some heat to it, but it only serves to add a little warmth in the finish.

A thick, prickly, spirited flavor.  Lots of bitterness and peppery alcohol, skimming the deep chocolate and creamy sweet flavors with rough strokes.  Sharply warm and borderline hot for me, in amaretto and even kahlua flavors.  The combination of the acrid, oxygenated coffee flavors with the spirit flavors is pretty unpleasant to me, but thankfully it sits deeply enough underneath the ocean of chocolate and molasses and extraneous sweetness that it doesn’t ruin the beer.



Palate is full and oily; certainly hot in the finish, with a peppery singe.  And a little bit of chocolate covered coffee beans lingers long after the finish.  There’s a lot of positive qualities here but I can’t appreciate the expired coffee flavors or the heavy heat.",0.0

The beer is silky smooth in the mouth and each time you taste you can focus on a new flavor.

The aroma is really nice showing notes of dark roasted coffee, semi sweet dark chocolate, caramel malts, and dark fruits. A subtle bourbon twang finishes things off. The flavor follows suit and the fig and stewed raisins come out a little better to go with the cocoa and caramel malts. The coffee roast is noticed through out along with some earthy hop bitterness. Vanilla and bourbon from the oak smooth things out and add even more depth to the flavor. The bourbon presence is almost perfect without any added alcohol heat. Full bodied and silky smooth with subtle carbonation that leads to a roasted cocoa and bourbon finish. The depth of flavors and the use of the barrel really seperate this beer from others.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"A MASSIVE thanks to Matt for this awesome bottle! Much appreciated man! Tasted in the company of Yan and Mademoiselle Irina. During this long tasting, the words spoken were rare and the papillary orgasms numerous. Is this the best imperial stout I have ever drunk in my life? Maybe not, but it sits proudly on the immense podium of formidability! The black beer suddenly darkened the terrace on this precise day of the lunar eclipse. The liquid is topped with a magnificent and light white foam that I never tire of contemplating. Lace, lacing, various and irregular geometric shapes... A great complexity on the nose where all these aromas are skillfully balanced: anise, bourbon, coffee, molasses, brown sugar burnt with a blowtorch, vanilla and roasted pecans. It is prodigious! The signs of a subtle aging are felt but no matter, it is wonderful! Milky texture; brown and warm alcohol. The liquid flows along my tongue with a sensuality barely punctuated by a faint sparkle reminding me that this is a beer. I go from marzipan to pastry cream to chocolate éclair. Admirable and measured length letting the caramelized flavors stretch out long and gently. Lord Jesus, make this moment of Happiness that we share on this terrace never end!",0.0
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2002 Vintage - Bottle #44 of 115:  Sampled from 53 deg F to 61 deg F.
I shared this bottle with my wife, flutetokill. Pitch black color with a small light brown head. The aroma was very decadent...sweet bourbon, licorice, dark chocolate, cherry. The flavor was huge (like everything else about this beer) with tons of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, sweet fruits, and licorice. The aftertaste is a strong licorice tone with warming alcohol in the throat. The feel was very soft, smooth, thick, oily, and sticky. One of the biggest differences between this and the regular Speedway Stout is that you don't have that crispness here...it works much better. This is the first beer that I've had that seemed perfectly complete, well thought out, and masterfully crafted. It was a completely pleasurable experience. Yee-Haw!!!!",0.0
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Review #650. 750 ml bottle served in a CCB snifter. 2012 vintage

A: Pours a very dark black color with a tan head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to thin ring that leave some minor sploches of lace behind.

S: Bourbon up fron couple with some figs and various dark fruit. Sweet barrel presence with some caraml and light vanilla. A little stone fruit sweetness with some roasted malts and chocolate.

T: The barrel is upfront with some oak and smooth bourbon. Bakers chocolate and some milk chocolate with heavy roast. I’m missing the coffee flavors from this guy, but it’s still really good.

M: Silky smooth mouthfeel, medium to heavy bodied. Medium carbonation level.

O: This is definitely in the upper echelon of BA stouts. Having more coffee notes would have definitely set it apart. Still a very delicious brew that I’d love to have again.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thanks again Brad, long time want.

2007 vintage bottle #212. Poured into a tulip. Beer is black with a thin brown head that breaks and clings to the glass. Some (very little) lacing left on the glass and the carbonation is apparently low.

There is a woody / liquor sweet aroma to this beer. Smells great. Not a lot of alcohol but some sweetness and a hint of roasted malt.

Beer is really really smooth. Medium to full bodied, sweetness up front with an ever so slight amount of heat behind it. Oddly there is almost a late tartness to this beer. Its not lactic or acetic, the beer isn’t going bad but there is a strong almost tannic character to the whole beer. I suppose this the result of the wood aging process. It is unexpected but does not interrupt the flow of the flavors in the mouth. Bitterness at the back is low but good. Overall a really good beer. I’d still like to do the side-by-side with the regular.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2006 edition.  Bottle 120/235.  I finally decided to bust one of these out tonight after patiently aging since last spring.  I figure celebrating my last weekend before starting residency is a big enough occasion.  Pours a thick and black with no head.  It doesn’t coat the glass like some IS.  Aroma is strong bourbon at first with coffee, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and dark fruit.  It smells like some kind of rich dessert.  Flavor is dark chocolate and coffee with a nice compliment of bourbon and oak that is a big player but not overpowering.  Sweet dark fruits as well.  It finishes with a little alcohol warmth, which is actually pleasant and doesn’t reflect the 12%.  The mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I expected and very smooth.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle at RBSG Grand Tasting, July 2006. 2004 bottle. Pitch black. Unfortunately I didn’t get to taste this alongside the regular version (that had to wait until late in the evening when I remember sitting with bottles of Speedway, Dark Lord and Apis Jadwiga in front of me that nobody was fighting over) but perhaps the coffee is a little less intense. Although that could be as much the extra age (don’t know how old the regular version I tasted was) as the barrel aging. There’s a little vanilla from the barrel age but its such a big beer that its going to resist too much influence (which is no bad thing). To be honest, I’m not sure that the barrel-aging improves the beer too much. Otherwise, not really much point in repeating what others have said many times before. Big and heavy. Loads of coffee.

Overall, this much age isn't good for this beer. I have had it plenty of times fresh or with a couple years and it's much better than this old bottle.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pre-Great Taste sampling at 1FastSti’s house


The capstone of the night, this was the whole reason we were doing a tasting.
   Blake’s bottle was #13 of 240.  I’ll have to open my bottle of regular
   Speedway to compare, but this was definitely a well crafted well though out
   beer that belongs in the Top 10.  If you ever get the chance to try it savor
   every last drop.
Aroma / Appearance - Oak, vanilla, coffee, black cherry, graham
   crackers and toasted marshmellows dominate a complex and rich nose.  With a
   larger sample I might have picked up even more.  The bourbon notes are evident
   but they do not take over.  The body remains midnight black; no light escapes
   this black hole of a liquid.
Flavor / Palate - There is a creamy mouthfeel that permeates through
   the entire beer.  It starts off as a combination of bourbon, cherry, vanilla
   and alcohol.  Next it forms coffee, raisins, plums and blueberries.  As if
   that was not enough there is a textured velvet before it finally decides to
   reveal the coffee flavors one last time.  This is a very dense beer though
   well balanced.  Each of the tastes feels like it belongs; nothing here feels
   out of place or strange.  The finish has a lingering caramel and raspberry
   texture.  I had to sit for a few minutes when the glass was done admiring it
   because it sticks around for a long time.",0.0

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"In short: An bourbon aged coffee stout that spent too much time in the bourbon barrel.  Excellent but I prefer the regular Speedway.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Sent to me by many people (doubleO, hophead84, kegbear, more…).  This rating for a 2007 vintage (from kegbear I think).

The look: Black body topped by a short lived small tan head

In long: Drank a full bottle next to on of the regular Speedway that WeeHeavySD brought to me over a year ago.  So both beer are about the same age.  No need to describe the BA beer, better to describe the difference between the regular Speedway that we all know and love.  The nose of the BA has moderate bourbon, some vanilla and very little coffee.  Overall the nose is a lot less roasted and less coffee than the regular Speedway.  The taste is overloaded with vanilla (that the regular Speedway doesn’t have), light roasted level (less than regular Speedway), quite a bit of black liquorice (a lot more than in the regular Speedway), some bourbon (less than I expected), some port-wine (something the regular speedway didn’t have).  The carbonation is softer than in the regular Speedway.  The alcohol is a little apparent (more apparent than in the regular Speedway).  Overall the bourbon barrel aging is so over-done that the beer barely feels like a coffee stout.  Barely any coffee notes.  I’ve had chocolate stouts that had more coffee flavours than this one.  This really is a very good brew, going through a 750ml by myself was a pleasure, something I cannot say about most of 12%+ beers.  However I cannot believe that some people can genuinely find the BA better than the regular Speedway.  Hey, I just had this great idea, why not use Bourbon Barrels to make scotch!!!",0.0

Its a 2006 BA speedway.

A - Pours a nice deeply black with little light penetrating the thickness of it.

S- It has some bourbon on the front end with big dark fruit prunes especially.

T - Once the bourbon clears you get coffee then chocolate with a very smooth silky finish.

Drinkability is very easy on this. The other guys were saying they may still prefer the regular speedway over the BA version. I like both versions and would but this everyday if it were available to me.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Three year old bottle, but with black neckfoil (the print on the bottle says ""with coffee and aged in bourbon barrels"", so I assume it is the same thing). One of the most expensive beers I ever bought, delivered to me by my dear former colleague Maaike. I taste this a little above cellar temperature from an old port wine snifter. Black colour (but in fact an extremely dark ochre brown), thin deep beige head, a little more ’loose’ than I had expected and breaking open after a short while but retaining well around the edges, with a delicate, silky lacing. The aroma is heavenly: a dense, thick, strong and intoxicating perfume of all the good things you would expect in a big stout, and more. Impressions of freshly roasted coffee beans, kahlua, orange liqueur, warm chocolate sauce, cognac, liquorice, vanilla beans, peat, leather, oaky tannins and even moist wood, gingerbread, hints of soy sauce, cooked meat, cloves and butterscotch. This liquid commands respect, nothing in the nose reveals even the faintest flaw; I’m beginning to understand why this beer scores so high on this site. Taste is... well, intense, to say the least: an overpowering symphony of candied fruits, espresso beans, fondant chocolate, vanilla, oak, candi syrup, dried orange peel... Difficult to point out which comes first. Carbonation is sharpish, even a bit fizzy at first; mouthfeel is thick and smooth, somewhat cloyingly sweet at first but drying more and more towards the end, over a big yet refined, oily, multi-layered maltiness. Spiciness, bitterness and intensity increase in the finish, where a strong bourbon presence takes the lead along with strong woody tannins, with a drying, even somewhat burning effect which can be felt from the tip of the tongue till deep in the throat; peppery hops are quite strong as well, and so is the remaining syrupy maltiness. The bourbon alcohol and the strong, coffeeish roasted bitterness keep struggling for dominance but remain matched. How sweet the onset may have been, the ending of this complex ale is bone dry.  This is a powerful, demanding form of liquid gastronomy in which many things are happening at the same time. Still: this is, contrary to what I had expected, probably not quite the best stout I tasted so far - the alcohol burn is just a little bit too much over the top for me, the mouth and throat keep sticking a bit with the initial candied sugariness and it is, for this particular style, a bit overcarbonated. Nevertheless: hugely complex, hugely enjoyable, very impressive with a formidable balance between sweet and bitter, both present in their most ’compressed’ and intense form. Something to be reckoned with and enjoyed carefully, concentratedly - and sip by sip. Wow, what an experience... Big cheers to Maaike!",0.0

Bell's Black Note Stout,"I’ve wanted to try this for years - I finally found it on local shelves. The appearance is an oily black with a lasting beige meringue head. No light passes through the glass when backlit, and appears still. The aroma is sweet bourbon booziness with slight chocolate bitterness, and a hint of freshly ground coffee beans. Taste - intense bourbon with notes of dark roasted coffee upfront, quickly fading to a freshly cut moist cigar on the back with lingering bourbon bite combined with the bite of bourbon left on the tongue. Palate - Viscosity of lowfat milk and smaller-sized CO2 bubbles make for a silky mouthfeel. Overall, an outstanding blend - I look forward to aging several of these.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"Beer #4 of 13 in blind tasting. 
 2012 bottle, more than 2 years old This was the second beer in what was supposed to be an unadulterated imperial stout tasting. I have had this a few times and I never liked it. Fortunately, blinded I still did not like it. Poured headless and thinnest of the beers available. I thought this was oxidized, got lots of woody notes, and rather acidic. In hindsight, seems like I was pretty on without picking up bourbon.

Despite me having this as one of my worst beers, everyone else enjoyed it. For the aggregate it scored highest and strongly above average (0.55 standard deviation above). HOWEVER, usually a BA beer scores high in no BA imperial stout tastings. I don’t give these aggregate results much credence.",0.0

Bell's Black Note Stout,"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe. Served as Black Note. Pour is jet black in my snifter with a thin tan head that fades to a ring. Aroma is chocolatety, with notes of coffee, vanilla, caramel, and a bit of bourbon. Mouthfeel is thick, and viscous. Very dense, and filling. Flavor is also chocolatety, with the same notes of coffee, vanilla, and toffee. Bourbon isn’t as pronounced as it usually is in BA stouts. Much more subtle, making this very drinkable. I absolutely loved this. Probably the best bourbon barrel aged stout I’ve ever had!",0.0
Bell's Black Note Stout,"750mL courtesy of cavemanlawyer at a tasting. Big time thanks. Consumed on 6-16-12, reviewed from notes. 

A: Pitch black and all the poetry it implies. Aggressive poor yields some thin lacing, but not a great amount of head. Good carbonation bubbles.

N: Bourbon, honey, and some ethanol. Coconut, caramel, and vanilla. Really quite nice. 

T: Roasted coffee and malt. Bourbon is integrated well into the main body, leaving the normal descriptors of vanilla/caramel/oak. I’m getting plenty of chocolate and some molasses, licorice, and a mystery flavor which kscaldef jogged out of my head as candied pecans. There’s still some heat here, though. 

M: This is coating without being cloying. A very impressive example of what I want in my RIS. 

O: There were a couple of beers that I never thought would be bottled and would thus not make it to the PNW via trades. This was one, the other was CBS. CBS was a big letdown; this is not. Well worth seeking out.",0.0

Bell's Black Note Stout,"People have been talking and writing about this Imperial Stout for a long time, but you don’t really know what to expect until you try it yourself.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"Hand bottle from Growler. Big thanks to egajdis for sharing this hand bottle, this was truly a treat. Pours a deep, deep black body with thin head. Aroma was very complex - butter (not in a diactyl way, but in a bourbon/whisky way!), vanilla, bourbon, vinous. The aroma honestly changed everytime I took a sniff, well deserving of it’s ""10"" rating. Flavor is complex as well - caramel, vanilla, butter, very sweet. A few sips I noticed had an peanutbutter like taste. Being a bourbon barrel beer this is pretty smooth and I was surprised to find that the sweetness of the Double Cream was dominating the Expedition. This is one truly delicious beer and I NEED to have a bottle (or grolwer) all to myself at some point in time to truly appreciate this beer.",0.0
Bell's Black Note Stout,"Pours an opaque very dark brown with a quickly vanishing, short khaki-brown head. The aroma is striking. Caramel, vanilla, and coconut.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"Sampled at GABF 2013. Pours black with a short tan head. Aroma of dark fruit and espresso. Excellent flavor of coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, and a hint of ripe plums. Alcohol creeps up on the finish. Awesome and well worth the hype.",0.0
Bell's Black Note Stout,"Opaque and black with a frothy tan head rising prophetically. Balanced vanilla beans and bourbon aromatically dance with chocolate and sweet mocha grinds while Madagascar vanilla and caramelized hazelnuts rhythmically fornicate through all nose sockets. Full bodied flavor strikes aggressively and splendidly balanced. Roasted espresso grinds titillate the tongue. Bourbon hides under the semi-sweet dark chocolate coating that encapsulates the espresso bean. Thick oily fluid ripples throughout as the mocha grind bitterness tittles at the tip of the tongue. Dark chocolate manifests more as we delve deeper into the glass. The no bake dark chocolate brownies provide an everlasting surplus in the finish, complimented by a tenderly sentimental vanilla, bourbon and mocha bean signature at the end.

Cocoa, Licorice, Coffee, Brown Sugar, Vanilla, Honey, Leather and Bourbon. Wow! Wonderfully rich but not sticky thick. Great roundness of cream and sweetness with just a hint of oaky grainyness. Perhaps the best BA Stout I’ve ever had. Just the right amount of everything Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Spice and Bourbon Barrel. The best part of this beer may be the lack of hot alcohol behind it to overpower it. I think it was listed as 11.something but it certainly doesn’t present the alcohol in a manner where you guess that.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"Very happy to open a bottle of this vintage that was born on December 28, 2012. At 4.31 on average, should we expect a marvel? Once poured, this brown liquid allows only a thin foamy construction. On the nose, nothing like a major work. I would even say more, than reasonably rich and opulent aromas of chocolate, caramel and vanilla bourbon. On the taste buds, nothing other than a prodigious and delectable epic of chocolate malts, coating bourbon and fruity molasses. On the palate, nothing like a big and ferocious viscous beast. I would even say more: a body that is altered by the barrel can sometimes be pleasant. In the finish, nothing like a big heat. I would even say more that the sweetness of the chocolate malts is transported towards a bitterness timidly established by notes of coffee. In short, nothing like a messianic proposition. I would rather say that it is a frankly perfumed beer, tasty as desired and very easy to drink. Greetings to solidfunk for this rather rare thing.",0.0
Bell's Black Note Stout,"FoBAB 2009 (listed as Black Note): My third must try beer of the fest. Basically opaque with a lovely small creamy head and very good lace. The aroma has an intense mix of coffee and cream, chocolate and vanilla, walnut and charred malts, liqcorice and oaky bourbon, and even a touch of meaty bacon. The taste is a powerful onslaught of rich malts, ripe fruits, chocolate and espresso, anise and light charred barrel smoke. I get a touch of grassy hops towards the finish. The mouth feel is oily and lush, coats the palate but is not as heavy as your basic Expedition stout, nicely warming without becoming boozy. Wow,this is everything it has been made out to be. A world class Impy and a must try for any stoutie, just missed placing in my top 10.",0.0

I’ve got way too many of these ""landmark"" beers all stored up for a few hundred more ratings. I’m not going to sit here and not enter this one so it can be all celebratory when I do. 



Pours basically black with a small but well retained head. 



The aroma is big & sweet with lots of fudge & bourbon notes. The alcohol is there in a pleasant bourbony kind of way, even fainter is a hint of smoke. 



The flavor is roasty and bitter, this is not without sweetness and lots of bourbon character, but this retains so much of what’s great about the big awesomeness that is Expedition Stout. Plenty of chocolate, both in the dark bitter variety and the sweet fudgy variety. Some black currant and cherry fruitiness become more and more pronounced along with the woody character of the beer as it warms.

Thanks to whoever brought it (might have been cquiroga, maybe Captain Cougar; there were so many generous benefactors, and all the beers were just chillin’ in the tub, it was impossible to keep track).  Smell:  wow.  Bourbon + imitation vanilla your mom uses for baking + liquid creamy chocolate; the bourbon is so nice and fruity, not dominated by oily alcohol aromas.  Pours pitch black like normal Expedition, with crumbling oily lacing.  Super full bodied.  Taste features a creamy lactic sweetness over full rich malts of toffee, chocolate; a bitter, dry, and musty finish is full of hops, but it’s layered and variable, it keeps changing: starts earthy and dusty, then becomes coffee-ish in the rich bitterness, then settles into a weird sour hops after effect, which was weird and soured me on the beer.  To bad it was the last impression.  This is a monster, but I think I might still just prefer regular Expedition.  I’m growing tired of barrel aging.",0.1095993248702382

Pours black with a two finger brown head that settles to a light swirly creamy cap and foamy ring, leaves short-lived lacing behind.



Aroma is a big blast of bourbon, rich dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee, a bit of anise, hint of smoke.  Good to very good strength.



Flavor is rich and delicious.  Quite bourbon-forward, a lot of vanilla and serious chocolate, marshmallow, roasted malts, anise, some dark fruit, little caramel, rather sweet, minimal bitterness, decent alcohol bite, but fits for the style/size.  Really good!



Mouthfeel is full bodied, very creamy, smooth, sticky, low to moderate carbonation.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"Appearance: Black, light dark brown head, low retention, small bubbles moderately active, fine lace. 

Nose: Bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, fudge, coffee. 

Taste: Bourbon barrel and chocolate dominant, roasted malt, finish very distinct from the aromas of quality coffee. Still sweet, slight bitterness. 

Sensation: Medium body, good length, spicy touch on the tongue. 

In short: For me, this beer has two great qualities. First, the balance of roasted malty notes, aromatic contributions from the barrel, residual sugar and bitterness. A beautiful mastery. Then, the transition between the mentioned notes and a very distinctive finish on coffee is very interesting. Beautiful complexity. Can I go ahead and say that it could have had a little more body (and if I really want to go further, ""punch"")?",0.0
Bell's Black Note Stout,"Tap at Churchkey. Pours ink with a medium tan head leaving webby reddish lace. Nose is rich buttery bourbon with tropical notes like dried pineapple and dried papaya. Toasted coconut. Let it decant to cinnamon ganache and very subtle meat/umami character. Soft booziness, coffee liquor. So many rich subtleties makes this an incredible experience. Taste is similar to normal and Rare Bourbon County Stout. Super creamy, rich coconut oil mouthfeel. Feels less sharply bitter than normal Expy. Softer and easier to love than normal Expy. Superlative soft mouthfeel. Nice bitterness comes through to cut initial sweetness. Great mouthfeel- mild heat reminds of soft bourbon aging but softness is unreal. Roasty bitterness and coffee character hints that this is not BCS but something else. Very beautiful. Complexities are easier to fall in love with than normal Expedition which can be too aggressive  and powerful at times.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"Sample draft at FOBAB.  Slight bourbon aroma.  Taste has a soft bourbon taste with a nice underlying stout flavor.  It is very smooth and very balanced but nothing that really blew me away.  Medium thickness, on the thin side for the style.  Incredibly smooth for something this big.  Overall, this is a very good beer that did not live up to my high expectations.  Initial rating of 4.1



Tried again.  This time with the new 12oz bottle.  Compared to KBS and bourbon county.  Both from 12.  A decent amount or bourbon this time.  Not quite as much as bc but close.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"Served as the Black Note, on tap at Maduro in Madison, on pre-GTOM evening. Viscously dispensed to a shaker!! with a dark, black/brown hue, and a decent amount of brownish tan head foam that lingered as a thick ring & light haze of film.

Ditto on the flavor, with warming alcohol, hefty body, low carbonation, but a pleasant creaminess to the mouthfeel. Whoa!  Next time, shared 12 oz. 2012 bottles with fellow beer geeks.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"One of the best, so I figured it would be a good place to start for my first rating! 

Had this one on tap at O’Rourke’s in South Bend,IN...part of the Oberon kick-off celebration.

Aroma: Bourbon up front, but hints of dark chocolates, roasted malts and subtle vanilla.

Appearance: Pitch black, thin head of mocha foam...little lacing. A swirl of a half-full glass will give a nice oily coating.

Taste: Extremely balanced beer. Bourbon and licorice up front with roasted malt,  chocolate and a creamy vanilla over the middle and a warming finish containing notes of coffee. The bourbon and licorice calm a bit after it warms, only giving it more balance. You start to get the bourbon being more pronounced in the finish, very warm!

Palate: Full-bodied beer. Creamy. Low-Carbonation. Resonates on your palate. A true sipper.

Overall: Excellence. My favorite beer. I wish all beers had this much flavor and balance!",0.0

Bell's Black Note Stout,"2012 Vintage

Pours nearly pitch black - into a snifter. Surprisingly there is a dark brown head that sticks around for nearly the entire 50 minute duration of enjoyment. In the glass it is black as an eighth note (sorry). Gorgeous

The aroma is incredibly enticing, bringing you in with intensity and balance. Very prominent bourbon barrel characteristics - sweet vanilla and coconut, oak, and heat. Rich dark and milk chocolate and fresh coffee nearly dominate the dark fruits lying beneath. 

Tastes just as good as it smells. Big bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and sweet dark fruits. It is not a sweet bomb of a beer, there is some dryness. 

The mouthfeel is nearly full, soft carbonation and incredibly smooth. Very drinkable, do not feel the 11.8 abv at all, just a nice soothing warmth from the bourbon. 

This is a fantastic BA stout and well worth the effort to seek out a few 12oz bottles.",0.0
Bell's Black Note Stout,"[Tap at Stub and Herb’s] Pours pitch black with a moderate tan head. Aroma is divine.

Makes expedition feel like grainy water in comparison. Flavor isn’t too shabby either. The double cream stout really shines through, lots of barrel character, dark chocolate, and roasted dark malts.

Aroma is similar to zhukov, so I’m a bit nervous that this may no longer have the hunahpu characteristics.  Licorice forward, with a touch of cinnamon and spice.  The taste is where this separates itself from zhukov.  Taste is heavier on cinnamon, with small amounts of chocolate and vanilla.  Had I not known that it is aged on peppers I would have never noticed that slight burning sensation this produces in the throat long after each sip.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Pours a thick black with a almost black head. It looks like used motor oil that has been sitting in a pan in someone’s garage for about a year. Basically the way I want to see my stouts. Has a malty pepper smell to it with a little chocolate.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Perfection!

Received this bottle from Chairmissing and I can’t thank him enough!

A: The darkest, thickest beer I’ve seen to date. Decent carbonation.

S: Coffee, chocolate and vanilla.

T: Let me start by saying I came into this beer very skeptical. I never believe the hype behind beers but this left me speechless. I let the bottle sit for about 20 minutes after taking out of the fridge, poured into a snifter. The first taste was strong chocolate and alcohol with a interesting aftertaste. As it warmed the cinnamon and chili became quite apparent. The strong chocolate hits first then some malt and to finish it off the chili hits the back of the tongue simply amzing and this is now the most complex beer I’ve ever had.

O: Can’t describe how much I love this beer. There is no way I will miss the release next year. I wouldn’t trade away the cellar to try it but if you have a friend near the brewery or someone offering you a bottle for a decent trade definitely do it.",0.0

Dark chocolate, bitter-sweet, roast, cinnamon, fiery spicy hotness, gingerbread, vanilla, creamy and smooth finish. Low lush carbonation carb. The alcohol shows nicely in the finish, along with the background hoppy bitterness. An atypical beer for me to love, but this is REALLY well done. Sweet and savory side-by-side thanks to the pepper heat and the bittersweet chocolate. Wow.",0.0
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"split 3 ways, poured into a tulip and two snifters. Thanks ""Suitcase Jon"" (Capra12)

Pours insanely black, void of any light. Thick tar-like syrup. liquid/melted chocolate. I have never seena beer so thick. Dark Brown milk chocolate colored foam. i think a spoon would stand up in this. plenty of thick head a couple fingers deep. It stands still long enough for me to grab my camera and line it up for a few close-ups. I know this one is gonna be good.

Aroma is heavy laiden with roasted malt and burnt toast. some espresso and pepper spice. Loads of dark havy chocolate on the end of the first nose. Espresso and alcohol after a swirl and another smell. I just can’t help but stare at this liquid tar, are there preserved dinasaurs stuck in there?

Taking my first sip. insanely thick and heavy. First is the bitter roast bounding my taste buds with hints of coffee slipping through the heavy doses of dark chocolat. rolling around through the tongue out comes spice and smoke. so much chewy thick syrup coats my entire mouth. Chocolate rides all the way across the top with alcohol and vanilla that swarm in the creamy foam that happens as it rolls through my mouth. More sips bring some tobacco and leather to accompany the slight smoke, as it warms a bit more sweetness of chocolate and caramel come out along with more peppery notes, i can’t tell if its cinamon or peppers or both. The 8 or 9 ounces that I poured myself of this were definately all I needed.

when i rolled this around in the glass the foam just clung to the glass fighting for its life and reflecting light with glittering accents like little diamonds on the very outreaches of the head.

This is truly one very unique brew. Can’t say i’ve had an imperial stout this big, thick, and heavy. truly a great one. Thanks again Suticase Jon for hooking me up with this one.

This beer could swallow any food up that you throw at it. only the richest most crazy thick triple chocolate cake with chocolate fudge layers and tons of heavy chocolate and roasted coffee sauce drizzled all over it would ever come close to matching up or cutting through this beer. If i was going to die tomorrow, I would order this beer with that cake.

The aroma is equally unique, a really enticing mixture of vanilla, hard roasted malts, and a whiff of chili - everything perfectly balanced. The body is solid, lots of hard roasted malts, some sweet cocoa comes out and the chili leaves a little bite on my lips. The finish is dark chocolate, the hard roasted malts leaving a little bitterness. Finally a truly unique Imperial Stout with the spicing being perfectly subtle and balanced.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Appearance: pours like sweet lovely delicious motor oil. Espresso crema head fades fast into a thin ringlet. Swirls with black tears and a slightly thicker collar. No head. None.


Nose: thick, tar, and char. Vanilla beans, raw chilies tickle the back of my nose. Burnt black cacao and espresso sludge. Wisp of melted cream. Cinnamon is a shadowy whisper here, there, and than none at all.


Palate: for such an intensely thick pour his mouthfeel is amazingly soft, velveteen, and creamy. Immediately coats lips in burnt caramels and cinnamon and black chocolate all melted into one. Long chocolate finish, thick and fudgy please. Heat tickles sides of cheeks with essence of chili without the pain. Ashen burnt black wood in the breath. Vanilla root flirts with massive hunks of decadent fudge. Interesting conflict of creamy velvety smooth mouthfeel which at the same time sucks all moisture from said mouth. Cinnamon not as prominent as expected, though a whisper peeks through here and there, mostly lost in the chilies and the burnt fudgy vanilla rooty goodness.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"From notes. 750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. 2014 vintage. The pour is a thick dirty motor oil black with a finger of dark mocha head that fades foam ring, leaving no lace behind. The aroma is beautiful. There is a ton of cinnamon in front of a light cocoa and a lot of vanilla. The chilies don't really dominate, but offer a good peppery spiciness that is incredibly well balanced. The cinnamon comes back and is delightful. I love the smell on this. The flavor is great. Copious amounts of cinnamon up front and they ease through a nice pepper transition into a soft cocoa and vanilla, before reentering the cinnamon realm. The fact that the chilies are reserved makes this so much better. The mouth feel is thick and viscous. Great carbonation help it just cling to the mouth in a never ending film. The aftertaste is all cinnamon and subtly it moves through a good chocolate and vanilla lingering finish. Damn good.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2013 Bottle from Hunahpu Day poured a month later in an official Hunahpu glass. Pours like thick black syrup with a late forming dark brown head.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"750mL bottled 2/26/21, drunk 11/21/22, thanks Chalameuax!
Undetermined clarity, dark mahogany with deep burgundy highlights in the light.  Medium-sized, tan head shows moderate retention.
Nose is beautiful and well-aged.  None of the unfermented sugars and syrupy fudge that so many stouts have these days.  The adjuncts are done incredibly tastefully, as well with none of it jumping out or dominating.  Dark chocolate, vanilla, moderate roast and ample sweet caramel from the malt with no alcohol, even after warming.  Everything melds together so well and it's shocking to me that this is a mere 21 months in bottle.  Drinks like it's homogenized for 5 years.
Soft, malty, rich and yet wonderfully attenuated.  Near-perfect balance giving appropriately chewy, luxurious textures with no syrupy sweetness or any fatiguing sugar on the finish.  Cinnamon spiciness helps balance and vanilla is soft and flavorful.  Nothing jumps out and this is a study in balance and finesse.  Through all that, it's still pleasingly rich and satisfying.  No alcohol whatsoever.  Pretty crazy that I never got on the Cigar City train - just missed the boat.  Glad to finally try this and I see now why Cigar City hit it big.   Hard to believe they've created this much depth, complexity and balance without barrel aging. This puts many barrel aged stouts to shame, which is impressive. 9/4/9/5/19

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Tasted at Janick's. Thanks for sharing Janick! The beer is black, oily, not very foamy and seems very heavy. The liquid sticks to my glass and clings to it for a long time, leaving a brownish and greasy film. The aromatic palette is the dimension that I preferred in this beer: cocoa, coffee, batch of chocolate chip cookies... Really, this beer offers an absolutely magnificent nose! In the mouth I was struck by the prominence of spices that I had been unable to anticipate when smelling the beer. The mixture of spices is surprising and also very complex and homogeneous. I detected sweet chili, pepper, cardamom and ground coriander. We must absolutely recognize the skill with which the brewer was able to tie these flavors together. I remain skeptical about the need to add so many spices when the background is based on cookie dough. I probably would have preferred this beer on Christmas Eve!",0.0

Dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla all come through big in the taste, as well.  I’m not a big fan of chili in beer, but it’s very nice in this one, only hitting in the finish with a bit of spice.  This sort of super rich chocolatey imperial stout is right up my alley for the style.  Hops are present but more of a background player.  Pretty sweet but it works well for the beer.

Aroma of dark chocolate, cocoa beans, dark dried fruits, cinnamon, sweeter liquorice, rear cigar, vanilla, a note of leather also and some weak spicy/earthy notes. Taste is more roasted and the chili really strikes through in the aftertaste in a pleasant way. Also followed by the cocoa beans, chocolate, liquorice, weak tobacco, alcohol in the back of your throat. It also has that salty quality to it, some espresso notes and dark dried fruits here aswell. Big and full of inspiring nuances! Really diggin the chili in the end featuring the creamyness!

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Bottle from last year’s Hunahpu’s Day, an event organized by Cigar City to deliberately hype this beer, to the example of Three Floyds’ Dark Lord Day (it cannot be a coincidence, by the way, that the label states that ""Hunahpu was tricked by the Dark Lords of the Underworld"" - this is doubtlessly an ironic nod to Three Floyds...). Makes me very curious to find out if it is worth the hype. Opaque black colour (revealing itself to be a very dark mahogany in the end) with high degree of viscosity, under a crackling, moussy, deep brownish beige head, almost reddish brown initially, steadily receding but retaining a thin rim around the edges. Very powerful and very seductive aroma, utterly complex, refinedly sweet, roasted and subtly spiced, first almost a ’dame blanche’ of chocolate sauce made with cognac poured over home-made vanilla ice cream, coffee liqueur, marzipan, sweet dried chili peppers clearly there, burning pipe tobacco, milk chocolate bars and Belgian chocolates, vivid accent of cloves and (strongly) cinnamon rolls, kahlua, cappuccino, eucalyptus, refined bourbon-like alcohol, cashew nuts, allspice, candied dates and cherries, subtle touch of meat broth... The ’basic’ and dense malts, hops and alcohol bouquet releases ethereal, volatile and beguiling sweet spice accents whenever it feels like it. What a fascinating smell... I can sniff it for hours. I cannot wait to take a sip, and must conclude that the taste follows the aroma perfectly: the expected dense candied sweetness opens the palate and makes my mouth water, candied fruits, with an almost refreshingly minerally sourishness coming from carbonation, which may perhaps be a little bit stronger than usual for the style, but fits in perfectly here. A soft and beautiful vanilla sweetness is apparent already early on, even strongly so, but I love vanilla so this is, to say the least, a welcome surprise. Very creamy, velvety, viscous, oily mouthfeel and obviously very thick body, revealing an abyss of malts, very chocolatey, nutty and caramelly, with a strong mocha bitterness after the middle, lively and not just from roasted malts, but an actual, powdery and refined coffee beans flavour. Cinnamon comes up retronasally along with that wonderful vanilla flavour, and then the finish evolves, with a big and thick lingering malt and candy sweetness, cloying even, aided by peppery hop bitterishness and of course warming, but nonetheless very gentle, liqueur- or rhum-like alcohol; the cinnamon and coffee stick to the throat, as a mixture of sweet, bitter and umami flavours, but given the immense complexity of this beer, it is hard to tell which ingrediënt causes which aftertaste... The ancho and pasilla chili peppers, both rather mild varieties, are there, but provide just a subtle burning touch in the back of the mouth and throat, without disturbing the overall balance; I do get their earthy, smoky, sweetish, peppery flavour though, only adding further complexity. This brew is indeed hugely complex and consists of layer upon layer of flavour, absolutely divine. It takes a lot of concentration - and a large bottle - to try and grasp what is going on in this one, and this is again a reminder of what beer as a beverage is capable of. This kind of top quality beers of utmost complexity move me. Yes, this is clearly worth the hype; this is an awe-inspiring imperial stout, managing to respect all the qualities of its style and building upon them an own personality; I’m pretty sure I will recall this taste for the rest of my life. If it weren’t for the somewhat sticky, cloying effect in the back of the mouth and throat, I’d give it a perfect score, which would have made it my very best beer so far. For now: just one inch away from being perfect.  But then, considering my previous experiences with this brewery, I did have high hopes for this, admittedly.",0.025197631533948505

We were only two on this and I had a hard time finishing it. Very nice mix of chocolate and hot peppers both on nose and taste.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours out thick and very little head.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle: Huge thanks to Travis & Tommy for splitting this with me. Black, black, black & oily as fuck, topped with a velvety, fine mocha cream that lasts exceedingly long for a stout. This beer is a bowl Cinnamon Toast Crunch & Teddy Grahams covered in vanilla drizzle, fudge, & sweet Apple Brandy sauce. Chocolate, roast, sweet brandy, vanilla, cinnamon, mild coffee, graham cracker.... Only thing I don’t get is the chili peppers, I’m guessing the barrels have swallowed them whole. I don’t mind, though, because they might interfere with the decadence of this brew. Thick, chewy, creamy; this is a very big beer on the palate. A dessert beer to the max, fantastic all around.



Update: After having this quite a few more times thanks to many generous BA’s, as well as some local tasting groups, I have to bump the score up. This just gets better & better. Molten  Chips Ahoy & Teddy Graham cookies with cinnamon graham cracker, apple brandy, vanilla bean chips & dark fudge drizzle. This is truly an excellent beer.",0.0
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle. Huge thanks to the local group for sharing this with me. Pours deep black, very dense. Very little head on the pour but still looks awesome. Aroma is ridiculously good. Can smell it from a couple feet away. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, berries, vanilla, cinnamon, soy, and marshmallow. Tastes just as incredible as the aroma. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, chocolate syrup, cinnamon, light smokey peppers, and a hint of dried dark fruit. Perfect mouthfeel as well. Very low carbonation makes this extremely smooth and allows the huge flavors to stand out. I’ve had a couple days to think about this beer and I’m convinced it’s the best beer I’ve ever had. My first perfect 5. I would trade many bottles in my cellar to get another one of these.",0.0
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle shared with, and thanks to, the Great Damico. Bottle came as the result of some excellent reconnaissance at Hunahpu’s Day. Pours a dark black color with a thick chocolate head that breaks down quickly. The head retention is amazing for a barrel aged brew. Aroma of chocolate roast, dark fruit, apple, pepper, vanilla, and hints of breadiness. Really intoxicating. A sweet chocolate taste with notes of chili, vanilla, and slight cinnamon. A nice layer of heat from the pepper. Wow. It really is hard to say whether this or the base version is better. So much complexity. So much happening during the first 3 seconds on the tongue. Just another amazing brew that I likely will never be fortunate to drink again. Kudos to Redner and a big thanks to Damico.",0.0

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Much thanks to Dice for opening this bottle. Pours motor-oil thick, dense and viscous.

Beautiful chocolate that lasts and lasts, coating the mouth with so much chocolate. Chili peppers and metal. Very sweet, but the peppery finish stops it just short of being cloying.

Solid inky black color with a creamy dark mocha head that slowly dissipates to wisps on top. My God that aroma is heavenly! Rich chocolate caramel and molasses with a spiced rum cake kind of feel to it. Moderate amount of cinnamon, light wood and vinous fruity notes. The flavor is rich chocolate spiced cake with hints of rum and molasses. The alcohol shows a bit of warming but is never harsh. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a slick syrupy sticky mouthfeel. Damn that is a great beer! Even the non beer geeks I shared this with enjoyed it.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Cigar City Brewing - Double Barrel Hunahpu’s 2016

Imperial Stout With Cacao & Spices Added. 50% Aged In Rum Barrels, 50% Aged In Apple Brandy Barrels.

Alcohol: 11% by volume.

Colour: Black like the eyes of the furious fire god Hun-Hunaphu

Foam: Beige, modest with a finely grained structure.

It hisses loudly and falls to a small stripe. On the edges of the TeKu there are dotted spots.

Smell: There is pulp! The aroma blows to the max. First rum and raisins macerated in this noble drink. Then a whole range of dried fruits, candied apples, plums, apricots and grapes.
Right after that a terrible punch straight in the face from cocoa beans, thick milk chocolate and Belgian pralines.

Knock out provides a range of toffee, coffee, raisins, cane sugar and spices.
Beautiful bouquet!

Taste: Incredible barrel profile. The euphoria of flavors begins with noble rum with its strong and uncompromising taste, full of spices and wood. Then the barrel of apple Brandy (or, I presume, Calvados) enters with great verve, giving the drink a taste of baked apple pie.
The next layers of the bouquet of flavors are an avalanche of chocolate, toffee, Belgian pralines, sugar cane, wood, raisins and toffee.
The final straight belongs to spices, the most distinguished of which is chilli, dotting the ""i"", stinging in the throat.

Alcohol is present, warms, confuses the head a little, but fortunately it does not have a warm, solvent character and does not step out of line.
Double Barrel Hunaphu's has no shortage of body.
The noble, dignified character of the drink will provide many minutes of successful, fruitful tasting.

Carbonation: Low.

Summary:

Finally!! Hunahpu’s (several vintages) - NO! Bourbon Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s - NO!
And only Double Barrel Hunahpu’s - definitely YES!

A wonderful little beer that gives so much joy and satisfaction from tasting!
Deep flavor and aroma profile, stunning Rum and Calvados barrels.
Balance, depth, variety, class and chic.

The best beer in Cigar City Brewing's portfolio!

The nose is very rich, with tons of Mexican hot chocolate, vanilla, really great molasses rum, a really nice dose of maple and brown sugar, and just a bit of tingling burn on my nostrils. The flavor is rich milk and dark chocolate up front, a bit less cinnamon than on the nose, but just enough, moving to more molasses rum, vanilla, brown sugar, and a nice hint of spicy chili pepper that has a nice burn from my throat to my belly. The body is very full and creamy with light, but just enough carbonation, and a very long oaky chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy finish.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Thanks DmouthCaliBrewz for sharing this bottle with me. Split 4 ways (more than enough I should add) at about 55 Degrees F in snifters.



A - Pitch black, 1 finger head that fades fast. Great legs, some minor particles on the swish. Looks eerily similar to straight up regular Hunahphu. 



S - Nose WHOA. this is a different beast than it’s little brother. Maple, cupcake, vanilla, rocky road ice cream, the brandy sweetness definitely comes in like it’s 4th of July.



T - Again, shines even deeper. I would guess this is way higher than 14% ABV. Wedding Cake, brownie batter, pepper only at middle to end and doesn’t linger. the spice is in no way hanging on for dear life. You get this bright maple waffles and chocolate cupcake like this is all dessert and should pair really well with NOTHING. drink it straight up after eating a steak dinner. you’ve deserved it!

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"> A total overhaul of Hunahpu creates Perennial BA Abraxas


[ Bottle ][ vacax ][ 750ml ][ 10K+OT Tasting ][ Stemless Wine Taster ][ 5/3/14 ]

>> Thanks Jake for this one! Pours ink like other Hunahpu’s with layer of weak, read foam. Stains the glass. Nose on this one is instantly the best of any Hunahpu variant: guajillo pepper, cinnamon, ancho chili, vanilla, graham cracker, rum raisin, dry rubbed skirt steak. Taste is also instantly the best of any Hunahpu by a long shot, in fact, this beer is so much better than previous Hunahpu’s that it is clear this is a complete recipe overhaul to transform this beer from an ashy, sour, thin mess to something 99% identical to Perennial Abraxas. Gone is that extreme sourness from over mashed black patent malt. Now there is rich, melted sea salted dark chocolate, assertive chili pepper deep heat from ancho chilis. Previous Hunahpu’s had near a smidgen of chili heat. Palate is rich and viscous instead of ashy and watery. This is a major overhaul and easily the best Hunahpu out there. Now the question is, why is this rated so much higher than BA Abraxas? I’ll give you one guess.

It’s like regular Hunahs beefed up big brother with some complex barrel character on the side. Please give this time to settle in the glass, open up and reveal itself, cause if you treat Hunah just right, it could give you a craftbeer boner! Fo realz. It’s dat gewd!",0.0

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle (750 ml). Shared by kermis, huge thanks! Cigar City deep black with a small dark brown head and little to no lacing. Aroma is rich and very complex with chocolate, raisins, spices, dark chocolate, perfume, chili peppers, Rum, vanilla, spices, fruity notes, cinnammon... it might even be a tad too complex and it doesn’t completely get together (still really good too). The taste, on the other side, is as complex but it is perfectly integrated in a decadent burst of flavors... dark chocolate, Rum, vanilla, raisins, cinnamon, chili peppers, spices, coffee, Brandy and a perfect moderately warming lingering alcohol/spices finish. Full bodied and it stimulate all of your taste buds. Medium carbonation that is pefect to open the flavors. Spicy finish. Regular Hunahpu is one of the best beer with chili peppers, but this one is just so freaking good. You won’t easily find a beer that is as complex as this one. The balance is great for this kind of beer. I really enjoyed this one!",0.0

Tasting Notes

Aroma: Doughy, fruity, hint of vinegar and honey.

Appearance: Cloudy gold color.

Flavor: This is a truly complex beer.  Everything is so subtle and well-blended.  Amazing flavor that is very difficult to describe.  Light caramel and honey sweetness, bread, sour apples and some vinegar, hint of wood complexity. 

Palate: Medium-full body.  Creamy and milky texture.

Overall: Spectacular beer.  I really wish I could get my hands on a bottle of stuff!  It is so intense and complex and would be prefect to sit and enjoy for hours!",0.05802588531856596
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Rating number 2600. Pours with minimal head and a hazy golden brown body. Aroma of Bordeaux wine fills the room after pouring. Aroma on closer inspection shows alcohol, caramel, florals, wet wood, fusel alcohol with a tinge of berries, wine, and cobwebs. Taste raisins, and rum raisin ice cream, sherry, port, madeira and a whole host of other fortified, vinous wines, rum soaked bred, wine barrels. There is a bit of oxidation, but it is light and pleasant. Some musty notes. Long duration. Warming with light bubbles and an awesome vinous finish. Very pleasant indeed!",0.0
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Courtesy of Tom Peiters at Monk’s Cafe, thanks Tom! Vibrant aroma of candied fruits, white pepper, vintage port blended with moscato, yeast, licorice and vanilla. Also subtle hints of raisins, incredibly sweet malts, dry hickory,  the bottling floor at Domaine De La Romanee Conti. Taste is utterly magnificent. Honey, icing from an oreo ice cream cake, spicy relleno and pear/apricot jellies. Also lingering tastes of bread, anise, molasses, candy sugar. Sourness is as pleasant as I’ve found in an aged Belgian. Finish is absolutely monstrous, ten miles long, holding my palate hostage without a ransom in sight.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"This is one of the few beers that I've seeked out that delivered more than I was expecting. The odd thing is that my reason for not expecitng more from this beer was that I had had the regular Stille Nacht and wasn't impressed. This, on the other hand, is AMAZING. The color is a nice apple cider and amber with good clarity. Likely the age fo the beer had allowed the yeast to really stick to the bottom because it never got cloudy even toward the end.  Nice glow. Aroma: Some spice, cotton candy, cider vinegar, alcohol. I know I mention the vinegar, but it doesn't show up in the flavor and is only a small part at the very end of the aroma. It actually adds to the quality of the aroma instead of detracting. The flavor is nicely malty, toffee and caramel. Very fruity like cherries and apples. Underneath you can actually taste the wood of the cask. Slightly winey. I'd put it easily in my top five. The guy I split the bottle with agreed. If I could find cases of this, I'd buy them.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"05.22.05  750 shared at jimmack04 invitational.  The third time I’ve had this brew and each time is better than the first.  This beer, each time I enjoy it, produces another one of those magical beer moments where it’s almost impossible to pick up the pen to write any notes.  The first two times I’ve had it, I didn’t even bother, this time I knocked off at least something to make it official...This beer is a 30 year old wood aged port in disguise.  In fact, nothing from Bordeaux has ever come close to what De Dolle managed to extract from this wood.  Honey colored and wonderfully viscous with an unfortunately sudsy, sort of soapy head, but at least it still shows some carbonation despite its age and size.  Color and clarity are gorgeous.  The body is pure silk.  Forget every other time I said a brew had a velvet or silken palate.  I was an idiot.  This brew glides on Apollo’s wings across the palate, pure love.  The flavor embodies all that is ancient wooded port, hints of sherry, dry spices.  It’s a Christmas vigil with the fireworks of the 4th of July.  It’s sweet, savory, and deep, while its still making a sweet case for attention.  Hell, it’s too good to deal with the pen in my hands; it takes two hands to control this snifter.",0.0
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Well, here we are then: one of the biggest whales from Belgium, the legendary start of Dolle's Special Reserva editions and therefore the very first beer in Belgium to have been deliberately aged on wooden casks which previously contained another beverage, red Bordeaux wine in this case. The pioneering role of Dolle Brouwers cannot be underestimated, in being the first non-family-owned craft brewery in Belgium (around 1980, the same time as the beginnings of Abbaye des Rocs' brewing activities); then in 2000, this Special Reserva series, which is continued to this day and has been applied not only to Stille Nacht but also to Oerbier and on one occasion to Dulle Teve (of which a new one is in the process of preproduction now), marks the beginning, at least in Belgium, of what is now common practice among craft breweries around the world. The brewer, Kris, was generous enough to offer us a vertical tasting of all Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions yesterday and needless to say, I cannot thank him enough for his kind generosity - I did have a few Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions before, but never this legend, the ultimate one, a whale I never thought I would ever be able to taste. Carefully opened by Kris himself, the 17 year-old 75 cl bottle, with rusty crown cap and charmingly moldy and partially disintegrated label, did effectively - and contrary to my expectations - produce a minimal head upon pouring, in the form of a thin ring of eggshell-white, loosely knit bubbles, which expectedly disappeared shortly thereafter; the beer itself was of a most beautiful and intense, almost glowing orange-amber colour with a molten copper-like hue, clear initially but hazy with sediment near the finishing of the bottle. A milky cloud of dead yeast and proteins appeared only in the very end. The aroma was of an unbelievable complexity, depth and beauty - I cannot recall ever having sniffed any barleywine (because that is basically, though perhaps unintentionally, what were are talking about here) that comes close to this: gooseberry jam, candied orange peel and marmelade, beguiling vanilla-ish wet oak wood, sweet white dessert wine, honey liqueur, armagnac, matured sweet sherry, old cider, amaretto, marzipan, fresh fig juice, moist raisin bread and, as a sign of its respectable age, hints of wet cardboard and damp cellar, only adding charm, maturity and complexity. The onset was sweet, lush and almost 'praline'-like, hinting at candied figs, sugared fried apples and sweet raspberry jam, drenched in an orangey marmelade sauce with a light sourish sherry hint, that stretches towards the finish where it becomes more outspoken - though a kaleidoscopic, utterly refined and ravishingly beautiful candied sweetness remains the main flavour. Carbonation is evidently very soft (but not at all flat!), resulting in a thick, very vinous, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Thick layers of caramelly and slightly cookie-like malt sweetness with honey and marmelade sweetness on top blend with an unbelievably deep and rich finish, where sweet dessert wine flavours (rather than actual Bordeaux, strangely) are added, tannic woodiness renders a gently drying effect and very sherry-like oxidation, of the noblest kind I may ever have encountered in any vintage beer, establishes a deeply elegant and luscious maturity. Vanilla-, marmelade-, marzipan- and cognac-like impressions make this almost like a liquid crêpe Suzette - with yeasty breadiness added in the very end, soaked in brandy-like alcohol warmth. This is, along with some of the greatest lambics, the most impressive Belgian beer I ever tasted - I feel humbled by this, and not just because of its legendary status in the craft beer world. It is hard to describe, even for me, how beautiful, opulent, deep and aristocratic this beer is; this is without any doubt at the very top of what beer can do in a gastronomical sense, so I cannot but give this the perfect score - if this doesn't deserve that, then I don't know what does. What makes it all the more remarkable, is that it has remained in such mint condition after seventeen years - this only adds to the fact that this product was made and cared for with utmost knowledge, skill and experience. My deepest gratitude goes out to Kris, not only for being so immensely generous to offer this and other bottles for our tasting session, but for giving a beer as utterly beautiful as this to the world. A whole string of young craft breweries today, in Belgium but also on an international level, can and should learn from this. A day to never forget!",0.0

Pours a dark brown with a fine lasting head. The glass is exploding with light chocolate and dried figs, dates and raisins. Loads of oriental spices and vanilla. In fact this beer is a liquid version of an English Christmas Cake. The mouthfeel is one of an extremely fullbodied beer with a lot of sweetness that is yet perfectly balanced by the afterburn of alcohol. This is an exceptional beer!!!! No doubt one of the 1-2 best beers I’ve ever had, which is why I managed to taste it 4 times during the festival with consistent tasting notes.

Fine hints of dried apricots, cedar wood, and orange marmalade but also the smell of cakes and freshly roasted pinepits, Calvados Hors d’age and touche of freshly made croisants with real butter that is melting on it. The taste is also very wine like ( Hongarian Tokay wine ). This masterpiece has a Full and round mouthfeel with a lot of freshness. In the taste you can notice hints of Ripe red fruits, some nuts, vanilla, top quality Normandian applecider and fine BUAL Madeira.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle-conditioned, obtained thanks to my newest great buddy sprinkle (the holy grail! Finally!): cloudy dark orangey amber. Minimal lacing on disappearing head. Woah that nose! This has to be one of the best smells ever. Extremely vinous and potent. The Bordeaux wood really comes through, basking its glory into an already capable beer. I’ll sound like I’m just enumerating, but this is an equilibrium, trust me, everything at the right place and everything does include a lot of things! Sharp cookie dough flavours, cinnamon powder, vanilla, maple, barley sugar, bananas, oranges, pancakes, nutmeg, pears, nuts.. lots and lots of flavours. Complexity layer over complexity layer. It somehow manages to remain diplomatic, begs to be sipped while forcing you to take your time through pure transcendence and force. WOAH! Yeast overload in mouth, this is more than doughy, it’s a pure French toast. Vinous dates, sweet desserty liquor, a big liquid cake. I’ve no idea how so many flavours can be balanced, no idea. It’s almost a case of name as many flavours as you can and have fun finding them in here. Magnetic sheer polar extremes. Velvet mouthfeel, silky full body, soft carbonation, venerable in that aspect. Evolving flavors, complex, elegant, what more do you want? Decadent stuff. If a beer has ever lived up to the hype, this is it, I’d dare even find it underrated as a matter of fact ;-) That this was possibly not the best bottle of this tasting I consider as the best I’ve been part of is an indication of how good my dreams will be in the next few days.",0.0

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"750mL bottle, courtesy of mwsf, shared trade with acrdz and I.  Goddamn.  Thanks so much, Matt!  Pours a lightly hazy, orange-brown color; honey-yellow edges; good amount of viscosity; solid perimeter of off-white bubbles with patchy lacing.  Loads of honey in the aroma: vinous red fruits, Belgian sugar, cherries coupled with the slightest tartness; some chewy caramel from oxidation, but this doesn’t overwhelm the other, clearer notes; incredibly dense, honey-laden, vinous nose; no show of the alcohol underneath.  Full mouthfeel: similar honey-like sweetness and viscosity that one would expect from the stille nacht, but coupled with lightly tannic red fruits, incredibly complex yeastiness, chewy caramel, and viscous Belgian sugars; this bottle seems to have held up beautifully (thanks to great cellaring, evidently, and large pours); there’s nothing thin about this beer, nothing close to watery or relaxed concentration; I could sip this for effectively forever, and I just might.  Lengthy finish: sweet, complex honey and yeastiness, toasty breadiness, and a touch of red fruits, spicing, and dough.  Just a magnificent, complex, seamless barrel-aged beer that can outlast even our desires to track down and drink every single last bottle of this.",0.0

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Huge thanks to hopdog for the bottle, Rating #2000!!  Poured clear, fiery medium orange initially (progressively more hazy with subsequent pours).. loose dusting and larger bubbles of off-white head around the edges. 

 The aroma was just exquisite.. definitely a solid dose of Bordeaux influence over a sweet, supple base.. the underlying beer mellowed out considerably, leaving sweet caramel, toffee, and a delicate bouquet of light fruits (peaches, apricots, and some vinous influence).. deeper oak and Bordeaux undertones as well.. almost a sweet bourbon in there too. 

 The flavor begain with an array of sweet lighter fruits, sour oak, and grape skins, followed by warm caramel and toffee on the middle (accented by warm clove and other Christmas-ey spices).. warm back-end with a touch of oak and a bunch more vinous.. very long, warm, sweet and complex finish. 

 Warm and entirely fulfilling on the palate with great balance between sweet fruits, sour barrel influence and grapes, and alcohol warmth.  This was entirely what I needed.  Thank you Steve!!",0.08466675133346034

Pours thick and deep amber with no head. The aroma is heavenly and arousing. It strikes like a fina muscat wine, there's notes of wood and cherry and so much else I couldn't keep track on. As it warms it becomes more port like and developed peppery notes. There is loads of malt to balance it, and the body is firm and dense and with tremendous depth. It is sweet, sure, but never strikes me as syrupy or sticky just perfectly balanced. The finish is velvetty and oaky.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"10th September 2011
Cloudy orange - brown beer. Decent sized white head. Nose reminds me very much of a Vintage Port cork that has just been pulled. Palate is soft and semi dry and quite well carbonated. Mild caramel malt backbone, tasting slightly aged. Riding over all this are rich wine notes. Red wine with strawberry and then later on blackberry and blackcurrant. Agitating the beer produces some lactose on the nose. Aniseed becomes more obvious. There is a surprising amount of carbonation here and much agitation is required to remove it! The finish is dry and woody. This is the most Port like beer I’ve ever had. Even the Port barrel beers have not been this porty. If you look at recent ratings people are saying this is past it’s best. Who knows but judging it on it’s own merit it’s still quite remarkable it it’s uniqueness and rich flavour. The alcohol is still quite robust. The most surprising thing about this is that De Dolle have never redone this. 2013 postscript - they must have read my mind!

That’ll be me 20K then @ ChrisO’s. Almost clear orange beer, small cream colour head. Light palate, decent fine carbonation. Lovely Port Wine flavours with vibrant crystallised fruits.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Produced in 2000, Stille Natch Reserva is a very special, limited addition of De Dolle’s seasonal Christmas brew, Stille Nacht or ""Silent Night."" Stille Natch is a very special beer to begin with, but De Dolle really out did themselves when they decided to do Reserva. Stille Nacht is brewed with with pale malts, white candy sugar, is hopped, and then dry hopped with Nugget hop varieties, and comes in at a warming 9-10% abv. De Dolle boils this beer for 5 hours, making it a very high gravity brew. It is then bottle conditioned, and will continue to develop in the bottle. 

Any vintage of Stille Nacht is a true gift to any beer lover, but a 750ml corked bottle of the Reserva is truly a Christmas treasure. Reserva takes it to a whole new realm. Reserva was produced in 2000, and was aged for 18 months in Bordeaux wine barrels before being bottled. This age in the wine barrels, gives an already incredible beer a level of complexity, flavor, and character, that is in a class by itself. Reserva comes in at a warming 12% abv, making a very potent beer as well. 


Stille Nacht Reserva pours to a beautiful, hazy, deep golden color with a thick and creamy pillow of a head, and a lively and vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is incredibly complex and aromatic with big robust aromas just bursting in the air. Aromas of sweet malt, oak, candy sugar, deep vinous notes, spicy hops, and peppery alcohol flood the nose. The plate on this beer is rich and full, yet at the same time, has a nice bit of acidity, that dances on the tongue. Big, robust flavors of sweet malt, light caramel, oak, pepper, black berry, and vinous flavors, coat the tongue and glide down the palate. It is almost too much of a good thing, as your taste buds will be on bliss over load. Reserva finishes with more complex flavors up front, then ends with very vinous, acidic, and peppery flavors that linger on the tongue for quite sometime. 

In a word, this beer is stunning. This beer was one of the most enjoyable beers I have drank, ever. The age in the Bordeaux barrels really give this beer a whole new dimension. The vinous qualities of this beer combined with the fantasic malty overtones and warming alcohol makes this one of the most delicous beers ever produced in my opinion.",0.0

Absolutely fantastic.  Notes of walnut and pecan from the oak and sweet candy sugar after years of aging.  Smooth and wonderfully balanced, velvety and long-finishing.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Had on tap to culminate Raleigh Beer Week. September 3, 2010.

Typical lights-out black with a small browned head that leaves me a little wanting. Some lace. 

Slightly muted at first, the nose opens up as time goes on. Tons of oak, high quality coffee, some whiskey, maple (of course, and it really comes through after sipping for awhile), caramel, and fudgy chocolate. What’s near-perfect in the aroma is perfect and rich in the mouth. Thick roasted malt, vanilla and bourbon first, followed by maple syrup and oak. I find the barrel-aging to be better on this than the KBS, which is more dominated by the bourbon. CBS is just so smooth, fudgy, and complex as it opens. The maple sweetness and coffee bitterness balance beautifully. 

Fairly thick and syrupy. (Ha.) I had three of these because, well, it’s just one of the finest beers I’ve ever had. When I finished my first glass, all I could think about was starting in on my second one.",0.0

The aroma maple, chocolate, a sweet roastyness and a loving coffee finish to it. I love the licorice kick to it, and the maple just holds it together in bliss. The flavor. Wow. Starts off sweet and chocolatey, slowly moving through to a coffee like nice never tasted before. It's a brilliant, seamless transition they masks all hints of booze. The maple provides an amazing flavor to tie these together. The mouth feel just coats thickly and doesn't let up. The finish is definitely coffee on the lingering aftertaste, but the maple is amazingly influential. It provides just an incredible balance that I've yet to find. Amazing

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"REVIEW #1000!  Beer has officially taken over my life!  Growler generously shared by largadeer on BA &#40thanks, Chris!&#41. I was really looking forward to trying this beer and annoyed him about it at every possible opportunity. Growler did leak in transit and lose a substantial amount of beer, so the packaging materials were lucky enough to sample quite a bit of this rare brew.  Fortunately the beer was still great, even if a little flat.  I knew from the start this was right up my alley since I love imperial stouts, coffee, and maple syrup. I could probably take almost anyone in a Super Troopers style syrup bottle chug.  Pours black and viscous with the tiniest bit of brown foam when agitated. Clung to the side of the glass when swirled.  Aroma is coffee, roast, maple syrup, and a tiny bit of alcohol. Very inviting.  As for flavor, I’ve heard you can drop a tablespoon of maple syrup into a Breakfast Stout and approximate this beer pretty closely closely. CBS is a little fuller-bodied and more viscous, but as far as taste goes, that is a very good approximation. Flavor is lots of bitter coffee that is very reminiscent of regular Breakfast Stout, roasted malt, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, and a faint hint of oak. Alcohol is detectable but very well-hidden. This beer is really well-rounded and succeeds in balancing the sweetness from the syrup and malt with the coffee bitterness.  Because of the shipping mishaps, the amount of carbonation was somewhere between really, really, ridiculously low and Angels Share - i.e. it was damn near flat. Surprisingly, that didn’t matter much. Call me crazy, but I like it when a syrup beer has a syrup-like mouthfeel. That’s exactly how this was. CBS is smooth and viscous on the way down and lingers on the palate afterwards.  This is incredibly drinkable for an imperial stout. The second I put the glass down, I was thinking about my next sip. It just keeps you wanting that mapley, coffeey &#40not even close to being a word, I know&#41 goodness and almost makes you cry when it’s gone and you know you’ll probably never try this again.  Founders, I can’t stress this enough, please brew this beer again. If I could have a keg of this stuff delivered to my apartment once a month, I would be a very happy, drunk, and fat person.
UPDATE 9/19/09: largadeer got a new growler that was perfectly hermetically sealed, and it was PHENOMENAL.  Huge lasting tan head with great retention and lacing.  Flavor is just incredibly complex with a lot &#40but not too much&#41 of maple syrup.  Nice lively mouthfeel.  This destroyed both KBS and regular BS in a side-by-side.  This is one of the best beers I’ve ever had.",0.0

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"On-tap at the brewpub, it’s an unbelievably powerful aroma of maple that courses through this beer, unfortunately to the detraction of pretty much all other beer-like smells.

The palate is smooth, especially for an imperial stout.  Coffee flavors come through, along with a nice caramel character toward the mid- to end of the palate.  Especially pleasing is a distinct lack of hop bitterness, which often only seems to make the roasted malt character too strong.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Reviewed 9-1-10.

I had this one on tap 2-3 weeks ago over at Churchkey. At the time, I liked it, but still thought the KBS was better. However, after thinking about it and in retrospect, I was out with friends, spent most of my time and energy enjoying their company, and wasn’t able to give this brew my full attention. Fast forward a couple of weeks.... I was out beer shopping in downtown DC and came upon a great bookstore and tap house I had always heard great things about, but had never experienced - Kramerbooks. I went inside and the bartender handed me a draft menu and low and behold.... there it was!

Ap: Very dark, pitch black even, with a great deal of carbonation for a beer this style. It poured with about an inch worth of head. This one’s a beauty!

Ar: Maple and coffee (just like the name dictates), with hints of chocolate and caramel. It had a very candy-like sweetness, as apposed to a brown sugar-type one.

T: Founders BS with maple sweetness. How to describe this best .... Hmmm...Caramelized, coffee and maple infused, dark chocolate cotton candy, melted into liquid form and slightly chilled. Simply amazing!

P: Surprisingly creamy and smooth. Some of the coffee ground notes I found offensive in the BS are now muted, and the high grade maple prevails.

Maple syrup gives it a more rounded and smoother taste, and makes the roasted dark malt more toffee/caramel and nutty and less burnt/smoky. Surprisingly, the maple syrup doesn't make the CBS too much sweeter - if anything the aroma compared to the KBS is deeper and richer. Palate is smooth, lightly smoky, roasted, very fine carbonation. Excellent all around.",0.0

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Black with a small, somewhat bubbly dark brown head that leaves great lazing on the inside of the snifter. Aroma is superb with vanilla, honey, bourbon, light and dark chocolate, cookie dough, caramell and toffe alongside a subtile tone of coffe. Flavor is seriously intense with maple syrup sticking to the inside of my mouth revealing sweet notes of dark chocolate, brownie cookies, vanilla, some molasses and murky wood (bourbon.) Very intense yet balanced. Ends on a fantastic chocolatey roasted and slightly bitter note with dry coffe and a fine spirit kind of heat alongside a fat creamy maple syrup character that seem to wash the heat off while providing a deep sweet drinking experience. The balance between the sweet syrup and the dry coffe is just gorgeous, wow.. And if thats not enought the mouthfeel is just perfectly slick, creamy and slightly sticky, just enough to indicate that this is a seriously potent brew. Great.",0.0

A: Pours a nice deep dark black. with a small tan head. No lace.

S: Wonderful fresh maple syrup aroma. Hints of bourbon and vanilla hide beneath.

T: WOW! Fresh sweet maple syrup up front, rich, bold, sweet good. The bourbon shows up in the middle. It does not overpower which I like because it lets the maple shine. Vanilla seems to meld right into the maple. The finish a bit of fresh coffee comes out with just a touch of chocolate. Very Very Very complex.

Light chilli heat, sweet but not too sweet or cloying. Taste has dark bitter chocolate, bitter booze, really intense still, flavours intact, tasting like KBS on steroids. Still dry finish, chocolaty, light maple booze. Worth the hype, nothing short of amazing. We move forward to 2017 version. Well, you can recognise its still the same beer. Thats about it, fresh version has more maple, its sweeter and all characteristics are not as chiseled compared with this original 7 year old sample.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Fresh from bottle (2013): Black pour with brown head. great aroma with coffee at the front with chocolate (a mocah really) and bourbon behind it. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I’d like. Coffee flavors up front, with bourbon and chocolate undertones. Great bitter/sweet balance, but I think Eclipse might beat this beer in a fresh head-to-head. Better taste than the ’11 I had aged 1.5 years, but less body. Same score as last time for different reasons. Have a feeling that 9 months to 1 year is the sweet spot on this beer.

Old score and writeup: Gave it a 4.6 Had 2011 on draft (1.5 years old). Overall a very pleasing and complex beer, though it didn’t age age as well as I’d think. Definitely one of the better stouts up there, though I’d rank bourbon county and Avery stouts above it.",0.0
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"My 1000th rating, care of Mr Paul Unwin. I was a bit hesitant about going for the KBS. Was not a fan of Bourbon County Stout. Opened this and looked into the neck of the bottle to see the swirling smokey aroma released. One sniff and it was pure dark chocolate. A very good start. Next sniff and there’s a strong whiff of bourbon whiskey barrel. That grainy smokey sweetness. Hope it’s not going to overwhelm the flavours. So, smokey oak barrel, bourbon whiskey, dark chocolate, expresso coffee, spice, minerally. Colour is opaque black, thin tan head. There’s some carbonation bubbles in there but not too much. Taste is a surprise. Really well balanced. Big hit of dark chocolate, black coffee and some sweet bourbon whiskey, but it’s not overwhelming. There’s some carbonation, which tingles with the bourbon flavour, but as it goes down it’s smooth dark choc and black coffee. Perfect balance. Watching Danny Boyle’s Olympics Opening Ceremony.

On the palate dark chocolate, cocoa, black cherry in alcohol, almost imperceptible dried figs, light bourbon that becomes more present later together with the dark chocolate; after a short pause a beautiful finish of toasted coffee mixed with sugar and cocoa comes forward accompanied by raisins and an ethyl note that warms and rises to the nose, finally leaving a pleasant woody note very persistent.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Thx to px2grafx. Poured a dark oily body with a small tan head. Minimal lacing on the glass. Initial aroma was a blast of bourbon. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak were all here. The bourbon influence was a little overdone, but it was still very enjoyable. Never woulda guessed 10% ABV. Didn’t know what to expect after the Breakfast Stout, but this was hella better. The coffee has been muted, so perhaps it was good to have all that bourbon flavor. May 18, 2006.

April 9, 2017 rerate: Black pour, tan head that lasts. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, roast, vanilla, caramel. Medium to full body, interesting balance of coffee, chocolate and the barrel. I like it, but it still doesn’t come off as a world class imperial stout, it’s just good.",0.0
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"2017 brewing. Crowler from Kunda Beverage in King of Prussia, PA. Pours oil black with minimal dark brown head. Sweet bitter coffee and booze aroma. Mouthfeel is heavy but not super heavy. Little carbonation. Taste is both of coffee and bourbon. Coffee makes it kind of bitter. Bourbon makes it sweet and bourboney but not crazily so. Very good but I doubt I’d hunt it down. Glad to have tried it though.",0.0

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),I was psyched to see this. A black appearance with a beige head. The aroma is whiskey and coffee. Or smells like Jim Morrisons breakfast.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"12oz bottle.  Aroma:  Coffee just jumps out of the glass.  Cream, tobacco smoke, vanilla, rich chocolate, light oak.  Bourbon is there but snakes its way subtly through the beer.  Wow.  Appearance:   Dark and oily looking black with no highlights.  Dark tan head was small, foamy, and fleeting.  Not much lacing.  Flavor:  Again, the coffee just pushes to the front with its richness.  Dark chocolate, smoke, vanilla, light toasted nuts, oak.  The bourbon is balanced very nicely. It adds some flavors and richness, but doesn’t overwhelm.  Finishes somewhat dry, but roasted grains and coffee linger after the finish. Palate:  Full bodied and creamy.  Moderate carbonation.  Strong alcohol warming in back of mouth and down throat.   Overall:  Great, great beer.  Smooth, rich, and very satisfying.  The subtlety of the bourbon flavors was terrific.  Only complaint is that the alcohol is a bit hot at times.  But that’s a small complaint against everything else they did well here.",0.0

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Very excited to finally break into a bottle of KBS and I’m not sharing either. It’s a beautiful looking beer, pitch black, basically no head retention, thick and oily. Ok so at first this thing smelled like oxidized and burnt coffee and tasted pretty oxidized too and I can’t verify how old my bottle was. I was honestly pretty turned off by it at first. Burnt, stale, bitter coffee, old wood, cereal grains and cocoa powder. As it warmed up however, I started to enjoy it more- deeper chocolate notes, vanilla cream, not a lot of heat on it anymore. The coffee warms up very nicely too as this beer opened up. Very glad I got to try this and I want to try another again, maybe fresher. Best imperial Stout? No. Second best? No. Overrated? Yes.",0.0

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"I reviewed the 2018 edition originally, but now that the 2019 edition is released, I am updating this review. The packs I bought were bottled just 10 days ago and ran me $28 each 4 pack. The taste this year is extremely well-rounded; I’m not sure if it’s due to it being so fresh or not, so perhaps the coffee will fade overtime and the bourbon and oak will be more pronounced. I’m laying down an entire 4 pack to cellar so I can see how the beer evolves overtime. The appearance is as usual, very dark but not motor oil. Got about a finger of head on an aggressive pour into the KBS snifter from last year (nicer than last years’ in my opinion). The smell is quite wonderful, bittersweet chocolate, lots of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and of course rich roasted malt. The barrel profile comes out more as this beer warms up. Mouthfeel is light but not thin. Very well-balanced for a beer of this ABV. The remaining test is to see how this beer ages. This is world class beer for sure.",0.0

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"12 oz bottle from CT Beverage in New Britain, CT.  This beer is very elusive a one to a customer limit.  Pour is jet black with motor oil thickness, a thin beige head and big alcohol legs.  Smell is equal parts dark chocolate and espresso with notes of wood, charcoal and booze.  Taste is similar to the nose with some nice elements of vanilla and oak with a charred bitterness that works well with the sweet malt.  Bourbon really shines through on the back end and actually cleanses the palate in between sips.  The barrel aging really helped this beer and us a big improvement over the Breakfast stout which I thought was a coffee saturated overrated mess.  The bourbon, oak and vanilla really make this complex and enjoyable and the coffee, although present, doesn't dominate the beer.

But towards the end, upon full warming, there is a thinning and a rise of the bourbon that sstarts to drown out the rest and it beomes less interesting. Others will probably like that, but here the sweetness didn’t work with the slight thinning and the big bourbon. Just not handled as classically as in the Central Waters though still very nice.",0.0

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Vintage 2006

Pours opaque black, with dark brown bubbles that struggle to overcome the viscous liquid.
A inverted cascade of ulta-fine carbonation swells to a half inch with an exaggerated pour.

Aromatics are pungent with heavily roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and a small dose of bourbon. 
The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and slightly grainy. Plenty of gription and cling-power.
The pallet is laden with plenty of dry, bitter, dark chocolate, black-roasted coffee grounds, oak char, and burnt malt.
Hopping is subdued, and alcohol is slightly warming.
Finishes with lingering brownie batter infused with espresso, and spiked with a hint of whiskey.

Pours dark brown, almost black, with very thin reddish-cappuccino head.
Unfortunatly I got a bottle that was a month beyond the BB date already (the risk on online shopping... ), and this most probably affected the aroma, in which the coffee is surely there, but not as strong as expected. On the other hand, I can get a smoky flavour, like habanero. 
Very nice as the same flavour I got drinking, plus a much more evident coffee roastiness, plus dark chocolate and some alcohol to warm. Sweet and bitter are balanced perfectly.
Very low carbonation, full body and oily, everything packed with a nice alcoholic kick.
A great sipper which I can't wait to taste again fresh!

Great. Flavor is amazing as well, massive sweetness overpowering the front of the mouth, followed by a roasty, ashy middle and rounded off by a nice hint of coconut. An amazingly well balanced, complex brew which I can’t get enough off. Long, cloyingly sweet aftertaste with again the coconut present. Soft, oily texture.

usual black tar stout in a glass. Ink. Smells initially pretty weak, but probably because it is too cold. As it warmed the coconut really came through and paired well with the beer.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"One of the most sought after versions of BCBS, vintage of 2013; my bottle says 14.1% ABV instead of the 13.9% ABV given above. I taste this special treat from an old port wine snifter at near room temperature. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, near to black but not entirely so; only in the last remnants of the liquid, a cloudy brown appearance reveals itself, with tiny bits of dead yeast and proteins lining the glass wall.  The head is thin, beautifully deep beige and a bit coarse, but is sadly reduced to an irregular, wafer-thin rim around the glass in instants. I passionately fall in love with the aroma: what a divine bouquet rises up from the bottle... I could sniff this for hours on end: deep dark chocolate sauce, raisins, candied figs, vanilla-like oaky tannins, Islay whisky, liquorice, old sherry, soy sauce, candied orange, eucalyptus syrup, espresso, cocoa powder, cedar wood, pear syrup, Worcestershire sauce, some cooked meat or fried eggs far away but not disturbing at all, and indeed a faint hint of coconut, though I suspect this volatile aroma has faded considerably in the course of almost two years. The taste amazes me even more: a complex and baffling experience indeed, starting off with a very dense, pointy, refined, concentrated, candied sweetness, cloying a bit to the lips, candied oranges, pear, dried dates and indeed a hint of dry coconut meat; a tinge of carbonation pierces through, as well as subtle sourish and salty accents (red berries and soy sauce). Then a profound chocolate maltiness unfolds in all its glory, bitter chocolate with caramel and cashew nuts, spreading over the tongue and mouth cavity, with a fat, oily mouthfeel; a wonderful symphony of sweet versus bitter, with a lively, almost faintly clove- and cinnamon-like spiciness to it (perhaps the rye whisky already speaking?). Bitter wins in the end, as - almost unexpectedly - a tangy yet still mellow roasted coffee ’blackness’ appears, almost cappuccino-like in combination with the bittersweet chocolate, warming and filling the back of the mouth. Even before I swallow the first sip, it is clear to me that this beer increases in complexity as it makes its way through the palate; the finish beautifully recaptures the whole taste trail from beginning to end, blending the candied sweetness, the bittersweet chocolate malts and the softly roasted coffee bitterness into one concentrated ’ball’ of taste, which is finally confronted with a big wave of warming, whisky-like alcohol which also remains on the tip of the tongue after swallowing but somehow manages to remain gentle in all its force; a clear, drying, tannin-like woodiness ensues, as well as a background hint of peppery, leafy, noble hops adding a subtle, double bass-like structure to the whole. The complexity and richness of the malts, including a warm sense of high quality, aromatic coffee and again the woody tannins, linger for hours after swallowing and the alcohol warms the heart... Things just keep happening here, no matter how many sips you’ve taken.  Though I have to admit I expected more coconut presence, this is still one of the most noble stouts I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I particularly appreciate the follow-up of tastes in this one, sweet and bitter and bitter and sweet all make their appearance one by one only to lead to a resolving climax, as in a classical drama, though I did find the alcohol and the cloying sweetness perhaps a tad over the top - I had the same experience with AleSmith’s Speedway Bourbon Barrel Aged, and like in the case of the latter, this is the only thing keeping me from giving both stouts a perfect score.  Obviously, in view of this beer’s complexity and greatness, this is only the slightest form of criticism, if any; both remain unforgettable and both surely belong to the best beers I ever tasted.  This one, too, is a slow sipper for sure, to be treated with graciousness, dignity and respect. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into this beer; it is as if the malts were selected especially to fit in with the spirit of the barrel in which it has aged (and frankly, I would not be surprised if this is indeed deliberate). Fantastic example of the style, definitely worth the money (which was quite considerable, needless to say...). A world-class masterpiece, that is beyond doubt. I will remember this for the rest of my existence and I will keep the empty bottle in my cellar, only to look at it every now and then with a feeling of nostalgia...",0.0

I have to say, this actually lives up to the hype. And holy crap there is a lot of hype surrounding this. If you have multiples and plan on drinking one, probably best to do it now, this is good to go, cant imagine it getting any better.  





7/17/14 Was at room temp for a few months and then in my fridge for a few months. Everyone said the coconut would be gone in 6 months. Well it’s about 1/4 of what it was. Which is still a decent amount of coconut.  But not to say that this turned to regular bourbon county. It’s almost as if the coconut broke down into sugar. Super sweet, touch of bourbon.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle, thanks Tommy for sharing this wonderful beer. Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a small tan head and lots of little pieces of what I believe to be coconut floating all around. Nose is rich, but not as the almost cloyingly rich OG version of this wonderful stout. Coconut is super present, more in this beer than any other coconut or non-coconut beer I have ever had. Super impressive. Balance is incredible. Really good stuff, maybe my new favorite bourbon county, though the Rare was pretty incredible. Psyched to try this delicious elixir.",0.0

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"My Bottom Line:

Coconut thrives through this fun dessert of an Imperial Stout, swimming around chocolate and caramel flavours in an otherwise heavily sweet, complacent mouthfeel.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-There is no head of foam atop the darkness.

-The sweetness is prevalent and can get on your nerves quickly. Glad I got to split this bomber with a few likeminded aficionados.

-When the coconut subsides, this beer might reach better cohesion. For now, flavours are harmonious, but the flavour profile is not nearly as tight as it should be.

-The flatness and utter dominance of the coconut make this much less compelling than the ratings suggest.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coconut and black chocolate with some bourbon and some vanilla notes. Taste is a complex and satisfying mix of vanilla and bourbon with some black chocolate with just the right amount of coconut. Quite a bit of residual sugar notes but not overly so. Body is full with nice creamy body and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Such a shame that this was only brewed once.,0.0
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle thanks to daknole. Aroma has a medium light coconut note but it is strong enough to break through the moderate chocolate notes and moderately strong bourbon notes. Some light oak and toasted almond character. Light roast character and faint dark fruit. Pours black with hints of dark brown. A faint attempt at a head appears but then disappears even quicker. Some white coconut flakes floating in the beer. No lacing and more a sheet of liquor than legs. Flavor has moderately strong chocolate notes with some light roast. Moderately strong bourbon character with lighter oak notes as well as some toasted almond and vanilla. Medium light coconut notes that add a hint of sweetness. Not much fruit esters. Medium alcohol spice in finish and moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium low carbonation. Oily, silky and chalky all at the same time. Low astringency and medium alcohol warmth. Overall the coconut flavor and aroma are great, but the appearance and mouthfeel are severely hurt by the coconut. A great coconut stout, but it is rough on the edges. The barrel and bourbon qualities show through nicely.",0.0

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Tasted blind at a horizontal including Vanilla, Rare, Cherry Rye, Bramble Rye, Coffee ’12 and an ’09 Bomber. Poured into a snifter at approx 55 degrees. Reviewed from blind tasting notes. 5/6 in the lineup. 

A- The lowest carbonation of the bunch, essentially no head formation whatsoever upon pouring. Thick, blackest of black, motor oil appearance. 

S- Tons of barrel on the nose as well as bourbon. Some sweetness, almost like a port-like oxidation. In addition, some vanilla. 

T- Tons of vanilla, barrel and bourbon. The vanilla is very rich and the most apparent note. Tastes absolutely fantastic. 

M- Thick, rich, and lingering. Not much more to be said. Simply fantastic from start to finish. Minimal carb. 

O- We actually misidentified this as the ’09 bomber, and the ’09 bomber as this. To be honest, we all enjoyed the ’09 more, although this was the close second out of our ratings by just 1 or 2 total points. We should have been able to guess by the very low levels of carbonation. Either way, this is a fantastic beer, but I think it may have peaked. When I had this back in May, it definitely had a bit more oomph than this bottle.",0.0

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz bottle, #3,642 with an 11/19/10 bottled on date. Picked up this piece of hype at the Binny’s LP Black Friday event. Pours an oily black colored body with a few ruby-brown traces around the edge. Thin, frothy, dark brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light ring around the outside. Aroma absolutely jumps out of the bottle upon opening. Extremely rich and smooth. Loaded with molasses, caramel cookies, vanilla, an underlying yet distinct roast, dark chocolate, and a very pleasant warming bourbon that never announces itself as boozy. Some raisins and dark fruits, soft oak, and barely a hint of leathery tobacco. The barrel presence is quite deep, but anything but overwhelming. Flavor is more the same. Loaded with thick, rich, and sweet chocolates, molasses, and caramel cookies up front. Smooth vanilla, somewhat salty oak, raisin, and roast follow quickly before the extremely deep barrel aspect wraps this up. Tons of sweet bourbon, but oh so soft and never boozy. The barrel completely dries this out with a very enjoyable warming feel that increases more and more as it flows down my throat. This beer finishes better than Peter North. Plenty of vanilla, raisin, bourbon, oak, rich chocolates, molasses, and fairly bitter roasts make it so complex before leaving a lengthy aftertaste. Full, silky smooth body and barely a trace of carbonation. Fantastic mouthfeel. Overall, I was skeptical, but the ratings are legit. This is every bit as good as advertised. The barrel aging on this is so deep and complex, but it still has plenty of sweet, rich, and roasty malts. Spectacular balance and enjoyable in every aspect. $43 and two hours in the cold is a pretty steep price tag, but damnit this is a world class barrel-aged imperial stout.",0.0

S - Chocolate, oak, bourbon, toffee, burnt sugars, roasted nuts. The alcohol is a little hot, but hey, it’s still not overpowering by any means. The sweetness is not overdone like I find in some other big -bal aged stouts.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle shared by the other Matt the other day at the other house. This is the other Bourbon county, the green one, served in a Russian River wine glass. Thanks Matt! This beer was also drank close to the same time the Bourbon County Brand Stout (regular) vertical was drank. I’ll review that later.

Beer looks exactly like BCBS, it’s black, thin head of small tan bubbles, minimal lacing, low carbonation, the swirl leaves a coating on the glass, legs appear, looks really nice.

Aroma is great, it has this sweetness from the malt, hints of roast with a strong but not overpowering woodsy and liquor character. The liquor is smooth and flavorful on the nose.

Beer is medium in body and lowly carbonated on the palate. Beer is sweet at lead off the way a syrup is sweet, giving way to a huge, flavorful midpalate experience of strong liquor and alcohol. The finish is a little dry with minimal bitterness, somehow accenting the flavor of the oak and the bourbon, it tastes really nice. For such a big and aggressive beer it drinks wonderfully. I am very curious to see how this ages. Very excited about this beer in general. I am not a scotch or single malt expert but all of these nuanced flavors from the different barrels definitely makes me curious.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz. bomber, #3,760, with thanks to dgugliuzza from over on BA, and selfishly shared with no one on my own little New Years Eve Eve party by myself.  Pours a nice dark black with a minimal brown head that quickly disappears leaving a still surface.  Aroma is lovely, with lots of barrel notes, oak, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, chocolate, and ripe dark fruits.  There is a definite initial note of alcohol that dissipates as it has a chance to breathe, and other than needing a little time found this quickly went away.  Flavor is equally up to the task, with more rich vanilla, oak, molasses, chocolate and a blend of ripe dark fruits.  The carbonation is just a touch higher than I’d hope, with some prickliness, but retains a smooth and coating finish.  A fine beer, but not quite at the level of something like FiftyFifty’s PVW Eclipse.  Embarrassed at how much this costs, but for a one bottle, one time kind of thing there are no regrets.  Thanks again Danny!",0.0

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bourbon county rare. 5oz sample at goose island clybourn on the Black Friday releas... Pours a  
velvety, silky solid liquid night black pour with a thin khaki head  
quickly receding towards the glass’ edge leaving a wispy presence of  
it’s former self... Aroma is fairly assertive on the bourbon front,  
somewhat thick and sticky, with molasses and vanilla. Subtler coconut  
undertones mingle soflty with the aforementioned qualities... Flavors  
are much of what was described in the nose with smooth bourbon  
characteristics combining sublimely, well perhaps not to that extent,  
with more than subtle hints of vanilla. Not so much heat or a boozy  
presence detected (as it would with a fresh batch of BCS) although does make an appearance in a slow yet persistent manner...  
Body has held up to the prolonged aging which is significant in  
itself. Carbonation is present and body is smooth.  Decadent to say the least.  Not sure if it’s worth the pricetag but it’s a must-try for me as a bourbon county stout lover.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"5 oz pour.

It pours a dense black with a fizzy head that dissipates before I even get it.

The smell here is richer and smoother than the average BCS. This is partially due to the extra aging, but also the bourbon barrels used. It has all of the traditional BCS traits: thick bourbon, barrel, chocolate, and roast. However, there is an added almost woodsy-spiciness that is unique to this version.

The flavor follows. It has that hint of spiciness that takes regular BCS to a different level. It is smoother, and richer. The aging has allowed it to mature to perfection. The drinkability here is much greater than the average BCS.

This one is overpriced, but it is a great experience. An outstanding beer.

Nose is really smooth bourbon with a nice amount of toasted wood. The flavor reflects the oak barrel a bit more then all the other BCBS variants. The complexity is just as fantastic as any BCBS. Great slick, oily texture that just slides down the muzzle. Bourbon flavor is real smooth leaning on subdued. I would say if you have any of this now is the time to drink it. Still wonderful flavor but I feel like it is leaning on the ledge of falling off real soon. I was really happy to have gotten to sample this.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Draft at the CBC Event at the brewery and again on Black Friday at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a pitchplack opaque pour, some brown ruby edges, a small frothy darker brown head dies to a small ring. Aromas are rich chocolate chip cookies, vanilla tannins, warming bourbon, roasted malts, flourishes of roasted coffee, bakers chocolate, dark fruit slips in. Thick and strong on the nostrils, rich and creamy, sweet yet roasty, deep barrel presence. Initial is rich and creamy, roasty malts, dark chocolate, brownies and cookies, caramel, coffee grounds, bigger vanilla tannins, rich barrel presence, warming as it goes down. Wet oak, thick bodied with legs, coats the palate well as raisin and dark fruit, touches of plum and dark black cherries really grow and give this beer it’s character. Vanilla, rich bakers chocolate, coating malts and warming barrel, a little hot, but a big luscious body supports it. Incredible, if not a bit hot. Truly a good display of the barrel, and special ones at that. Finish is warming, loads of vanilla tannins with roasty bitter malts, cocoa, and coffee running the gambit and warming spirit, touches of dark fruit, anise, biscuits, nice. Overall, it IS BCS..

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Draft.  I’m sure the appearance is probably a 5... but in the little sippy cup thing they give it to you in... I’ll leave it a 4 for now.  The aroma also suffers because of this, maybe it’s because of waiting in the cold for a while, but it also seems muted.  Wow, what a great marriage of bourbon and wonderful stout, the bourbon is quite strong but never gives the sense that it’s too much, not subtle but remains ever sophisticated, the stout has just light touches of soy up front, a few people commented that it actually seems to have less depth than regular, the bourbon is just amazing... o so delicious.  Mouthfeel seemed to be just a bit marshmallowy but that could be because this is out of a keg, so it fluffs up a bit, supremely drinkable though, no indication that it’s 14% at all, and you don’t tire of drinking it whatsoever, doesn’t gloop up like other big stouts... probably will get a 5 on palate once I try it out of the bottle, (eh just tried some regular BCS, this is for sure a 5 on palate).

The aromas consist of sweet bourbon, vanilla, molasses, oak, chocolates, and syrupy goodness. You can tell it’s had plenty of time to age and let it’s intricate qualities intermingle. I would like a little more PVW but it’s fine. The beer is already over two and a half years old at this point. The flavors are just wow.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle #6554, 4 oz pour into tulip tasting glass.
Appearance: Black with a light dark brown foam. Foam dissipated rather quickly after pour.
Aroma: Tons of chocolate on the nose followed by powerful scent of bourbon.
Taste: What I picked up on the nose gets amplified on the palate. Starts with big chocolate and then the rich bourbon flavor starts to build and come into its own. This is such an excellent fusion of flavor.
Palate: Medium body. Beer leaves its mark on your palate and the flavors persist long after a sip.
Overall: This was one of the finest imp. stouts I have ever had. I wish I had a more sophisticated bourbon palate to better detect the intricacies of the barrel aging. Regardless, this was like eating a box of chocolates, all of which were filled with pappy!",0.0
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"The heart rate rises. Didn't think I would get to experience this. (Thanks biggsbowler!). A bit of the evening's highlight and big surprise. The feeling of being able to drink the best berries made by one of the breweries that meant the most to me is heavy. 
Scent of vanilla, bourbon and nostalgia. Feels that it probably has nothing to gain from longer storage. Balanced, smooth and nice. Faint sense of oxidation that is easy to ignore and just enjoy and feel nostalgic and remember back to his first bourbon cask imperial stout.",0.0

7/28/2011: Goose Island RARE Bourbon County Stout... Aroma: AWESOME! (but difficult to describe)... Vanilla, raisin, plum, high-end bourbon, black licorice, tobacco. Appearance: Deep, dark ruby-brown color, OPAQUE; fleeting dark brown-colored brown; oozing golden bubbles. Flavor: F-ing A! WOW! This beer is truly light years beyond the ""regular"" BCS... rich, deep, robust caramel tobacco; chewy, but muted black licorice; smooth, subtle VANILLA, a splash of red wine/port; roasted almond; really great refined bourbon alcohol and slight burn through the finish. Palate: Full body; silky SMOOTH and mellow; milky texture. Overall: Insanely good! #1 or #2 overall for me! Is there any more I need to say?! Yes, yes I do... This beer is WAY beyond what I expected. There was a lot of talk that this wasn’t overly distinguishable from the regular BCS, but there is no comparison. This is a PHENOMENAL beer.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Quick notes. 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Bottle #2209, bottled on 11/19/2010. Huge thanks to Doug for slaying my number one want by sharing a pour with me!

Appearance wise it is identical to BCBS, no surprise there. Having never had the 2008 vintage which this beer is using, I can say its awfully similar to how the 2009 vintage is drinking now. There is a stronger vanilla presence and it is smoother and mellower than the standard beer. Just loads of chocolate, charred malt, and rich and decadent bourbon. It drinks far too easily, which is sad considering how elusive it is now. A marginal improvement over standard BCBS, but when that is your favorite beer it truly does matter. Such a beautiful beer that I’m glad to have finally tried.",0.0

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Sampled the 2003 Vintage at the cider house.  A bit more dark and caramel coloured than Neige, it’s viscous and oily and coated the tulip-shaped tasting glass well.  Aroma starts off with a little oak, then a few alcoholic fumes, but not overpowering at all, then comes the fruit salad: lychee, passion fruit, mangoes, and then finishes off with a smell of freshly chopped mushrooms.  Insane.  This elixir tastes like liquid apple pie.  Soft notes of caramel, it feels powerful in your mouth but comes down smoother than silk.  It has a residual sweetness that cancels out any apparent acidity and doesn’t give you that ""too much sugar in my bloodstream"" feeling a lot of dessert wines can give you.

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"5/4/07.  Poured out of 375 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with Olivier_MTL on RateBeer 12/3/05.  2003 Vintage.  Pours a deep amber-gold color with good clarity and a bold, beautiful depth of autumn color.  The oily legs on this cider are much broader and slower than those of its brother, the Neige-- tilt the glass and there are times that the high edge of residue takes literally several minutes to droop, like the wax from a freshly-lit candle.  The aroma here is much richer and more succulent also-- some overripe apples and fresh apple sauce (complete with cinnamon accompaniment), as well as soft caramel and a captivating, warming, sweet-liqueur aura.  First taste is decadently sweet with a lightly leathery, lightly waxy tart apple outline.  The finish drops most of the soft tartness that balanced the initial taste and leaves a homemade soft-and-syrupy cinnamon apples and a slight apple pie doughy flavor.  Some zesty alcohol rounds out the mouthfeel, sort of a funny way to balance the gripping sweetness.  This is even more indulgent than its companion, lacking most of the tartness of crisp fresh apples but replacing it with an intoxicating medley of apple desserts that rival the best restaurant creations I’ve ever sampled.",0.0

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Harvest 2007, #75 of 5866 bottles produced. Tasted at my cellar temperature 10 degrees Celsius in a glass of Dominus Vobiscum Grande Reserve. Clear golden yellow in appearance with micro bubbles in suspension and very liqueur-like in appearance because the imprint of the movement of my glass leaves a beautiful trace still visible. Complex aroma of candied and exotic fruits: apple, pear, orange and passion fruit with a slight smell of ginger. Very classy in the mouth! We can taste ginger, cooked apple, caramel, cane sugar and salt and yes salt. A pleasure with each sip: roundness, thickness, well-hidden alcohol, oiliness and above all finesse. The salty comes back again and is very special when warming up, I have the impression of eating an apple pie. I also taste the cinnamon and more salt. Wow, for the first time I can allow myself to say that I am experiencing a moment of fullness with a cider. A purchase that I will make every year to let age in my cellar for a good 10 years. Once again, I am very surprised, an intriguing and stimulating taste, candy. Be careful, do not share.......... It is always possible to do better but how, the only way to know is to give this little baby a few years of rest in the shade.

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"375ml split on Valentines Day. I’m not as crazy about this as I have been with past samples. Perhaps it’s now that I have so much of it, or that I’m drinking so much more. The sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a while, and the alcohol presence is strong. It is still delicious, with a supernaturally thick body, delicious apple and grape sugar. There is a touch of acidity early in the sip, with a bit of cookie and cake later. Apples taste is very young, green, not the old, rich apple I’ve noticed in Neige and other frozen-juice ice ciders. I couldn’t possibly deny the greatness of this beverage, but truth to be told, it’s not one meant for even moderately large quantities of drinking.",0.0

A thick, oily body glides over the tongue, effortlessly delivering the sweet apple goodness to each and every corner of the mouth.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Thanks to the Birthday Boy, Craig ""Swiftkey did it"" Garvie - 2008 Vintage

Opaquest dark brown, a total black hole swirl of a tan head. Rich sugary dusting. Dark smooshed figs, toasted coconut and isolated grab of raisins as it warmed and a welcoming porty porter core. Initial taste is a proper shotgun burning raidance of Meaty, juicy darkest malts - treacly charred sweetness seeping through. Vanilla pod crackles. Soily/dusty coffee dryness. Stabbing richness towards the finish, speckled fizzing out heat on the finish. A lot more layered and flavorsome than a Dark Lord, although a little more chewy meaty and leap at the finish - it’s up there and it’s mysticality will only increase each year this isn’t made.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 Kaggen enjoyed at Akkurat

A: Deep black body with a smallish khaki head of tight bubbles.  Receded over a minute or two leaving behind some whispy lacing.

S: Delicate milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and some oak.  The bourbon barrel aging is undeniable but it is quite restrained and silky.

T: Like the nose, the bourbon barrel aging is graceful.  That said, its subtleties are somewhat lost in its meekness.  I prefer barrel aged stouts that are a bit more potent, but refrain from burning your throat off.  Milk chocolate, oak, vanilla, and bourbon are all here.  Surprising, not as much roasted malt as I was expecting.

M: The mouthfeel is the standout element of this beer for sure.  Nice and thick, with a luscious, velvety feel as the beer coats the tongue.  No burn with just the slightest hints of the 10% ABV.  

O: Quite nice.  I think just about anyone can appreciate the quality here, but its just not quite the bourbon barrel RIS that I absolutely crave.",0.0

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Some kind of celebration punching my 4K rating at RateBeer. I’m not really that concerned with numbers but sometimes it could be fun to do something extra about millstones anyway. The truth is I’m such a lacy rater so barely 50 % of my notes end up here. The big advance of this is the fact that it’s quite easy to grab something interesting from my notes and make it my “celebration”. So what could be more appropriate than world greatest Imperial Stout. I’m lucky to have sampled this by several occasions, but this 2007 vintage where pulled out of my cellar late one evening after a great beer tasting session. Everyone had gone home and I just felt for splitting this bottle with my beer buddy Gunnfryd. The big question where if it still was able to kick balls after a set of other superb ales (lots of good memories from those days my buddies cared to bring fine beers at our beer evenings). Back to the beer. Pours pitch black with a small but nice, dense brown head. Body feels thick and heavy with a appropriate moderate level of carbonation. A sight for sore eyes. Strong aroma of everything dark, like dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate with leather, wood and smooth, refined alcohol.

The aroma was dominated of chocolate with sidenotes of tobacco together with some oak. The taste is warm, round and sweet. Its not very heavy compared to other stouts like this. Lots of spice, chocolate and the wooden notes. Ver nice and very balanced but not as complex as i thought it would be.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"I have to keep my benefactor under wraps, per their request, but suffice to say it’s a them and I thank them profusely and promise to show my thanks very soon. This bottle is a 2006 vintage. 

The aroma is beef bouillon, soy, dark chocolate, burnt and roasted malts and marshmallows with faint porto notes. The beer pours a gloppy black and settles with a thinnish mocha head, but initially the head is finger thickness and creamy looking. 

The first sip is fairly boozy and the barrel aging is immediate and unmistakeable imparting vanilla, pineapple and coconut notes. I also get some nutty Maderia notes and gobs of dark chocolate. Fairly hot on the swallow with a cream and chocolate chaser. It almost tastes like a dark chocolate liqueur. The finish makes me think of a vanilla liqueur with faint nutty and chocolate notes that invoke german chocolate cake. A very enjoyable beer that is definitely not a product of hype or hysteria.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"275ml bottle (Porvoo Harvest/Dark Beer Festival 2007) 2006 vintage (8:5:8:4:16=4.1)
Jet black, espresso head. Toffee liquorice vanilla aroma soft but very powerful. Mocca and whisky taste - again very powerful, but quite mellow. Whisky definitely dominates, quite alcoholic. Excellent sipping beer, not for glugging, that’s for sure. Looks like it’s been made to taste of whisky rather than to taste of wood that’s been steeped in whisky, or even to simply age itself. In retrospect, this isn’t vastly superior to any of the other whisky-laced beers, but as my first in the style I was very impressed by it.

Rerate: 250ml bottle - Thanks Jesper! (8:4:8-:4:15=3.9-)

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Rating 500. Version 2009. Tasted 14 oct. 2010. At first, till some weeks ago, I was thinking Närke probably should be overrated. Cause of the low brewingcapacity, and the very hard to get beers, this beers just had to get an higher rating then they deserve… Ok the beers should be good, but that good like described? Then, soms weeks ago, I had the chance to taste some beers of this brewer (thanks to Brouwerij De Molen, with the beerfestival!). And I took the chance to taste 3 beers of this brewer, that are not at the top of the ratebeer-rating, but decent. And damn, they are very good, maybe even great. So I got myself also Stormaktsporter and Kaggen Stormaktsporter at 25cl bottles. And now is the time to rate this 2 beers next to eachother (lucky me). So my 499th rating is the Närke Stormaktsporter 2008, my 500th rating is the Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter 2009. And here we go my 500th rating: Pours out a bit darker then the non-kaggen version? Really pitch black. A small head, brownish, won’t holds that good as the normal version. Smell is diferent, more sourness comes up, and something for sure different, the bourbon? Coffee, fruits, something pleasant (bourbon?), wood, chocolate. Very nice smell for sure, also the vanilla seems to come trought a bit more... Taste is different for sure also. Ofcourse the taste is roastiness, coffee, chocolate,… but some more liquorish for sure, more alcohol, and the bourbon comes up with a kick. The sweetness goes at this one more to some sourness. The mouthfeel is pleasant, about the same, oily like i like it. The taste is maybe just a bit to sharp for me at the start. Maybe I’m weird, but I like the normal version just a bit more, It seems more balanced then this one, but that’s maybe cause this one is younger, and after some aging the sharp start will be softened. A very good brew for sure, and wanna try this again in some time, with an aged bottle. But till then: overrated? NO! Best beer? no... Top-beer? For sure! Very decent imperial stout for sure, well done Närke! Maybe I had to wait a bit longer to open this bottle, or the other version, as my 550th rating or so, but now it’s more easy to compare them. Edit: retasted to celibrate something special. 2009 version on 12/09/2014. Almost like i remembered this beer. The honey seems faded away some, but while warming up it’s still there. Ages good (5 year old bottle), but expected a more different taste as fresh.",0.0

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Alright, I had the chance to get a sample of that (2005)  in Copenhagen, then I tried the new 2007 version at Oliver twist a few weeks later and retried, some days after, the 2005 thanks to my very generous Göteborg hosts: Marsiblursi. First off, the regular Stormaktsporter is an excellent imperial stout and rather tough to beat in complexity. I don’t quite understand the purpose of setting it in a barrel. It is apparently a rather short journey that it takes (2,5months), yet the effect is considerable as bourbon is obvious in the nose, but the low duration has allowed the body to keep most of its thickness, silkiness and richness. 
 So what do I think about it? Well, first off, I prefered the 2005 version which is 1% lighter and more developped and rounded around the edges at this point. The 2007 is still a fair bit boozy. The 2005’s complexity is more obvious and the concentrated fruitiness from the regular comes across more naturally. Appearance-wise, they both wear a fair diminishing dark beige head. Totally opaque, oily body, pitch black. The 2007 actually left legs on the glass. Gentle alcohol flavours, rum-soaked grapes, heady nose with wild leather smokiness, mint, vanilla (strong), chocolate roastiness and hard to pick up single fruits. Complex nuances, age-worthy, silky full body with honeyed and brown sugar tones. Very creamy, smooth carbonation. it manages to feel quite vinous at the same time, full on truffles, earth mushrooms powderiness and growing date square undertones. You can eventually all kinds of little nuances, which is the sign of a great beer. Still, at the end, I’m not convinced I prefer the barrel version and remain unconvinced that the rarity does not make me try harder to pick out stuff. Certainly a fine experience though. I’ll just give both Stormakts the same score.. but it is a sipper and I’m less into those that I once was.",0.0
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2005 bottle - June ’07 - purchased at Akkurat, Stockholm - $40.  

First off, I thought this really lived up to the hype.  It was flat out unbelievable - right in between the imperial stouts that need to be a bit bigger and those that go overboard...no matter how hard I tried to find something I didn’t like about it, I simply couldn’t - it was the definition of balanced.  Each sip was proceeded by a heart-felt ""WOW!"".  Every part of this brew was so insanely complex.  The aroma wrapped up vanilla, oak, dark chocolate malts, espresso, licorice, dark fruits, etc - I smelled it for who knows how long.  Flavor was exquisite - wrapping all those smells into a perfectly chewy and smooth palate.  Talk about wanting to lick your gums and lips.  The finish was balanced between sweet and bitter - the slight alcohol burn warmed but nowhere near overpowered anything.  Will I get my taste buds on this one again?  Let’s hope so.  Ya, I liked it that much.  Simply divine in every right a beer can be....",0.0

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the ""best beers of the world"" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny.",0.0

Interesting to note that a sample pour from the same bottle into an identical vessel did not have any head at all; no idea why. Aroma is prominent molasses and caramel with more subtle notes of vanilla, coconut, and very light ash.  Maybe a touch of chocolate dipped orange peel as well.  Flavor has a full vanilla and caramel burst up-front with a similar finish to the regular; toffee, roasted malt, and light fruit.  However, the finish in the Kaggen! is a bit softer, rounder, and more pleasing to me.

Aroma has roasted malt, chocolate, oak and lots of vanilla typical to bourbon aged IS. The bourbon comes a bit too much through here. Very smooth and thick palate like the basic stormakts has. Flavour is rich and very complec with bourbon, honey, vanilla and chocolate. At the end of the glass the bourbon has covered my whole mouth and the thick palate has become really sticky. 25 cl of this is really enough. Kind of reminds me of Goose Island Bourbon County, but this is slightly better. Worse than the non-Kaggen version though.

A - Pours black, tan head, a bit of retention and a hint of lacing.

T - Even better then the nose. Lots of honey up front, some chocolate, oak, dark fruits. Lots of stuff to pick out here and like the nose, very complex.

D - We split this bottle several ways, but I could have easily drank the entire thing (if I were being greedy). It was very special to have the 2005 version, which already has 5+ years on it.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/30/2011.  Poured from a 8 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. 2008 vintage. 

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter has a typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace. 

The aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose.

The flavor is pretty much exactly what I want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. Smooth, sweet bourbon comes in first and slowly lets in the fig, raisin, cherry, and roasted malt blend beautifully together. Some dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, and light espresso notes are in the background. The finish has a bit more bourbon and finishes fairly clean.

The carbonation is smooth, with just enough crispness to excite the tongue along with the bourbon. The body is on the fuller side of medium and consistent all the way through. Slightly sticky on the lips.

Clearly, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. No individual flavor really stands out, but the flavors in concert work so well together.",0.0

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle with a huge thanks to Marsiblursi! this comes from memory from earlier today as it was drank on the way to go pike fishing....Pours a deep rich brown with a decent tan head that holds well to the glass. The aroma is fantastic of dark fruit, some coffee, dark chocolate, some peat, and some alcohol. The taste is absolutely wonderful of the above smells, with some brown sugary sticky goodness on the palate. The alcohol is by no means over powering, but is enough to let you know its there. finish and mouthfeel is creamy smooth with a light lactose presence.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Re-rate bottled at Akkurat and at SMÖF.  The flavours are now more mature and balanced. The silkyness of teh regular Stormaktsporter now combines well with all the attractive barrel induced flavours.  It has grown one step further on bottles.


[Draught at Oliver Twist, Stockholm]  Intransparently black, small pale brown head. Rich aroma of licorice and wood. Sweet with full body and concentrated flavour of coffee, tar, oak and whiskey. Salty finish with vanilla and chocolate as well as a fair amount of bitterness. The barrel character does not overpower the other flavours, making it more balanced than many other barrel aged beers.",0.0

Much the same flavours as the aroma, just even better. Feel is really oily! Feels like an expensive wine experience. Finish has surprisingly much bitterness.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"250 ml bottle from a trade, vintage 2016.
Black body, with a small, creamy, dark beige head. 
Beautiful aroma of honey, dark chocolate, bourbon, moderate coffee, some tobacco, slight toffee, slight wood. 
Tastes quite similar, with less honey, more cocoa powder, slight soy sauce.
Medium, oily mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. Finishes smooth, moderate roasty, moderate sweet, a bit dry, with tobacco, cocoa powder, moderate bourbon, some coffee, some honey, 

Delicious! I really love the nose, the honey adds a very smooth, unique layer. Greatly balanced in the taste, just enough roastiness and sweetness, with the bourbon barrel perfectly integrated, very smooth for the ABV. Not my very favourite style example, while I enjoyed this a lot and I can see why this was so special back then. Score: 9 / 4 / 8 / 5 / 17",0.0

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Royal Park Beer Festival. 2006 vintage. The emperor has no clothes? I’m not sure, he’s definitely not as well-dressed as he thinks, IMO. The aroma just screams coconut, to the point of not much else getting through. So bourbony - it’s completely dominant. Piney, minty American hops mixed with coffee and chocolate in the US stout style underneath. Bourbon doesn’t affect the flavour nearly as much - no noticeable saltiness or booziness, which I appreciate, but I didn’t detect any oak character either. The barrel-aging doesn’t seem to have added much besides the rampant bourbon aroma, it’s more like an imperial stout with a shot of bourbon. And the thing is it just doesn’t taste like good bourbon either, it really reminded me of white label Jim Beam. I dunno. I mean, it’s quite a nice beer, but obviously you’re gonna have high expectations with a beer like this. If this is what barrel-aged imperial stouts are all about then I’ll just stick with the plain ones I think.",0.0

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 Bottle at Akkurat, split with a friend.  I can’t find my notes for this, or the other bottles we had at Akkurat.  So everything here is from a foggy memory on a day where I hadn’t slept in like 36 hours and was pretty much walking around in a daze.  Pour was black with maybe some brownish edges.  Nose was pretty wonderful, some elegant bourbon, oak, plethora of dark fruits, roasted malts, almost smoky.  Sweet and amazingly complex flavors swirling around.  Sweet malts, sweet honey, dark fruits, some spicy oak and bourbon, smoky, roasted malts.  Really surprised at the smoke element in this.  As it keeps breathing and warms some breathtaking nuances take shape, I think the honey became more pronounced.  It should not be served cold.  This was super complex and a delight to drink.",0.0

The 2007 Kaggen was my favorite of the bunch, it was a bit better rounded than the 2008.  
 

Pours very deep brown, nearly opaque, capped with a thin brown head. Beautiful lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, oak and perhaps a bit of honey. Flavor begins with roasted chocolate malt, coffee, licorice, and molasses, with oak and charcoal in the background. Hop bitterness builds a bit towards the finish, and remain on the palate along with dark chocolate. Some alcohol in the finish as well. The body is a bit thinner than I expected.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Bottle from a trade with Matt. Pours black with a dark brown lacing. Aroma of CINNAAAMOON, cinnamon rolls, dark ripe fruits, some spice (from the chili i guess), cocoa powder, brown sugar, cookie dough, some barrel character, vanilla and some weak coconut as it warms - but the main thing is really cinnamon rolls all over the place. This beer gotta be kidding me. The taste is just freakingly slick chocolate, raw cocoa, vanilla, chili, cinnamon rolls, dark fruits, nougat and a lot of wooden whiskey barrel character. I think the barrel and the chili saves this beer from being cloying. The end of this beer is just crazy good just covering your mouth with melted chocolate haha!

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"BBT3 tasting. Poured a black color with an off white head. Did not know what to expect going into this one as chilies and cinnamon are kind of a turn off for me.

The pour is a lighter black with a thin ring of dark tan head and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is pretty good. There is a strong spiciness from the chilies and cinnamon, but the chocolate really mutes it. The barrel offers a further balance and a hint of vanilla. The light woodiness really adds a touch of sweetness that I like. The flavor is just as good. The complexity and depth really stand out. Chilies, cinnamon, chocolate, light vanilla, whiskey sweetness, and a light woodiness. This is just so complex and lovely. The mouth feel is light and not as viscous as I’d want. The carbonation is on point, and the aftertaste is lingeringly sweet whiskey and spicy chocolate. It’s really good. Damn.",0.0

Nothing is jumping out and dominating the palate, but each ingredient makes it;s presence known. Nice cocoa and vanilla sweetness that cuts the pepper heat and barrel character nicely. Just wishing it was a bit more ""bold"" in terms of body and character. Typical gluttonous expectations. Finishes a bit ""hot"", but fairly balanced.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"750ml (thx, Brent D.!) @ Ryan's. Vintage 2022.
Appearance: pours like oil, very dark brown with a weak dark beige head.
Aroma: cinnamon, chillies, some black currant notes coming from cinnamon probably, lots of whiskeys barrel.
Taste: very thick, lots of barrels, very complex cinnamon. When it's warming up you can find nice black chocolate notes. I couldn't really find any vanilla.
Overall: for sure - this is a nicely done imperial stout, but you can't really find much over the cinnamon and chillies here. Not that they are overpowering here, no, they are nicely balanced, but the rest is quite weak. Some black chocolate here, yes, for sure, but no vanilla here for me.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,This stuff smells great but is ultimately a one trick pony. It smells and tastes like Mexican hot chocolate with a shot of whiskey in it. It is black w/ only a small head of brown foam. I get a bunch of cinnamon and vanilla and all kinds of good stuff in the nose and can say it smells legitimately delicious but tasting it is when it sort of goes awry. It is heavy and sweet and the spices and booze overwhelm any real malt character. It has very little carbonation which increases the ponderous heavy feeling of it and overall it feels more like some sort of spicy version of Kahlua than a good beer to me.,0.0

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Thanks to Matt and Kevin, shared with my family on Christmas Eve.

Pours a viscous black color, with a small, fluffy, dark brown head, leaving back a perfect, thin lacing at the side of the glass.

Smells of sweetened cinnamon on top of earthy malts, bakers chocolate and a gentle amount of coffee. The Bourbon qualities aren’t too present on their own, but blend very well into the chili spices, adding heat and wood to the nose. Notes of molasses provide a sweetness to the brew, which gets supported by the omnipresent cinnamon spiciness outstandingly well. 

Begins with rich cinnamon flavors straight from the beginning, while earthy, toasted malts, as well as slightly bitter coffee build the foundation of this beer. The cinnamon gets a bit sticky and dusty, while it turns pretty intense on the palate, with molasses and toffee adding a lot of sweetness to its dominant spiciness. The Bourbon barrel, mirroring the nose, doesn’t turn very present on its own, while it interacts perfectly well with the chilies, leaving the spicy cinnamon with an interesting, hot and complex touch on the palate. The sweetness gets balanced by a wooden Bourbon bite, which got a semi dry, bitter aspect to it, highlighting the earthy malts. 

Finishes with a sublte, spicy burn, while coffee becomes more present, still with a slick sweetness detectable, which is now calmed by the wooden maltiness, while the Bourbon shines through in its wooden, vanilla qualities, with a peppery bite. Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, with a hot burn in the end. The beers body is incredible full and quite different to the normal version, while providing less coffee, way more cinnamon and the proper sweetness.",0.10314212462587938

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Tria in Philadelphia, served in a 13 oz tulip glass. The beer poured a vibrant copper color, clear and with a thick off white head that disapated slowly and gave way to a nice ring around the end and a swirly island in the middle. The aroma was a strong pine and citrus nose that was similar to the Elder but kicked up a bit and more pure and extreme but enjoyable. The taste was very similar to the taste. There was the initial hoppy, piney taste with some citrus, grapefruit and a touch of sweet caramel. The mouth feel was very smooth with a nice alcohol burn on the way down that tells you this is a 11% beer. What a smooth ride the Younger was.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(Draft: O’Brien’s in San Diego, CA) Compared side-by-side with Pliny the Elder, and I think the young whippersnapper is schoolin’ the old man.  This is a very flavorful brew, big, very bitter, grapefruit-like citrus, but also quite fruity with an apparent sweet, orange citrus flavor.  Aromatic grapefruit/hoppy nose is bigger, sweeter, fruitier and more balanced than the Elder.  Thick, sticky, very sweet palate like a barleywine, but with a strong bitter bite to balance it out.  Dark golden in color and a bit hazy in appearance.  The occasional large carbonation bubble speeds to the surface.  The off-white head fades to an island of sheen.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On Tap @ Russian River
What a pleasant surprise! There wasn’t supposed to be any more of this until August. 1st day on tap @ the brewery. Better than I remember. Incredible, intense hop aroma, lots of pine note from the generous doses of Simcoe hops. I almost didn’t want to drink it it smelled so good!  Amber color, small whitish head. Intense complex hop flavors, (5 different hops) A veritable explosion of flavor. Hides the alcohol well. full bodied malt character. Great finish, wonderful hoppy aftertaste. All Hail Vinny!",0.0

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Nice golden color with an off-white head that retains well and leaves a decent lacing. Absolutely mind blowing aroma. Full of citrus; grapefruit and pine and other aromas I can’t hardly begin to describe are not only blended perfectly, but are powerful enough to greet your tongue from a foot away. Amazing taste of aforementioned aromas with a strong, yet amazing bitterness. The bitterness seemed like it came in waves; extremely bitter, but only pleasant bitterness, not harsh at all. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a dry finish, leaving you wanting more and more once the explosion of taste leaves your mouth. I would drink the hell out of this if given the opportunity.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"True to the hop-forward roots of California, this one lives up to my expectations of what a ""triple IPA"" should be.  It had the big hop citrus-grapefruit kick at first with a nice and bubbly palate feel as it swirls around on the tastebuds, and finishes off with some smooth maltiness.  Sometimes the supposed double or imperial IPAs are imbalanced with lots of hops along with an ugly, synthetic side, as if it’s the cost of brewing extremes.  Not this one though.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"The beer pours a medium orange that is surprinsingly clear. The head rises about 3 fingers but falls quickly to a soapy cover. The lacing is light.

The aroma is much lighter than I had anticipated. The aroma is some hops mixed with a little pine and a bit of soap. 

The taste is also pretty light, much lighter than I thought it would be. It starts off a little sweet then goes to a full bitterness throughout. When you start out its a little bitter, but as your drink it, it becomes very drinkable.

The feel is medium in body, a semi dry feel, and a very lasting flavor.

The drinkablility is very high. You can’t notice the 11abv but its highly drinkablility. 

Overall, this beer is really really good. Its smooth, drinkable, and a nice expenience. Its not overally hoppy which is nice. Is it the number 1 beer in the world, no? Is it the best ipa in the world, no? Is it a top 50 beer for me, yeah, its that good.",0.0

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Served on tap at Russian River Brew Pub, Santa Rosa, California Thursday night.  It glows a beautiful, deep, clear, orange color and produces no head, just a thin, white ring around its surface.  I usually like seeing more of a head on this style of beer, but there was something so enticing about its stunning, solid color.  Swirling the glass would immediately bring a white film to the surface, and it would dissipate just as fast as it had appeared.  The aroma is an amazing blast of pine and fresh orange peel ... though not as overpowering as I had anticipated (feared) it would be having never had a triple IPA until now.  On the palate it was full bodied, very slightly sticky, and it’s carbonation danced perfectly in my mouth.  The taste sealed it with a perfect bitter.  This is an intense beer that makes so many bold statements, and yet remains incredibly well balanced and so easy to drink.  I’ve been a fan of Pliny the Elder for years now, but it’s ultimately the impeccable balance of the Younger, and that equally amazing color that’s sets it apart.  It’s nothing short of a brewer’s masterpiece.",0.0

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Served on-tap at Monk’s on Russian River Monday. Finally captured the dragon.

A - Pours clear golden orange with a fluffy one finger tall white head leaving thin sheets of lace down the glass. A very nice looking beer.

S - Smells of fresh cut grapefruits, apricots, pine needles, pungent citric hops and a touch of sweetness creeping in as it warms up. The balance of aromas is very well maintained throughout.

T - Starts off with a ton of tropical fruits - mostly grapefruits, mangos and pineapples - quickly giving way to a mix of strong, bitter citric hops, fresh cut pine and a bit of sweet malt. The balance of this beer is amazing for how big it really is. Finish has plenty of lingering bitterness, clinging to the pallet long after the finish.

M - Medium-Light body with a well balanced flavor and moderate carbonation. Bitterness is surprisingly mild, lingering on the pallet for quite awhile.

Overall
It is said that this was a QDH TIPA. There were signs which suggested that this beer was a hugely improved version of DDH PTE - sweetness, floral, corn, ripe fruits, refreshing bitterness, etc. The improvement is mainly about the mouthfeel - such thick and creamy, without any peppery pungency. This beer is extremely easy drinking and enjoyable, especially for sweet enthusiasts.  A redefinition of West Coast IPA!
据说这是款四倍干投的三倍IPA。有一些迹象表明这款酒是DDH PTE的魔改版——可以感受到甜度、花香、玉米味、成熟的果味还有清爽的苦度等一脉相承的特征。改进之处主要在于口感，如此的厚重而又细腻，没有丝毫的椒麻感。这款酒极其的易饮且愉悦，尤其是对于甜渣党而言。它重新定义了西海岸IPA！

Best Triple IPA in the world according to Untappd: 4.66

Alcohol: 10.25% by volume

IBU: 90

Canning date: 03.02.2021

The most sought-after IPA in the world. Referred to as Double IPA by RateBeer. Referred to as Triple IPA by Untappd. 
First released in 2005!
Until last year, the beer was available only on tap at the brewery in Santa Rosa, one day a year, in February. Long lines of beer geeks waited for hours to try this masterpiece. Last year and this year, the owners of the brewery, married couple Natalie and Vinnie Cilurzo, decided to bottle Pliny. 
In 2021, a new hop - Elixir - joined the wide range of hops. 

Pliny the Younger is poured with a white, fluffy as snow foam, which slowly slides down, leaving a moderate amount of discs. 
The color is golden, clean, clear. 
After removing the branded cap, you can feel the strength and intensity of the hops. It smells phenomenal - resin, pine needles, forest, an avalanche of citrus fruits, of which oranges and tangerines are the most noticeable. Pleasant maltiness, followed by minimal floral notes. After warming in the hands, even more resinous details. 
The taste bursts with intensity, and at the same time surprises with the lightness and smoothness of the experience. 
Intensely coniferous, forest with elements of pine needles. The power of citrus: tangerines, grapefruits, oranges sealed with elements of pineapple. Specific bitterness, but not overwhelming in any way.
A masterful balance. Powerful and compact body. Sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet, sometimes citrusy, sometimes floral, sometimes resinous. All combined into an unforgettable image.

A perfect, unforgettable experience.

Overall, a really nice triple IPA. I forgot how good it is. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer isn’t too sweet. Lots of hop character.",0.040032038451271776
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler in trade from madorb.  Thanks!  Pours a clear amber color with a lasting beige head.  Smell is big piney hops and some fruitiness.  Taste is quite hoppy and bitter with fruity orange and grapefruit along with pine.  Touch more hoppy and bitter than Pliny the Elder, but not any better and less drinkable.  Medium body and carbonation.  Certainly great, but definitely not my favorite DIPA.  Flavor wasn’t quite as good as PTE, and I’m glad that the other one is readily available rather than this.",0.0
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Handbottle. Aroma of peach, pineapple, grass, mango, generally tropical, pine kicks in as it warms, and always sweet malt there too, seemingly also throwing in some similarly citrusy esters, but really, it’s hard for me to say what notes are the hops versus the esters here. Big, in any case. Flavor resinous, extremely bitter, despite the huge malt that tries so hard to balance it out. I must say it’s a bit on the hot side, but there’s so much else here that I’m more noting than complaining. Though based on this handbottle sample I’d say I prefer the Elder, who really cares with a 4.3 score.",0.0
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"growler brought forth by the illustrious sparky27...


golden amber pour with a soapy white head and an abundance of spotty lacing. 

it smells fan-fukking-tastic!!! bitter pine, orange pith, grapefruit and flowers mix with honey, caramel and malt. alcohol plays a role as it warms up a bit. seriously the best thing i’ve ever smelled in a glass!

the flavor... well, it cannot live up to the aroma... it is on the sweet side with a medium to full body  thinned with alcohol, bitter and resin to make it exceedingly easy to keep drinking (and getting terribly d-runk!). delicious. 10/4/8/5/17/4.4",0.0
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at the Falling Rock in Denver and out of a kick ass growler thanks to Bill. Both times the experience was the same. Pours a crystal clear, golden body with a creamy, finger-width, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a veil of lacing throughout the session. The aroma is incredible. Tons of fresh, dank, oily hops. Resiny pines, sweet citrus, passion fruit, mango, florals, dense earth, herbs, and melons with a touch of caramel. A fantastic aroma. Flavor is a hop explosion as well and fairly sweet. Tons of bright, piney, grassy citruses, wet and dank earth, flowery tropical fruits, resins, a touch of honey, and a decent amount of caramel. Finishes dry and bitter with a very lengthy, oily, and resiny aftertaste. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Not a bad balance at all for such an explosion of hops and no hint of alcohol until a slight warmth shows up in the throat. Overall, this definitely lives up to the hype. Hoppy as shit with an outstanding aroma. A pleasure both from the tap and the growler. Awesome DIPA.",0.049507377148833714

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Russian style Imperial Stout ... WAAAAHHUUUUU. It is wild. Looks like tar when it slowly seeps out of the bottle. Oil black and fat with almost no foam and virtually no carbonation. Nose of licorice, coffee and cherries. The taste is an explosion of spice, anise, coffee, earth and overripe forest fruit. Sweet, but with just the right amount of bitterness for balance. 

Brewed in 2007 and holds exactly 15%. WILD (and slightly weird) beer. KING

The barrels don’t destroy the base Dark Lord at all, but rather build and re-direct this into a new beast. A special treat this is. Great beer.

Oak and vanilla are delicious but the soy sauce is a touch off putting. The mouth feel is thick and viscous with a heavy soft carbonation. The soy sauce dominates.

One of the better barrel beers that I’ve had. I don’t give out perfect scores, and the only detractor was that a small fleeting head would have fit the style better. Undoubtedly this was from the re-bottle so figure my appearance score upwards in your head if you choose to.
Black, oily and coating the glass as it’s swirled.
Rich alcoholic yet restrained bourbon aroma. Notes of licorice and raisins come easily. This is one that can be enjoyed for the aroma alone. I don’t like bourbon, but there is plenty of good Imperial Stout aroma so that the bourbon doesn’t take this one over.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle shared at RBAG Summer Session 2012. Thanks for the effort to get this Savvy - and for sharing!!

The chocolate and bourbon finished quite well together. It was exceptionally smooth, perfect in body. This beer was fantastic.",0.0
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Hand bottle from Mr Facto (kidding).  The aroma was a bunch of oak and bourbon, smoke, and dark dried fruits.  I Think the oak was the big player for most of the beer, until it had warmed enough.  This it had tons of bourbon.  Very syrupy an oily looking.  Pitch black with a rich brown head.  Coat the plastic cup it was served in nicely.  Very well balanced.  Everything blended quite nice.  True to the original.  Oak and vanilla.  Roast and dark fruit flavors.  Very rich, lush, and slick over the tongue.  Long finish.  Top notch.",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle 656/688

Black pour with a thin light brown collar. Thick oily residue left in the glass. Very thick ABV legs

Nose is dark fruits, vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel,coconut, and subtle soy sauce. Some alcohol but well subdued. Fruits really stand out well.

Might as well just copy and paste the above remarks. Barrel really shines in this beer and hides what makes Dark Lord a meh beer. Dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, caramel and other fun notes. 

Thick and coating. Low carbonation, big body, well balanced. ABV is there but it is later that it catches up to me. 

Bad ass beer. One of the best bourbon treatments I have had.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Served on-tap @ the Dark Lord Release Party.

Pours a thick, syrupy black..the head is modest and a dark caramel color. Aroma is heavy coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate, with some alcohol creeping out as well. There’s definitely an oaky, bourbon kick to it, but the bitter chocolate and roasted coffee flavors still take the stage similar to the bottled Dark Lord. Amazingly balanced between the bold hop character and the array of tastes..just fantastic. Mouthfeel is expectedly thick, and very coating..yet smooth as velvet. Remains remarkably easy to drink for a beer of this magnitude.

Felt privileged to try this one.",0.0
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thanks to Facto for this bottle. Pours dark brown/black, with a very small tan head. Aromas are bourbon, chocloate, dark fruit, and roasted malt. Flavors are bourbon, oak, dark fruit, chocolate, malt, and coffee, with a little bitterness. Carbonation is a low. This is a top notch beer, but a bit too much bourbon takes away some of the ’normal’ Dark Lord flavors that make it great.",0.0
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"A: The pour is viscous and black with just a bit of tan foam around the edge of the glass.

S: A definite oak and bourbon presence to the nose without the intense sweetness Dark Lord usually has. Certainly some sweet chocolate and vanilla with a bit of dark fruits.

T: The oak aging gives this one a bit of a tannic character and some bitterness that the original does not exhibit. The bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors are quite strong but still allow the chocolate, roast, licorice, and dark fruits to show.

M: The body is thick and chewy with a low, smooth carbonation.

D: I like this one much better than Dark Lord. The oak aging here has helped to balance the beer out and mitigate the overwhelming sweetness.",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"I was a bit dissapointed by the choice of plastic cups for this beer, and at $6 for a 5 ounce pour I wasn’t too excited. That’s neither here-nore-there and has no bearing on the wonderful taste that gripped my tounge. My little plastic cup was filled to the brim with a viscous black liquid that had a thin dark brown fluffy head on top. The aroma on this filled my nose with deep oak and burbon notes, some hints of chocolate and an ever so slight hint of cherries. Dark almost roast like flavour with a bit more chcolate and heavy notes of burbon soaked wood. I detected some coffee in there, maybe a bit of vanilla as well. Having the privledge of trying this next to ’04, ’05, ’06, I can’t say i liked it as well as the ’04. it did add a lot of wonderful notes and gave it a great character with tons of complexity.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap at DLD ’08. Nearly black with a smallish head. The aroma is pretty darn close to the oak, in fact it was hard to tell them apart, but this one had a little more vanilla. Smells good, really good. The body was thick as all get out, it was tempered a bit by the oak, but the vanilla actually blew the pretense that this is anything close to a balanced beer. The vanilla reminded me of the woeful lack of attenuation and this beer was a sticky sweet mess that I could hardly drink. The flavor was vanilla dominated and it accentuated the high residual sugars, there was the rest of the typical DL flavors, but the vanilla was the straw that broke the camels back. Thankfully for several people sitting by me, I could not drink more than a few sips of this before I sat it down and went to something else.",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"2013 Vintage, bottle 428/711

Split with my friend Keith who attended DLD with me this year. Served in a FFF mini-snifter. Reviewed from notes. 

A- Upon pouring, a mocha head quickly appears and dies down within 30 seconds, leaving a ring of foam around the rim of the glass. The color is opaque black, thick like motor oil. 

S- The first thing I can smell is a very strong bourbon barrel presence, but it is quickly joined by vanilla, coffee, and a sweet molasses like aroma. Excellent aroma, it definitely invites you to take a drink.

T- I don’t think it would be possible to use any more descriptors for this beer. Black cherries, prunes, vanilla, followed by some tobacco and caramel with bourbon strong on the finish. There is a lingering sweetness that is very familiar from regular dark lord on the back end, and surprisingly little to no alcohol bite, even with the bourbon flavor being so apparent. There is no detectable hop bitterness. 

M- Silky smooth, yet very thick at the same time. This is definitely a sipper, but it is very easy to drink. Low-medium carbonation is right on for the style. The flavors linger and change over the incredibly long finish, definitely over a minute later I can still taste the beer. 

O- This is a very enjoyable, incredibly complex beer. I’m glad I hadn’t drank anything before this, because it was such a pleasure to really get into this beer and enjoy the full range of flavors you can get from it. The bourbon is there on the nose and finish, but the vanilla really outshines it, at least in my opinion. I’m sure that will die down with time, although I think this is simply amazing as it is right now. It was an honor to drink this beer, so very glad I was able to score one this year!",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Draft sample at Dark Lord Day 2010.  I was crestfallen a little earlier when I had heard that the Vanilla Dark Lord was gone; my only goal of the day besides getting my bottles and having fun with my pals was to try this.  Then someone nearby pointed out a guy who had a little bit left.  It was good timing because I had my Kate the Great bottle cracked open to share, so I ran over and bullied the guy into trading a pour for a pour.  He instead gave me what was left in the glass (maybe 2-3 ounces) and said he couldn’t finish it and didn’t care for any KTG.  Fine by me!  Granted, the bottom of his plastic cup sample wasn’t ideal, but still a fantastic beer emerged.  Dark, opaque brown, with remnants of a brown head.  Big vanilla notes on top of the Dark Lord’s coffee, milk and dark chocolate, dark fruits, earthy notes, and molasses.  I’m an absolute sucker for vanilla aromas but the flavor doesn’t always match the sweet goodness; this was the case here, though not by a ton.  Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a smooth, rich, sticky mouthfeel.  I thought the sweet vanilla detracted a little bit from the normal (and very sweet) Dark Lord, whereas the oak version adds a special element to it.  Don’t get me wrong, this is amazing and needs to be tried; it just doesn’t match the others. Re-Rate: Downgrading this a little bit after trying 347/934 of the 2012 series, the most sober I’ve been when I tried it. It had a very sweet candy note on the nose above vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Flavor of chocolate-covered cherries, vanilla, oak, caramel, and molasses. Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, smooth mouthfeel. Great, but not as good as I remembered.",0.03131121455425748
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Vintage 2013. Bottle 104 of 711. How lucky! Thanks to whom it may concern for the hospitality!! Beautiful dark color with its delicate foam collar. On the nose, a chocolate cake, marshmallows and vanilla from Madagascar. It’s really something! On the palate, a vanilla armada! Too bad this totalitarian sensation crushes all the other flavors. It lacks refinement… On the palate, a rather thick liquid that ends up sticking to the corners of my lips. On the finish, a roasted vanilla fondue like a big marshmallow taken out just in time from the flames of a campfire watered by a caramelized bourbon.",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Tasted at Dark Lord Day 2010, out of a wee plastic cup instead of the recommended snifter.  This was incredibly thick beer.  More like molasses or a milkshake than beer, really.  Without a doubt, the thickest brew I’ve ever tasted.  Get it yet?  It’s freakin’ THICK!

The nose was very nice.  The vanilla comes through, here, but it is well complemented by the roast and chocolate flavors, as well as a fair smack-in-the-face from the alcohol.

Flavor was huge and bold.  Perhaps too much so?  The vanilla is very big in the flavor, perhaps to a fault.  Not bad, of course.  Just too much vanilla, in my opinion.  Then again, I""m not the biggest vanilla fan.  On a positive note, the use of real vanilla bean, rather than an extract or something else, really does make a difference, as the quality of the vanilla is notable.

Overall, a very big, very good beer.  For those who enjoy vanilla more than I, this could very well be paradise.  For me, it was a nice new way to try the Dark Lord.",0.0
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Poured from bomber into a big ol' snifter. Thin head that dissipates quickly. A terrific aroma of bourbon, chocolate, coconut (I'm guessing from the vanilla but if came through as coconut), and some soy sauce. Mouthfeel is excellent. Beer is slightly syrupy but also has a pleasant thinness to it. Nice and oily. Flavor is very sweet. Bourbon barrel is supremely integrated and even throughout. Vanilla is more subtle than expected and only contributes on the back end. You really only notice it if you look for it, but when you find it, it's quite nice. This is a mature, sophisticated beer with many element expertly weaves together. However, the sweetness is just too much for me. Best to be had in small quantities.",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Shared bottle. Not much in a way of appearance - dark brown thick liquid with virtually no foam, something you would expect from such a big beer. Rich and complex aroma dominated by vanilla and bourbon over the black chocolate and coffee notes common to imperial stouts in general. Tastes as complex as it smells, with vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel and coffee nuances playing in tandem and changing one another with every moment passing since the first sip. A truly magnificent dessert beer that provokes deep introspection and will make you think about the meaning of life while trying to get to the end of the aftertaste.",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Bomber (many thanks, dustbunny, for opening this gem). A super-heavy dark chocolate tone dominates the aroma and is joined by sweet vanilla, boozy bourbon, cocoa buttercream frosting, a slight touch of phenols (wet campfire), and a balsamic whisper. Pours very dark brown with nearly no head. The taste is wonderfully smooth and layered, with rich vanilla, decedent chocolate, toffee, hot booze, caramel, and a slightly earthy bitterness. The flavors complement each other perfectly. Beyond smooth texture (almost slick); very hot and dry finish. A whale that exceeds the hype; I like it even better than the port barrel version, which recently wowed me.",0.06622661785325218

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"4/25/2009:  3F Three Floyds Vanilla Bean Barrel Aged Dark Lord is thick, sticky and black.  It just sticks to the plastic glass and has pretty much stained it!  This beer has a really sweet aroma with rich caramel maltiness underneath TONS of real vanilla.  The flavor is very much like the aroma.  It is very sweet with caramel, vanilla, and a pretty high level of alcohol and just a hint of bourbon.  It has a mellow and milky texture and goes down smooth, but sticks to everything else.  Overall, this beer is really, really good, but almost too sweet.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Huge thanks to Diego for scoring a very well-kept handbottle of this.

That out of the way, I’d like to say that I think this beer symbolizes a lot of what is wrong with certain elements of craft beer today.  It smells fucking divine, vanilla beans for miles and miles and some hot cocoa swirled in and a touch of bourbon.  But the taste is pure sugar, under-attenuated as all hell and almost impossible to keep down in more than the tiniest sips.  There’s extreme, and then there’s over-the-top, and VB DL strikes me as more of the latter.  I’m giving it a 3.0 because it would make a great candle wax or Febreeze.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"I got to taste a couple of sample pours while standing in line at DLD thanks to the friendly folks in Columbus who were able to get a couple of full cups out of the brewpub. Re-poured into a 4 ounce tasting glass.
Milky off black color. Beer still had a thin brown collar around the rim.
Tons of Vanilla, boozy alcohol and very sweet syrupy aromas. I took a couple of whiffs of this -- very pleasant on the nose. This tasted like a frozen ice cream drink with creme de cacao (such as a Brandy Alexander) that had melted. 
Very thick and rich, low carbonation. Mouthfeel was very much like melted milkshake -- certainly interesting but not what I want in a beer. Very chalky, chocolate finish. I realize drinkability is not the same as availability, but how drinkable can a beer be that’s only available at one place for about 45 minutes a year, and then only in 3 ounce pours? I consider this a gimmicky beer -- if it were more readily available it would be something you would want to try once, but then move on to something that taste more like beer than a vanilla milkshake.",0.0

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap at DLD ’09, served into a goblet.  Holy cow! This aroma is nothing short of heavenly.  Fresh vanilla galore, creamy ice cream, bourbon and roasted bourbon wood, malted cocoa, coffee beans, subtle citrus undertones.  I didn’t want to start drinking, it smelled so good.  Zero head from the pour.  Black.  A dark wood colored outer ring with some small stagnant carbonation bubbles.  As thick as it gets, and rather mysterious looking.  But really, upon sipping, how can a beer this big, be so smooth? A really unbelievable feel, super thick, leaving flavor everywhere.  Just great for sipping.  Aroma really did not lie about how this one would taste.  Quite similar actually, as the flavors feed off the aroma very well.  Vanilla syrup, roasted bourbon cream, the best black malts I’ve ever had, a thick woody bitter to back up the sweetness of minor 3fs herbal and citrus.  The hop backing fits in with everything so well, making this a very well balanced beer.  Other notes of warm cocoa and roasted black coffee.  Sweet till the end, but its never too much like it was last year, with just the perfect amount of vanilla.  A decent amount better than the other two versions, this was probably the best imperial stout I have ever had.  Wonderful!",0.08804509063256237

 I was going to describe all of the nuances of this beer, but I’ve decided that I’m too lazy right now.  I will just say that, this is my favorite bourbon barrel aged beer that I know to exist.

No lacing. Aroma is yeaty and full of chcolate and vanilla, some bread, cherries, and candy as well. Richness everywhere, in the aroma and taste. This one is creamy as creamy can be, just incredibly smooth...thick, but never TOO thick, a perfect mouthfeel.  Flavor is f’n delicious. Thick and chewey, with lots of roasted barley, vanilla, chocolate covered cherries, cocoa powder, oak, and yeast, also notes of coffee. Some dark fruit and syrup notes as well. Roasted malts make themselves known at times, but the vanilla and chocolate covered cherries pack the punch. Alcohol is present, but doesn’t feel like 14% whatsoever, but everything else is bold, yet smooth and totally drinkable. Flavors swirl in your mouth and are constantly changing, even the same mouthful will evolve before you swallow. The vanilla is always present, but only adds complexity and flavor, it never dominates.

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(bottle shared at the RBSG brunch) Pours jet black with a dark tan head that quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass. Aroma is very potent, and the maple syrup really dominates proceedings, and it serves to mask the coffee component underneath, which improves the beer as I can smell some vegetal snap pea and green bell scents emanating from the coffee undertone. With more air, some sweeter scents of Reese’s peanut butter cups, walnuts, and raisins make their presence known, which does improve things. The flavor also heavily emphasizes the maple syrup, and along with that is an abundant amount of chocolate, peanut butter cup, and roasted malt. Very sweet. The coffee again is pretty suppressed by the sweeter flavors but some ash and greenness is evident towards the finish, although it’s not nearly as glaring as it is in the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is appropriate.",0.0

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"12 oz bottle poured, foiled up and presented blind as a gift from Prufrockstar. Thanks! Don't know what this is, but I know it's delicious! A waxed bottle that basically took a chainsaw to get through. A dense coffee black pour with a thick, espresso brown foam head. First initial response is the maple content. Lots of it. And it's delicious. The ultimate breakfast brew here with a coffee and maple pairing. Really thick body. Thick milk chocolate, caramel, maple, and low bitter coffee follow up.

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Great Taste of the Midwest on August 08. The pour is a viscous and tar-like black with a thin dark brown head that settles to a small ring and offers some great staining on the glass. The aroma is all coffee up front and absolutely beautiful. There is a great complexity of maple, a little bit of green oak and vanilla. A fudgy chocolate backs everything up. It smells like a fudge. The taste is unbelievable. Heavy coffee, that unbelievable maple, a great chocolate, moderate vanilla, and a light bourbon presence. This baby tastes like a maple-soaked coffee fudge. My god. The mouth feel is unbelievable. It’s like chewing fudge. Thick, viscous, with a soft carbonation. This baby just coats the mouth and refuses to leave. The aftertaste is all maple.

There’s something additional here too, a doughy cookie batter chewiness, that sets it apart from other stouts that have those traditional coffee-milk-chocolate aspects.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Wow.  Rochefort 10 is an opaque walnut-colored beer with an elastic cappucino-colored head that leaves hearty lacing.  It is bright and fruity on the nose, with yellow apples, light sweet grass, cinnamon, raisin and wood.  It is soft and fluffy yet lively on the tounge.  It seems slightly acidic.  It is well-bittered and well-balanced.  The flavor is thick: chewy malt that hints at salty and even unami-- it spans the tounge.  World class!",0.0

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"What can be said about this beer that hasn’t been said a thousand times before? Well, not much. This is a fantastic beer and if one can wrap their brain (and tongue) around the complexities of this beer then you are surely that much further on your way to a better place. The aroma was multitudes of dark fruit and chocolate and toffee and brown sugar. The appearance was beautiful to look at as it was incredibly dark (stout like?) with little light passing thru but what did was a deep purlple, almost eggplant like purple to it. The taste is almost liquer like, with a sweetness to match the dark fruity-spicyness that is velvety soft on the tongue. Another beer that I’m happy to be able to purchase at any time, pretty much anywhere around I live.",0.0

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Take 2 Bottle from Tomlinsons, Inverness [300113]

 I return to this beer after another 1000 or so rates. I was worried I might not like it as much. No way - it’s still #1, but the Pannepot Grand Reserva is a close second....must open the Westy 12 soon.....Just phenomenol 9/4/10/5/19 4.7



Appearance is dark brown-amber with golden amber edges on glass. Pours with off white head that dissipates to a thin layer. Aroma is exceptional and complex - raisins soaked in alcohol with gentle fruit cake spices, sherry notes, hint of roast malt, dark spice sugar. The flavour enhances the aroma,  so complex and interesting, everything is blended so well with just the right amount of alcohol. Each sip brings something new - I feel as though I am drinking something antique - reminds one of the whiff of resin off old furniture (it’s not in the beer - it gives a memory of it !). The carbonation is just right, the mouthfeel rich. The finish is complex, warm and smooth with spicy hops and fruity raisin - pure nectar. This beer is incredible, so beautifully crafted and so hard to describe in words, but so wonderful.  10/4/10/5/19 4.8 [240611]",0.0

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Rerate: Bottled 33cl. It pours a dark brown beer with a beautiful tanned head. The nose is of roasted malt, aniseed, herbs, pineapple and toffee accompanied by a huge amount of licorice and almonds. An extremely pleasant, complex and unique aroma. A lot more alcohol showing up in the Rochefort 10 than in the Rochefort 8. Wonderful taste with figs, roasted malt, aniseed (not noticeable in the rochefort 8), nougat (which adds a lot to this beer), herbs (I can’t make out which ones, but definitely an excellent blend), pineapple and homemade caramel showing up. A beauty. Deeply pleasant silky mouthfeel. Full bodied. Beautiful lacework. Definetely a lot of alcohol in this beer - which is a little too present for my liking. Especially just before the finish. Huge amounts of licorice appearing in the finish. A great beer - but I enjoyed Rochefort 8 more than than the 10. Additional Comment. Initial rating: March 6, 2007. Rerate August 5, 2008. 8th rating February 11, 2009: Surprisingly pale huge light beige head.  A lot of aniseed in both aroma and flavor. Incredibly complex with hints of sage, pineapple and candy. A lot of reminiscent homemade caramel. Warming alcohol showing up with the swallow. Outstanding. I reveled in every sip. Without a doubt a lot better than Westvleteren Abt 12. Beyond world class.

A bit overpowering, and I don’t find many of hte notes in it others are tasting unfortunately, and, well just to contradict a previous reviewer, I believe I prefer a Trois Pistoles from Unibroue to this - it’s a little smoother and less alcoholic tasting, if memory serves (which it may not).",0.0
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"330ml bottle into a goblet.

Pours an opaque dark ruby, almost black, with a light tan one finger head. Really decent head retention and lacing throughout.

The aroma is full of dark fruits such as plums, raisins, dates, and figs. Is quite vinous with a very red wine-like aroma. Some notes of sherry and cranberry. Quite nice.

The flavor provides even more depth than the aroma. Plums and grapes along with sherry and a hint of vanilla. More dark fruit washes over the palate with some oak and plums. Bitterness is on the moderate side with much of the perceived bitterness provided by the alcohol. It is never harsh but is definitely noticeable providing a nice, pleasing warmth in the chest and throat.

Overall, an amazing Quad and one of the best Trappist beers out there. So many complexities in the aroma and taste it is a brew that every true beer fan should experience.",0.0

Anyways, on to the beer!  Dark brown, opaque, loads of ""floaties"" massive foamy light brown/tan head. Active carbonation, the bubbles form a honeycomb structure under the foamy head, interesting looking! Sweet malts, toffee, prunes, honey a hint of allspice in the nose. Smooth & creamy, sweet toffee & raisins, like a new flavor of ice cream topped with spiced rum, cotton candy, traces of hazelnut....there’s so many flavors at once plus the alcohol sneaks in after the swallow to make its presence known.

As it continues to roll through your mouth, you'll start to experience the fruits and spices which will leave you with a pleasant aftertaste and wanting to jump in for another sip.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Bottle, Ciro’s, Toronto.  Dark brown / purple colour.  Fantastic aroma, lots of spice, plum, and slight alcohol.  Very little head on the pour in a nice trappist style glass.  Mouthfeel was a little disappointing in that it was thinner than the appearance suggested, but still it was complex without being syrupy.  Lots more spice and warm alcohol in the taste - I couldn’t really describe it, but I knew it seemed well balanced and quite agreeable.  This beer got better as it warmed as well - the flavours were less intense, but by the end, I couldn’t identify the 11% alcohol level.  A nice experience with good company.

Re-rate April 20 05.  Acquired a bottle in a trade with Mustang3.  My initial rating of this was when I was still at a pretty infant stage as far as trying new styles were concerned.  The bottle I had last night absolutely blew me away in a way no beer has.  The appearance of this beer was quite different, as I was in my well-lit living room and not a dark enjoyable bar.  It was very dark brown with red hues and a murkiness that looked fantastic. Small tan head.  The aroma was amazing - fresh hops, sweet malt, a little spice and some alcohol - I’ve never wanted to try a beer based on its aroma before so bad in my life.  The mouthfeel was also very unique - full-bodied, yet really frothy - this is where I encountered the biggest difference in my 2 ratings.  The taste was of rich malt, a well-balanced bitterness and the alcohol was incredibly restrained.  There was almost a sweet rum like quality to this beer.  I have not done it justice, but this was without question the best beer I have ever tried.",0.0

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Bottle into chalice.

Pours a murky, rich dark purplish-brown, with a magnificent, pillowy two-finger khaki head on top. The head reduces to a thick, creamy khaki cap that leaves substantial lacing. Very nice.

Nose is hard to get a grip on - nutty, bit of cocoa, primarily brown sugar, spicy dark fruit, and doughy yeast. What’s there is fantastic.

Taste is full, rich, complex, and yet perfectly in sync with itself, if that makes sense. Notes of cocoa and spiced brown sugar, raisins and dates, doughy, spicy yeast, with a mild earthy bitterness coming out to join the fray right before the finish. Finish is sweet, spicy, yeast with some sweet raisin notes. Fairly short finish, warming, just a bit of alcohol underneath. Subtle but big in flavor, all while being very approachable.

Mouthfeel is creamy and fluffy, perfectly executed, full mouthfeel without being syrupy.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Three-year old bottle aged by yours truly.
Date on bottle is the date of exipiration, exactly five years from the date of bottling. The date string reads 230113 (d/m/y), i.e. January 23rd, 2013. We deduce this was bottled in January 2008 and as such is now three years old.
Pours a deep dark brown almost black color with tiny light-brown head. The aroma is as strong and potent as ever, with a delicious bouquet of dark fruit engulfing the nose. Plums, raisins, and sweet dates. Such a beautiful, complex, assertive aroma... Surprisingly, after three years, carbonation is still very strong and prickles the tongue. The flavour seems to have lost a bit of its complexity. It has certainly softened over the years but still is an extension of the basic notes of the aroma... plums, raisins, dates. What is new is a less hidden taste of alcohol that has a distinct strong liqueur taste to it. Whether fresh or aged - Rochefort 10 is one of the best beers in the world.",0.0
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"I’ll start off first by saying that I am partial to rich, complex, full-bodied beers.  I crave layers.  I 

want dimension.  I want to be able to look into every corner of the beer and find something worthy of 

mentioning.  To me, the difference between a craft beer and a world-class beer is that a while a craft beer 

may be an excellent example of a particular style, and therefore enjoyable cum that particular style, a 

world-class beer is an oeuvre on the palate that can provide the culinary depth of an entire meal in one 

quaff.

All this to say, Rochefort 10 is such a beer.  

From the deep mahagony color (dare I say it reminded me of buffed koa wood from Hawaii?), one expects that 

the malt should shine through, and from the nose one waits to taste spices of all different kinds.  One is 

not disappointed.  The first thing that I noticed in this beer is how well the brewer has stood up to the 

formidable 11% alcohol content; unfortunately most high-alcohol beers will have the experience of ethanol in 

center state, as the lead singer, with the rest of the flavors singing backup, however Rochefort 10 is in 

control of the alcohol content and uses it to strong advantage.  There are of course raisin tones, and plums, 

but factor in the chocolate and you have gourmet Raisinettes.  The tastes have a matte finish, rather than 

glossy; everything is balanced and textured rather than bright and zinging.  More tastes follow - muted strawberries, ripe banana, and of course a highly pleasureable layered maltiness.  At first drink I was tempted to say that the finish was dry, but it wasn’t.  It was clean, as if it were purposeful.  One gets the sense that everything is in its place, nothing is an accident.  This is a wonderful beer, practiced and perfected.",0.0

Westvleteren 12,"Tasted side-by-side with St. Bernardus ABT 12, which is supposedly a near-clone.  Purchased on eBay, shipped direct from Brussels from the limited release gift pack with glasses.  Extremely expensive, but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Enjoyed on December 25, 2011.  Color is dark brown, slight reddish tinge, almost opaque.  Half a finger of head retreated quickly to leave minimal ring of lacing.  Nose is incredible - chocolate, espresso, roasted hazelnuts, spice - maybe even cinnamon??  First taste was surprising.  Lots of carbonation, dried fruit, raisins and dark cherries.  Many hop notes - piney ,a bit earthy.  Strange, nearly sweet flavor presents at the end of each swallow.  Almost a smokey, charcoal with a hint of maple syrup!?  Molasses!  Alcohol nearly missing escept in the after taste, where a pleasant warm burn is felt.

Compared to the St. Bernardus, I found it to be more yeasty and complex, with more carbonation and a more robust mouthfeel too.



UPDATE July 28, 2013.  I’ve been saving these bottles and slowly drinking one at a time since December 25, 2011.  Cracked open the fourth from this batch today, and it has aged extremely well.  Poured with less head than the first bottle two years ago, but the mouthfeel is still extremely carbonated.  All of the original flavors are still here in full force, with a nice added smokiness.

A true wave of flavor that bombards and pelts your mouth and that slowly develops into a beautiful fruity caramel citrus cherry flavor. A head that does not last too long but is of a beautiful light caramel color. Cloudy and extremely dark red in color. Sweet with a soft bitter bite. There is so much flavor present! A beautiful not too dry aftertaste that is simply beautifully balanced. Words fall short. A beer that stimulates all your senses.

Westvleteren 12,"Blind Quad 07 tasting 330 ml bottle from xnoxhatex.  Very malty aroma, its light especially when held next to Rochefort 10.  Grain, toasted chocolate toffee, vanilla, prunes, rasins, its definitely complex but I have to stick my nose in their a little to really get it.  Murky rasin brown in color, average off white head with lasting lacing.  Lightly sweet in flavor and finish, candi sugar, rasins, plums, cherries, oak, and the warmth of alcohol.  Medium bodied, creamy and fizzy with some nice undertones in the flavor.  This unanimously took second place in the the tastings, beat out by Rochefort 10.  
-----------
8/2/06 Thanks to xnohatex for the sample straight from belgium bottled only about a month ago.  
Pours dark with a small off white head.  The aromas are very nicely balanced like everything else in this beer: plums, currants, raisins, brown sugar and dough.  At the first sip i’m struck: suprisingly medium to light body but a crazy amount of fizziness over the whole tongue.  The longer I hold it in my mouth, it almost becomes numb with the carbonation.  Drewbeerme described it as probably what it would be like to taste a little finger-lick of cocaine, i agreed.  Flavors followed with successive sips:  raisins, toffee, carmel, cinamon, oak, vanilla, clove, and alcohol all balanced so well (maybe even too balanced).  as the beer warmed it seemed to turn sweeter and the aromas and flavors turned more to chocolate and almond.  After a few sips of this i was suprised to feel heady very quickly.   

This isn’t a crazy or intense beer, dont expect that, but it is (possibly)  the most balanced beer in the world.  4.7",0.0

Westvleteren 12,"Rating #1000   I did a side by side between an approx. 5 year old bottle (labeled at 10.6%) and a 6 month old bottle (labeled at 10.2%).  I will give the beginning stats on the five year old and then the traits / differences of the 6 month old.   The  five year old  bottle had a minor ""pfft"" when the cap came off.  Poured with the color of brown sugar with a nice beige head that was very respectable for the age.  The aroma is full and open with plums, raspberries, brown sugar, thick caramel, earthy malt, red wine notes, buttered toffee, raisins and more - there is something new with each wiff.  Full body that’s thick and velvety smooth with some incredibly soft carbonation.  The flavor starts with brown sugar, Belgium earthiness, plums, raisins & smooth rich toffee-like earthiness.  The finish adds some spice and a surprising sharpness and some astringency.  As it warms the raspberry aspect comes out more and the finish loses some of the sharpness and becomes more lush and adds dark cherry, brown sugar and caramel. (9/4/9/4/18/4.4)    The  six month  version pour deep mahogany  with a dense tan head - everything darker than the older version.  The aroma has cola, brown sugar and other flavors of the aged version, but all of the favors are more subdued and sharper.  There is less earthiness, but more fruit.  More brown sugar and caramel earthiness as it warms, but nothing like the aged bottle.  The flavors are much tighter and hidden, the five yar was significantly more lush and opened up.  Medium / full body with fairly sharp carbonation.  The taste is more sharp with earthiness, very dark caramel, coriander and pepper.  The finish gets quite sharp with anise and  pepper.  As it warms it opens up more, but nowhere near where the aged version was from the beginning. (8/5/8/4/17/4.2)   Overall, it is well worth aging the beer.  I’ve held onto the aged beer for years and it was worth it.  Big thumbs up  for this exceptional beer, but if you have the patience with a fresh bottle it is advised to give this a bit of time to age.

Westvleteren 12,"Received as a wedding gift from my best man--by far the best gift we received. He got us a six pack, and my wife and I are planning on having the next five each anniversary up until our fifth.

A: Poured into a Mikasa chalice. Pours a large mocha head atop a very dark brown body. Plenty of yeast. The lacing is extremely long-lasting.

S: Lots going on here, especially as it warms up. The trademark yeast is by far the most prominent smell, accompanied by some dark malts and fruits, along with a bit of alcohol.

T: Much the same as the nose, and probably the most complex beer I’ve ever tasted. Plenty of dark fruits, dark malt, alcohol, fruit and yeast spice, caramel, and molasses. 

M: Very full and heavy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Luscious.

D: Quite complex and takes a while to drink, and only gets better as it warms up. Very nice to savor for a long period of time while continuing to find new things going on.

Westvleteren 12,"After being on site at the cafe by the monastery and drinking the fabled westvleteren 12, I can't help but agree with everyone who touts this beer as the best in the world. I had hoped it would taste ok, but no more because the price. But it doesn't get any better than this. It must be said that I am completely sold on monastery beer and preferably from Belgium. But this beer has it all in my opinion. But there are also other beers that are not so far away. But at the moment this beer is the best beer in the world in my opinion! ??",0.0
Westvleteren 12,"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with a small light tan head that fades leaving minimal lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, slightly burnt caramel, figs, alcohol, slight banana, and yeast spice. Taste is the same as aroma with just a slight residual sweetness.

Westvleteren 12,"Proof of the existence of God.  The yard stick by which all other Belgian Trappist beers (indeed, beers in general) should be measured. Head: the ultimate rocky Belgian foam.  I would not be surprised if they pack the pillows of the monks at the abbey with this heavenly mousse.  Thick, long lasting, creamy, dense.  Aroma: mysterious, deepening with increasing temperature.  Chocolate, layers of malt, Viennese coffee, caramel, notes of port.  Flavor: the Everest of complexity.  Sweet treacle and toffee but not cloying, because a well balanced bitterness, alcohol and spice mixture immediately tempers the first impression.  Roasted malt, chocolate chip cookies, caramel sundae topping, hot buttered rum.  Let it warm up a bit and discover why people become monks at the abbey breweries.  Palate: creamy without being thick.  Delightful.  Immediately brings up perfect moments: sitting by a fire in a ski lodge after a perfect day on the slopes, reading a book in a European cafe on a rainy night, playing traditional music with friends in a dimly lit pub.",0.0

Westvleteren 12,"This was a blindtest between W-12 2005, W-12 2006, St. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10. The current rating is for 2005, as this was the one that scored highest in my book. 

It pours a red/bronze-ish with a small offwhite head. The aroma is about as sweet as it gets, alot of candysugar in there. Heavy on the sweet side, with a alot of grains/malts. Also the candysugar is very present here. Some alcohol towards the finish. Rich mouthfeel, and suprisingly good carbonation considering it’s 7-8 yrs old.

Westvleteren 12,"Type: 11.2-oz. bottle
Glass: Trappist glass  
From: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, Calif. 
Price: $84.99 for 6-pack + two glasses (also had to purchase $50 worth of stuff at HWC)  
Misc.: Bottle cap and part on bottle  said best by Jan. 8, 2015; The only time this beer has been in the U.S. and supposedly the only time it will be.

Poured a mahogany color with about a finger of off-white head that stayed forever on the top of the beer. Great thick and milky lacing on the sides. Great retention all the way down.

Smelled sour fruit up, followed by a sweet tarty flavor. Got green apple and kiwi. Also some malt backbone to it, mainly toasty caramel and toffee. Some light chocolate, too? Got better as I sat and smelled it.

Tasted similar to the nose. Just so damn smooth. Definitely could taste the alcohol up front. Some cloves, which I didn’t get in the smell. Got the green apple and tartness. Also light hints of caramel, honey

Medium body. Thin texture. Soft (below average) carbonation. Long, smooth finish.

An obviously fantastic beer. Like Frank the Tank in “Old School” said, “Once it hits your lips, it’s so good.” One of the smoothest beers I’ve ever tried.",0.04622501635210243

Westvleteren 12,"12-oz. bottle. Dark copper pour with a good deal of suspended yeast globs and a pillowy, latte-colored head. Aroma of brown sugar, dates, dark stone fruit, banana bread, and subtle Belgian esters. Incredibly rich flavor with heavy bready malt (almost like a märzen) being the dominant tone early, along with some raisin, a touch of brown sugar, and a surprising bit of almost spicy, boozy heat. As it warms, the breadiness takes a back seat to a sweeter Belgian yeast/candi sugar note. It’s not as complex as past bottles, but still quite layered. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with a tangy, lingering finish. A delightful beer, but it doesn’t quite live up to its extremely lofty hype.",0.0

Westvleteren 12,"Well, what better way to end the year than with the proclaimed ""best beer in the world."" Pours a very dark slightly murky brown (left some yeast in the bottle) with surprisingly small, dissipating tan head.  Very effervescent, with rich wine-like nose with hints of molasses, baker’s chocolate, and sweet fruity liqueur. On the palate, smooth but a little thin, tasting like a nice aged port with added barrel character, along with a sort of grape jelly note i remember from the 8, for which this is most definitely the more adult version.  A lovely long finish, melding through many different stages from winter spices to delicate candi sugar sweetness to a final delicate tingle of herbal hop bitterness.  Best beer in the world? That always seems a contentious claim, as taste is inevitably subjective, yet this is one particularly well crafted and lovely ale, and one that I am very happy and thankful to have tried.",0.0
Westvleteren 12,"I sought it out because of its high ratings on this website.  While it is a very good beer but it wouldn’t put it in at 100%.

Westvleteren 12,"Was planning on ageing this for awhile but something inside just told me to drink it tonight during a nice summer thunder storm. Poured a smooth brown and settled into a darker shade of deep dark brown in the glass. The head was foamy and thick and held an almost indigo hue. As I polished off the pour, the sweet smell hit me...raisins and rum mostly. Tasting this behemoth was a stage-by-stage event that involved multiple phases and finishes. Stage 1: Lots of raisins on the taste buds, some alcohol presence felt as my whole tongue kinda tingled upon the first sips...felt really good. Finish was very rounded, slightly hoppy, and so smooth and balanced. Stage 2: As it warmed up, that alcohol became far more evident in the taste...almost canceling out all of the raisin aspects from before and introducing some kind of medicine-like feel...not unpleasant...but reminded me of vodka with it’s icy, somewhat metallic tone. At this point in time, the smell seemed sweeter and made me think of cotton candy and the finish had quite a burn to it. Stage 3; That burning sensation has tapered off a bit but still noticing mostly alcohol in the finish; although the balance remains stable. Stage 4: I’m thinking of port now, some smoke and a slightly toasted flavour that is difficult to pinpoint. Some fruity aspects coming out to me now also...apricot, apples, grapes. Stage 5: Coming near to the end of the glass now...sad to say. More of a distinct bitter sweetness coming through in the taste...brown sugar, cloves, spice, and cinnamon. But those elements are kind of attempting to cut through that thick hazy alcohol wall and not always making it. There is a sort of tar-like flavour that I am detecting along with orange peel and a burnt coffee zest. As I downed the final drop, it kind of sent a slight shiver through my body. The monks done good again. Bottom line: an interesting beer for sure, not sure how often I could truly drink these and seems like something I could enjoy more in the dead of winter...especially around Christmas/New Years Eve. Festive, complex, and comes across more like a Belgian Barleywine than anything else. So glad I could drink this. Will try and keep my patience and age the next one properly and compare.",0.0

Strong and very sweet aroma, even relatively simple: cherry and plum in syrup, ripe banana, caramel. On the palate: full body, little carbonation, ""chewy"" consistency. The first sip impresses for its intensity, for its power, and for the sweetness: wave of raisins and plum, with a final bitter note of medicinal herbs and cinchona. Notes of ripe banana, biscuit and caramel emerge, but above all oxidized notes that bring it into the territory of wines such as Porto, Sherry or Madeira, Passito. The drink becomes very interesting, with an extraordinary intensity and, above all, with the alcohol (10.2%) hidden in an incredible way. The dessert is tempered - as mentioned - by a finish of quinine and officinal herbs, a slight pause before the sumptuous aftertaste, alcoholic, soft and satisfying, fruity and very long.",0.0

Westvleteren 12,"Managed to try two separate bottles, one from a promotional six pack but close to use by date, the other probably brewed this year. There were of course massive difference, the older one having lost its carbonation massively and while much sweeter at first, didn’t have the pleasant aftertaste of the fresher bottle, which my ratings are based on. Having done the Belgium 6 abbey trip, this was of course a big must try, since the others I had all had before. Given it’s lofty rating on this site, I was at first a little disappointed, with the initial flavour quite mild compared to Rochefort 10 or Chimay blue, but it does maintain the flavour in your mouth and the sweetness comes through slowly. Like most Belgians strong caramel flavour with nice balance of light bitterness. Still, prefer the Rochefort and the Chimay triples but that’s just my preference. A very good beer.",0.0
