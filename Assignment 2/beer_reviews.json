{"product_name": "Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch", "product_review": "There are not hundreds of beers on my bucketlist anymore, throughout the years I have had the pleasure of tasting many of the world's great beers and I am grateful for each and every one of them, but if there is one beer I have been eager to sip for nearly a decade now, it must be this one: Toppling Goliath's Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout, or KBBS as it is sometimes abbreviated.  A coffee stout aged for over a year in bourbon barrels, it was first released in 2012, but the story goes that at that time, only six people showed up - after which founder Carl Lewey stopped selling it and kept the rest of the batch for private consumption.  I guess he must have known already back then that he was onto something, as the buzz around this beer began to grow and it quickly became one of those modern whales every beer lover in the world wants to taste at least once.  In 2015, KBBS reached number one in the list of top beers on this very website, stoking the hype even further; nine years later, it still holds that same enviable position, as it does on BeerAdvocate (as well as second place - though only recently - on Untappd and Brewver).  It goes without saying that I am very happy to be able to finally taste it today on my birthday, from a 2022 vintage bottle (numbered 1679) just over a year old - and of course I know that a beer like this will probably only improve in coming years, but I just could not resist having it in my collection any longer...  Builds up a light brown, mocha ice-coloured, minute-bubbled and therefore densely creamy head of medium thickness, slowly receding and opening yet retaining well around the edge, with some dots of lacing here and there, over a pitch black beer.  The bouquet is intense - and indeed overwhelmingly beautiful, one sniff already managed to convince me instantly of the whole hype around it: top quality Swiss chocolate, chocolate ganache, top class real maple syrup, the finest Colombian coffee, warm bourbon of some high-end brand, vanillin-breathing oak wood and a lot of it (I love it), homemade coffee brownies, Alicante nougat, armagnac, fudge, expensive Belgian chocolates, crème au caramel, artisanal mocha ice cream, coffee liqueur, more dark bitter chocolate underneath and then all kinds of subtle hints ticking all the boxes of a high-level U.S. style 'impy' varying between almond, roasted pecan nuts, cinnamon, fresh bayleaf, pipe tobacco, fresh fig and even more fruitiness warming up (blackcurrant) but then making room again for wet leather, walnut oil, charcoal briefly showing up only to vanish again in seconds, haemoglobin, rum-soaked raisins, date jam, a very vague minerally touch (clay) - before all that dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon and oak return, all intertwined into one monolithic, perfectly aligned and beguiling 'block' of aroma.  In the mouth, the most noble and refined sweetness unfolds, date jam, candied cherries, golden raisins - in a very dense, concentrated manner, with very slight sourish and umami notes here and there, but too subtle to describe; mouthfeel and carbonation are absolutely perfect for this style of beer, rich, velvety, viscously thick yet still oily-smooth, heavily yet supply gliding down the tongue, leaving behind thick layers of fine dark chocolate, toffee, nougat, almond and hazelnut paste, with both the coffee and roasted malts providing bitterness balancing out the sweetness.  An overall bittersweetness fills the mouth in a most complex way, releasing accents of amaretto, bayleaf, cinnamon, light sweet pipe tobacco and, much lighter still, even 'blood' or the juice oozing out of a medium rare steak - all of which matches perfectly without even the slightest sign of a false note, and all of which is enveloped in a noble oaky woodiness (think vanilla and actual wood flavours) and, of course, a long, warming, soothing bourbon bittersweetness, bourbon of high quality in this case, with armagnac- and walnut liqueur-like features.  The finish goes on and on, warming on a cold January night, but more importantly, providing an extended enjoyment of this formidable brew which seems to last forever.  Hops are present 'behind the scenes', with spicy and even very faintly citrus peel-ish details that all contribute to the vast and massive landscape of flavours.  The coffee returns every now and then retronasally, in a most sophisticated way.  This is one to enjoy very slowly and over a very long period of time: as the temperatures shift, one shade of beauty is replaced by another.  This is the one beer I spent the most money on in my twenty-five years of tasting beer in a serious way, but I have no regrets - on the contrary, I am filled with joy and gratitude that after such a long time, this most coveted of the world's craft beers (or one of the most coveted at least) finally reached me.  The number of bottles released each year seems to have grown in past iterations, probably since Toppling Goliath extended their production capacity with a new brewing installment in 2018, so who knows, maybe one day this gem will become a bit more widely available, and when that happens, I will be happy to pay for a second one.  As for now, I suppose I could consider selling the empty bottle, as I noticed one being auctioned in the States for no less than a hundred dollars...  Anyway, to conclude this long journey through this awe-inspiring brew: I think scoring becomes a bit meaningless in the light of not only this beer's inherent perfection and majestic beauty, but also in its consistent high scores in the decade in which it has been in existence.  Additionally, I cannot find anything I do not like here, not even after examining it with a microscope, so to speak, so here you go: the perfect score, mostly symbolically because American style imperial stout really does not get much better than this, at least not in what I have tasted so far.", "rating": "5.0"},

Pours nearly pitch black color and capped by a small tan layer of foam that settles in quickly to a thin film and leaves some nice legging on the glass. The aroma shows notes of rich, dark chocolate, maple syrup, and roasted coffee over a dark roasted malt base with further notes of bourbon and oak laden vanilla. The maple syrup is dominant but the underlying chocolate, coffee, and oaky vanilla shines as it warms up. The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and maple syrup right up front along with the bourbon oak, vanilla, and a moderate bitterness for balance on the back end. The maple syrup is sweet but tastes like quality grade A stuff compared to fake adjuncts found in other similar beers. Full bodied and slick with moderate carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and bourbon oak on the finish with lingering maple syrup sweetness after each sip. This is really tasty and definitely one of the better maple stouts I’ve had for sure, but not sure it quite lives up to the hype or the price to get it. Still a great beer.", "rating": "4.3"},

Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Travis’s house on September 24. Gold-waxed, 2014 vintage, 12 oz bottle shared by me. The pour is a thick and heavy dark black with a thin ring of dark mocha colored head that leaves no trace. This thing just sticks to the glass. It’s amazing. The aroma is unbelievable. The balance of heavy maple, chocolate, vanilla fudge, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, molasses, and brown sugar is just amazing. The bourbon barrel adds a wonderful oaky complexity and a hint of bourbon that really ties all of this together. The flavor is equally as amazing. The chocolate and vanilla fudge right up front are spectacular, and the maple comes rolling in with the dark fruits, sweet molasses, coffee, and brown sugar. The bourbon holds off, but remains detectable in each aspect. The balance is great. The mouth feel is unlike anything I’ve had. Period.

Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.\n\nAlthough I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin’ Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.\n\nI cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers I’ve ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.\n\nTastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.\n\nThis beer is beautiful throughout, it is indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin’ Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD.

Pours a rich thick deep black hue, opaque and thick, a frothy brownish head atop dies to a creamy ring, laces ok. Good dark ominous body, good legs. Aromas offer maple and coffee, sticky caramel and some vanilla. Roast, toast, and toffee. Maple syrup, gentle oak, vanilla, and faint whiskey wafting. It’s cold, so some warmth should open this up more. Initial is thick and sweet, touches of maple, oak, and cocoa. Sticky caramel, dark roast is mellow grows as it warms. The coffee comes out a bit more roast, a good intensity up front as it trails off, firm presence in the middle. Sticky and firmly flavored, roasty with good vanilla, barrel flavor as we round the corner. Vanilla, coffee, sticky caramel. Toffee, espresso, and richer coffee as we round up, a bit more roasty, sticky, barrel flavor. The base is still thick and firm, not making this pick up much if any heat from the barrel. Oak, roasty, and coffee. I think this is much more drinkable than the Mornin’ Delight. It’s sweet, but not nearly as much. Thick and full, but not overwhelming. The coffee element comes on at just the right time. Really well put together. I prefer this to Mornin, which may just be sensory overload. This one is the gem.

{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the \"best beers of the world\" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny.", "rating": "4.8"},

So what could be more appropriate than world greatest Imperial Stout. I’m lucky to have sampled this by several occasions, but this 2007 vintage where pulled out of my cellar late one evening after a great beer tasting session. Everyone had gone home and I just felt for splitting this bottle with my beer buddy Gunnfryd. The big question where if it still was able to kick balls after a set of other superb ales (lots of good memories from those days my buddies cared to bring fine beers at our beer evenings). Back to the beer. Pours pitch black with a small but nice, dense brown head. Body feels thick and heavy with a appropriate moderate level of carbonation. A sight for sore eyes. Strong aroma of everything dark, like dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate with leather, wood and smooth, refined alcohol.

This is a 2009 vintage at 9.5%. Full macho American pour into my large stemmed De Dolle Glass.\n\n\n\nA - Pours oily, totally black out of the bottle into the glass. A 2 finger coffee colored head forms and fades over the course of 90 seconds to a thin ring and minor sea-foam consistent bubbles. The stickiness of the head is resilient as it swirls around in the glass. Pitch black, not oily but pretty damn black in the glass. \n\n\n\nS - Nose is interesting. I get almost a mix of espresso creamy latte with lactose and fresh roasted coffee mixed with the sweet booziness of rum barrels. There is a hint of vanilla beans and dark chocolate.\n\n\n\nT - Interesting. This may be the most roasted beer I’ve ever had like a mix between roasted coffee and roasted oak over a fire. Not campfire smokiness but just very roasted. There’s a huge chocolate presence at the start, the middle is latte with vanilla added and the finish is this roast bomb with an almost astringent booziness like what you get after drinking cheap cough medicine. In the back of my throat I get a grain alcohol like taste like swallowing freezing cold vodka but the burn is always the same.\n\n\n\nM - Velvety and sort of fudge like but you know the feeling you’re left with after eating chocolate covered espresso beans? that’s pretty much what this feels like but in liquid form.\n\n\n\nO - I’m overall pretty disappointed in this beer. Tickers GOTTA tick but I really don’t feel that this is worth either the hype or the trade bait. There’s too much roasted notes, way too boozy for a 9.5% beer and the astringency never goes away.

{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "2007 nip bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm.  A few days earlier I drank full bottles of the 2006 and 2008 Stormaktsporter, and while both were considered very, very good, I felt the 2006 was faded and the 2008 was still a bit too bright and green.  This led me to choose the 2007 as the Kaggen! vintage to try at Akkurat a few days later.  My previous rating is from a nip bottle of the 2005, split two ways in 2008, sampled amid a number of other beers of varying style, bitterness and alcohol.  given the tendency of Narke beers to be somewhat mellow, focusing more on presenting a flavorful, balanced beer drinking experience rather than a bold, in-your-face drinking experience, my thoughts were lost, only preserved in notes taken four years ago.  So I truthfully had no opinion about the Kaggen from that long-ago taste.  I decided on this trip that I would experience Narke Stormaktsporter as if it were completely unknown to me.  The hype surrounding the beer is hard to ignore, but I feel like I can be honest with myself about quality given all of the things I’ve drank, where I’ve been in my beer travels, and how often I seem to go against the grain.  I’ve spent untold amounts of money on beer I didn’t enjoy, cheap and expensive both.  I trusted myself to honestly evaluate the Kaggen without consideration of rarity, reputation or pricetag. Combine this with the fact that so many people have had 4.5+ \"wow\" moments with this beer, and I know there’s something in here to find.  My previous rating was rather unexciting, so I figured I didn’t get the full experience, and this was my shot. So with that all said, how was the beer?  \n\n\n\nFirst pour: early on the beer has limited expression given the temperature, a bit colder than is ideal. Early on the nose presents  a chewy and creamy melted chocolate chip dark malt character with light touches of faded whiskey and oak. The body is exceptionally savory and frothy, suggesting chocolate fudge and fluffy but savory cake.  There is slow growing alcohol warmth as the beer begins to blossom and open up with time, and after about 10 minutes it becomes difficult to put into words... surreal decadence, that would put it best. Prickly, just-bitter cocoa nibs and fudge cake softness with a velvety body.  Later on, approaching room temperature, the nose develops some metal and paint yeast notes but it’s really quite mild and doesn’t spoil the decadent spongy fudge cake deliciousness.  Some mild smoke and char are at play later on, and the whiskey remains happily subdued and well-matched for the moderate roast and soft, decadent body.  The last sips show a bit more whiskey and alcohol, as expected, but still remains creamy and chewy and perfectly suited for it’s size.  Delicious.  And no fish sauce whatsoever.\n\n\n\nprevious rating of 2005 vintage sampled in 2008: Appearance is deep black, no apparent light passing through the edges of my glass.  A deep brown head sites on top, and when swirled the brown, thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass and slowly crawls back down.  Very attractive splotchy lacing.  First impression of the nose is rich dark chocolate and a slightly hot aroma of whiskey with faint charred wood as well. For sure the whiskey is not overpowering, and I’d probably say it’s one of the few beers that used whiskey barrel aging is a truly complimentary role.  The (faint) char, rich (but not heavy) smoke, and malty scotch notes work together really, really well.  First taste is rich chocolate and sharp whiskey, again, complimentary rather than dominating, with oak barrel and delicate, toasted chocolate malts coating the mouth.  Over the back it’s slightly warming, very mellow and smooth, leaving a rich toffee, amaretto and resinous whiskey coating on the tongue.  A few times I even pick up some nice, moist tobacco as well.", "rating": "4.3"},

Drink it, period. *Rational-rate*: every time I have Kaggen! Stormaktsporter I never feel used to such a masterpiece. As I said to everyone: had many of the BIG IRS whales, like Black Tuesday, Darkness, Darklord, The Abyss, Eclipse, Dark Horizon, ecc., ecc., but this one tower above all. The reasons? Color is intense black, with a brown head like moka. But complexity starts from the aroma: you could never get enough of smelling, you touch something different every time. And difficult, extremely difficult to hive off single components. It’s burned sugar, molasses, apricot, oak, vanilla, plum, cherries, chocolate, coffee, syrup, spice, herbs. Bond between all that stuff is almost indivisible, even more in taste, it comes out an holistic property. Difficult to explain. But fact is, and could seem a paradox, separately from complexity, Kaggen! isn’t difficult to have, even though 25 cl is the best format, because hits directly the bull’s eye of senses without hesitation. You don’t need to be an experienced taster for appreciation and understand you’re facing something SO BIG. Moreover, it’s pointless making long analysis and list all flavors, since the best side it’s just the wholeness of such a full body; warms mouth and palate, in a great alternation between sweetness and bitterness (more the first) and the PERFECT balance of malts and hops. Herbaceous character, given by heather honey, isn’t invasive and oak aging as well. It’s ambrosia, no way. Breweries like Närke aren’t just their hype-geek productions, try other ones (cAmarillo, Örebro Bitter, and so on) and you’ll catch how they great could be as artisans. Long live HG and Berith.", "rating": "5.0"},

Stormaktsporter has a typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace. \n\nThe aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose.\n\nThe flavor is pretty much exactly what I want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. Smooth, sweet bourbon comes in first and slowly lets in the fig, raisin, cherry, and roasted malt blend beautifully together. Some dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, and light espresso notes are in the background. The finish has a bit more bourbon and finishes fairly clean.\n\nThe carbonation is smooth, with just enough crispness to excite the tongue along with the bourbon. The body is on the fuller side of medium and consistent all the way through. Slightly sticky on the lips.\n\nClearly, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had.

It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wondeful deep brown head. The wonderful raosted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, soem distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel lie you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anythign but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ).\nAdded now (as the rating is from 2009).

A very lively, large, blooming, deep brown head erupts on a near jet black body. Lacing is sheety, large, and sticky. Aroma is very intense: fruity, floral, buttery, maple, something not unlike bourbon but more akin to brandy and spiced orange. As it warms, very heavy buttery bourbon comes through even though this has no bourbon component in the aging. More spiced orange comes through again with licorice and mild peat. Later, I get a lot more orange, potpourri, heavy clove and cinnamon. Taste is very different from the normal version. Up front this is sharp and citrusy, mild butter and spicy oak in the mid, and finishes neutral, tannic, and rich with bourbon, oil, and coconut similar to Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Palate is slightly carboardy and mildly dusty. Not super oily or thick. Very different from the normal Stormaktsporter. Not coffee, chocolate, or bourbon forward. More neutral malty, bitter orange, mild coffee. Pretty good but not mind blowing. Definitely not the best beer in the world unfortunately. Inferior to Misto BA or even De Molen Heaven and Hell.

There was chocolate and vanilla in there, a healthy but not overly oakiness as well. There is sweetness and mild alcohol but its not cloying or hot at all. Its very \"complex\" -- it almost turns to a liquor aroma after a while, a mild whiskey or something slightly fruitier, but its not oxidized.\n\nBeer is a little lighter in the body than I was expecting but I suppose I should have been expecting the way it was due to the ABV being so high. Leads off with a definite sweetness, mild alcohol but its not drying. Great palate connectivity, the beer sort of coats the tongue, lingering with these subtle fruit flavors and general sweetness, creamy in the mouth, no help from carbonation at this point but this beer doesn’t even need it. Its a very good beer. Have it again? Definitely. If I ever get a hold of a bottle of this, it will be shared with a group of beer nerds who fantasize about this as much as I had.\n\nServing type: bottle", "rating": "4.3"},

Cause of the low brewingcapacity, and the very hard to get beers, this beers just had to get an higher rating then they deserve… Ok the beers should be good, but that good like described? Then, soms weeks ago, I had the chance to taste some beers of this brewer (thanks to Brouwerij De Molen, with the beerfestival!). And I took the chance to taste 3 beers of this brewer, that are not at the top of the ratebeer-rating, but decent. And damn, they are very good, maybe even great. So I got myself also Stormaktsporter and Kaggen Stormaktsporter at 25cl bottles. And now is the time to rate this 2 beers next to eachother (lucky me). So my 499th rating is the Närke Stormaktsporter 2008, my 500th rating is the Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter 2009. And here we go my 500th rating: Pours out a bit darker then the non-kaggen version? Really pitch black. A small head, brownish, won’t holds that good as the normal version. Smell is diferent, more sourness comes up, and something for sure different, the bourbon? Coffee, fruits, something pleasant (bourbon?), wood, chocolate. Very nice smell for sure, also the vanilla seems to come trought a bit more... Taste is different for sure also. Ofcourse the taste is roastiness, coffee, chocolate,… but some more liquorish for sure, more alcohol, and the bourbon comes up with a kick. The sweetness goes at this one more to some sourness. The mouthfeel is pleasant, about the same, oily like i like it. The taste is maybe just a bit to sharp for me at the start. Maybe I’m weird, but I like the normal version just a bit more, It seems more balanced then this one, but that’s maybe cause this one is younger, and after some aging the sharp start will be softened. A very good brew for sure, and wanna try this again in some time, with an aged bottle. But till then: overrated? NO! Best beer? no... Top-beer? For sure! Very decent imperial stout for sure, well done Närke! Maybe I had to wait a bit longer to open this bottle, or the other version, as my 550th rating or so, but now it’s more easy to compare them. Edit: retasted to celibrate something special. 2009 version on 12/09/2014. Almost like i remembered this beer. The honey seems faded away some, but while warming up it’s still there.

The taste brought things forward even more, really just layering the complexities in a very intense manner. \n\nThe chocolate fudge really stood out to me at time, but in all honesty it was really difficult to pick out individual throughout, as everything was just so well integrated. In essence, all I can really say is that this is exactly what an imperial stout should taste like. I would say that for a beer with this incredible amount of flavor, the feel was a bit thin.

Flavor has a full vanilla and caramel burst up-front with a similar finish to the regular; toffee, roasted malt, and light fruit.  However, the finish in the Kaggen! is a bit softer, rounder, and more pleasing to me.

{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "2006 version, purchased at Oliver Twist. I’ve got the ’07 waiting for the right tasting event back home. Aged in Mackymyra single malt whiskey barrels if I’m not mistaken. Served in a snifter. The bottle was given to me WAY too cold, so I let it warm for a bit.\n\nA - First, I don’t generally dig snifters for my RIS consumption - they generally reduce head volume by quite a bit, and my favorite brews don’t benefit much from the aroma \"retention\". In any case, it had a late-rising dark mocha, even slightly red, half-finger of foam that dissipated pretty quickly to a ring with a few bubbles at the surface and some \"legs\". Pitch black - there’s some pretty lace that’s generated with each sip but it quickly slides down the edges of the glass and back into the abyss. It actually looked a lot like Dave’s (d0b) pour of the Cigar City 110K+OT in my Darkness snifter. I’m going to give it the benefit of the doubt, but if I get subpar head volume in a different vessel next time I may dock this a half point.\n\nS - Sweet Jesus - this thing smells epic. Huge whiskey, vanilla, oak, dark fruits, honey, roasted malts, tobacco, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, molasses, and probably all the other descriptors used by my reviewing colleagues. The closest comparison I can think of was the incredible BA Decadence ’07, but this brew brings a slight sour note to the table that is almost a little reminiscent of the most recent Perseguidor (batch 4). I’m not sure how much time this brew sits in the barrel, or whether Swedish whiskey is more conducive to \"bugs\" but it’s a wonderful addition that adds a touch of depth and richness that can be lacking in other BA beers. There’s not a trace of astringent alcohol either.\n\nT - OK - you can pretty much taste everything listed in the smell, as there is really no drop-off in complexity. Whiskey, vanilla, wood, bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, roastiness - they’re all here. Near the back end of the palate it fleetingly moves into BA barleywine territory somehow, with the burnt molasses flavor in there, but then it finishes with huge tannins and oak - like on par with Toronado 20th here. I’m at a loss here, because I keep picking up slight sour beer elements that my fellow colleagues didn’t mention - perhaps this is caused by the age, or the barrel used? In any case, it’s as if someone took an amazing BA beer like Decadence and spiked it with a touch of Consecration or something.\n\nM - There’s a little heat to go with the full silky smooth body and lots of stickiness. The residual feel is that \"I’ve been licking a piece of wood\" kind of thing that shows up in barrel-aged brews. Fairly mild carbonation. No complaints here.\n\nD - This is the only place I can really knock this brew. I was worried the 250ml bottle wouldn’t be enough for me to really enjoy and reflect on, but it was plenty. The alcohol is well hidden, but the buzz creeps up pretty fast. Also, the heavy tannic finish and the somewhat mind-blowing flavor depth make this a true evening-ender. But what an evening!\n\nIt’s not very often that a brew comes along that changes my perception of what a style can do. I’m not sure if the slight sour notes were intentional, or a by-product of the barrel aging process, but any beer that marries the best of brews like BA Decadence, Parabola, and Bell’s BB Double/Cream Expo blend with stuff like Toronado 20th and Persguidor opens up my mind and palate to the amazing possibilities of beer. I understand this stuff is hard to get, but it should be tried be every beer lover at least once.", "rating": "4.8"},

Its on Wild Turkey, only going to be about 800 bottles, this one is going to be special. Unreal vanilla already presenting, aroma is one of the best ever, taste still getting there but this will be awesome.\n-06 version that was not barrel aged put into a glass bottle and just sat for 3 years, awesome vanilla notes on the front, beer itself is almost syrup lots of acid, a little tough to drink but interesting\n- 08 kaggen that is 4 parts kaggen and 1 part smoked beer. This is not a commercial beer, made by the brewery for him and his friends. This was the best of the lot, unreal balance and totally amazing. They need to make this, it would hit top 5 easily so balanced with tons of vanilla, smoke, wood, and coffee. AWESOME. \n\nEach version is totally different, the 08 that I reviewed and gave a 4.55 is widely considered in Sweden as the worst batch.

Shared at a very small tasting with a few guys from BA.  This was really one of the defining moments in my beer drinking career.  Tried this next to regular Stormaktsporter.  This beer was everything I hoped it to be.  Insanely flavorful and complex, yet also subtle.\n\nSo from what I understand, \"kaggen\" is approximately Swedish for \"barrel aged.\"  So if I ever make it to Sweden and go to a beer bar there, I’ll have to tell them to give me something kaggen.  I wonder what the Swedish equivalent of \"-bal aged\" is.  Maybe \"-kan\" or something.  Yeah that sounds right.\n\nPhenomenal appearance.  Looks almost exactly the same as it’s non \"-kan\" brother - pours darkest brown, not quite black, with a creamy tan head that settles over time, eventually leaving smooth thin foam and swirls in the beer.\n\nSo much going on in the aroma.  Very complex and intense yet nothing overpowers.  Roast, chocolate, caramel, anise, dark fruits, tobacco, and wildflower honey.  Definitely some barrel notes as well: oak, vanilla, and whiskey.\n\nFlavor is similarly complex and amazing.  Tastes even better than it smells.  Just the perfect level of sweetness with caramel, chocolate, toffee, dark fruits (raisin, plum, date), vanilla, herbal and floral notes, tobacco, oak, leather, well-integrated whiskey, and maybe even some hops.  Slight floral notes and a little smoke.  It’s amazing how many flavors they pack into this beer.  It’s subtle and balanced a la Kate the Great rather than in your face a la Black Tuesday.  It’s on a whole other level from Kate though, really putting almost all competitors to shame.\n\nVery smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel with medium-full body and an incredibly long finish.  Not at all cloying or syrupy or boozy.  So this is called an imperial stout, but feels more like a baltic porter in my opinion.  A really, really awesome baltic porter.\n\nOverall, just a flat-out amazing beer.

The taste is dark fruit and rich tobacco with a surprising touch of sourness, Smoky and peaty undertones before the coffee bitterness. A constant mocha and vanilla vein runs throughout the brew. The mouth feel is a tad thinner than the \"regular\" version but a bit more carbonation makes up for it. Big fruity and twangy tones with a hint of wild funk makes it more complex than the non-Kaggen version but at the same time it is slightly less wonderful.

Flavor is also loaded up with big sweet chocolate malts, more bourbon and oak, more vanilla ( almost a Charleston Chew candy like character) on the flavor turns more to licorice, leather then a nice earthiness (burlap sack and cedar cigar box) along with more coffee and roast in the end with a perfect bitterness.

There are beers that fall short of hype, there are beers that meet the hype, and then there is Narke Kaggen Stormaktsporter, which annihilates the hype and then kicks its butt again.  This beer is almost flawless; from the pouring of the motor- oil-in-a-black-hole-tinted liquid to the final sip of bourbon barrel soaked chocolate syrup, this beer blows most others out of the stratosphere.  The nose is a symphony of bourbon oak, chocolate, woody sugar, and molasses. As I said before, this beer pours as dark as motor oil in a black hole.  Darth Vader looks downright pale compared to this beauty.  A waterfall of flavors tickle the taste buds with each precious sip, notably the aforementioned chocolate syrup seemingly poured from a bourbon cask after maturing for 30 years, with a stark dark fruit presence that rounds out the experience.

Many thanks for knocking out the last of the beers I most sought out.\n\nAh, Kaggen - how you have eluded me all this time.  So many perfect scores have been bestowed on you.  So many arguments have been fought over whether you are the best beer in the world.  Finally my time has come to evaluate all the hype and praise.\n\nIn a nutshell, if falls far short of expectations.  The aroma was very nice.  The excellence of barrel-aging was very evident in both the aroma and flavour.  This alone allows me to appreciate the high degree of skill that was involved in this process.  However, there was a stark lack of balance here with each flavour component seeming a bit disjointed from the others.  The body was also a tremendous letdown for me as I was expecting something quite....well, \"imperial\" in nature.  I got very ordinary and run-of-the-mill.  Nothing huge in regards to the viscosity.  Which is fine if there’s a multitude of complexity and refinement in the flavour as was evident in the original batch of black hole from Mikkeller, for example.

{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "New Rating: 9/5/8/3/17 = 4.2  2008 bottle.  Much bigger sample this time.  Consumed in August 2010 immediately after regular Stormaktsporter.  A virtually black body props up a thick and frothy head of mocha colored foam.  Settling to a pronounced, bubbly edge, the head leaves scattered spots and organic splotches of lacing on the glass.  The nose is pretty damn nice, showing rich notes of dark chocolate, scorched caramel, and black strap molasses, with an overtone of slightly smoky whiskey and oak char.  Dark fruits, most likely fig, brood within, along with hints of sweet pipe tobacco.  It seems a bit less earthy than the regular Stormaktsporter, no doubt a result of the barrel influence taking precedence over hops.  Flavors are nice, but not as complex as the regular version.  The whiskey again seems to overtake underlying subtleties, replacing them with a velvety smooth vanilla character and soft barrel char.  Caramel and chocolate are at near perfect richness, towing the line between sweet and earthy.  The palate is substantial, though it is thinned a bit and warm with alcohol.  Carbonation is noticeably softer than that of the base version, which is welcomed.  Overall, it’s a mighty fine imperial stout, but there’s not a doubt in my mind that I overrated on my first go-round, as have many others.\n\nOriginal rating: 10/5/9/4/18 = 4.6  2006 bottle, courtesy hopscotch.  Thanks so much Eric!   Pours a dark chocolate brown body.  Pure liquid fudge at the deepest point, glowing golden brown at the edge.  A swirly tan head with a bubbly edge forms the crown.  There’s no lacing to be found, but a tilt of the glass reveals thick, sugary legs the slowly meander back to the body.  The aroma is nothing short of astounding.  Melted dark chocolate and caramel are rich and decadent.  Figs, cinnamon, and nutmeg add fruity and spicy highlights.  Oaky bourbon and vanilla permeate everything, imparting the signature aroma of something that has been hibernating in a barrel for ages.  The flavor is nearly as great.  Fudge brownies drizzled with caramel come to mind.  Bourbon soaked figs provide further complexity and depth, while candy licorice hints at a light smokiness.  The body is medium-full, slick, and creamy.  Finishes long and chocolaty, with the faintest hint of alcohol burn.  Phenominal, world-class brew.", "rating": "4.2"},

Caramel, alcohol and very dark, bready malts on the aroma. Smoky caramel and dark, dark smooth malts in the flavour.\n\nIncredibly smooth and full it reminds me of an LBV port but with less fruitiness, of course. As I got further into it I noticed more oak and black(?) bread.\n\nIt’s a beer to be enjoyed slowly for sure. I split the (small) bottle with my heterosexual life partner who was probably even more impressed then I with this remarkably crafted beer.\n\nI’m hard pressed to remember a more complex beer than this one.

I’ve wanted to drink this for a long time but knew it had to wait for 1000.  And it seems to have been worth the wait.  This is the 2006 vintage and it pours a beautiful deep deep black with a light brown  head that started frothy and faded to a kind of island.  Nose is huge with notes of chocolate, coffee, and some roasty malts, it’s a damn big nose, speedway has a big nose, peche mortel has a big nose, this nose seems bigger to me, maybe its the moment that is taking over my sense but I’m not sure, it smells pretty damn good.  Taste is pretty damn nice as well, it’s chocolaty, smooth, with bits of coffee and malt and toasted roasted malts.  There is a lot going on here, right now I’ve got a nice coffee bean aftertaste going but the actual taste is pretty diverse and damn fine.  This is pretty damn stellar, and I think I may have to rate it above speedway, I know I know, but its damn good, its damn near perfect.

The aroma is more subtle than the flavor, but a delightful mix of old oak wood, bourbon, cocoa powder and vanilla. The nose increases with warmth into a more warming character of well-rounded bourbon, molasses, soft espresso and alcohol...but not too strong by any means. The flavor extracts the aroma notes and multiplies them to another level entirely. I tasted coconut with chocolate, medium coffee and brown sugar with plenty of oak mixed in. Extremely well-balanced and complex, with the alcohol subdued fantastically. I wouldn’t know this was 10% upon tasting if not for the label. Finishes smooth with incredible mouthfeel.

The drink poured the colour of black treacle with a small beige head, and as I lift it to my lips once again a fury of thunderous claps swirls around. An infuriated Thor was riding his chariot across the storm clouds that were gathered menacingly across Otmoor and wielding his mighty hammer mjollnir. Without delay I sipped this brew as streaks of bright white light flashed all around, the aroma was honey, finest cocoa, and dark sticky fruits, the taste was sumptuous, filling, rich and simply stunning, it was like a cadbury’s flake moment, the taste of marshmallows dipped in the finest chocolate and left to drip all over your hand vanilla, figs and dark sugars make up some of the other flavours. The crackles and bangs continue outside, Thor is busy tonight but I sip again, the full range of flavours literally beats my tastebuds into submission, its almost numb with this full flavoured onslaught.

The dilemma is this, I have convinced myself that this is indeed going to be the singular greatest beer I have yet to consume, causing me to ponder if this will actually live up to the billing.  Upon pouring, my heart races a bit.  A nearly completely light obliterating black, the only glimmer of color is the faintest brown, trying to escape around the edges.  The aromas coming forth are an opus of complexity, the likes of which are rarely attained.  Oak, vanilla, roasted malts, smoke, Valhrona Chocolate, the sugar crust of a creme brulee, Black Mission Figs, date syrup, plums all make their presence known.  Waves of olfactory pleasure engulf my psyche, pulling in more inward into a contemplative state.  I continue to inhale, wondering how this is possible.  The flavor is other worldly.  The roasted flavor is the first to makes its presence known.  As I continue, a light brown caramel teases the senses, sublimely yielding to a playful balance of oak, vanilla and Italian meringue, though ever so slightly.

Bourbon doesn’t affect the flavour nearly as much - no noticeable saltiness or booziness, which I appreciate, but I didn’t detect any oak character either.

Possibly the beer I have drunk the most of without rating. (with the exception of possibly the Cantillon Blåbær.) I wanted to give it the respect it deserved and rate it with a totally fresh palate and that I did on a Thursday afternoon that was to be the beginning of a top 50 fest of beer rating thanks to Harry. Anyway... the beer.\nIt’s black. Totally black. No light penetration what-so-ever. A slight but solid brown head. Certainly the darkest coloured head I have seen in a long time. It’s more akin to chocolate ice cream.\nAroma is superbly roasty and full of amazing hops too. Peaty whiskey, outlandish malt, dark, dark chocolate and some lovely sugar and smoky hints. So incredibly nosable. I was appraoching half way through my glass while Harry was still sniffing at his!\nFlavourwise it is not quite on the level of the aroma but still utterly stunning. Once again, incredible hops are balanced perfectly with the most unreal malt I have tasted. Beautiful rich dark chocolate ice cream, hints of tartness, spice, boozy peaty whiskey notes, utterly gorgeous lip smacking vanilla, viscous, oily and huge alcohol but oh so bloody good. Finish is of biblical proportions and just doesn’t stop. The light sting of alcohol reminds you that this is really serious stuff. Palate. Oh... my... f**king... GOD. Honestly it is unsurpassed by all I have tried previously. Totally unexpected carbonation that is so very good. Fizzes and zings around the mouth and prepares your palate so very well for the following rich velvet cream. Impossible to explain. It’s just stunning.\nOn the way to tipsy after half a bottle. Totally incredible beer. Having had this along side the regular Stormaktsporter I have to say that in all honesty it is hard to pick the winner between the two. Both are stunning but when geeking out and writing numbers the Kaggen just edges it. Oh, another thing, it has the best sediment of any beer ever, I’m convinced of that.

Underlying all that, a building dark chocolate awareness that several sniffs in takes charge. Then eventually is replaces by rum cake. Deep sustained high-cocoa content chocolate flavor--someone playing a \"chocolate\" note on a grand piano and holding down the pedal. Even a minute after a sip the chocolate coats in sticky bitterness. Vanilla sweetness that is tentatively present from the beginning begins to grow, but the iodine bitterness keeps if from getting sticky. \n\nThis is such an interesting beer to beer to be #1.

{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "2005. The body is a scary opaque black, oily with a downward plummeting motion effect from the center outward, like it’s falling into itself. No head forms. Instead, small, piled-up clusters of thin-skinned bubbles flitter to the edges of the glass. The end result bears a distinct resemblance to boiling liquid, where the rising bubbles are restrained by a gelatinous coating that is plastered to the perimeter of the glass. Wow.\n\nI spent half an hour nosing this. Every nuance is so rigid in its foundation and exacting limits, I became positive that I have never been so sure of exactly what I was sensing. A vinous aroma with wildly wrought notes that belie the whiskey barrel heritage broke down as follows...First press sugarcane-coated roasted malts lead the charge. Lightly floral alcohol is seemlessly integrated into the nose. Overripe, sunken-walled oranges and sun-kissed apples are next. The oaken scents resemble freshly splintered wood, imparting vanilla. Hints of Sumatran coffee wafting through a door in a mountain village (I really started to drift away with each successive inhalation). German chocolate cake made by someone with a penchant for adding twice the amount of liquor as the recipe called for. Rum notes, finally, that seemed to have scents identical to the esteemed Ron Zacapa Centenario.\n\nThe flavor showcases mild sweetness deftly counterbalanced by roasty bitterness and late drying from robust alcohol, the likes of which are now more easily discernable. The barrel aging time period appears to have been perfectly calculated for maximum enjoyment; it’s very balanced, not too much, nor too little, for a complimentary flavor addition. A subtle change in an ethereal flavor component takes place - what seemed like an amiable rum and chocolate cake combination in the aroma now tastes like rum cream. The finish is powerful and warming. Alcohol and vanilla linger. A very elegant finale. The palate is caressing and extremely full bodied without ever feeling overbearing. I love the way each part of my tongue and the sides of my cheeks are washed with flavor, then patted dry with alcohol and spicy tannins. \n\nI can’t adequately sum this up, but the numbers should sufficiently relay my experience.", "rating": "4.6"},
{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "Alright, I had the chance to get a sample of that (2005)  in Copenhagen, then I tried the new 2007 version at Oliver twist a few weeks later and retried, some days after, the 2005 thanks to my very generous Göteborg hosts: Marsiblursi. First off, the regular Stormaktsporter is an excellent imperial stout and rather tough to beat in complexity. I don’t quite understand the purpose of setting it in a barrel. It is apparently a rather short journey that it takes (2,5months), yet the effect is considerable as bourbon is obvious in the nose, but the low duration has allowed the body to keep most of its thickness, silkiness and richness. \n So what do I think about it? Well, first off, I prefered the 2005 version which is 1% lighter and more developped and rounded around the edges at this point. The 2007 is still a fair bit boozy. The 2005’s complexity is more obvious and the concentrated fruitiness from the regular comes across more naturally. Appearance-wise, they both wear a fair diminishing dark beige head. Totally opaque, oily body, pitch black. The 2007 actually left legs on the glass. Gentle alcohol flavours, rum-soaked grapes, heady nose with wild leather smokiness, mint, vanilla (strong), chocolate roastiness and hard to pick up single fruits. Complex nuances, age-worthy, silky full body with honeyed and brown sugar tones. Very creamy, smooth carbonation. it manages to feel quite vinous at the same time, full on truffles, earth mushrooms powderiness and growing date square undertones. You can eventually all kinds of little nuances, which is the sign of a great beer. Still, at the end, I’m not convinced I prefer the barrel version and remain unconvinced that the rarity does not make me try harder to pick out stuff. Certainly a fine experience though. I’ll just give both Stormakts the same score.. but it is a sipper and I’m less into those that I once was.", "rating": "4.1"},

Some cola and soy sauce like notes could also be detected. You feel the warmth of alcohol but no evidence of alcohol over the palate. Full bodied with a smooth texture.

Somehow it manages to present an entirely different (and worse) aroma of this beer than the delicious treat my friends’ glasses have shown.  So I’m combining the two into some sort of amalgam.  Starts briefly with a very raw acetone nose, some grapey and intense black rum-cake notes as well.  Fudge liqueur, boozier than the regular Stormaktsporter, and with some tangy wood-solvent in the nose that fades later.  Flavor is amazing, with rich ash-rum and black raisiny chewiness and some almost overpowering sweetness that just drops out with perfect elegance into a deep, dry, ashen and faintly cocoa-flavored trail-- grainy like a black-and-white, low-light photograph.  The flavor depth that these elite Scandinavian breweries somehow routinely extract from their malt bills is absolutely astounding.  Somewhat thinner, drier mouthfeel than its silky sister; fluffier and slightly more scratchy carbonation.  Tobacco all over the finish.  This is a fabulous beer and deserving of all the praise, but I still prefer it in its more drinkable state, untainted by the funnel of whiskey saturation.  Thanks so much, Per!", "rating": "4.4"},
{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "2005 Vintage from Akkurat, Stockholm. \n\nPours oily jet black, with a beautiful creamy brown head rising ever so slowly from the body. First note of the aroma was bourbon, and quite a lot of it, undertones of vanilla oak, bitter dark chocolate, rye bread, honey sweetness and a hint of smoke. It didn’t blow me away like I’d expected, but was very enjoyable nonetheless. To the first sip, the mouthful was so perfect, slick and heavy, but so smoothly carbonated. Sensational, exactly what I’d expect from a great Imperial Stout. \nFlavours of oak and vanilla run through the first impression, followed by a boozy rumminess, dark chocolate truffle, rye bread and some earthiness. From memory, this was quite different to the un-kaggen version in that it had a far more boozy flavour and finish to it, despite the lower abv. The finish is also quite bitter and smokey, in a stunning kind of way. \n\nOverall I’d say its approaching perfection, but probably not my favorite beer ever.

The aroma had just a remarkable rich vinous and plum character that formed a perfect complement to the lightly-burnt dark chocolate and coffee malts at the core.. additional layers of complexity evolve throughout the drink, with vanilla, oak, and ever-so-slight bourbon in one wave, darker honey in another, and mild smoky caramel beyond that... just hard to fathom how so many wonderful components can be blended so intricately. \n\n Semi-sweet honey accompanies the rich tapestry of dark chocolate and fresh coffee onto the palate.. a sweet wash of bourbon sugars and vanilla comes before the drink is halfway completed.. well-toasted caramel, smoky tobacco, and dark fruits blanket the back-end, then coffee and woodsy bitterness accent the warm and magnificent finish.  This falls between medium and heavily-bodied, with just enough carbonation to keep it moving.. the flavors wash over the proper taste buds with surgical precision.. the long, warm, vibrant finish leaves great satisfaction, save for the realization that this remarkable exilir may never touch my lips again.  Just brilliant!  \n\n 2006 bottle thanks to Craig!  Poured rich, inky black with a great initial cap of tan head.  After a couple minutes to breathe, rich bourbon and vanilla really came to light.. layers of dark chocolate and roasty black patent malts.. mild smoke and some oak.. sweeter uptake at the back with mild alcohol.  Deeply-roasted dark chocolate and molasses roll elegantly onto the palate with trails of vanilla and some smokiness.. bourbon fills in the back and nasel passages.. thickens up toward the finish with roasty chocolate and mild coffee bitterness.. long, sweeter finish with a perfect blend of barrel and stout.

{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "From a 25cL Bottle, Vintage 2005.  \nPours an incredibly dense chocolatey black color, inpenetrable by light, with a silky foam of caramelized marshmellow floating lightly on top.  A gentle swirl leaves some nice lacing streaks on the sides of my snifter glass and is enough to keep the chocolate island atop alive and healthy.  To be honest, my meditations on the appearance of this brew were distracted by a sneak preview of the aroma, which immediately blew me away, making me feel all giddy while at the same time forgetting completely about the appearance of the beer.  For one who diligently tries to capture the art of every beer consumed by photograph, this was quite a feat, although sadly, I wish I had a picture now to remember this experience by.  Onward.  Thick, intoxicatingly rich bouquet thats brimming over with bourbon soaked prunes that have been flambeed with a decadent caramel crust. Some softer fruits linger as well, almost like banana (although not the phenolic kind) crusted with some flaked coconut and sticky wildflower honey.  Some very mild vanilla bean and gentle chocolate fudge rounds out the bouquet nicely.  Like with the non-barrel aged version, I find it exciting to be tasting a beer that relies mostly on the intricacies of its malt profile to form the complexity, rather than relying on the polarizing roast, char, and alpha hops characters that so many of the other highly rated beers on this site use to set themselves apart from their categorical peers.  On that same note, the barrel character seems to be playing a supporting role in this cast, rather than the lead.  Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  A massive wave of complexity confronts my taste buds as soon as palate contact is made.  It starts ot with an incredible dry chocolate base thats enhanced by the caramelly bourbon  notes without getting too hot.  There’s a smooth transition where some dark, chewy, leathery characters begin to come out, and these are accented by a touch of tartness taking the form of prune skin tannins.  The finish is a remarkable display of balance, as the toasty, oaky characters come through strong by dancing on the edge of roastiness.  The palate is exceptionally long and clean, with all alcohols clearly masked; excellent example of extracting the great barrel traits without leeching out any of the negative.  A masterpiece.

{"product_name": "Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter", "product_review": "Sat down with the brewers from Närke on Friday October 24, 2008 at the SMÖF 2008 festival. We teamed up the 05 vs 06 vs 07. Didn’t take notes, but it was truly special!\n\nHad this again now on Christmas Eve, shared a bottle with my wife just because I had the chance, did it at The Rover, Göteborg.\nExcellent nice dark black color. Rich nose and taste, close to perfect!\n\nFirst and second ratings.\nDraught, sampled at the brewery. It’s like their \"\"\"\"Stormaktsporter\"\"\"\" but bigger and better. More body, more taste, more powerful. Vanilla and oak in the scent and taste, as well as coffee. Pitch black look to it. Very nice, but something you might not drink too much of I guess, due to the high alcohol level.\n\nAlso tried as bottle on RBESG 2006, aged some, still great.\n8/5/8/5/17=4.3\n\nThird rating.\n(25 cl bottle at The Rover, Göteborg)\nBought a bottle for myself, I wanted to re-rate and really enjoy this one. Screw the price!\nBlack look with a thick brown head. No transparency at all! Totally pitch black and gourgeous.\nSweet oily thick scent. Alcohol, some vanilla and bourbon whiskey smell as well. The vanilla and bourbon scent becomes more intense when the glass becomes emptier and the brew is warmed up and oxygenized. Smooth velvet mouthfeel. Smooth initial taste, transforming via tar and smoke towards rubber and warming alcohol. Taste is also chocolate and coffee when warmer, mostly chocolate though. Medium high bitterness. Long nice lasting aftertaste.\nExtremely smooth, nice and friendly, too bad it’s fairly expensive and rare...\nIt’s worth it to buy a bottle to enjoy yourself though.\n9/5/9/5/19=4.7\n\nFifth or so sample.\nShared a bottle with a friend at The Rover, Göteborg.\nPitch black color, rich brown head. Sweet rich raissin and coffee scent. Also scome alcohol, still very soft and very nice. Smell is also a touch of smoke and rubber, mixed with vanilla. I spent roughly 3 minutes looking at the beer and perhaps 10 smelling it before I even let the glass near my mouth, it’s just amazing, fantastic and all the big words together! Extremely big, large, huge, all of it, full rich palate, smooth and oily, best ever! Long chocolate and smoke aftertaste. Sweet sirupy taste, coffee and chocolate, smoke and rubber, also vanilla taste. This beer grows even better every time I drink it, and I can honestly say it’s the best beer I’ve ever had. I don’t like the use of 5.0 for a beer, what happens when you try something better? re-rate? But this one is truly worth it! A shame it’s almost gone. Luckily the new one is coming...\n10/5/10/5/20=5.0\n\nLast(?) rating: \nI had a bottle stored at The Rover in Göteborg, waiting for a special occasion. Then my favourite ice hockey team won gold in the Swedish Championships about 2 weeks back, so now the bottle is gone. I was quite sober though, only high on adrenalin, so it didn’t go to waste, I fully enjoyed every last drop of it.\n\n\n\nFirst rating of the 2006 version\n(Bottle at The Rover, Göteborg)\n10%\nPitch black color, big brown head, lovely! Oak and vanilla scent, also some salt and the northern Swedish ocean/Baltic sea at fall smell. Smell is also sweet, grains and alcohol. Honey and heather in there as well, though the oak is rather dominant. Chocolate, roasted, sweet malt, melted vnilla ice-cream, coffee taste. Roasted, sweet coffee aftertaste. Thick, oily, smooth mouthfeel, medium high bitterness. Very, very nice, though I want it to age perhaps 6 months or so to mellow out and improve even more. Close to perfection!\n9/5/10/5/19=4.8\n\nTried this the other day at the brewery, 2006 version.\nSerious vanilla/oak nose to begin with, more than I have sensed before.\nNice long chocolate finish after it has warmed for a while.\nI think it’s lovely just to sit down and enjoy it!\n\n\nNew rating, 2006 version from a pub in Göteborg\nPitch black color, brown head. Vanilla and oak, alcohol and grains, sweet and raissin scent. Chocolate, oak, raissins, figs, some spices, alcohol, sweet taste. Wood as well. Smooth silk like mouthfeel laced with alcohol. Medium bitterness.\n9/5/10/5/19=4.8\n\nRerate\nDraught at EBF 2008, on Saturday September 13\n2007 version\nBlack color, brown head. Sweet malty, very vanilla, big oak scent. Lots of oak and vanilla, mixed with alcohol, taste. Smooth full mouthfeel, medium high bitterness.

UND BESTES BIER DER WELT!!!\nDas Westvleteren 12 führt einige Tasting Listen an und ist auf Youtube auch unter dem Begriff \"Bestes Bier der Welt\" zu finden. Es kommt dunkelbraun mit beiger, gemischtporiger Krone ins Glas, die eine mittlere Standfestigkeit hat. Der Geruch erinnert an einen Mostkeller mit hohem erdigen Anteil. Besonders auffällig ist der Alkohol. Beim Antrunk hatte ich eine Geschmacksexplosion erwartet, die einen sofort und für immer umhaut. Nichts dergleichen. Das Quadrupel kommt dezent mit Pflaume, Likär, Beeren, Vanille, Zartbitterschokolade und leichtem Karamell rüber. Dabei ist das Bier leicht süß aber gerade noch so, dass es richtig männlich ist. Bestimmt bekomme ich für den Kommentar wieder Haßposts. Ich erahne noch weitere Aromen, möchte sie aber aus Unsicherheit nicht benennen. Zweite Verkostung nötig. Ich habe gar nicht gemerkt, dass das Bier schon fast leer ist, deshalb nun der Abgang: Der Alkohol gewinnt an Dominanz und bringt zusammen mit der Hopfung eine merkliche und sehr gut abgestimmte Bitterkeit ins Spiel. So können die vorher genannten Aromen, die immer noch da sind, in einem anderen Licht erlebt werden. Absolut phantastisch gelöst. Garantiert ist das das beste Quadrupel, das ich je getrunken habe. Zu dem besten Bier: ich glaube nicht, dass dieses Bier in Kuba am Strand bei 34 Grad das beste ist oder es einem Radler Liebhaber gefallen würde. Deshalb ist der Begriff für mich auch lächerlich und für jeden Betrachter anders.

Obviously, I'm looking forward to drinking aged examples in the coming years...\nPours a hazy dark amber to brown with a stable, foamy, tan head. Very expressive aroma of tawny port, red wine, wood, red apple slices, dried banana, pear, overripe blue plum, brown bread, baker's yeast, artisan milk chocolate, chestnut. Taste has a sweet estery mix of blue plum, red apple, dried banana & raisin in a thick brown-bready, slightly toasty, somewhat chocolatey malt body with a hint of candi sugar, but never in a cloying way, surrounded by a spicy and a dry-yeasty note, and even a sourish dark-fruity streak. The herbal & peppery hoppy finish offers more dried & candied fruits, spices and 'dry' brown bread and even a very vague hint of coffee. The whole is topped off with a noble, vinous warmth of brandy-like alcohol. Medium to full body, creamy-moussy texture, average carbonation (toning down when warming up).

I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all.

Bottiglia in edizione speciale XII, BB 02/12/2014, dunque imbottigliata nel dicembre 2009. Invecchiata per quasi 12 anni. Schiuma praticamente assente, colore marrone scuro non torbido ma con molti lieviti sospesi anche al primo colpo. Carbonazione leggera. Al naso enorme complessità, su tutto caramello, frutta secca e di bosco, sentori erbacei. In bocca leggermente acquosa ma allo stesso tempo di buon corpo. Caramello e i tipici derivati dell'ossidazione dominano la bevuta, la frutta rimane sullo sfondo. Arriva poi uno delizioso amaro che porta diverse pennellate erbacee e floreali, accentuando anche il resto dei sentori. Finale dolce ma secco, che assume anche una nota acida e tostata quando la birra sale di temperatura, oltre a un pelo di liquirizia. La transizione tra amaro e il finale è il più grande pregio di questa birra.\nUn viaggio in un sorso, estremamente complessa ed elegante nonostante 11 anni di invecchiamento.

The difference are massive.\nIf we clear that lets go to the review.\nWhen i open the beer one punchy full of flavors aroma fill my roam from nowhere. The aroma cover my entire room for fun. But the most shock thing wasent the aroma but the taste. When the beer touch my mouth, it bites my tongue and cover my entire mouth with insane flavors that i never had again. I had feel the same thing only once from \"Rochefort 10\" that also bites your tongue and your mouth very aggressive. But \"Westvleteren 12\" do that more aggressively. The beer has the best mouthfeel i ever get from anything in my life. \nThe taste is so complex and so unique. The beer is very sweet and at the same time bitter with a lot of caramel, chocolate, fruity notes. And the finish it has 3 long directions. In the beginning it gives you one aggressive and punchy bitterness and in some secs that become sweet and again it change in some warm bitterness at the end. Really i cant described that. The feeling was mind blowing. The carboration is little high for one \"Quadrupel\" beer but it stick perfectly here.\nOverall the best beer i have get/tried today.

The color of the beer and the look and feel of the foam are just... right.

It has many of the tastes you expect from a dark trappist, dark fruits, nuts and all that other nonsense which I am not good at describing, but what sets this one apart from the rest of the trappists, and other belgian triples and quadruples for that matter, is a taste I can best describe as a soft bitterness.

Complex malt delivers a rich Christmas cake base with strong fruit notes of syrupy dates, raisins, damsons, prunes with barley sugar twist. Earthy, damp note to the subtle hop content delivers a short but balanced flavour to the aftertaste. Finish is malty with Cognac booze notes not overwhelming the malt character but you know the strength is there.

Côté visuel, rien à redire, on est proche de la 8 avec une brun foncé limpide surmonté d'une mousse crémeuse de 1,5 cm. Le nez est de façon surprenante voire inquiétante très discret. On y trouve tout de même un alcool aux accents de cognac, du candy et des fruits avec de la prune et de la poire. Le tout étant peu intense. Heureusement la dégustation est toute autre ! Et, si l'intensité de cette Westleveren XII n'est pas la plus incroyable au monde, elle fait preuve d'un équilibre exceptionnel qui en ferait devenir saint tout diablotin (est-ce là une stratégie des moines pour évangéliser la Belgique ?). Cette bière est classieuse, avec un alcool affirmé, sur des airs de cognac, mais pas agressif et s'alliant parfaitement à l'amertume et à une base maltée ou le pruneau prend les devants sans être prédominants. Obtenir un tel équilibre est forcément le fruit de très longues années d'expériences et d'une maîtrise du brassage hors norme. Donc merci aux moines d'avoir œuvré en ce sens et d'avoir protégé un patrimoine unique. Mais revenons à la dégustation. Par rapport à la 8, ce qui change et bien entendu l'alcool, qui prend ici beaucoup plus de caractère tout en restant très bien intégré, mais également les épices, moins présente ici et avec des arômes de pruneau plus développés. La complexité est excellente dès l'attaque qui reprend les arômes développés par le nez avec en complément des notes de candy et de poivre. La seconde bouche prend davantage ses aises et sur l'arrière bouche, ce sont les épices et le pruneau qui prennent l'ascendant. Le final, très long marque un mariage de l'alcool et de l'amertume assez remarquable tout comme l'est cette bière. A savoir ensuite si c'est la meilleure bière du monde, je pense finalement que cette question n'a pas de sens. Que demande-t-on à une bière? En premier et avant tout d'être équilibrée et en second lieu de nous donner de l'émotion. Et si le premier point est factuel, le deuxième est très personnel. Chacun d'entre nous sera plus sensible à l'intensité, à l'amertume, à l'alcool ou à la complexité. Comme dans la quête de tout Graal, l'important est avant tout dans le chemin, les bières découvertes jour après jour, l'expérience acquise mais surtout dans les rencontres faites tout au long de ce chemin qui sont pour moi une source d'enrichissement inégalable. Et je remercie donc cette Westlevern XII pour tout cela. Une émotion est peu de chose si elle n'est pas partagée.", "rating": "5.0"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "A 330ml bottle with a cap date (bottled +3 years) of 1st September 2019. Poured into a Chimay goblet glass. After a careful pour to leave most of the yeast in the bottle, it was a clear brown colour with a copper red hue and a just over one finger off white head that had great retention, but eventually settled to a very nice self replenishing cap while leaving great lacing around the glass. Aromas of strong fruitiness, apple, plum, dates, fig, toffee with light clove and banana notes. Tastes sweet, plum, dates, fig, banana bread, toffee, yeast and a touch of spice. Creamy, medium to full bodied, with moderate carbonation. Overall, I’m not a huge fan of sweetness, and this definitely leans on the sweet side, perhaps overly so for me. I prefer both Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12 over this.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Amazing aromas and flavours, a refreshing beer with many different flavours and a great balance between the flavours and aromas. The character changes with temperature, the flowerness, perfumeness vary with temperature and transforms into more of a caramel/burnt caramel and abit more bitterness to it. \nI believe one of the secrets to success when it comes to both Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12, is that the tasting experience, aromas and flavours change with time and temperature. The nose and palett never get used to the same flavours and aromas. New unique aromas and flavours keep these beers interesting, especially the Westvleteren 12. There is always something new to discover when you put your nose in the glass of a Westvleteren 12. For being such a strong beer, there is very little alcohol aroma or flavour. It adds to the flavours and experience but it does not overwhelm the experience. The Rochefort 10 has alot more alcohol presence both in aromas and flavours, and can come across boozy. Despite there is not that big difference in alcohol 11.3 % in Rochefort 10 and 10.2% in Westvleteren 12, the difference in experience is very big. The sensation of tickling/numbness is just present in Westvleteren 12 whereas in the Rochefort 10 it is very prominent. \n\nThe Westvletern 12 has a larger range of flavours and aromas than the Rochefort 10. It doesn´t have as long after taste and has a more refreshing, lighter quality and not just as chunky or decadent as the Rochefort 10. The Westvleteren 12 has not pointy aromas or flavours that urge you to take another sip. Everytime you put your nose in the glass, there are some new aromas to discover and where as the Rochefort can get a bit \"dull\" at the very end of the tasting experience, the Westevleteren 12 remain a refreshing feeling. One could ask for a bit longer after taste, to par with the Rochefort 10, that would have been fantastic. However, this beer is more complex, more balanced, has more aromas and flavours, is less boozy and never gets dull compared to Rochefort 10. Overall this is the very best beer I have ever had, and I line up in the choir to praise this beer from Westvleteren as the very best beer in the world.

Looking forward to visiting the abbey shop in November where I can hopefully pick up samples of the other Westy brews. \n\n\nRe-rated April 2018: Left a bottle \"condition\" for another six months. A bit more fullness to the flavour. Unsure if I have matured alongside this beer, but can definitely pick apart more complex fruity, caramel style notes. Thick, airy head with the yeast resting on top stayed with me all the way to the end. Strong, typical Belgian fizzy carbonation with a massive alcoholic bite but incredibly smooth.

Aromat fenomenalny. Odjąłem punkt za wygląd, bo wydawał mi się strasznie jasny, jak na quadrupla. Bardzo słodki, nie za dużo ciała, ładnie wyczuwalna wiśnia.

Als Willkommens Trunk gab es erstmal ein seit mehr als 10 Jahren abgelaufenes Westvleteren XII. Was für eine trübe, braune Brühe kam da aus der Flasche. Wow! Im Glas gab es keinen Schaum und null Kohlensäure. Das Ding war tot, aber verdammt lecker. In Nase und am Gaumen fette Waldhonignote, etwas Harz und eine schöne Malzigkeit. In der Runde kam zurecht der Vergleich mit Met auf. Schön zu wissen was in der langen Reifezeit aus diesen sensationellen Bier geworden ist. 10/4/10/5/20\nAus der Flasche (bbe 21-04-2019) 2018-04 getrunken. Diees Batch des W12 ist deutlich gehopft für ein Quadrupel. Die Balance zwischen den sonstigen typsischen Aromen so sehr harmonisch abgestimmt.

In der mehr als 2 Jahren Flaschenreifung sind nun die deutlich Hopfennoten deutlich in der Hintergrund gerückt und eine vollmundige Malznote und leichtes Honigaroma bestimmen nun dieses Batch. So mag ich es lieber. 10/4/9/5/18\nAus der Flasche (bbe 14.08.2023) im 2021-12 getrunken. Diese Westvleteren startet mit einer kräftigen stabilen, beigen Schaumbildung, die fast wie ein Deckel kaum Aromen aus dem Glas entweichen läßt. Etwas später dann leichte malzige und etwas kräuteraritge Aromen sind wahrnehmbar. Am Gaumen ist es malzig und immer noch leicht Bitter durch den Hopfeneinfluss. Aber es ist ,auch etwas leichter im Körper im Verhältnis zu dem hohen Alkoholgehalt. Mir gefallen die Westvleteren XII am besten wenn das bbe abgelaufen ist.

Also, there’s a few sprinkles on the top of the head from the sediment.\n\nThe smell has a realy dark fruity nose to it, raisin-prine-plum-fig, along with some chocolate, yeast, coffee, and yeah, a bit of the alcohol.\n\nThe taste on first sip has the dark fruits at center stage. Subtly sweet portions of plum, raisin, fig, some dark cherry, a touch of chocolate and cofee(and I do mean just a touch) and a slight bitterness in the form of some citrus near the tail end of the sip and it carries on right through the finish where I also get some of the alcohol that warms the throat during the swallow. This is so darn complex that I fear my words will not do it justice but hey, I’m doing the best I can. ;^)\n\nOk, I’m about 2/3rds of the way through my glass and the chocolate is a bit more pronounced now and that simply adds to how silky smooth the mouthfeel is. And look at all that sticky lacing on the sides of my glass!\n\nThis is the second of my bottles I’ve tasted(the last one was shortly after I received them) and I’m as impressed now as I was then....a 2 year span. \n\nBottom line: Yeah, I spent a few bucks to get my bottles of Westvletern 12(and 8) and I could have bought lots of other beers for the cost but, I feel that the money was spent well. I’ve had other quadrupels before and I liked them. I’m partial to the style. Is this the best example of the style that I’ve had to date? You darn tootin. Is it because of the scarcity factor? No. It’s because my palate tells me that it is *that* damn good. Complexity in the taste? This has it. Complexity that has all the flavours working in harmony? This has it. A great looking appearance in a glass? This has it. A nose that keeps you sniffing before every sip? This has it. A mouthfeel that is both silky smooth and chewy at the same time? This comes very close. Drinkability that goes through the roof? Just about. So, would I buy some again? At current prices?(US$18 per bottle plus shipping from Belgium) Maybe, but if it was as \"easily\" available as other examples of the style, I’d buy it by the case.", "rating": "4.5"},

It was far better then the food and was easily the high point of our trip to the city. It was so good I had a second for desert. I would have enjoyed a third if I hadn’t been with friends that wanted to get going.\n Later I had the opportunity to enjoy the others they produce but they were very good but not this good.\n A year later my friend in Antwerpen sent me 6 bottles. 2 of each of their production and I was thrilled to no end. After 100’s of beers, this is still one of my favorites. I’m looking forward to searching some more out on my visit next month. I might even take a trip to the abbey if possible.", "rating": "4.9"},

La douceur n’est cependant jamais excessive, comme jugulée par une certaine fraicheur (surette) et une amertume qui se redéveloppe en fin de bouche. Alcool très bien intégré qui ne perce pas. Fine pour une quadruple, tire vers la texture huileuse. Bière très ronde, de corps moyen pour le style. Un exemple d’équilibre, de complexité et pourtant d’accessibilité.", "rating": "4.6"},

Perhaps the greatest difference is the more pungent aroma of alcohol in this one, while the Bernardus seemed to be mellower. This is a reasonably fresh one, maximum 6 months old. This dark amber beer has those fruits in the cellar holding the main backbone of the aroma and taste. Alcohol on the aroma to start with, stronger, with freshly tanned leather and an explosion of apples, plums, peaches and apricots, old books and wooden crates, wicker baskets and dusty curtains, dark empty wine bottles and firewood, both on the aroma and flavours. It’s all so round and timeless, with sweet malts, vanilla and yeast…roasted almonds…wine… prunes…honey, tobacco leaves … wow!

It’s extremely flavorful and it sticks around, laces the glass, and all those things you’d want to see in a great beer. Best I’ve ever had? Unsure. Worth hunting for the taste? Sure, why not.

Pours clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with a only a light warmth present after the finish. Overall this is an insane quadrupel style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Very similar to Abt 12; but this one had more nutty/biscuity malt complexity and a better mouthfeel. A highly amazing offering all around, as I had hoped for.", "rating": "4.5"},

Pleasant rich alcoholic sweetness of rum raisins. Faint yeasty aroma with formic tartness on the nose. Subtle spice like cinnamon.\n\nMouthfeel is alcoholic and syrupy. There is adequate carbonation which is balances out the palate very nicely. Palate is ponderous with dark roasty flavors up front: espresso, dark chocolate, almost burnt barley toast, there is just enough breadth in the palate for an umami component to suggest burnt char siew ends. The middle of the palate is nicely rounded and endowed with fruity flavors: ripe dark cherries, honey plums, dates, prunes and stewed fruit. Because of the residual from the front of the palate, you get the impression of cherry liqueur dark chocolate candies. The palate is surprisingly light riding on a whisky smoky, alcoholic palate. No cloying sweetness. All the carbs in this this have been turned to beautiful aromatic alcohol.\n\nFinish is clean without the expected cloy. \n\nOverall impression. Dangerously approachable.

I am finally beginning to realize that I must not like really good beer, go figger. From a bottle this beer poured a darker brew but not real dark, more of a lighter brown. Had a decent head that faded rapidly to a thin creamy foam which provided nice lacing. Initial taste impression was strong yet smooth and somewhat civilized and this is nothing out of the ordinary for many lower rated beers. Warming sensations as it transversed my mouth to the gullet. Some unexpected bitterness in the session, I thought it could have a few more manners. However, for 10% it did not provide an alky impact that was in yer face, tho it certainly was apparent and somewhat volatile on the olfactory -I guess that was a good thing. Flavors were simply alky laced old country trappest beer, nothing more. Decent co2, but not half the effect of a good Orval. The finish was the kind of feeling that you get when you drink a medium good trippel or even a misbehaved dubbel. So, overall, another letdown. I waited 10 years to try this and the build up to this night’s tasting was not worth it but I was finally glad to get this off my bucket list. If you want a good quad experience, Sierra Nevada Ovila Quad is much better than this brew, JMHO.

It took me just shy of seven years here on RateBeer to get to 1000 ratings, so why not make it what is still rated as the best beer in the world? Bottle from the \"brick\" that Westvleteren made available by the monks on 12.12.12, purchased at Holiday Wine Cellar where Mark graciously held one of the bricks for me while I was out of town on business ($84.99 for six-pack \"brick\" with two glasses). My firstborn child was born on 10.28.2012 and I assume that this was packaged around the same time as his birth...will save and age a couple of the bottles for sharing with him on his 18th or 21st birthday (previously drank two bottles so I still have three left). POURS a deep brown hue with red/purple/garnet highlights and two fingers of loud fizzy beige foam that reduced to one finger but holds. AROMA is quite complex with various notes of raisins and other dried/candied fruit (cherries, figs, dates), tawny port, buttery caramel, honey, Belgian yeast, and mild Christmas spicing. FLAVOR is equally complex with notes of port wine, dark grapes, thick toffee, molasses, overripe dark fruit, sweet dark berries, nutty malts, dry oak, and hints of chocolate and dry spice. Flavor definitely becomes richer as it warms...each sip reveals a different nuance than the previous one. Odd that such a high ABV beer has such big carbonation, but it adds to the mouthfeel and perception of flavor. The high alcohol is utterly concealed and it is not too heavy on the palate, making this a very easy quaff. Amazing that this much flavor and complexity can be coaxed from the basic beer ingredients (plus candi sugar) alone without barrel aging...though I think my own three years of cellar aging has helped.

The current average score is a phenomenal 4.44, but will it live up to the massive hype? Let’s see. Pours a dark brown body with a medium tall beige head. Aroma has some fresh dark bread, Belgian yeast, ripe grapes, prunes. Hoppiness is dry and earthy. Taste is very smooth, there’s caramel, prunes, a bready note here and there. Grapey notes emerge occasionally. Finish adds something mildly nutty. The alcohol is generally smooth and presents itself as a warm afterglow. In comparison to other Trappist beers, I think taste-wise it’s actually closest to an aged bottle of Rochefort 8. I don’t see too big similarities with St. Bernardus Abt 12, which is the beer that gets compared to this one the most. The only thing in common seems to be the nutty aftertaste. In comparison to Rochefort 10, it’s smoother and more easily drinkable but the level of complexity is not quite up there. So my favourite Trappist after Orval remains Rochefort 10. This one deserves a solid \"4\" but not much more. It is a great beer but certainly not the best beer in the world and not even the best Trappist.", "rating": "4.0"},

I’m not sure what was more difficult. Obtaining a bottle of this, or mastering the pronunciation of the brewery. I really wanted to save this for my 1838th rating (matching the year the historic brewery first opened), but that’s a tough waiting game to play, and I can’t hold a backlog for more than a few days. I wish I could have tried this in a blind situation, to know for sure if this is as incredible as it seems. One thing that is for certain, upon pouring this, my first thought was \"this is a beautiful beer.\" Best by 9/30/2018, so according to my researched math, this is pretty damn fresh. Shipped to me with prompt and precision by Beer of Belgium. Thanks guys! I’ll contact you guys again for sure. Pours a dark, ruby, dusty brown color with a swirl of tan active fizz head. It’s hard to put a hyped beer like this into words, when I’ve been dying with curiosity on the subject for as long as I’ve enjoyed beer. Tried my best to pour this at the proper cellar temp. I feel like I got it as close as its gonna get. Sweet plum like aroma. Flavor is very complex with raisin, smooth semi sweet. Rum like hints throughout. Oakey. Has a very nice warming palate that gets better and better. By far the smoothest, finest drinking quad I’ve ever had. In a style that is always a rough go for me, this is a masterpiece for sure.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Bottle at Sin & Redemption in Toronto. The bottle was CAD 22, which makes € 15.2 - for comparison, at Get Well they said it was CAD 40! No info about bottling date or BB. (Edit: ah, that was on the cap... didn’t get to see that!)\n\n\n\nPoured carefully into a Duvel chalice. Dark, murky, coppery brownish colour with a thin layer of light beigeish head that seems to be thickening as the bubbles rise in the middle. Looks really funny and entertaining. It really is increasing rather than decreasing - WTF? How is this possible?! .... Massive amounts of bits n pieces floating around. The head retains until the very end. The aroma strikes at first as brandy-like, but not at all overly so (it’s rather cold at the moment), it’s malty and plummy, nutty. Estery fruitiness, a bit of old basement dust and rotten apples. As it warms, I even get some chocolate. The first sip leaves a lip-shaped hole in the foam. It’s really sweet, caramelly, jammy, it fills the mouth the moment you touch it with your tongue. No alcohol felt, but I love how it maintains its brandy- or cognac-like character I got in the aroma. The carbonation is active, body full. Really nice soothing warmth in the throat, nearing heat really. The alcohol stays out of sight, only appearing as this increasing warmth in the throat. It’s got that same problem I have with strong, caramel-forward beers - even if they’re excellent at first, they later (half-way through) begin to aqcuire a metallic taste and shallow mouthfeel. Maybe it’s the palate-numbing alcohol? All in all I must say, it lives up to the hype. Loved it. I really did.\n\n\n\nThe moment I arrived back home, I learned they now sell it in many places in Tallinn. Damn it. At least the bottle I had was way cheaper.\n\n\n\nEdit: another try, a while later. Got a bottle from Uba ja Humal in Tallinn, for € 17-18. BB 11.03.2018. The head is much less as entertaining as it was when I last (first) had it. Massive bits still floating... Even though I’ve had it sit still in the fridge for months... The head retains but only as an uneven film. Lace? Somewhat. Aroma and flavour still similar to what I’ve written above. But seems boozier than before. Less as interesting. Wouldn’t rate it as high now... Damn. What the hell, was the initial 4.3 really because of the hype? Or is my palate that much numbed? (Currently my 3rd beer of the night.) Pretty harsh on the palate too - thin and very active carbonation... Hm.\n\n\n\nI gave it 5/5 appearance last time, that must have been for the ’entertaining’ head, but now, goddamn, it doesn’t look good! Lowering from 5 to 3. Palate goes from 4 to 3...

The pour is a muddy dark brown with a thin light brown ring of head no lace. The aroma is definitely a little hot, which is a little surprising for me. There is a wonderful caramel malt and a dark fruit presence that is really nice. There is just such a complexity and I love it! The flavor is really good also. Caramel, dark fruits, and figs accompany a brilliant butterscotch. There is a little bit of an apple cider finish to it, which is way too smooth. The mouth feel is thick and creamy, without being chewy. The carbonation is soft and lovely. The finish is lingeringly malty with a little apple skin zing. I love this beer.", "rating": "4.4"},

Chociaż jeśli chodzi o balans to zdecydowanie po stronie słodyczy jest. Piwo ma sporo ciała i jest wysycone klasycznie dla takich belgów, czyli raczej wysoko, warto je odgazować nieco, by wyczuć więcej. Goryczka jest raczej niska a alkohol całkiem dobrze ukryty.

Er zitten ook zoete tonen in van gedroogd fruit en karamel, droge tonen van de specerijen en een perfecte bittere finish door de gebruikte hopsoorten. Het mondgevoel geeft een mooie carbonatie door en een zacht bitter smaakpallet in de afdronk. Naarmate het bier opwarmt komt de alcohol steeds nadrukkelijker naar voren, maar de balans blijft perfect. De afdronk is lang en zacht bitter. Is het dan de beste Trappist? Naar mijn idee wel, maar de Rochefort 10 doet er weinig voor onder. Dit geldt ook voor het abdij bier Sint Bernardus Abt. 12 die ook heel dichtbij deze smaakbeleving komt. Deze ga ik zo proeven ter vergelijking. Verder zeer veel respect voor de monniken van Westvleteren, voor dit uitzonderlijk Belgisch biergenot, wat met toewijding en geduld wordt gebrouwen.\n\nVergelijk Westvleteren 12 en Sint Bernardus Abt 12: De bieren lijken op elkaar, maar de Westvleteren heeft een verfijnder aroma dan de Sint Bernardus, ook iets zachter van smaak en iets verfijnder en subtieler qua complexiteit en smaaklagen.Toch net iets lekkerder. De Sint Bernardus is iets scherper en kruidiger, maar komt toch heel dichtbij betreft smaak en aroma. Een goedkoper maar toch volwaardig alternatief. Beide bieren zijn uitstekende quadrupels en van een zeer hoog niveau, maar de Westvleteren heeft mijn voorkeur, door het meer verfijnde aroma en smaakpallet. De gebruikte gist is toch verschillend. Deze bieren horen beide tot de beste Belgische bieren die er zijn. Maar de Westvleteren 12 is onovertroffen.", "rating": "4.8"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "330ml bottle share with anstei. So I finally get to try this legendary beer. Dark brown color with small crisp head that disappears quickly. Aroma immediately gives candied sugar and dark fruits, forest strawberry, but also a maltiness there. The maltiness doesn’t go away, can’t be unseen now... Taste is rich, candied sugary, dark fruits, spices. Finish is heavy and sweet, with a nice hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is extremely crispy-foamy. Spices, berries maybe, sugar Liquorice and a bit boozy. More balanced than the Rochefort 10, but not as balanced as Bernardus. Interesting that these three Champions League beers of the Quadrupel style are all so different in their characteristics. A superb beer, but this maltiness in the aroma... Besides that, a fantastic brew, but really not worth the hassle to get it. A good choice for the 100th brewery I’m rating :)\n\nUPDATE: Enjoyed a vertical with vintages 2002, 2014, 2015 shared with jonas, jfb, MoritzF, and Ritzn in June 2016. The 14 year old one has a lot of Pedro Ximenez Sherry aromas, some old rubber (but the first pours did not have as much of it - the later pours had too much dead yeast in there), and hardly any carbonation left. The 2 year old one was quite edgy, a bit phenolic, really good, and the one year old one was smooth and balanced. Very interesting!", "rating": "4.5"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Well, here it is then, one of the world’s very best beers according to this very site. I have been familiar with it for many a year and enjoyed it many times but it wasn’t till the Flemish media made a hype out of it, following its election as best beer on this site, that every beer drinker in the country and abroad wanted to get his hands on it - prompting the monks at the Sint-Sixtus abbey to change their ways, introducing a reservation system and reducing the amount of crates per car (as the only official way to buy it, is driving to the abbey to pick it up). In other words: thanks to Ratebeer, it is even harder now for me to obtain it than it already was before (thank you, Ratebeer...). Anyway, for this rating I dug a 1,5 year old sample from the cellar and taste it at cellar temperature. It pours a deep, dark, brownish purple, clear at first but hazy with deposit, under a thin but remarkably stable, light yellowish beige, sticky, moussy head. The aroma is powerful, complexely perfumed and simply stunning: all kinds of noble sweetness and spiciness are blended into one mouth-watering bouquet I could sniff for hours; impressions of marzipan, old port wine and madera, candied orange, banana liqueur, milk chocolate, apple cake, walnuts, brown bread, vanilla, overripe pears and plums, cinnamon, sweet cherries, cognac, mint, cocoa powder, butterscotch, raisins and something vaguely earthy, only adding subtlety and complexity. In the mouth, candied and overripe fruits abound, sourish and sweetish both in a delicate and gentle way, banana, blue grapes, plums, pears, passion fruit and of course dark candi syrup, over a profound, fluffy, somewhat fatty malt sweet backbone, caramelly, nutty, chocolatey, with a delicately tingling carbonation adding a slight sourishness; towards the end, yeasty spiciness comes up retronasally, leafy and peppery hop bitterness and warming, liqueurish and brandy-like alcohol put everything into utter balance. Assessing whether this is the world’s best beer or not is irrelevant to me: I have always regarded this as the top ’abt’-style beer in Belgium, a landmark on the Belgian beer map, with a delicacy and refinement seldomly seen. I tasted this younger and much older and even at 8 years of age, it was still a heavenly experience, on a par with the world’s best wines or single malts. Keep in mind, though, that the balancing, earthy and leafy hop bitterness declines throughout the years, causing the fruity and candi-ish sweetness to become more pronounced; yet after many years of cellaring, it also maderizes beautifully. I prefer this at 1 or 2 years of age but this is pure personal taste. In all: the best of the abts to me and one of the best Belgian ales, that much is clear. The fact that it is hard to get, probably added to its sheer mythical status, but I must admit that even for me - living in Flanders - the excitement of booking a couple of crates and driving to the far-out Westvleteren monastery to get my hands on them does add to the experience. Inspiring, appetizing, satisfying, this is indeed a classic in every sense of the word.", "rating": "4.7"},

I can’t help but think the rarity/legend of this beer has contributed a little or more to the 4.5+ AVERAGE score, but it’s #1-2 on another site as well, so that doesn’t account for THAT many high scores. To the review (expectations aside) poured fairly clean (no sludge on the bottle rim or massive floaties like in some other belgians with a touch of age on em). ruby/dark brew with some fizzy tan head. mouthfeel was pretty smooth. good body, but a little over carbonated. aroma was doughey and yeasty...sourdough bread, which was different, but not necessarily in a good way. aroma was plum, fig, fruits, yeast, more dough. smooth again, and hid the alcohol well, but this beer did nothing to stand out. All 3 Rochefort beers are better, as are the few Struisse beers I’ve had. I don’t know what the fuss is about. Maybe if I’m in Belgium one day I’ll get to have it fresh, but I’m not dropping more money on this to ship a bottle. In fact, I’m selling my second bottle (which we’d planned to drink, except that it was not worth what i can get for it). Disappointment for sure. Pannepot rocks. October 2013: From the gift pack release...much deeper, more fruit, less breadiness (which wasn’t all that impressive). If I’d rated just this batch, it would likely be a 4.3. Still not the best. but much much better. Not aure of age/transport on the first one, but that can be said about a TON of aother beers too that were better than the original 3.7.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Inutile dirlo...questa birra è veramente un capolavoro!!! Il colore è mogano scuro. La schiuma è fitta, abbondante, mediamente persistente (anche se ne rimane sempre qualche millimetro per tutta la bevuta) e dal colore marroncino chiaro un po’ dorato. Al naso si percepiscono soprattutto sentori vinosi, da vino liquoroso (quali Marsala e Porto). Ma è in bocca che esplode in tutta la sua bellezza. Caramello, maltato, frutta scura (come prugne), ciliegie (sia fresche che sotto spirito), e soprattutto un buonissimo liquoroso che ricorda, come si sentiva anche al naso, il Marsala e il Porto. Finale leggermente amarognolo. Corpo decisamente strutturato. Carbonizzazione bassa, se bevuta alla temperatura giusta, sui 12 gradi. Se più fredda, la carbonizzazione è eccessiva e non si sentono bene né tutti gli aromi né i sapori. Lasciata nel bicchiere, lascia esplodere tutti i suoi sapori. Possiamo dire che ogni sorso è una scoperta, non annoia mai con il passare delle bevute. Fama veramente meritatissima. Unica birra trappista ad essere fatta, per quanto ne sappia, unicamente dai monaci. Il loro motto è: \"facciamo birra per vivere e non viviamo per fare birra\". Il non essere attaccati al guadagno, ma alla qualità, rende questa birra un prodotto veramente eccezionale. Una parola sull’annoso confronto con la Rochefort 10, la mia birra preferita.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "A kezdeti benyomások egy vulkanikus erejű habkitörést követően fogalmazódhattak meg bennem, melyek közül elsőként mennyeien krémes, tejszínes aromáját említeném egy lágyan pirított, mogyorós-diós-mandulás vonallal. Páratlanul sima és visszafogott, mégis összetéveszthetetlenül egyedi. És amikor krémességet említek, azt szó szerint kell érteni. Ha valaki csak könyvekben találkozott volna még e fogalommal, tökéletesebb szemléltetés egy korty Westvleterennél nem is létezik. Szétolvad a szánkban, lágyan elterül, szinte betapasztja a szájüreg minden egyes négyzetmilliméterét. Egy rakás alkotóelem jelenlétét véljük felfedezni, a szokásos trappista összetevők mindegyikét: diófélék, datolya, szilva, mézes harapnivalók és krémlikőr éreztetik hatásukat, az eredmény azonban lenyűgözően egyedi. Valahogy egyik fázis során sem érzünk előretörő komponenst, kitüremkedő ízjegyeket, annyira szorosan kötődik egymáshoz minden egyes molekulája a sörnek, hogy az egyes kortyok hatása minden alkalommal szinte előélet nélkül és a halványulás érzetét mellőzve, egyből a lényegre térve tör elő, pár másodperces jelenéseket idézve elő a varázslatból. Mintha minden ital legjavát ötvözték volna egyetlen palackban, az alkohol, mint közös nevező remekül elrejtett ereje, a likőrök gyümölcsös krémessége, a maláta teltsége egyszerre lép a színre, majd még mielőtt megfejthetnénk, megfoghatatlan összetettségbe burkolózik. Ezen ismertető után felesleges lenne tagadni az iránta kialakult csodálatomat, melyet nem elsősorban újszerű, soha nem tapasztalt ízek parádés felvonultatása, semmint inkább a nagybetűs harmónia titokzatos létrejötte eredményez.", "rating": "4.6"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Managed to try two separate bottles, one from a promotional six pack but close to use by date, the other probably brewed this year. There were of course massive difference, the older one having lost its carbonation massively and while much sweeter at first, didn’t have the pleasant aftertaste of the fresher bottle, which my ratings are based on. Having done the Belgium 6 abbey trip, this was of course a big must try, since the others I had all had before. Given it’s lofty rating on this site, I was at first a little disappointed, with the initial flavour quite mild compared to Rochefort 10 or Chimay blue, but it does maintain the flavour in your mouth and the sweetness comes through slowly. Like most Belgians strong caramel flavour with nice balance of light bitterness. Still, prefer the Rochefort and the Chimay triples but that’s just my preference. A very good beer.", "rating": "3.9"},

Poured in a Westmalle chalice. Had been in the fridge 15 minutes. \n\nPours with a big, fat uneven head that hangs around for a couple of minutes. Typical dirty quad look. \n\nSmells of plums and brandy, brown sugar, Trappist yeast. All the classics. The typical quad smell. Most similar to Rochefort's red wine barrel qualities, but you can definitely smell the St Bernardus relationship. \n\nStarting to warm up as I sip it... Wow. My mouth is so full I feel like I'm almost having an allergic reaction. This is without a doubt the most complex beer I have ever had. The first time I ever tried it, I picked up on the fact that it had not just Rochefort's dark fruits, but also it's own sweet berry fruits too - baked together in a dry, yeasty brown sugar cocoa and raisin cake. ...and the flavour develops every few minutes as it warms. A third of the way in and I'm getting sweet, bitey Lambrusco at the front of my mouth and a wave of brown sugar raisins coming backwards over the tongue. I think it's still a little young though, hard to tell without a date. \n\nThe mouthfeel is huge. Beautiful carbonation and alcohol warmth that carries the sweetness without St Bernardus' drier, doughier feel. \n\nDon't ever let anyone tell you St Bernardus is 'the same' (I've been to both the St Bernardus brewery and In de Vrede twice!). If anything, it's closer to Rochefort 10. At the end of the day though, it's just a beer and your glass will eventually be empty. Definitely the best quad, but Pannepot and Rochefort are essentials too. St Bernardus comes after this (in spite of the similarities - it still uses St Sixtus yeast, but Westvletern moved to Westmalle yeast in 1992 when the contract arrangement ended - somehow it makes a world of difference). Save up your money and go to Belgium. If you can't make it to In de Vrede it would be well worth paying €10-15 for on the grey market. \n\n\n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "rating": "4.7"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "11.2 oz bottle. From notes taken at the St. Sixtus Abdij, June 7, 2007. This was a truly overwhelming experience, to have this beer (as well as the 8 and Blond) at the source. It ranks as one of the more memorable moments of my life, and I would encourage any and all to experience it for themselves.\n\nThis beer was poured for me at the restaurant In de Vrede, in the shadow of the Abdij itself. The beer is a dark opaque brown with a lasting pillowy off-white head that left ample lacing. The aroma is simple but complex: malt and dark, sweet fruits. The flavor is truly something to behold, and words are difficult to come by to describe the perfection. Notes of caramel, malt, spice, slight chocolate all combine to form the perfect beer. As the beer warms, each sip is a new revelation. As often as I have tried to rate this beer, the right words do not avail themselves. I am reminded of the film \"Contact\" where the protagonist agonizes over the fact that they did not send a poet through the wormhole. This beer is something that must be experienced firsthand. My highest rating I can possibly offer.", "rating": "5.0"},

Well, it’s pretty damn impressive! I am glad I’ve had it. I’ve had other beers that have had huge hype. It lives up to the hype. I rated it as fair as I could. It’s really good. Will it change your life, no. Are other beers better? I think that’s really up to you, and what your into. I judged it on it’s merits. I meets all the criteria. I will also say, that some beers can meet the rating criteria, but aren’t enjoyable, that isn’t the case here. It measures up and is excessively enjoyable. It is a classic.", "rating": "4.7"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Dit was de tweede keer dat ik de Westvleteren 12 heb gedronken. De eerste keer dateerde nog van een tijd dat ik nog niet zo kritisch bezig was met het proeven van bieren. Dat dit bier internationaal vermaard is, eigenlijk alleen positieve beoordelingen krijgt mede met het exclusieve karakter maakte dat de verwachtingen hoog gespannen waren. Wat ik me uit de eerdere degustatie herinner is dat het me toen meer dan gemiddeld was bevallen.Het aroma is zacht en herbergt toetsen van kandij, noten en mokka. Het is een subtiel aroma, maar zeer uitnodigend.Het uiterlijk is diep donker met een gezonde glans. Het koolzuur komt maar beperkt vrij en kleeft niet tegen het glas. Toch vormt het bier en mooie volle en dichte schuimkraag met een mokka kleur.De smaak vult de verwachtingen op basis van het uitzicht en het aroma volledig in. Het bier smaakt zacht bitterzoet met toetsen van chocolade en mokka. Het mondgevoel is veruit het beste aan dit bier, licht sprankelend, toch verfrissend maar met een ongelofelijke afdronk die je doet verlangen naar de volgende slok.Algemeen is dit bier dus en absolute winner MAAR wat mij betreft zijn er waarschijnlijk couranter verkrijgbare bieren die vooral qua smaak en aroma zeker een evenwaardig alternatief kunnen bieden. Maar hey, is het nu net niet dat waarom elke bierliefhebber de bieren van de Sint Sixtus abdij ooit moet geproefd hebben?", "rating": "4.0"},

Je hebt de blonde bieren (tripels), de amberkleurige bieren, zoete bieren, zure bieren, bieren die gerijpt zijn op eiken vaten e.d. dat het moeilijk is om slechts één bier als beste van de wereld te beschouwen. Laat ik vooropstellen dat de Westvleteren 12 inderdaad een goddelijk brouwsel is, het is alsof een engeltje op je tong plast. De smaak is rijk, vol van smaak, je proeft o.a.toffee, kandijsuiker, donker brood, peperkoek en dit bier heeft een heerlijke zachte afdronk, ondanks het hoge alcoholpercentage. Maar als je geen liefhebber bent van donkere bieren, zal je dit bier nooit het lekkerste van de wereld vinden, wat de mensen ook mogen zeggen of schrijven. En ik denk ook dat dit bier als beste wordt beschouwd door zijn exclusiviteit. De hype wordt een beetje gecreëerd in die mate dat je jezelf als bevoorrecht gaat beschouwen als je er één mag drinken.

Thank you, Monna!\n\n\n\nPreparation: bottle maintained at ambient temperature of 10°C - 12°C overnight; Popped at 13.1°C (within recommended temperature range) onto the Chimay chalice.\n\n\n\nLooks: Cloudy hazy dark mahogany colour with chunks of dirt-like yeast sediments; Three finger head and beautiful, lasting light beige foam with a thin head that refuses to go away! Excellent sticky lacing with bubbly small carbonation.\n\n\n\nAroma: Fragrant light alcohol, sugar and vanilla, with nicely-woven light plum, raisin, wood, musty cellar, Port wine, red wine, Bel yeast and malt. New aromas continue to evolve as beer warms. Amazing!\n\n\n\nTaste: A great combination of flavours, started out with light but nice alcohol and sugar, then followed by freshy plum, raisins, light roastiness and nuts, wood, caramel, rum, light banana, light toffee, light cream, herbs, faint liquorices, shades of lime and faint grass. Yum!\n\n\n\nBody: Medium. Slick and pretty creamy palate.\n\n\n\nMouth Feel: a subtle combination of tastes - intense and fleshy dark fruits, winey cellar (lovely!), nutty roastyness close to fresh toast, wood barrel, caramel, banana and cream. All in fairly light touch but together they works so well, very seductive to mind!\n\n\n\nBooze and Sweetness: The 10.2% abv is its strongest suit - strong but absolutely not screaming at all. It stays silent for a good 20 minutes or so, the standard sign of a good brew. Subtle winey aroma with nice soft rum taste. How pleasing. :) Sweetness is also very restrained, just the right amount to complement the booze and give the beer some nice support. Very good!\n\n\n\nHoppiness: Not all that complex. Faint grassy nose; Herbs, thin liquorices and grass for taste. Some faint bitterness in the background but at this level, in reality it’s the lasting, tasty woody cellar-like sweet booze finish to round things up.\n\n\n\nAfter Taste: Wet, Nicely sweet boozy and creamy to mouth.\n\n\n\nComments: Finally! I am fortunate enough to obtain the legend, AND choose the perfect moment to enjoy it and pit with the closest rivals, Sint Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10. \n\n\n\nAs a Trappist beer, this is low-key and unassuming on the outside, but full of subtlety within. Its Darwinian aroma completely won my heart, and the taste, through in light touch and not the “blow my mind to the 4th dimension” type, is extremely well-presented to back up the beautiful aromas. Impressive in a very subtle way. This is seduction at its best! ;)\n\n\n\nTHE TRIUMVIRATE VERDICT:\n\n\n\nThese three Quads evolved in quite different paths so the judgment is surely subjective. Anyway, this is my two cents:\n\n\nWestvletreten XII:\n\n- Subtlety is the key.\n\n- Fantastic Darwinian aroma of cellar and wine.\n\n- Excellent rum booze and sweetness.\n\n- amazing taste variety for a Quad, all in right amount to impress.\n\nIn Short: the best of all three.\n\n\n\n\nSint Bernardus 12:\n\n- Nice extension of strong Belgian Dark and more!\n\n- Fragrant aroma and rich taste varieties. Richer than Westvelteren XII but with lesser romance. “Big and hearty”.\n\n- Strong booze and nice sweetness, especially the bourbon!\n\nIn short: a close second to Westvleteren XII, slightly less subtle but undeniably nice!\n\n\n\n\nRochefort Trappist 10:\n\n- “Hard hitting whiskey and brandy” is the key. \n\n- Head is flat, taste variety is rather limited of the three Quads.\n\nIn short: My least favorite. A hard liquor disguises as Trappist beer.", "rating": "5.0"},

Pours a very dark brown with a sizable foamy head. Smells of cherries, plums, brown sugar. The aforementioned flavors hit the tongue first before it transforms into something a bit more yeasty and biscuity and spicy. Lots of stuff going on. Thought it’d be a little thicker in texture based on how it looked.

Nice aroma of dark malt and molasses smellable.\nThe beer itself starts quite fresh-hoppy. Brown sugar, molasses, dark dry fruit. The hop-bitterness and even a bit of freshness is noticeable through all parts of the beer. Even a bit tangy. Lots of bubbles. \nThe aftertaste is long, deep, brown sugar, not too sweet. Plums, dark cherries.

St bernardus is a little more subtle in its nose, not as aromatic, yet still slightly sweet... Both colors are nearly identical, deep brown caramel... Alcohol content is more apparent in the Westvletern, not outrageously sweet as I expected, but pleasant, not overpowering... Leaves a nice slightly yeasty finish on the palate, very nice and well balanced... St Bernardus is slightly sweeter which conceals the ABV better and slightly less bitter and yeasty on finish, however the Westvletern may be more complex...

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "(Rating #500) - On ne devient pas la meilleure bière au monde par auto-proclamation, juste parce qu’on le décide. On obtient ce statut par l’approbation générale. Carlsberg se targue d’être «probablement la meilleure bière au monde», mais qu’en est-il dans les faits? Budweiser, «King of beers»... dans quel putain de royaume? La Westvleteren 12 est la meilleure bière au monde parce que des gens l’ont bue et qu’ils l’ont vraiment aimée. Il y a peut-être l’effet de rareté qui ajoute à l’aura mythique de cette bière, mais son couronnement n’aurait jamais eu lieu si le produit n’était pas exceptionnel. Et justement, il est exceptionnel — that’s it! Pourquoi? Comment? Je ne sais pas. Chose sûre, je me ferai un devoir de vous décrire du mieux que je peux chacune des gorgées de la bouteille que je viens d’ouvrir. 1) Sentiment envoûtant de sécheresse; c’est à la fois sucré et amer. 2) Un peu de mélasse par-ci, un peu d’alcool par là. Le bal est ouvert! 3) Une autre lampée – plus copieuse – pour goûter le grain franc qui donne un corps de déesse à cette bière. 4) Et on recommence avec des saveurs légèrement boisées, peut-être un peu vineuse sur les flancs quand on s’y attarde. 5) Oui, du porto! Il y a définitivement des airs de famille entre un bon porto et cette Trappiste. 6) Sans commentaire... J’ai pris cette sixième gorgée sans réfléchir, ne serait-ce que pour prendre le temps d’en profiter un peu. 7) Mes papilles sont saturées par l’alcool et les sensations volatiles. Ma langue est engourdie par l’élan émotif des saveurs à fleur de peau. 8-9) Une gorgée double pour tenter de goûter davantage, plus égoïstement, ce qui pourrait difficilement être plus intense. En bouche, des impressions de sirop d’érable me titillent. 10) Je renifle mon verre avant d’attaquer cette dixième. Des effluves d’alcool contre-attaquent, comme pour me dire «calme tes nerfs buddy! Tu ne peux pas boire pas Westvleteren 12 en 10 minutes sous prétexte que t’as envie d’écrire un texte de merde et aller te coucher par la suite. Tu vas la laisser se réchauffer un peu et prendre le temps de la laisser mûrir sur ton bureau». Et puisque j’écoute la bière quand elle me parle (ça n’arrive pas souvent), je vais fermer ma gueule sur cette gorgée sensationnelle (oui, sensationnelle!). 11) J’ai pris la onzième gorgée en écrivant sans même prêter attention. Je devrais consulter! 12) Je viens d’offrir une lampée à ma douce en lui disant «tiens, goûte à la meilleure bière au monde». Puisqu’elle venait de bouffer de la pâte à biscuits, elle a trouvé que c’était boisé et alcoolisé, mais très peu sucré. La leçon du jour : ne vous empiffrez pas de pâte à biscuits avant de décapsuler une Westy; vous passeriez alors à côté de sa merveilleuse rondeur sucrée qui nous rend complètement fou. 13) Puisque le chiffre 13 porte malheur, j’ai versé cette gorgée dans la gamelle du chat. Depuis ce temps, son ronron est beaucoup moins grinçant. 14) Mon palais retrouve sa forme, je dénote une certaine acidité et des notes plus torréfiées. 15) Je fais tourner le doux liquide dans ma bouche et il caresse mes joues, ma langue, mon palais, mes gencives. Mon dentiste m’a dit de ne pas trop laisser les liquides longtemps dans ma bouche, que ce n’était pas bon pour mes dents. O.K. mec, mais je bois une Westvleteren 12! Je ne vais quand même pas l’avaler tout rond sans la laisser m’agacer les capteurs. No way! S’il insiste, je téléphone à l’Association Dentaire Canadienne pour lui coller un grief! 16) Ce que je notais comme des saveurs de mélasse lors des premiers contacts se sont transformées en caramel, avec un peu de chocolat en périphérie. C’est magique! 17) L’alcool (10.2%) prend tout de même beaucoup de place dans cette bière. Ce n’est pas un point négatif; juste un constat. Ici, l’alcool ne semble pas amplifier ou porter les saveurs, il trouve sa place dans les méandres vacants. On goûte le sucre, puis l’alcool, dans une alternance effrénée, comme une danse avec un tempo imposé par l’urgence de finir le verre. 18) Je constate pour la première fois que la bière est pétillante. Pas énormément, mais tout de même un peu. Comme si les bulles étaient enfouies sous le lot des saveurs et qu’elles resurgissaient à la dernière minute pour nous donner un «kick». 19) Le fond du verre est visible. J’en suis presque nerveux. 20) Ça y’est, le verre est vide! J’ai pris ma dernière gorgée avec un biscuit que ma tendre moitié vient de cuisiner (les mêmes biscuits desquels elle avait tiré la pâte qu’elle avait en bouche lors de la douzième gorgée). C’est vrai que le côté sucré s’efface, mais l’amertume est mise en relief pour la première fois et ça donne une nouvelle dimension au produit. Je suis très heureux d’avoir tenté le coup. Et plus encore d’avoir bu une autre Westvleteren 12. Je ne sais pas s’il s’agit réellement de la meilleure bière au monde (qui suis-je, anyway, pour dire qu’une bière est la meilleure sur la planète?), mais je suis prêt à affirmer qu’elle est excellente. D’ailleurs, j’espère ne jamais m’arrêter à dire qu’une bière est la meilleure... LA MEILLEURE E-V-E-R! Si ce jour arrive, j’aurai l’impression d’avoir atteint la fin de ma quête. J’aurai le feeling d’avoir plafonné. Que mes prochaines dégustations seront vaines. Il y a tellement de découvertes à faire et le terrain me semble infini. Jusqu’à maintenant, c’est cet horizon qui s’étend à perte de vue qui me plaît, qui me garde en haleine. Je viens de boire une Westvleteren 12 et j’ai passé une belle soirée...

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Rating #2000. 330ml brown bottle - a gift from verticalbaconstrips the night of RBAG 1. I’m not really sure how old it is, or how it was acquired, I’ve had it for over a year now. The cap has a date of 24.09.13. Brown pour, orangey highlights, hazy, some sediment. Dark beige head that fades to a small tight bubbled cap, some creamy edges and ok lacing. Nose has rich plummy fruit notes, sort of winey, a bit of rich alcohol, chocolate. Taste has chocolate malts, toffee, and dark fruit (plum and black cherries, raisin), a bit of late bitterness and some alcohol. Aftertaste has light hops, rich chocolate and toffee malts, lingering dark fruit notes. A lot drier than I was expecting. Mid to full body with pretty active carbonation. Overall, the Westy expresses everything I would like to see in the abt/quad style, it certainly stands up to, but does not surpass my favourites in this style. It was/is an excellent beer, and I feel like a true rater now that I’ve had the Westy.", "rating": "4.2"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "As an american who has wanted to taste this beer for some time, I found myself lucky to have recent moved only a few hours drive from Westvleteren.  I recently made the trip and bought several gift packs of XII and also sampled in the cafe.  If you love this style, the XII is a real treat.  This strong has an extremely pleasing bitterness with chocolate and burnt sugar flavors -  it is complex, and, depending on the day, i would also say marzipan, caramel and citrus as well overtones as well.  I think that the key to enjoying this beer is to drink it at the right temperature.  I store at approx. 50-60 degrees and put in the fridge for 20 min. before drinking to settle the yeast.  If you drink immediately after opening, the taste is much more sharp.  I like to leave it to sit for 20-25 minutes, at which time I do believe this is a very close to perfect brew!  Highly recommended if you like the style.  On a side note, I also love the Rochefort 10 and put it on par w/ the Westvleteren, absolutely.  They are equally amazing.", "rating": "4.6"},

The pour was a medium/dark murky brown with a small (less than 1 finger) light brown fizzy head that reduced down to a thin film and small collar, which lasted throughout and had excellent sheeting of lacing.\n\nThe aroma was of a sweet dark bread malt and a bold doughy Belgian yeast with notes of toffee, chocolate, coffee, banana, dark fruit (plums, figs and dates) and a light alcohol presence.\n\nThe taste was a smooth malty sweet with just a touch of toffee and chocolate along with a nice mild roastiness early on, and then progressed with a somewhat intense yeast presence building up to a bold fruitiness and a mild alcohol ending. The flavor lasted an average duration following the swallow, and had a yeasty fruity alcohol taste that was left behind to settle in on the taste buds and lingered for a while longer.\n\nMouthfeel was just under medium in body with a texture that was smooth and creamy yet dry and slightly oily along with a carbonation that was tad prickly.\n\nOverall this is a beer that comes with quite a hype, now I can say it most definitely lives up to it.

It was full of various fruity flavors, a bit citrussy, raisins and plums, with a distinct bitterness which immediately reminded me of \"poperings hommelbier\" which comes from the same region and uses local westflanders hops. I rated it a personal top 5 beer straight away. But more striking was the feeling that this was a young beer that could get even better over time.\n\nThe second time I have had a taste was at a friends place who had a bottles which he had laying around in his cellar for 9 years, and a bottle which he had for 5 years. The oldest bottle was bad, it was unpleasantly acidic, it had no other flavors and we didn’t even finish it. The 5 year old bottle was more interesting. It was already starting to get a bit acidic, but not disturbingly, the fruity flavors where much less strong and the palate was definitely much less. Like an aged film-diva. But at this age it still beats much of what is out there \n\nA few weeks ago I opened my last bottle of the case I got two years ago. And in my opinion the beer was at its best. All the promises the young beer had made came true. The fruity flavors where even more deep and complex, the bitterness had become more subtle, as had the sweetness. At this maturity level this truly is the best beer in the world.\n\nThere are only two beers that can compare to this beer: the Rochefort 10 and the Chimay Bleu. The Rochefort is an incredible beer (personal top5) but it is a bit les dynamic in aging. The Chimay is a personal favorite as well, with a promise of aging well, but I still have to try one that has matured. So far, this is the absolute best!", "rating": "4.8"},

It has been the most remarkable couple of days.\nThe colour was a deep ruby, close to mahogany. It had an enduring cream coloured head that left a spiderweb of lace down the glass. I was impressed by the evident carbonation and how it was clear, not opaque.  I sniffed and then snorted. It was nearly ten minutes before I realised I had not tasted. I smelled currants, rhubarb, licorice, allpsice, candisugar, glace fruits, oranges, grapefruit, banana, guava, cinnamon, cardamon, dates, marshmallow, cassia, fruitbread, plums, damson jam, choclate dust, molasses and treacle. It evolved. It wasn’t just one smell, it was a changing amorphous cloud of thousands of aromas.\nI took a draught and was immediately wowed by the mouthfeel of a creamy, bubbly sweet and desserty body that was powdery as well. It had flavours that were vinous - red and desserty with nods to port, marsala and madeira. It had all the aromas evident in the flavour and all the changes that the aroma underwent, It was sweet and then sour and then dry. There was no immediate clash of flavours but it wasn’t restrained: it was full of intrigue.\nI had to ask myself, is this my favourite beer, or is it my most remarkable beer?

Dark, ruby color with a medium, bubbly head. No lacing, but the head leaves a lovely, beige film. The aroma is brown sugar, dates, apricots, licorice, cloves, and some faint resin and peat.  The flavor is very sweet, but tempered well with mild hop bitterness. There is a little citrusy tartness. Medium body, velvety feel on the tongue, and a little sticky. Overall, this is a great, flavorful, and well made beer. The palate is wonderfully light and effervescent. This is a great beer. [Re-edit, from a 2012 bottle shared by Hamp at Ale Alpharetta] The extra time has been friendly, adding some dark cherries and cognac notes. Mellowed out considerablly, with a much rounder, more blended character. The hop bitterness has all but disappeared. The palate has gotten heavier, but still has the lovely velvety feel of fine bubbles. I’d love to see what a few more years could do.", "rating": "4.4"},

Aroma is banana, toffee apple and bubblegum, but a touch of alcohol vapour comes off unpleasantly too. Appearance is a deep brown colour, nice tan head, with a touch of lace. Taste is where it’s at with this beer. Toffee and toffee apple, grapes, caramel but slightly alcoholic in the mouth which taints what would otherwise have been perfect! Palate is pleasant, slightly thick with toffee, but again, tainted by an alcoholic feel, especially in back of mouth. Overall a great beer, but could be better as the alcolhic attributes ruined what would be much nicer otherwise. A touch too raw at this age I think, could always do with 6 months or so in a cellar.

Not going to talk about pour, colour or on sight characteristics, but will concentrate on aroma and taste. This beer evolves in a unique way and is always an olfactory discovery.\n\nCapsule date 03.09.11 - batch from 3 september 2008. Aroma is an intense round and full bodied melasse experience. Pours flakey yeast that settles to the bottom quickly. Olfactory bliss : Over ripe dates and figs, the distinct sugar cane aroma most WV’s have comes out intensely! Dark bastard sugar, boozy (rum; in analogy with the sugar cane), slight malt and minimal oxidation : iron. Taste is viscose sugar cane, raisin bread, chocolate, caramel and again the dates and melasse.\n\nOther tastings : bottled in 1978, 1985-87-89, 1993-94; 1996, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009 and recently last week in 2012 + fresh batches.\n\n2002 : About the older batches ; one of the smoothest brown beers around, when left untouched for months or years. Extremely well developed aromas. \n\nChestnut brown. Aroma shows alcohol, wood, hint of smoke. Flavour notes highlight raisin bread, deep fruitiness (apricot). Long, sweet, silky malts in the finish, with dates and light bready notes.\n\nFresh batch june 2014 : pours a dark brown with beautiful head and lacing. Almsot like a matured 8 month viscose. Hops are balanced, need to settle but already promisingly soft and potent. Malt, candi sugar, hidden hop spice in the background... mostly don’t notice this hint in other brews...

Purchased on eBay, shipped direct from Brussels from the limited release gift pack with glasses.  Extremely expensive, but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Enjoyed on December 25, 2011.  Color is dark brown, slight reddish tinge, almost opaque.  Half a finger of head retreated quickly to leave minimal ring of lacing.  Nose is incredible - chocolate, espresso, roasted hazelnuts, spice - maybe even cinnamon??  First taste was surprising.  Lots of carbonation, dried fruit, raisins and dark cherries.  Many hop notes - piney ,a bit earthy.  Strange, nearly sweet flavor presents at the end of each swallow.  Almost a smokey, charcoal with a hint of maple syrup!?  Molasses!  Alcohol nearly missing escept in the after taste, where a pleasant warm burn is felt.\n\nCompared to the St. Bernardus, I found it to be more yeasty and complex, with more carbonation and a more robust mouthfeel too.\n\n\n\nUPDATE July 28, 2013.  I’ve been saving these bottles and slowly drinking one at a time since December 25, 2011.  Cracked open the fourth from this batch today, and it has aged extremely well.  Poured with less head than the first bottle two years ago, but the mouthfeel is still extremely carbonated.  All of the original flavors are still here in full force, with a nice added smokiness.

Pours a rich and glowing, dark brown-amber colored body with an inch thick, dense, frothy and creamy, beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is incredible. Plums, raisins, rich caramels, bread, chocolate, dried prunes, alcohol, peppery yeast, and a few licorice notes. Flavor is similar. Bready plums and raisins, deep caramels, chocolate overtones, peppery yeast, light alcohol notes, and licorice. Finishes smooth, lightly bitter and spicy, lightly sweetened, and lightly warmed by alcohol. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium-full body and a soft, moderately lively carbonation. Overall, I went into this with high expectations and it certainly did not let me down. An absolutely outstanding beer. The aroma is sensational; so rich, fruity, spicy, and complex. The flavor is perfectly balanced for the size and complexity and each nuance seems to change with every sip. My favorite of the vintages was this one aged for about a year and a half. \n\n\n15.12.12 stamped on the cap (bottled on December 15, 2009). Less fruity throughout, but more tart plums. The malts have definitely smoothed out and there is a bit more of a chocolate essence with a slightly richer and deeper caramel. A few more banana notes, less yeasty and spicy, but still clearly present and nicely balanced. Alcohol notes are still there, but much less so than the newer bottle. Finishes more smooth with a lightly bitter and spicy, somewhat tart plum that leaves a lengthy aftertaste with some yeast sticking out nicely. Overall, I like the smoothed out version of this, but I like the fresher bottle better. The malts are really nice on this and the spices aren’t as intense. Not as fruity, but more tart. Still excellent and my second favorite of the three vintages we tried. \n\n\n21.04.12 stamped on the cap (bottled on April 21, 2009). A bit more chocolate on this version with much deeper and richer caramels. The spices seem to come out a bit more than the second bottle we tried with more yeast and a few tobacco notes.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Purchased at de Biertempel in Brussels, Belgium, enjoyed at my hotel room in Eppingen, Germany after driving about 5 hours to have the ability to purchase this beer (amongst other things to do in the great city of Brussels).  Very very happy to have found this, I grabbed it and couldn’t believe I found it since the packaging is pretty minimalist.  Appearance is decadent, a very very dark coffee brown with a rather thick consistency and a very abundant, frothy off white head that doesn’t want to go anywhere.  Aroma is something I haven’t experienced before, it almost has a dough-like smell with notes of pepper, dark fruit notes, raisins, an amalgamation of multiple complex ingredients.  Taste is unbelievable.  There is not a bad thing about this beer.  It starts off with a sweet plum / raisin flavor, and finishes with a lively burn that gives an eye-opening sensation.  The mouthfeel is pretty thick and oily, the alcohol blends in nicely but lets itself known.  The only drawback I’d say about this is that I can’t get it readily.  A+++ brew, there was hype and I feel that it strongly met it.  This is the best Belgian beer in the world.", "rating": "5.0"},

Colpa forse della temperatura di servizio un pò fredda o del mia mediocre passione per le trappiste ma francamente non mi sento di giudicarla la migliore al mondo: gusto imponente e sontuoso persistente per diverso tempo nel palato dopo anche un solo sorso, caramello misto unicum all’inizio con un buon caffè cacaoso alla fine, corpo deciso seppure morbido e prolungato.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "330ml bottle. Pours out a dark reddish brown with a great pillowy head. The aroma is where it starts to let me down. It’s got a similar breadiness to the #8 with notes of plum and red grape. That’s a nice combination, but it doesn’t pack much punch here. On the tongue it’s all about malty yeastiness with a fine flavour profile of currants, cherries and spiced orange peel. Palate-wise I can’t argue: it’s more or less spot-on. I can’t help feeling disappointed though. It has all the qualities I’ve come to expect from Westvleteren’s other two beers but falls well short of living up to the hype.

The beer smells of rich chocolate malts and earthy yeast with a heavy alcohol odour. Taste is sweet with a lot of alcohol, which develops into a chocolate after-taste. The beer changes flavours depending on where it is on the tongue, close to the tip it gives grape esters and a touch of fruitiness. Toward the back of the mouth you get more of a rich chocolate taste. This beer has a good complexity but was not quite as good as the hype.

Served in a tulip glass after chilling on ice for about 10 minutes. Pours a sedimented medium brown that re-radiates light faintly.  A tight soapy tan head starts large, diminishes but stays with almost no lace.  The aroma is spectacular--complex and dynamic.  It starts a bit tight and hot but opens up on top of a deep fairly fresh sweet raisin bread and yeast backbone.  Aromas of vanilla, pepper, apples and orchard fruit esters unfold. There are hints or burnt caramel, burnt orange and hot pepper dark chocolate.  The flavor is very sweet but balanced by a surprisingly amount of spice and bitterness that lasts.  The mouthfeel starts super soft, velvety, lively; tends a bit yeasty and oak tight on the sides; then ends with a tickle on the back of my tongue and throat.  Sugars on the tongue and lips along with the yeast sediment continue to work and work.  Best beer in the world...arguable.  It is certainly in a rarefied league.  Initially I’m slightly disappointed by what it is and the price.  But as I sit reflecting and writing about it I’m more and more seduced.", "rating": "4.7"},

I thought I smelled some warm spice too. Nutmeg? Really awesome coconut too. Thinner palate than rochefort and la trappe. But I like the lingering warmth it leaves you with. Plus it leaves your mouth feeling like you just ate a slice of raisin bread. Taste is raisins, bananas, musty, and alcohol. Alcohol is quite strong. Warmth on the way down. What a great beer.

Pours dirty brown with a thick head that settles into a nice lasting layer for the reminder of the session. It’s not a looker, this beer, but the dirty brown color lives up to the rustic feeling of this legendary beer, and the nice beige layer of foam pulls up the appearance average.  The aroma is burnt and dried fruit, discrete at first but as the temp goes up it delivers more lovely scents. The taste is as rustic as the looks, caramel, chocolate, bitterness, fruit and alcohol. Long aftertaste. Compared to the other trappist beers, this one is the least accessible. Having brewed myself, it is impressive how a beer this high in alcohol can remain dry and sweet at the same time, though. The balance in the mouth is perfect, so is the carbonation.  It’s a rustic but quite perfect beer of it’s kind. Hyped up, perhaps, but for a reason too I believe.\n\nUpdate: Same batch, two years later. Aroma has faded into more of an unpleasant vegetable smell. Taste is still rustic and powerful. The bitterness is surprisingly still just as strong. Proof: the beer can be stored for years.", "rating": "4.1"},

It pours a cloudy brown with a pretty decent tan head.  The nose is a potent mix of spiced bread, vanilla, yeast, dried fruit, and brown sugar.  The flavor mirrors the nose with the yeast, dried fruit, and light brown sugar as the dominant flavors.  The spice, light wood, and bitterness add just enough balance.  What really struck me was the mouthfeel.  Light to medium bodied do in part to the combination of high alcohol and abundant carbonation, but it works well.  The finish is amazingly dry and the alcohol is all but undetectable at 10.2%.  I can certainly see why this brew is so highly rated.  My first thought after finishing it was \"I can drink this all day.\"  Truly outstanding.  Tasted side by side with a Roch 10 and a St. B 12.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "13 Oct 2011: Finaly got round to opening a bottle of this stuff (had 5 bottles for a number of years), lets see what all the fuss is about.\n\nPoured into a Westvleteren chalice, it looked fairly limp compared to it’s 8% brother, wispy head on top of a moody looking dark browny/red body. I tried not to let any sediment out the bottle, but a little managed to leap past me into the chalice, I’ll drink the remainder of the bottle (a fifth) with most of the sediment at the end of the review. I am reviewing live as I drink this evening.\n\nThe nose is rich red fruits, dried on a bed of dark chocolate and aged with fine English Oak, this is a smell not to mess with.\n\nThe taste is fantastic, add some carbonisation and a heap of alcohol to the aforementioned aromas and you’re half way there: I found a gargantuan amount of flavours and I now see why beery people clamour for this brew so much. Sweeter than I thought it would be (shared half a glass at the brewery bar when I bought the beer, don’t remember the sweetness), but that doesn’t detract from the tasting I’m currently having, which I’m really enjoying.\n\nThe 10.2% only become evident as the mouth dries, so well is the body and mouthfeel, a truely great beer, certainly now in my top 10, only the appearance letting it down.", "rating": "4.3"},

Still, there it is in front of me, a modest looking bottle next to a Rochefort chalice (I’d hoped for a Westvleteren one when paying 289 NOK (€38, $50) for a single bottle). In the glass it looks cloudy dark brown with a small but long-lasting tan head. The aroma is sweet and sugary, fruity, dark dried fruits and vanilla. Very sweet taste and a slight bitterness in the finish. Complex and extremely well balanced flavours with all the components from the aroma, and in addition I get some Amaretto-like almond/marzipan notes. The alcohol is much better integrated in this brew than it is in e.g. the Rochefort 10. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. A wonderful beer, but is it the best in the world?

Best by 03.08.14. Taken out of my cellar at 59 Degrees F and poured into a Chimay Chalice. \n\n\n\nA - Poured a cloudy dark brown into the glass. Produced a 2-finger coffee colored head that subsided to a half finger almost immediately and was gone after 2 minutes. There’s still some head lacing around the edges and center of the glass. In the glass, the beer is a nice deep dark brown like cedar wood color with a lot of cloudiness to it. Very complex in appearances but standard to most Belgian Quads like Chimay Blue or St. Bernardus 12.\n\n\n\nS - This is the standard Belgian Quad scent you’d expect. Great bready and earthy yeast make up a great deal of the scent. Smells like a bakery. The dark fruits like figs and prunes make up the rest. There’s this different musty smell that I don’t get from other quads. Smells like an old cellar or attic full of old photos and clothing. There’s also a slight bit of sweetness from brown sugar or maybe it’s just the dark fruit sugars that I’m getting.\n\n\n\nT - Wow. Incredibly sweet! Far more sweet than I was expecting and unlike any other Belgian quad I’ve ever had. The sweetness and malts are almost borderline very watered down whiskey. There’s a burn that starts on the roof of my mouth and goes down my chest. Not expecting that at all. I get this syrupy sweetness that you’d get from a flat pepsi and brown sugars. The standard quad bready yeast and dark fruits are there but masked by this overly sweet overly boozy feeling that really hit me in the face! Another sip and it’s still hitting me in the face. Insanely strong.\n\n\n\nM - 90% carbonation on a single mouth swish. The booziness of this beer stays around long after you’ve swallowed. It’s so insistent that you almost want to grab a glass of water to drink it down. Very very strong. Heavy bodied beer for sure.\n\n\n\nO - I’ve heard the arguments that Westy12 compares to Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12 in almost every way and those beers are fare more easy to find. I disagree. This beer is more sweet and more boozy than those beers in every way. I almost don’t want to rate this beer and I promise to re-rate it after I go to the St. Sixtus Abbey in May to pickup my 2 cases of beer and have a glass that was brewed fresh. I feel like this bottle was very off for being the best beer in the world. I disagree and Belgian Quads are my favorite beer-style.  This was a great quad but not #1.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I opened a 2006 bottle given to me by tderoeck. Best by 2011. Cellared in Belgium then shipped overseas via Belgium Post to my house. Stuck in the cellar at 62 degrees F. Poured at 4 ounces into a Duvel Tulip with friends. Appearance has gown hazy musty dark brown. Basically, looks more like bath-water than the Westy I had in April. Smell. More dark fruits, Mustier, dustier just sort of attic smell like old clothing. The taste is meh. It’s still Westy 12 but less unique, less enjoyable and a very high metallic finish. Mouthfeel is empty with some mild oxidation.

The fresher beers was quite different from the one sampled before, and much better in my opinion. Pours deep copper, not much sediment, looks almost filtered. About 10 mm of very frizzy, light brown head. Chocolate, caramel, some yeast, banana, esters, alcohol, cherry, red fruit, plum and some wort nose. I actually like to serve this a tad cold, as it changes aroma and character as it gets warmer. Mostly sweet, with a little hint of bitterness which is just right. Warming mouth feel, but not to much. Very frizzy and stingy carbonation, which I like in quads. Medium and very drinkable body! Aromas (this list could go on for ever, very complex beer!): Candy, cherry, brown chocolate (as in not the bitter cocoa type), leather, sugar, candy sugar, caramel, crackers, some alcohol, some yeast, banana, some malt, very slight hint of wort (fresh beer, mind you), actually a hint of licorice, some dry nut flavour, bubblegum.

There is no more recognizable unmarked bottle in all the land. Best by 09.03.12.\n\nMy pour has a dark caramel brown color with a slight ruby tint, mostly opaque but transparent in the edges. Only a small off-white cap forms on the initial pour, and this fades to a few spotty islands remain, along with a fair amount of particulate, even with a gentle pour.\n\nThe aroma is full, deep, and smooth. Brown sugar, toasted bread, caramel, raisins, figs, plums, cinnamon, Belgian yeasty spice all combine to form a nuanced and complex aroma.\n\nEspecially as it warms up, the flavor is pretty fantastic. Brown sugar blends with toasted bread, caramel, and some nutmeg, cinnamon and general yeasty spice. Raisins, plums, and dark cherries come in as the body turns from medium / full to medium / light. Right at the end, just a bit of ethyl alcohol comes in, along with some red wine vinegar acidity. The carbonation starts on the light side, and it is practically flat by the time the beer is through. It is creamy and smooth, while still a bit grainy. Medium to full body.\n\nWhile there was no way for this beer to live up to the \"best beer ever,\" I thoroughly enjoyed the anticipation leading up to my first experience, and the beer itself was quite good as well.", "rating": "3.8"},

The aroma is a vast canvas of intense Belgian yeasts, sweetness, brown sugars, caramel, plum, raisin, Danish breads, malty depth, cereals and gentle hops. It is very hard to pinpoint all of the various areas of this beer because of its complex structure. I never seem to get that big creamy tan head like I have seen on many pictures of this, I usually get a relatively thin tan head which seems to soon release into a fine skimming on top of the deep brown chocolate brew. The flavour is insane, extremely complex! There are brown sugars, Belgian yeasts, leather, sweet Danish breads, caramelled cereal malts, balanced fruits like plums, raisins and apricot. Great lasting flavour of dough and malty cereals also eventually you notice a gentle warmth on the throat though without even tasting any hint of alcohol, it could be passed off as a 6% beer because it is so gentle! Supple smooth buttery texture with a full body and suitably gentle carbonation. So much to talk about in this beer, very complex but very gentle and light without sacrificing any rich flavours you would expect naturally.

Small light beige head that turns into stable foam islands. It’s probably hard to rate this beer in an ’unbiased’ way, considering the status and ’hype’ surrounding it. First impressions are not overwhelming - to me this is not an ’OMG, fantastic’ brew. It has a complex, quite alcoholic nose, but also rather restrained. With the first sip, however, I start to realize the greatness. It probably has all aroma elements that I have ever tasted in beers (except smoke and barnyard). There’s caramel, herbs, dried figs, raisins, fruits of all kinds (grapefruit, orange, banana, pear), resin, licorice. And its all in perfect balance, so perfect and complex that its hard to discern individual aroma elements. It starts off quite sweet, then a wave of herbal bitterness, and finally a mildly bittersweet finish. The alcohol is noticeable, but blends in like in a fine sherry.

It was even better than I remembered it.\n\n---\n\nPoured into a Rochefort Trappist chalice\n\nA: Initially this pours a murky, sediment filled brown color but after drinking 1/2 of it, you can see ruby highlights throughout. thick creamy off white almond colored head. Unfortunately this didn’t leave very much lacing at all.\n\nUPDATE: There was barely any sediment in this bottle. It poured a beautiful, clear (until the very last ounce) brown/ruby color. The last little bit was a bit muddy but to be expected, I think. Head formation was decent and lacing was pretty much non-existent. Rating bumped to 4.5.\n\nS: soon as the cap was popped off the scent of strong sweet fruit filled the air. There’s a medium heavy malting, brown sugar, deep dark fruits, cherries mostly and it’s slightly alcoholic. Smells like a combo of berry pie and caramel.\n\nUPDATE: This smelled amazing and as described above. I bumped my rating to 5.0.\n\nT&M: very smooth taste, medium bodied beer which is perfect for the style. sweet and malted, lots of fruits on the palate but so much complexity that it’s hard to pinpoint what flavors I’m experiencing. Non noticeable bitterness or hop flavor. Needless to say this feels and tastes great! The only thing I’m not too keen on is the \"bits\" of sediment that get stuck between your teeth as you’re nearing the end of the bottle. I could do without that.\n\nUPDATE: Similar to above minus the \"bits\" of sediment. This was clearly a higher quality beer, one that was most likely not aged for as long or aged under better environmental conditions. Taste rating bumped to a solid 5.0! Def worth it! Can’t really find a flaw in the mouthfeel either - 5.0 too.\n\nD: Pretty high ABV that’s masked almost completely. Great sweet, fruity taste, if it weren’t for the carbonation I’d think I was drinking some kind of concentrated berry juice.\n\nOverall impressions: This is one of the most sought after, legendary beers. Given it’s availability, it makes it that much more precious and highly coveted. While it is a great beer, and a fine example of the style, dare I say that I think it’s slightly overrated and that there are better examples of the style available closer to home, namely Rochefort 10 and St Bernadus Abt 12.\n\nBig thanks to zaf88 for this trade.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "#10\nFast schwarzes Bier mit feiner Crema. Ein leicht hefiger Grundton mit fruchtigem Aroma nach Pflaume. Schön vollmundiger Antrunk und für 10,2% Alk. sensationell unspritig. Geschmacklich startet das Westvleteren recht süßmalzig, geht dann zügig über in diese pflaumige Fruchtigkeit. Der lange Abgang ist herb und leicht nachbitternd wie ein lang gelagerter Armagnac. Ein absolut fantastatisches Bier! Die Frage, ob es nun \"das Beste\" der Welt ist, kann man getrost dahingestellt lassen, denn für höchst subjektiven Geschmack gibt es eben keine objektiven Kriterien. In meiner persönlichen Top Ten gehört dieses Westvleteren 12 auf jeden Fall und in die ganz enge Auswahl für eine einsame Insel. Was dieses Bier so gegenüber den anderen Trappisten auszeichnet ist nicht seine Aromenvielfalt oder seine Stärke, das haben die meisten anderen Trappisten auch zu bieten.

Also a rather strong oxidized impression which is off, and notes of alcohol. The aroma is actually very nice, is has some nice subtle elegances. The taste starts off with heavy yeasty and estery sweetness, figs, dates, port like in the sweetness, chocolate and cocoa. At first the carbonation was almost excessive, and that combined with the high esters made a very harsh mouthfeel.

This is obviously worth it’s high praise and is a high abv beer you can drink and wonder where the glass went.  With that said, I’m not completely convinced it’s any better than Rochefort 10 or even St. Bernardus.  I don’t know, it’s definitely not worse though.  Distribution is a factor.

Lots of peppers and coriander that lingers throughout over the complex body into a sweet, yet dry finish.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "I just posted some comments on Reddit, this is what I wrote:Saturday night at my brother?s house, we start with a Pliny the Elder, kill some time talking, and then to the main event.He brings out a Westvleteren 12 with no sticker, plain brown bottle, some letters stand out from the neck of the bottle and only the cap informs that this indeed is the famous beer; unopened, we let it rest for 10 minutes, to let it raise its temperature slightly.My control beer, from memory, is a St. Bernardus Abt 12 which in my opinion is the best beer I have tried: complex, sweet, fruity, toasty, aromatic, just wonderful!I pour, slowly into Chimay chalices, and see how a perfect brown sugar colored foam develops on top, crowning a dark molasses colored liquid. The aromas, are muted, the taste is amazing, crazy good, similar to the St. Bernardus, but slightly more controlled, I feel it has no edges, it is more composed. But, weren?t they supposed to be like twins? Same recipe, yeast, water!To me, it tasted restrained, perhaps I could not appreciate the highest ranked of beers, I felt guilty: In my mind, the St. B was better, tasted courageous, like tradition, like a great beer: what Aragorn toasts and drinks with when in the company of great men!W 12 is great, but perhaps the hype led me to expect something far better in orders of magnitude that what I had in my hand? Is it really 20 or 30 times much better than a New Belgium Abbey Ale or a Malheur 10? Is it that the beer cognoscenti tout it as The Pinnacle of Greatness, knowing that this beer is almost impossible to obtain for an ordinary citizen, and thus will remain as a barrier of entry into their beer tasting club?

My nose is completely saturated in aromas of plum and grapes with and an underriding sweetness behind it all. Reminds me of a sweet, freshly cut piece of christmas fruit cake - lots of dark fruits and a sweet vanilla tone. The mass amounts of fruit come through in the taste. Lots of plum, raisins and grapes. Reminds me a little bit of this sparkling grape juice I used to have when I was younger. Grape undertones are very prominant. Quite a heavy, vanilla escence-like sweetness throughout the brew.

I have since tried this beer around 10 times, and never thought that it stood up to that original rating. It has ranged from thinner in body with more light cola flavor to sweeter, almost syrupy. At the end of the day, this beer is inconsistent, and that is a quality that does not deserve a 4.3 rating, so the numbers have been updated to reflect my more recent experiences with this beer.\n\n\n\n\nTasted on 8/22/11 from a 330mL bottle obtained in a trade. Pours hazy dark brown with orange and red tints, a very thin and a bubbly tan head that recedes rather quickly to nothing.  The nose is super complex with tons of lightly burnt brown sugar and caramel malt, a whole bunch of fruity fig, raisin, date, and molasses, with just hints of bitterness and some alcoholic heat. The flavor is lightly sweet with all of the same caramel, burnt brown sugar, fig, raisin, date, toffee, and molasses detected on the nose with an added lightly green hops note.  The body is full and oily with light carbonation and long fruity caramel, toffee, and lightly bitter burnt finish.", "rating": "3.7"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Wow, I almost feel like a heretic... How do you rate a legend? It’s almost impossible, isn’t it? Let’s deal with the basics first: dark brown pour with a medium - smaller than I would have expected - tan head. Aroma is unlike anything else I’ve had. Not even like a typical Abt. There’s a lot of sugar of course, and dark fruit, but the yeast is present in a way I haven’t experienced elsewhere. This also carries through to the taste, which has the same balanced yeasty sweetness. The complexity lies here: plums, raisins, dark fruits, roasty and bready malts and of course brown sugar. The alcohol comes through a bit as the beer warms up but as with any good belgian beer, never becomes too much in your face. Body is surprisingly light, as is the carbonation, but the lingering aftertaste is LONG and one of the best I’ve ever had. That’s a memory that will stay with me for a very, very long time. This might not fully match the hype for me, but overall it’s still among the best I’ve ever had and the second best Belgian after Rochefort 10.", "rating": "4.4"},

The flavor is very complex, so much going on. You get the initial hit of dark malts, and then flavors of wood, caramel, wheat bread, dried fruits, and then finishes with a nice touch of raw sugar. Brilliant effort. The taste hangs around and it sticks to your mouth for a while. I am tasting this one for days. Holy cow. This one had a lot of hype, and it certainly didn’t disappoint.

OK, maybe not, but it is a dark red with a cream colored head that’s very dense with fine bubbles. I can guarantee it’s plenty hazy with all the crap that poured out of the bottle at the end! 5/5 cause of the crap that came out which would put most people off. \n\n\n\nTaste: Taste is similar to the aroma. Get a ’bad’ one and you might think it’s just average. Get a good one and you will be blown away. Crapshoot! Price you pay for not buying it at the abbey....?\n\n\n\nPalate: Thick, oily, very creamy. The carbonation is intense but also very fine, and what I mean by that is that it’s like fine grit sandpaper in comparison, to say, a cola which would be much more coarse. Balanced well, alcohol is well hidden.\n\n\n\nOverall: If you want to know what I think about the hype...read the W8 review. It’s fantastic but, BUT, keep in mind it’s not magic in a bottle....only beer! \n\n\n\nDec. 2/14, another rate but of the XII gift bottle with a BB date of 27.03.15......\n\nAroma is very vinous, lots of sour, almost rotten fruit which doesn’t sound all that appealing but it’s backed by sweet aromas as well as some coffee and chocolate. Fresh baked brownies/cake as well. I swear this beer has one of the best aromas out there, it constantly confuses and humbles me and it’s what I strive for in my homebrews. \n\nAppearance at this point is a transparent dark red with a small off white foam that gradually diminishes. I’m sure I can make it plenty cloudy if I poured with more vigor. \n\nTaste...quite sweet and savory backed with a bit of sour. Quite like eating a really good christmas cake with some chocolate. It certainly doesn’t taste like a beer. Lots of vinous notes. Kinda has an old book/dusty taste. Sounds greasy but it really makes this beer that much more. \n\nPalate is phenomenal, I want to guzzle this glass down but it’s my last bottle...the mouthfeel is quite good, carbonation isn’t as high as most Belgian beers but the beer is very smooth at this point. Super drinkable. \n\nOverall...the bottle I had before this wasn’t very good and I was led to believe this bottle I’m having now wasn’t worth keeping. Oops. I’m somewhat angry I can’t get this as easily as Trappistes Rochefort but what can you do? If one of the monks from Westvleteren is reading this, I’d be very grateful to get your beer, even if it was limited. \n\nAn ideal world is a cellar constantly stocked with Westvleteren and Trappistes Rochefort along with a cute chick to serve me a bottle whenever I wanted and then leave me alone to enjoy the beer. \n\nOr she can get shitfaced with me.

Aroma is of brown sugar, yeast, and molasses with some hints of dark fruit -- a bit of malt, not a lot of spice. Foams in the mouth initially, then smooth into the finish. Not thick -- feels very light, like floating on air. Taste is quite elevating -- some brown sugar, alcohol (which gives rise to a very noticeable warming sensation), yeast, malt, dark fruits, caramel, and some maple syrup. Also some spice, though not much. There is a slight bitter note that comes out in some layers, which is usually complemented by brown sugar, but there is one layer in which the bitter is slightly overpowering for a brief time. The flavor is very intense yet smooth. Overall, predominantly malty with a bit of caramel, brown sugar, hops, and slight spice.

Very much like its slightly lower gravity cousin, the extra 8, but obviously just a hair bigger.  I’m not sure, but it tastes like the same recipe, just a little more of everything.  I actually found the 8 to be just a hair better, as the hops were a little more perceptible and cut the sweetness just a bit which I liked.\n\nThis beer comes in which an instant rush of fruit and spice.  Cloves, coriander and cardamom with bubblegum and bananas.  Hint of smoky, roasted nuts.  Slight tannic quality.\n\nLittle to no head.  Probably from the extended aging.  What little there was left a remarkable lace.  The yeast formed about an inch thick cake on the bottom, and the pour was quite clear as a result.  I drank half, then poured some of the yeast into the next half, because I like the associated change in taste.  Of course, after adding the yeast the clear brown became completely opaque.  The yeast lent a breadiness to the beer that I found quite favorable.\n\nVery drinkable for such a big beer.  With all the malt sweetness, it has no perceptible alcohol.  Mouthfeel is rich, thick, almost viscous.  \n\nOverall an excellent beer, this and the 8 are the number 1 and 1B beers in the world, in my opinion, and definitely one should not miss out on any chance to try this.", "rating": "4.6"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "(19/03/2011) bottle@Kulminator: very rich & complex taste, creamy, raisins, figs & prunes, earthly malt, brown sugar, some milk chocolate, spices, warming alcohol, very good indeed, the crazy is still a bit too much, I still think that whether you prefer Rochefort 10 or this is more a matter of personal taste than anything else ///// decided to try this again at Bruges Beer Festival 2012 -  33 cl. bottle sample – boozy dark fruits, sweet with touch caramel, plenty of sweet malts, hint spices, slight liquorish quality to it, touch chocolate, slightly messy & not exactly fully tuned, plenty of elements in common with the 8 as well as the 6 I have tried, 6 was a slightly different from standard version apparently, this is a good beer but there is a lot out there that equals this as well as surpasses it with some similar tributes, fine-tuned versions & imitations in Belgium being vastly superior to this that get a lesser amount of raves but the hype will never end and seems to be getting only worse ….  ///// tried a 2011 Vintage of this – bit under 2 years old. Tasted blind alongside St. Bernardus 12 & Rochefort. Despite not having had Westy in over a year & not drinking the others too often, took me about 20 sec. to tell which is which, surprisingly easy. Rochefort is crazily richer than Westy 12 – 12 is mellower, improved with age, quite good actually but the hype killing my buzz a bit, very interesting almost spice-like notes going on here, nice caramel, toffee & sugar etc. quite lovely but the hype makes it impossible for me to truly love this beer. Plus Rochefort 10 has much more going on & is sold @ the supermarket. Yes the hype is a bit too much with far too many people over the years having told me either “that this is the greatest thing ever or talking to me about how this was voted best beer in the world, etc.” or going on about how it tastes exactly like Leffe, the assumption that I simply have to love this is just a bit too much for me blah blah… I have been hearing this crap since I was 15 years old. Maybe should up score from 4.6 to 4.7 but I will leave this one for now. //// Tried a 10 year bottle of this one again, pretty nice subtleties here, not incredible but incredible shape for a 10 yr old beer, liked it quite a bit, not the elixir of gold that people keep telling me that this is //////////// 2010 Vintage. 33 cl. bottle @ home. Re-rate. Copper, reddish dark brown with a creamy, small, beige, off-white head. Nose simple, mellow oxidation, heavy on candy sugar, brown sugar, syrup, light liquorish, spices, faint molasses, smell is mellow & not in your face. Taste is slightly oxidized, heavy on candy sugar, pancake sugar & brown sugar, dominate all, chestnuts, spices, light liquorish, leaves, touch spices, lots of nuts, hint lavender, oily, warming,… Very nicely warming but not boozy like a fresh one. Very BE profile, dominant with sugar, its okay but lots of Belgians pack so much more than this. Oily, light oxidized body, slick. Good brew but there is better, similar in Belgium, overrated due to the perfect mix of rare but obtainable. Changing the score from 4.6 to 4.6 & that is overrating it but I have to keep the prev. scores in mind. I suppose my disappointment has something has something to do with it being #1 in the world. I suppose it is never going to happen that everyone will agree all at once about something. /////////////////// Tried another one, now idea of age, tasted a bit like a superior Westmalle Dubbel which sort of makes sense I suppose. Much fuller & richer. Very solid but costly, this was one of the label-less brewery bottles. Keeping the old score. //////////////// Also don’t see any notes for the 1979 St. Bernardus brewed version which I tried. For that one, too much oxidation, the 1979 “8” tasted really good but this one was too far gone for me. Definitely not as bad as it could have been, not very impressive either. ////////////////// 17.12.2008 Vintage, my last one remaining from the brick. Dark mahogany, touch ruby, small beige head. Smells like metallic syrup, sherry, coca-cola, vinous oxidation. Taste is liquorish, vinous & sherry oxidation, syrupy, vinous notes are quite interesting, thick leaves, herbs, touch coca-cola, caramelized cherry, faint bark. Fuller, slightly oxidising body. This is quite an interesting oxidation profile, I wouldn’t really call it top or anything, this is past prime most likely. I would be more exited about this if it weren’t for the hype that this beer has. This is quite an interesting oxidation profile even if it doesn’t feel prime anymore. Intriguing beer, I have attributed its popularity always partially to its ability to age well.", "rating": "4.5"},

Boy was that a mistake. I couldn’t smell or taste much of anything. Anyway, this time I get to fully enjoy it.\n\n4.0 A: Pours a ruddy dark brown color. Initially, it poured fairly clear, but toward the end of the bottle, clumpy sediment started accompanying the liquid. Two fingers of mainly frothy beige head with slightly better than average retention and a formitable ring of lacing.\n\n4.5 S: This is quite a complex brew! Surprisingly nutty, this is by far the nuttiest quad I’ve ever stumbled upon. Dry as well (I suppose that’s expected from the candi sugar). Earthy and musty, and toasty like there is lots of brown malt. Only moderately spicy and nothing really stands out in this regard (maybe white pepper). Fig, tobacco, and pear brandy fruitiness. Ovaltine-like chocolate and just a touch of booze. This is very nice, but I’d prefer if it had some more power.\n\n4.5 T: Not as complex as the nose, but much stronger flavors. Foremost there is brown sugar, caramel, tobacco, and molasses. Booze soaked figs, raisins, and prunes. Raw cacoa powder, nutty, and toasty. Peppery and to a lesser extent, clove, spiciness. Again, earthy and musty. Pretty damn good here too.\n\n4.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Carbonation is in perfect amounts with a good spritzy quality to it. Good amount of creaminess and super smooth with a touch of warmth on the finish.\n\n4.5 D: I suppose this does live up to the hype.

It is THAT good - nearly perfection.  The hype is real.  If I have any knock against it, it’s that it is a slight touch on the sweet side... but it’s taste is so complex, that characteristic is forgivable.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Drink by date of 9/3/2005 date on the cap. Pours a dark brown, lots of carbonation and thin quick fading off-white head. Aroma started to emanate out of the bottle as soon as the seal was broken on the cap. Aroma is very complex with a strong estery nose composed of a mild banana presence, a mild toasted malt and caramel sweetness, lots of Belgian candy sugar sweetness, very low liquorish and raisin with an almost cookie like finish to the nose. Flavor is fantastic! Strong candy sweetness up front with a mild smooth toasted malt in the middle. Light notes of banana and a complex estery flavor are also in there. Smooth brown sugar, light raisin with a very long lasting combo of caramel and sugar finish. Body is pretty heavy and holds a lot of residual sugar feeling. Carbonation is very high and keeps the brew pretty lively. Overall - first and foremost I have to say thanks to JMerritt for this brew. I did have some reservations in trying this beer as it comes with such lofty expectations that I thought it would be difficult for the beer to meet what I have read and heard. It definitely did not disappoint. The quality and attention to details form Westvleteren shows. Aromas don’t overpower but do give the brew a very intense quality not seen in too many beers. The flavor is complex, well balanced and provides a full range of tastes throughout th drink. Just an awesome  beer and one I will look forward to having again at some point this lifetime.

Interesting flavor with so much malt richness and some fruitiness to match but a distinct bitterness far in the background; very fig- and plum-like, chocolate brownie, blackberry, spicy nutmeg and mace, still the molasses, tea leaves and faint twig bring just enough deceptive bitterness, and just a faint Colombian coffee hint in there.

Started very similar to the Roch 10 but the subtle bitter notes were amazing addition to a very rich and fruity style.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Transcription of an old BA review from 03-24-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate...someday.\n\nThe review comprises notes from separate tastings of two different vintages. Scores are for vintage 2008.\n\nVintage ’08:\nThe review is based on notes taken in fall/winter 2009.\nYellow capped ascetic bottle with best before date 03.12.2011. Considering that Westveleteren 12 beers are bottled 3 years prior to expiration date the beer is vintage 2008. The pour into St. Bernardus goblet gives muddy rusty - mahogany brown nectar with light tan bubbly head fading into an island of agglomerated bubbles. Aromas of sour cherries, berries, figs & raisins, touch of cocoa, breeze of red wine. The flavor profile is nutty-cocoaish with over-ripened figs, rummy with sweet malt base balanced by mild hoppy bitterness prolonged into lingering subtle bitter aftertaste. Silky smooth and creamy with alcohol unbelievably well hidden the roughly one year old beer is fruitier, with more expressed vinousness and less hoppy character than fresh one. 10 4 10 5 19 = 4.8\n\nVintage ’89\nI was told the bottle is ’89 vintage therefore 21 yrs old although this cannot be verified as Westvleteren bottles didn’t always have BBE date on their crowns. However, the 11% ABV imprinted on the cap indicates this was a pre-1999 bottling. Between 1999 and 2002 the alcohol content of Westvleteren 12 has been gradually reduced from 11% to the current level of 10,2%. Diminishing of ABV was necessary to facilitate the brewing process as high levels of alcohol are more likely to kill the yeast. To the beer.\nInto Westvleteren chalice. Clear coppery-mahogany brown body lacking any head apart from short lived bubbly island floating on the surface. In over two decades of aging the beer has undergone a complete transformation from quad to fortified wine or even liqueur: at this stage is highly viscous, alcoholic, sweet and abounds in fruity esters.\nPalpable aromas of strongly fortified, port-like wine, intense sugary sweetness, plums, dried fruits represented by prunes, sour cherries , figs and rum soaked raisins. Clear presence of alcohol which is well incorporated into the whole. Each aroma listed reincarnates itself in the flavor department that perfectly matches the nose.The mouthfeel of warming and liqueurish brew is syrupy but not in a sickly manner, with zero carbonation. I’m pouring the beer carefully to keep the black slush at the bottom. Even so the last pour is hazy due to the raised yeasty sediment which adds some spiciness and in contrary with beliefs does not ruin the beer. Fully mature Westvleteren 12 is great, although does not have much in common with what I see as a beer.  10 2 10 5 18 = 4,5", "rating": "4.8"},

To explain further The Chimay was the biggest disappointment, it was obviously good, but the worst of the first four, the Rochefort beers were just as good as the first time I tried them, but was expecting that the St. Bernardus would be better, it wasn’t, both Rochefort’s are a prime example of what a Trappist beer should taste like, so the big question, is the Westvleteren the king kong of the Trappist world.- Westvleteren 12- Pours a ruby murky red with a nice bone white head that recedes to a collar, lacework is good, aroma is stifled cherries and Belgian yeast .

Full bodied fruity and sweet, not too much though but just enough and a little bit more. Very lean mouth feel, you feel the alcohol but as a complementary part of the flavor and round enjoyable maltyness. Fantastic good!

Then I’ll be able to decide if it truly is the greatest beer in the world. 33 cl botle poured into Trappist glass. Pours a murky brownish orange with a nice bone-white head that retains itself for a long time; when it collapses, it leaves a fine blanket of foam and some nice lace. Not nearly as much sediment as the Rochefort. Better looking than the other beer. Aroma is spicy, bananas, ripe plums, earth, cooked black beans, some funk. Equal in the aroma department to the Rochefort, but they are very different. Taste is sweet with no bitterness (towards the end of the bottle a little bitterness shows up in the finish); almost Eisbock sweet. Some apple pie in the flavor. Crisper than the Rochefort; meaty.

The inch or so of head is very dense, slightly beige, clinging on tightly to the glass on its descent.\nThe nose is quite intense and complex; dried apricots, raisin, fig, brown sugar, grain husk, undertones of chocolate, clove and peppery spice.\nRelatively low carbonation for a Belgian. Very creamy on the palate, excellent weight; not too heavy, well balanced, certainly not much indication of that abv.\nDeeply complex, and i’d say, unique flavour; rich dried fruits prominant with dates, figs, apricots, sultanas, prunes. There also seems to be a fair bit of hop flavour to it with some floral notes, and earthy spice and vanilla. Malts play their hand in amongst the lengthy palate with chocolate, bread and burnt caramels lingering. Bitterness higher than I was expecting, certainly enough to balance out the sweetness.\n\nWell worth the wait; definately one of those beers the more you look, the more you see; an experience for the tastebuds.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Certain products and certain pieces of art have a reputation for such amazing feats of greatness that their reputation is hegemonic. I could write an entire dissertation analyzing whether such reputations are due to authentic reaction and therefore deserved, or due to word-of-mouth hyperbole (especially in the era of the internet). I could also make the argument that the title of \"the best beer ever\" is an impossibility since that title implies some kind of measurable output and a place in a factual hierarchy of quality. But the method used to judge how \"good\" a beer is is based on personal taste, not any kind of mathematical, observable performance output. If beer could be judged using a scientific process, we could simply devise a formula and plug in the numbers - in essence discounting personal taste and the notion of a beer critic would be arbitrary.\n\nSo while I scoff at the notion of the \"best\" beer or the existence of a hierarchy of beer quality as a matter of fact (rather than as a matter of opinion), I still want to try beers with good reputations to experience and judge them for myself. And what better beer to do this with than Westvleteren 12 - a Trappist beer brewed by monks and sold exclusively at the monastery in Belgium. It’s roundly regarded as \"The Greatest Beer in the World\" among the craft beer enthusiast community. Now that I’ve had the opportunity to try it myself I can understand why some would give it that title. And while I do think it’s an excellent beer, it’s not the greatest beer I’ve ever had.\n\nAPPEARANCE AND AROMA\n\nI drank this beer twice - the first time I split an 11.2oz bottle with two friends. The second time I poured a bottle into a Trappist chalice. The beer looks more like red wine with a dark brown, extremely hazy body with a slightly ruby red hue. It forms a surprisingly large, frothy, beige head which never completely dissipates and leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass. \n\nThe aroma is also wine-like, although many Belgian \"strong dark ales\" or \"quadruples\" tend to have this scent. It’s mostly dark fruit with red grape, plum, and cherry dominating the nose with some ribbon candy notes too. There’s a perfume aroma of lavender and flowers with an underlying presence of strong alcohol.\n\nTASTE\n\nI’ve often found that the more highly-acclaimed a beer is, the more complex its palate. Belgian beers, especially Trappist brews, are known for being so complex that each sip is different than the one before it. Perhaps the best way to describe the taste of Westvleteren 12 would be to simply list adjectives: red wine; oak; Macintosh apple; cherry; vanilla; caramel; dark chocolate; fig; plum; bread, and alcohol.\n\nWhile I would say this beer is indeed very tasty and appealing, it’s not to the point of being absolutely delicious. The palate is not quite as intense as you’d expect. The flavors begin to light up your palate as soon as they touch it with the aforementioned dark fruit flavors. The middle is noticeably dry with a slight chalky taste of malts and a touch of sourness. The finish is a surprise, though, with rich caramel and dark chocolate sweetness followed by a bitter aftertaste that lingers shortly.\n\nWestvleteren 12 is definitely tasty and complex, but as impressive as it may be, this is still not the most delectable palate I’ve ever encountered. The intensity seems a little lower than it should be, with the alcohol taking some attention away from the palate. \n\nDRINKABILITY\n\nOne of the reasons I’ve been slow to warm up to Belgian beers is due to their spastic mouthfeel. I was pleasantly surprised by the gentleness by which Westvleteren 12 crossed my palate. There was no peppery sensation, so the beer was quite smooth going down. However, there is a definite presence of alcohol to cause for some heat in the throat and a dry aftertaste. This is a beer you’ll drink in sips anyway, since you’ll want to savor the experience.\n\nAt 10.2% ABV, this beer should be handled with kid gloves. The monks did an outstanding job of making such a weighty beer so palatable, but after one full serving I could tell I had drank a potent beer. \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nIt’s nice to have finally experienced Westvleteren 12 for myself, even if it did cost quite a bit to acquire. And while I enjoyed it a lot, I don’t quite understand how it got the reputation of being the best of the best. If this beer were as common as other Trappist beers like Chimay, Orval, Westmalle, Rochefort, etc. it would simply be regarded as \"another excellent Belgian beer\" - which it what it is.\n\nNOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZKF1kX3CUQ", "rating": "4.2"},

For a premium, that will be the Westy 12.\n\nWesty 12 Review\n\n\nThe Westvletren 12 is my 500th beer.  And it marks my passage from beer drinker to beer appreciator.  I am thirsty for more.\n\nI chose the Westy to mark a half-thousand beers consumed not only because it is an excellent and well-regarded beer.  It is symbolic.  More than a sample of a precise chemical craft, or brewing, the Westy represents the origins of my beer hobby, and the evolution of my palate and my interest in the field of beer.  Above all, this particular bottle was a gift from the very person who introduced me to beer.  It is a gesture that I took his invitation to heart, and have faithfully pursued the hobby well after we parted to different parts of the globe.  And it is a mark of my respect for his patience in enduring my initial skepticism, callousness and thick-headedness when it came to drinking beer and taking notes.  I owe him a great debt, and I honor that debt by drinking his beer.\n\nI took great care and attached great ceremony to reviewing the Westvleteren.  Ambient noise and smells were minimized.  Paper and pen were placed nearby, ready to receive observations and hastily scrawled epiphanies.  I cleared my head of distractions (there are many) and focused exclusively on this laughably humble bottle and its innards.  I girded myself for my Westvleteren 12.\n\nThe pour is pretty standard, even mundane.  It kicks up a light brown head, little to no lacing, and aside from a few flecks of yeast in the last droplets to fall from the bottle’s mouth, I have no physical evidence that this beer will be a milestone in my beer drinking career.  That evidence appears in the aroma.  I am stricken with childhood memories of happy Colorado Christmases, as an intoxicating blend of vanilla, oak, ribeye steaks, fig, and a touch of chocolate fill my nose.  It is incredible, and it is here that I first get a taste of what all the praise, writing and hype is about.  The Westy isn’t hype at all.  It is credibly amazing, and deservedly loved.  And the taste fits the Quad. style I’ve come to love so much.  It is big and rich, barreling onto the tongue with the same aromatic flavors that caused me to reel in my chair.  A few seconds later this boldness attenuates, exposing an undercurrent of fig and a deep, sweet red wine flavor.  And then again, moments later this layer of flavor recedes to expose a tertiary layer of molasses, oak, smoked wood and a parmesan cheese like umami.  To be short, there are three distinct layers of flavors, each of them characteristically delicious, and each a little quieter than the last.  That final touch of umami savoriness is practically a whisper, but you can still make out the words.\n\nWith all these flavors in a single beer there is a very real threat that the flavors may become crowded and muddled.  This is not the case.  The Westvleteren 12 delivers these flavors in stages, and on a perfect palate.  The beer is thick, but not syrupy, and it textures the flavors without warping them.  It is a crowd of luminaries, each in perfect concordance with the others, a kind of harmony of brilliance without egos to interfere.\n\nBy the very end of the beer I am questioning whether this is actually a Quadrupel.  It has all the basic qualities of a Belgian Strong Ale according to my taste buds, and possibly according to a rigid style guide.  But I think the Belgian Strong Ale tag might be slightly too tight on a beer like this.  The Westvletren is an expression of a style, and a permutation so fantastically brewed that it almost breaks from tradition.  These breaks are sometimes called revolutions, which would be the highest form of irony for the Westy’s brewers who are steeped in tradition themselves.  But they are also steeped in this beer, and they must know that what they do, they do very well.  This level of brewing is intentional, and it shows.  One need only look at the lines of avid drinkers banging on the monastery’s doors to understand that there must be some authentic draw to this beer.  And now I finally realize it through a few intense sips. I’ve extended a dimension of my understanding of beer and the craft beer world with one bottle of a highly-esteemed brew.  This really is a fantastic hobby.\n\nCheers Stéphane!", "rating": "4.8"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "In De Vrede. Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus.  June 2010.  I drank this beer at the cafe at the abbey itself in Belgium.  No doubt that the surroundings influenced my impression of the beer.  If you are planning a trip to Belgium, be warned that this place is TOUGH to get to without a car.  There are no buses or trains that go directly to the abbey, and a 10 km walk from Poperinge almost thwarted my efforts... but I made it, tired and thirsty, to the cafe In De Vrede!\n\nA. The beer came to me poured, although still from a bottle (unlike some other Trappist ales, that can be found on tap).  It maintained a head, light tan, and darker than that of the 8.  Small bits of sediment could be seen bouncing off the bottom of the glass as it bubbled (which it did with fervor).  The beer was served with the only real label-the cap.  (the picture on ratebeer.com is a post-sale label, not from the abbey)\n\nS. The nose of this beer is strong, but not over-powering.  More depth than the 8, with more intense, not really even hints, of prunes, raisins, fermented fruits and brandy.  Underneath the formidable scents of fruit, there is a musty, woody, base.  All of this clears out of the nose and leaves hints of grassy smells, likely from the hops, used almost exclusively for preservation.\n\nT. The initial sip instantly reveals sweetness and dark fruit flavors uncommon even among Belgian beers.  It is big, simply put.  Overwhelming flavors of syrup and brown sugar, balanced by fermented cherries and bourbon.  There is definitely heat from the alcohol, but the taste and smell are not invaded by this characteristic too much.  More subtle flavors come through after the initial shock wears off.  Wood, a little spice (grains of paradise? nutmeg?), and a clean dryness finish the flavor off.\n\nM.  Bubbles all over my tongue swept the thickness of the beer away well.  I was plagued with the \"scrubbing bubbles\" image as i tried to sift through the carbonation to pin the taste and viscosity of the beer down.  It was difficult to do, but the beer has a syrupy consistency that is still not as thick as the flavor would suggest.  Fun, tough to grasp, and playful, the mouth feel may have been the best part!\n\nD.  Surprisingly refreshing and fleeting, this beer was great, even on a hot and sunny Belgian afternoon.  The alcohol is 10.2%, but it did not feel anything like that (until i stood up).  It was easy to drink and doesn’t want to quit, which must make it especially difficult for the monks to drink only one!  \n\nI finished it with a dish of chocolate ice cream made at the abbey, and they paired wonderfully.  The dryness on the back end really stood out against the hedonistic sugar and cream in the dessert.  It would be perfectly at home with anything from beef stew, to grilled and saucy meat, to sweet desserts of chocolate or fruit.  A versatile and edgy beer, given the mystery surrounding it and the age of the brewing tradition from whence it comes.\n\nNot my favorite beer, but worth a trip to its home.

Solid but decided not to pay the $380 for a case from A-Dam though after trying this beer.  I would like to try this fresh.", "rating": "4.1"},

Flavor is light spice creamy, so smooth, and surprisingly not very boozy feeling. Creamy malts with sharp bitterness that is intense for only a second and then lingers. Really lives up to the hype!

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "500th rating. Bottle cap date-15.12.12. Consumed March 2010. A murky brown beer with an amazing looking head that very slowly dissipates. I mean this head has the longest retention that I have ever seen. It took about 10 minutes for it to settle down to drink it, but the whole time it was in the glass it kept a 1 inch layer of foam. Perfection? Maybe. The aroma was like baked crusty bread, dark fruits, nuts, dash of chocolate and was quite hoppy. The taste was peppery, more baked bread, lots of nuts, raisins, other dark fruits, yeast, wood, banana and the 10% ABV is absolutely hidden. What I find so great about this beer is the fact that it is so big and has a lot of layers of flavors yet it is extremely drinkable. I hear others mention that Rochefort 10 and Bernardus 12 are just as good. But the difference between Westy and those beers is this is so much more drinkable. This has all those flavors that those beers have and more but goes down way smoother than those other fine beers. I was surprised at how hoppy it was also. I had another bottle of Westy with a different date stamped on it that was not quite as complex as this so that’s what is stopping me from giving it a perfect score. I will revisit the other bottles that I have and if they age for the better then perfect 5.", "rating": "4.9"},

Thought it would be appropriate to review the #1 rated beer in the world with this landmark review. Poured into my Chimay Chalice.\n\nA- Body is a very hazy dark brown color. Pours with a minimally creamy off white head. Head subsides to a thick half-moon collar with no collar around half of it and an eggshell creamy remnants of the head in the center. When held up to the light one can see the thick, dynamic cloudiness of this brew.\n\nS- The overall impression of the nose is slightly sweet. Raisins, figs, root beer, cola, grapes, plums are mostly upfront and have a background of slightly spicy Belgian yeast and a very subtle, sneaky alcohol background.\n\nT-The initial flavors are exquisite and balanced. A perfect bland of spicy Belgian yeast, fig, malt, and and dark fruits such as sweet raisins and slightly tart plum mix perfectly and give off a root beer and cola-like flavor. The spicy yeast comes through a little more for the finish as well as a slight bitter alcohol bite. The flavor then turns around and ends with a sweet fruity note. A slight essence of spicy Belgian yeast lingers. Flavor is wonderful and complex.\n\nP-Medium carbonation and wonderfully smooth and creamy body. Yeasty and smooth but with a touch of alcohol astringency.\n\nO-This is a wonderful quadruple and it was truly and honor to try it. As far as pure drinkability is concerned; it is definitely a slow sipper. This, and other good examples of the style, IMO,are meant to be slipped slowly as you contemplate the complexity of what was produced. The ABV is quite noticeable and if you don’t take your time with this brew you surely won’t get a chance to appreciate it. Due to its $ and availability, its a beer that was definitely worth it for the first try/review but I will reserve obtaining it again for a VERY special occasion.

Pours clear red-brown with a moderate, frothy tan head and large clumps of sediment. Head has good retention and great lace. Aromas of honey, yeast, chocolate, tobacco, plum, raisin, pepper and spice. Flavour is honey sweet toasted malts throughout. Against this background, flavours of pepper and spice evolve and develop. The finish is long and lingering, spicy with a hint of nut. The 10.2% ABV is well-concealed, but it peeks through in the finish. As the glass warms, alcohol becomes more prominent and the aromas become more vinous. Medium in body, with an ultra-smooth, creamy texture that is ever so slightly sticky. Carbonation is average. So, does this beer match its hype? Westvleteren 12 is clearly incredibly well made. It is complex and subtle, and perfect for moments of deep introspection. For me, the real question is how it stacks up against its younger brother, Westvleteren 8. The 12 is sweeter, smoother and more alcoholic, but also lighter in body. Both are complex and malty, with the 8 more nutty and the 12 more vinous. Both are excellent brews, but I prefer the 8 by the slightest of margins. 2010-04-07", "rating": "4.2"},

Best before February 10th, 2011, so roughly two years old.\n\nA - Thank god! After the flat bottle I had in Toronto I was worried. The cap comes off with a hiss and a touch of gunsmoke. Pours with a voluminous two fingers of dark tan foam (impressive for a goblet!), that dissipates quite slowly and leaves glass-coating lacing and a thick cap. The body is a nearly opaque dark plum color.\n\nS - The smell literally explodes out of the glass, with an initial wave of dark fruits and berries. Plums, prunes, raisins, black cherries - they’re all here. There’s some vinous red wine notes that emerge, along with a touch of sweet tobacco, apples, and nuts. There’s a caramel malt backbone that ties things together, but stays in the periphery. As it warms a touch of booze peeks through to remind you that this is for sipping.\n\nT - The taste is very grape-forward, with notes of port, red wine, dark fruits, rum-cake, and caramel. It’s not as saccharine as Rochefort 10, as it’s balanced by a dryish and slightly woody finish. While the taste isn’t quite as complex as the nose, the alcohol is better hidden.\n\nM - The body is chewy and viscous, without becoming heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is present, but soft. Finishes surprisingly dry with only mild residual stickiness. Not much in the way of alcohol heat at all. It’s everything I’d want in a quad, and maybe even a bit more.\n\nD - So, is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but it’s a superb one nonetheless. It’s shockingly drinkable for a 10.2% quad, and I could actually have more than one of these without feeling diabetic too.

Massive retention and sheety, full lacing. Nose is rich milk chocolate, cinnamon, dates and figs. Taste is ultra rich milk chocolate, cinnamon apple butter, raspberry compote and ganache. Mild spicy calvados adds alcohol warm and sharpness. Effervescent carbonation and present hoppiness cut the sweetness. Very rich and aerated palate.

Starts out big on the black currents (wicked!!), some molasses, licorice, cherry, some roasitness, ends with more black currents (wicked!!!), and more licorice.

Alcohol is beautifully manifested in sweet and bready concept, like a rum raisin flavor. Flavor is also extraordinary; dark fruit is abound, with lots of plum, molasses, caramel, and raisin, but there is also a beautiful note of sweet nuts, like almond paste.

You can really feel all of those different components that make up the nose.\n\n\nPalate: It’s hard for me to give a great judgment of the palate due to the beer being quite flat, but it does have a very nice mouthfeel and a semi-full body\n\n\nOverall Impression: \nSo the hype is here for sure, and I couldn’t help but save this one to be number 1000.  Thanks to Nick for hooking me up with this rare treat!  You were correct my friend, the bottle does appear to have gotten a little flat, but all the wonderful components seem to have survived.  When I opened this bottle, zero choirs began singing, my life didn’t change, and I didn’t find the meaning of life, but I did find one heck of a beer.  One of the more complex and enjoyable beverages I have ever had the privilege of enjoying.  Anyway, I’m excited this was the beer I used to mark off my 1000 rating on Ratebeer.com.", "rating": "4.5"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "11.2 ounce bottle, brewed in 2009.  Pours mahogany, semi-cloudy, with a medium tan head that leaves only a little bit behind.  Awesome aroma of dark fruits (plum, date, raisin, fig), caramel, malts, spices, and faint alcohol.  The flavor lives up to the nose, with the same dark fruits, caramel, and malts, as well as mild spices, nuts, wood, and warming alcohol.  Medium bodied, really smooth, and alcohol is pretty subdued for being 10%.  It’s hard to find flaws in this one- maybe the body is thin for the style, and the color isn’t the most beautiful shade of mahogany.  But those are just tiny observations that mean virtually nothing compared to this beer as a whole.  I never thought this could live up to the hype, but it absolutely satisfied all expectations.

Ok, not nervous, but I was very aware that this is the holy grail of beers and I really wanted to do it justice. Because of the hype I wanted to make sure I didn’t overrate or underrate it--just drink it and give an honest opinion. Contrary to popular belief, angels didn’t sing and monks didn’t chant upon opening the bottle. I poured it into a Duvel tulip, and it formed a nice foamy tan head above a cloudy caramel brown pour. The nose was a little sharper than I expected (though it is 10.2%) with bready cherries and a bit of sharp booze. The taste, however, was fantastic, complex and lasting. It’s yeasty sweet bread on one sip, syrupy, caramel sweetness the next. Tried to pick out what I was tasting, but it was hard. Found some cinnamon, honey, faint chocolate, and some lingering yeasty breadiness after the sip was long down my throat. It’s smooth as hell, pretty chewy, and just coats the glass. There’s a touch of sharpness on the finish, but that doesn’t detract too much. While it wasn’t a religious experience, it was a fine beer that I’d love to lay down for a couple years.", "rating": "4.2"},

A nice looking beige head of about 3 cm with good retention leaves plenty of lacings.\n\nSmell: A deep and rich smell. Plenty of fruity aromas (cherries, plums, overripe strawberries), raisins, wet wood. The malty backbone is thick and \"dark\" and is accompanied by a prominent spicy aroma. A hint of yeast. The alcohol is noticeable, but very integrated with the rest of the aromas. A great smell.\n\nTaste: The taste is nothing but fantastic. A noble and rich malty backbone and semi-sweet cherries converge with a prominent, but not very strong, taste of alcohol. At this point, the beer is quite reminiscent of a fine liqueur. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Raisins adds another sweet component. Earthy yeast and spices balance the massive sweetness. Faint nutty aromas, and perhaps just a minimal hint of tartness. In the finish, the alcohol is very noticeable and has a sweet and warming character. But the alcohol is very well integrated and suits the beer nicely. The finish is slightly bitter with notes of spices, iron and grass.\n\nMouthfeel: Full-bodied with a velvety smooth texture. The rather high level of carbonation is well suited for the overall character.\n\nDrinkability: What to say about this legendary brew? Well, I think it’s almost as good as it’s reputation say it is. It’s just unbelievably tasty with an impressive complex character. This one comes really close to perfection.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n(Copy of old Beer Advocate review)", "rating": "4.4"},

Seriously big thank-yous for showing up with this.  Bottle code said 23.06 which we looked up and I believe it was a 2007 batch.  Cola brown with a tiny lace and tiny ring.  The nose was musty and sweet.  Sweet tea and cola or something.  Interestingly, although the head was tiny, carbonation fizzed on the side of the glass when tilted, and it was super fizzy carbonated in the mouth.  I don’t recall having that happen with any other beer.  The taste has the same effect as the nose, but with a lot more going on.  Sweet, to sharp bitter, then finally a pungent funkiness.

Lots of soft dark fruit, leather, nutty, wood and chocolate.  It is dark but comes off so smooth you think you were drinking a nectar of hazelnut-raspberry chocolate truffle.

It left me pondering which little details would refine a beer to this level, the myriads of processes behind its making, and its journey from the abbey to my apartment in Bergen, Norway. \n\nThe Westvleteren 12 is so balanced and fine-tuned that a traditional dissecting analysis of its contents seems only to disenchant the entirety of the tasting experience. Thus, I can only describe it in the ways of an entity, a combination of flavor, aroma and palate so tightly interwoven that it seemed to represent a different tactile sense altogether. The only keyword that has stuck in my mind in hindsight is: honey. And I like honey a lot. Particularly when it seems to have been gathered on clouds by angelic bees, sifted with stardust and filtered through the Pearly Gates themselves.\n\nAm I going over the top here? Indeed.

Taste is a tiny bit bitter with a spicy ending. Hints of red fruits, vanilla, cherries, chocolate and some hops but really in the background only. Some nuts also. Finish is dry and sweet at the same time. Quite warm but not much considering the alcohol. The first few sips were a bit disappointing (considering its reputation) but it became really complex and delightful after. Carbonation is interesting.

Concord grape, cola nut, plum.  The beer’s not cold, maybe 50 degrees.  Some dark raisin, but nothing unique and nothing in the way of pinnacle.  And the sip.  Dark cherry, damp dust, raspberry syrup, and alcohol fuel.  I’ve had a few moments where a single beer has changed the way i look at beer as a whole and I was expecting this beer to do that again.  Fireworks.  It’s not fair to the monks.  But I really think that in a blind taste test I would feel the same way.  Nearly sticky, not as hot as the 8.  I’m so thrilled to finally be drinking this.

Out of fridge for about 10-15 minutes and breathing a few more minutes before pouring. I wanted to let it breathe a bit longer but I pop the cap and it’s happy to see me as it slowly froths above the top of the bottle so I pour a little bit into the chalice. The foam keeps coming so I get the rest in there.\n\nThe pour as mentioned is extremely well-carbonated and yields a slightly murky raisin brown. Active carbonation yields a 1/2-finger head in the chalice; it dissipates but leaves a wispy ginger-colored film resembling a solid Kosher rye.\n\nWhoooaaa, camel...first impression is clove, ginger and rum raisin ice cream. The beautiful bride notices prunes and a bit of chocolate...she’s spot on. Prunes definitely abound; there’s a dark leather scent...even a bit of soapy plums. Very complex with a mild to moderate booziness that’s carrying ginger notes and aided by the solid carbonation.\n\nI’m getting a little bit of floral soapy notes at first, followed by mild gingerbread, a little clove and then some raisins. It’s amazing what 5 more minutes of warmth does for this. The floral soap veneer thankfully burns away and we’re back in solid Quad ground. The leathery fruitcake spices, the deep dark dried plums, dates and chocolate covered cherries bring this another level of complexity. Surprisingly austere on the finish...much more dry than expected. As the BB indicated earlier, mild baking/bittersweet chocolate emerges with warmth. Prunes, too. Still, a tad of lingering floral soapiness.\n\nFor some reason I expected a big mild spice and raisin bomb. I’m really surprised at the pleasant dryness of this offering. The construction is so well-done that there’s not a lot of mess left behind. The excited carbonation may indicate that the yeast in this deal may have eaten everything they could wrap their cells around. Still, that floral soapiness still lingers.\n\nMaybe it’s the thought of enjoying this for the very first time but this dows go down very quickly. It definitely takes a while for that one off-flavor - the floral soap - to burn off its weirdness. Note no real mention of booziness on the taste or palate profile - after the initial rum raisin ice cream scent it simply isn’t an issue. My guess is that I should probably invest in a case of this some day to evaluate over time because merely one bottle isn’t enough. With many extreme offerings the flavors and notions are in your face so that there’s no mistake. This treasure is definitely more subtle and takes a little more time to figure out.

Excellent wide ropy lacing (it does disappear after awhile), retention at a thin surface cover. The aroma is awesome and never weakens throughout the tasting. A bit sweet, nice mild spice (main characteristic), slight caramel and dark fruit. Extremely well balanced but not overly complex. Touch of earth? The flavour is very well blended which has made it hard to distinguish standout tastes. Very soft yeast, absolutely no alcohol, mild mild plum, slight chocolate?, minor pepper, notable malt taste, slight peppermint / spearmint ??? I’ll correct myself as I’ve now noticed the alcohol.

Appearance: Thick dark, murky brown with a wispy brown head. Aroma: Too much going on! Caramel, spice, yeast, leather, rosehip, ginger, malt, alcohol, cinnamon yet somehow very muted and understated - like a torpedo, just tremendous. Flavour: Wow, spicy, malty, like a well worn leather jacket. Whiskey and woody, sticky & toffee. some spilled on my my fingers and they were sticking together. Just so much dark fruit, figs, xmas pudding, cherries, red wine, ginger again, tingling my tongue, long sticky finish, just tremendous! I can’t believe I’ve finally got the chance to have it. Thanks to Blutt59 and HogTownHarry for bringing me on this beer journey. Beer #1000", "rating": "4.6"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Murky brown, deeply fruity ale has overlying rough & bucolic character. Very textural with surprisingly grippy palate from the assertive hop bitterness, almost grainy malts and a touch of alcohol. Underlying sweet silky deep fruit adds countering smoothness - and solid weight. LOTS of additions in this brew. So many flavors, wine fruit java-roast honey and spice. This beer is fairly big and makes itself FELT - in ways reminding me equally of barley wine and porto, but that doesn’t really say it. Acceptably tough and demanding, while also soothing - will need to enjoy more samples when I travel locally in the region. Much less smooth than St. Bernardus Abt, this (Feb 2008 bottle) Westvleteren Abt is no doubt as variable as Rochefort but experience will tell me more. A Kudos to Ralph M for my #600.", "rating": "4.4"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Ok just finished my 1st Westy 12! Very similar to St. Bernardus 12, I know St. B. brewed Westvleteren up until 1996. Honestly the smell is what i really noticed at first and set it apart from the St. Bernadus. Very dark of course it is a quad with sediment. Flavor was fantastic cannot describe it really so many raisin, dark fruit flavors, cherry and others cannot describe in detail sorry. At first it was a bit too cold so there was a slight alcohol finish, but as it warmed no detection of any alcohol and just great feel overall while drinking. Overall a great ale id put it up against 1st in a blind taste test with a St. Bernardus 12 and i will. My recomendations drink it at a little below room temperature 70 degrees IMO.", "rating": "4.7"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Was planning on ageing this for awhile but something inside just told me to drink it tonight during a nice summer thunder storm. Poured a smooth brown and settled into a darker shade of deep dark brown in the glass. The head was foamy and thick and held an almost indigo hue. As I polished off the pour, the sweet smell hit me...raisins and rum mostly. Tasting this behemoth was a stage-by-stage event that involved multiple phases and finishes. Stage 1: Lots of raisins on the taste buds, some alcohol presence felt as my whole tongue kinda tingled upon the first sips...felt really good. Finish was very rounded, slightly hoppy, and so smooth and balanced. Stage 2: As it warmed up, that alcohol became far more evident in the taste...almost canceling out all of the raisin aspects from before and introducing some kind of medicine-like feel...not unpleasant...but reminded me of vodka with it’s icy, somewhat metallic tone. At this point in time, the smell seemed sweeter and made me think of cotton candy and the finish had quite a burn to it. Stage 3; That burning sensation has tapered off a bit but still noticing mostly alcohol in the finish; although the balance remains stable. Stage 4: I’m thinking of port now, some smoke and a slightly toasted flavour that is difficult to pinpoint. Some fruity aspects coming out to me now also...apricot, apples, grapes. Stage 5: Coming near to the end of the glass now...sad to say. More of a distinct bitter sweetness coming through in the taste...brown sugar, cloves, spice, and cinnamon. But those elements are kind of attempting to cut through that thick hazy alcohol wall and not always making it. There is a sort of tar-like flavour that I am detecting along with orange peel and a burnt coffee zest. As I downed the final drop, it kind of sent a slight shiver through my body. The monks done good again. Bottom line: an interesting beer for sure, not sure how often I could truly drink these and seems like something I could enjoy more in the dead of winter...especially around Christmas/New Years Eve. Festive, complex, and comes across more like a Belgian Barleywine than anything else. So glad I could drink this. Will try and keep my patience and age the next one properly and compare.", "rating": "4.3"},

Me and beercronic finally decided it was time to drink the westies, but first we put it up against the St. Bernardus Abt 12, Rochefort 10, and Chimay blue, in a blind tasting battle royal. But doing it blind made for some interesting results ( cue suspenseful music ). It turns out for me anyway that the westy came in daed last in this blind tasting, not to say it was a bad beer but compared to the rest especially the Rochefort 10 it fell short. But enough of this on the review. Beer poured a dark, dark brown and had a minimal head just a skiff floated on top, and when I got close to the bottom of the bottle feta cheese looking chunks where plopping down in to the lake of beer. Aroma was very tasty, earth, floral notes, toffee and some very noticeable alcohol, the alcohol fit in very nicely into the aroma giving it a pleasant warming quality. Taste was yummy warm and cozy, lots of dark toffee malts, nice floral notes, warm alcohol and a nice spicy presence. Banana became more aggressive in the taste the longer I drank what made the beer smoother and took some of the edge off the alc. This beer tasted way more simple then I ever imagined it would, not nearly as complex as the Rochefort 10 but still very interesting to drink. I don’t think this beer lived up to its legend that it has, don’t get me wrong this is still one of the best beers in the world but I do not believe it is the best. I’ll give that honor to Rochefort 10. On a side note to this story as me and beercronic where attempting to do this review I was cooking supper and forced into my bed room due to the insane Caribbean jerk chicken smell coming from the bbq, and then chased out of there into the hallway of my condo building when the three heads of garlic I was using to make homemade garlic bread started to melt are faces off.

Pours a slightly murky purple amber that I remember being much darker in Belgium, very fine thin white froth on top.  This beer is pretty amazing, dark and bitter yet sweet and very easy to drink.  Tastes of bitter fruit skins, sweet molasses and very nutty, vaguely burnt brown sugar, noticeable yeastiness, plums.   Medium bodied with a medium/full mouthful, much softer carbonation than the fresh bottles I had in Belgium.  Yum.  Candied figs with great bitterness.  10.4.10.4.19 4/14/09.  [rerate of beer from February 2009]  not sure how I like these with age, really seems to lose it’s distinctiveness from the other trappists.  Becomes a very rich sweet cola like beverage.  Like a liquid milk dud.", "rating": "4.7"},

Pours a very dark and murky brown color with a frothy, cream colored head on top. Swirls of lacing are left behind as the foam recedes. The aroma is very enticing and shows hints of caramel soaked raisins, figs, and plums along with notes of cocoa, vanilla, and cream. The flavor follows with the caramel and dark fruits up front, but are then complimented perfectly by the raisins, vanilla, and rum flavors. The alcohol is slightly noticeable with a sweet warming on the back end. Medium to full bodied with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel that feels like heaven on the tongue. The sweet and warming finish lingers on for awhile and just begs for you to sip and savor this one.

The flavor is both dry, but sweet and both fruity (raisin, date?) and moderately malty.  Interesting sugary flavors, berry-like, and moderately malty.  There is an interesting spicy quality in the finish that is similar to that of a Pils.  Sightly dry finish.  The alcohol is there, but is not overly obvious.

This beer is topped by a light brown head that sits atop a brown beer.  There are notes of sherry, plum, and raisin (though the raisin is definitely the most dominant aroma) in the nose.  The beer smells sweet & rich as well.  Well the taste is fairly rich & sweet; there is lots of fig and plum notes, which are joined by a woodiness that is in the taste as well.  This beer was an awesome way to finish my great dinner at the Hop Leaf.  There is an astringent complexity to this beer that just brings it to a whole other level, and there is a slightly musty character that integrates well with the rest of the flavors.  I can fully understand why many consider this a world class beer.  I really like how this beer is quite fruity in both the aroma and in the taste.  The alcohol is very well hidden here, I can’t really detect it at all.  The rich sweetness is very conducive to being an after dinner drink.  This beer is like a rich, dark, sweet traditional German bread.  What makes this beer so good is that it is extremely well integrated; absolutely world class.\n\n\n\nCap Best By Date November 2007; Sampled February 2009\n\nTotal:3.9\n\n7/4/7/5/16\n\nA vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, creamy, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated amber color that when held up to the light shows that I poured quite a bit of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle into my glass, but is also a hazy, bright cherry color.  The aroma smells of spices and fruit with a rich, caramelized maltiness to the finish.  Aromas of fig cake, brandy soaked fruit cake, some marzipan, clove, dried cherries, white pepper, candied ginger form the bright aromatic notes.  There is a nice backbone here of must and damp earth, as well as some toasted malt character that provides a biscuit malt aromatics.  Some higher alcohols provide a bit of spiciness as well as some warming character to the tail end of each draught of the nose.  This has quite a rich nose to it, both the fruit and spices accentuate the perceived sweetness of the aroma.\n\n\n\nUp front this beer is a bit lighter than I expected, as it rolls across my tongue though it starts to pick up a viscous richness and heft, though it still maintains the drinkability that I like to have in a strong Belgian ale.  The beer has a definite sweetness (though not as much as the aroma might have suggested), but finishes with a spiciness that helps to dry the palate out.  The beer is a bit carbonated still after the vigorous pour and it provides a prickly carbonation as it rolls across the tongue.  fruit notes of prunes, musty figs and raisin are brought out by a touch of tartness as well as the sweetness in this beer.  There is a definite mustiness to this beer, it is oxidation character that it has picked up over the years, and it mixes nicely with the spiciness in the finish.  Speaking of which, the spiciness provides notes similar to white pepper, clove, a nutmeg like bite, some woody ginger and a touch of menthol in the long finish as well as some bitter cocoa.  This definitely gets more complex as it warms up from the high 40°F (~8°C) that it started out at.  The alcohol in the finish combines with the fruitiness to reminds me of Brandy.\n\n\n\nWell I had a bug dive bomb this beer, so it must have though there was something worth drinking in my glass (one of my dogs got a tasty, Westy soaked morsel because of that).  While this beer is quite good, I am quite disappointed in some ways.  I haven’t had this in a couple years, and I am thinking I need to try a fresher version to see if it is more like my memory of having this in Belgium and at the Hop Leaf (where I had it last).", "rating": "4.7"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "After the primarily overripe banana flavor of Rochefort, and the many comparisons I’ve heard between it and Westvleteren 12, I wasn’t sure what to expect--a distant relative, a first cousin, or a twin. After my tasting, I think only a fairly young and unrefined beer-tasting palate would judge RF10 and WV12 identical--each hit my mouth with very different flavors. Met some nice fellow Americans in Belgium at the abbey today picking up their orders around 3PM; wish we could’ve hung out. Exclusive rep of the beer didn’t mean much to me compared to the simple friendliness of the seller and overall good spirit around the Vleteren area, but I think the rep is absolutely deserved. Nose is similar to Kasteel bruin, and both beers are sweet, but the flavor of Westvleteren is oh so much riper and deeper than nearly any beer I’ve had... leather, vanilla, burnt caramel, licorice, slight butter, faint coffee, soft cinnamon spice and figs and apricot, with some smoky oak. I could swear I even taste a hint of caramelized witloof, that bizarre and wild acquired-taste vegetable which is the signature of Belgium. (Discounting brussel sprouts, which I really can’t stand.) Mouthfeel is marvelous; so velvety and rich that it’s like butterscotchy liquid angora. The dark anise aftertaste is almost not bitter at all, yet it dances a waltz with your tongue long after you’re finished. The moment my glass was empty I was dying for another. The only other beer I can think of that’s as complex as this is the far more bitter Storm King Stout, from Victory. So what is the best beer in the world? You’ll really have to try all the best-rated ones to answer the question of what suits your personal preferences the best, but Westvleteren 12 is truly marvelous, and definitely worth the test if you can get your hands on it. On further testing, I found this beer appeals even more. I can’t think of how to improve on it--I don’t know if it’s possible to ask more of a beverage.", "rating": "5.0"},

Taste is raisins, chocolate, port, caramel, candied dates, chocolate truffles, it is just layer after layer of delicious sweet dessert flavors. Long lasting finish and a nice syrup like mouthfeel. Minor carbonation that feel like smooth bubbles on your palate. Easy to drink at 10 percent and the taste makes it hard to stop drinking. Awesome.", "rating": "4.4"},

Spicy alcohol fill the end of the inhale. Suede Mouthfeel with a medium carbonation. The spicy character hides the malt nicely. Pretty sweet like with a nice warming from the ever present alcohol. Lingering spiciness and dry fruit flavors. Very creamy mouthfeel, very smooth. O the big flaw is how smooth this beer is. Hell I didn’t want to wait for it to warm up a little.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "With great anticipation I poured the beer from the bottle into a trappist glass.  The aroma was a highly complex blend of deep and dark fruit scents.  The most noticeable notes were those of raisin, plums, prunes, and some other figs.  There was also a hoppy component, with some citrus tones, including a touch of grapefruit, and a grainy-earthy hop part; maybe a bit of wheat, and late-emerging toffee notes.  The beer had a rich, dark brown color, with the slightest tint of dark copper.  The head was a bubbly-foamy off-white/light tan color with a very big size initially.  It lost its big head in the beginning, but leveled off to maintain a thin layer on top of the beer, with creamy edges., which remained until the end of the beer and left a lot of clingy foam on the glass.  I was worried I might be disappointed going in for the first sip, but far from it... the flavor explodes in the mouth almost immediately.  The first flavor to hit the mouth is probably the raisin-plum taste, with some sweetness, folllowed by a good bit of sour-bitterness.  As it warmed a bit, some of the grainy-earthy flavors came forward; there was also a toffee malt effect in the taste.  The beer has a hugely lively fizz feel along with the flavors, and leaves the mouth feeling full from even the smallest sip.  It has a thick, lasting effect, and the alcohol content pokes through from time to time.  The body was smooth and wet, yet still left the mouth feeling slightly dry.  Before having this beer, and even in the first moments, I was worried that it would not live up to the hype... but it did.  While the aroma and appearance were great (especially the retention of the cling and head), it was the flavor and palate feel that truly separate this beer from the pack.  I have never experienced such a burst of flavor coupled with a majestic palate feel before.

The nose is a luscious blend of dark, dried fruits, and some wood. \n\nThe taste is completely blended, there are no layers of individual flavors. The initial flavor is kind of sweet up front, but quickly begins to dry out. The woody, or perhaps leathery, character appears, and then a faint bitterness, as if from hops. The mouthfeel is barely carbonated, but silky smooth, and heavy. I drank three of these the last night of Marvin’s rule over Chalkies. It is to him that I owe many thanks for this bottle. \n\nI think that in Europe, the second number of the date represents the year, rather than the third, as in America.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "A rich earthy brown, she pours delectably into my glass, a goblet of course. A generous body, she is a deep earthy brown leaving no room for light to peek through. Thick and luscious in my glass with a nice tight, tan head which fades into a light ring around my glass. Much yeast in the nose with fruits such as prune, fig, and raisin. Westy is thick, heavy, and meaty in my mouth. A light touch of effervescent which I find is typical or bottle fermented Belgian Ales, and I love it. The palate is sweet and yeasty and a blend of darkish fruits like the prune, fig, and raisin I got in the nose. The whole flavor profile seems to settle right on the center of my tongue, lingering with a hint of dryness. Like a good Belgian, Westy warms beautifully, bringing out even more of the tangy yeasty sour goodness. Westy 12 finishes beautifully, much to my sadness, because I really didn’t want this wonderful Belgian beer to end. A true Trappist quadrupel, bless those monks.\n\n\nFor a high ABV, Westy 12 is very drinkable, and I could easily put a couple of these away, maybe with some yummy gourmet cheeses n smoked salmon. I have had a few \"religious experiences\" over the last few years of my beer geekdom, and Trappist Westvleteren 12 is definitely one of those.", "rating": "4.8"},

Pours a deep brownish red with a thick off white head. Nicely packed carbonation bubbles stream up the side of the glass. Aroma has a strong caramel malt sweetness, candy sugar, raisin, plums, and cherries all combined together, yet no one overpowering. Reminds me of a nice cognac where you just sit and savor the complexity of the aroma. Nice creamy body. Taste is thick and malty with lots of dark fruit notes, cherry, candy sugar.

I figured this was the perfect time to celebrate this brew the last weekend of summer, the working mans weekend, and all truly life is good.\n\nBottle served slightly chilled in my favorite chalice. The pour produced a good two fingers worth of Brown head that goes to a great lace. The body was brown to a dark red in color \n\nThe nose has tons of Malts and dark fruits It is a little less Intense than expected But it may be just reality catching up to expectation. There was a hint of spice and alcohol as well as it warms.\n\nFlavors of sweet dark fruits filled my mouth raisins figs and such. As it warms more of the alcohol is present in its bite but so does the spiciness in the flavor as well .Great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation for its style\n\nFor this holy grail of all brews this was a pleasure to drink, highly drinkable. The rarity of this brew aside. I do think it is close to a few of the other Belgian Quads I have tried St. Bernardus comes to mind. Don’t get me wrong this brew was better balanced in the flavor department but I think if it comes down to it St. Bernardus is a close second. \nThanks again Life is good for sharing such a rare brew as well as another buddy who will remain nameless for trading me one to put away for my son when he is legal age.

Well, I shared this with my dad and two brothers, and they asked, \"Was this everything it’s cracked up to be?\" Gotta admit it was not quite. Then again, the actual beer could never match up to its rep. Even as a Belgian Quad, I’ve ended up being more excited about Delerium Tremens or Atomium. Or maybe a family gathering is a little too stressful to actually enjoy a beer. I will say: Beautiful smooth brown pour with a short head. Smell of figs, raisins and Belgian brown sugar (not too much of the latter). Taste bring out those fruits, with the added sensation of fruit leather and Belgian malts. What I realize is that this is not a great \"extreme\" beer: there is nothing going over the top for the sake of bragging rights. No, the Trappist brothers were never into that. What I have instead is a well-practiced beer that balances in almost every respect instead of overwhelming the senses.

Moving on before it evaporates... The flavor is very similar to the nose, a little more bread and dark fruit. The alcohol is really minor but begins to emerge with warmth, as do some sticky bitterness and salt. The beer is effortless in it’s glide and soooo smooth given the weight.

Bottle courtesy of Shyam.  33cl bottle has no label, engraved in the glass is the word \"Trappist\", otherwise the only identifying mark would be the bottle cap.  Pours a deep, cloudy, nearly opaque nut brown with a head that was initially foamy and active, and settled to a healthy, creamy, tan ring with tight bubbles.  The aroma is mild, all things considered, but if you search you can sense the complexity.  There’s a deep, sugary malt presence, yeast, grain, bread dough, raisins, dried fruits, dates, figs and a touch of lemon grass.  The aroma is good, the flavor is truly remarkable: brown sugar, chewy bread dough, raisins, grapes, butterscotch, cookies, biscuits, Belgian candy, coffee with cream, cane sugar, a little bit of earthy spice and a little bit of mild milk chocolate.  Buttery and soft on the palate makes this so easy to drink with the kind of lingering sweetness that could make it a session beer.  What a session that would be.  Very well balanced and the consistency of the beer is probably a reflection of the care taken when making it.

It Poured just a bit hazy dark brown body with medium bigger brownish head. Strong, impressive aroma, yeasty with dark fruits (berries, plums, ) caramel. Some orange peel as well, with caramel and chocolate. Wow, can’t stand to try it now! At the first sip it seemed a bit light, bittersour caramel and some alcohol, but nice. After two or three its complexity started to show up, probably as the palate gets used to. Yeasty fruits with malty caramel produce some nice flavors, ranged from chocolate filled with blueberries to irish coffee, as alcohol is also felt a bit. Very nice, but not near perfect, somehow leaves a feeling alcohol is hidden in a bit wrong, unbalanced and I would deer to say cheapish way. Finish is very pleasant, very sweet, caramel and plum dominated. I am constantly bothered by that strange bitterness from the flavor, but otherwise would be perfect beer.

There was a very malty aroma with just the finest hint of chocolate coming through at the end. I was very disappointed in the degree to which the alcohol cut through the beer though. I got a faint hint of anise floating around somewhere in the background but it almost tasted like someone had spilled cheap vodka in my beer.

Tasted of nothing but vague roasty/hoppy bitterness at In De Vrede owing to the flu, but back home it’s easy to see why this is currently revered as planet Earth’s no.#1 rated.

Again, a slightly sulphurous note leaning towards living English bitter (Badger, Marston’s, Wadworth’s?). Smells alive, beery and like it’s just been drawn from a cask. Impossible to sniff without salivating. Flavour easily the sweetest of the Holy Trinity, thick with toffee, milk chocolate and burnt sugar, but also intense charred malt (or at least the impression of it), 70% cocoa bitterness and a closing sting of bitter, bitter hops.

It’s pretty green though, about 4 months old at this point based on a best buy date of 10/11/09 (converted to american format). I poured a bottle into a chimay glass. \n\nIt pours a very dark brown. It isn’t black, but light barely penetrates. There is a nice mocha colored head that hangs around for a while and laces nicely down the glass leaving patches of foam on the surface of the beer. \n\nThe aroma is great. It has a raisin and rich toffee aroma with a malty background. It is very sweet and there is another aroma on top of the raisins I can’t quite place that might be caramelized brown sugar.\n\nI have heard so much about this beer that I almost though it would fall short of my expectations. Fortunately, that was not the case. This is a great beer. The first thing that hits me is the insane level of smoothness and creaminess. For a Belgian Quad, it is ridiculous. In no way can I detect any of the 10.2% alcohol in this beer. I don’t consider myself a good enough beer taster to break down all the flavors in this, but I get a pretty strong chocolate flavor and a bit of spiciness as well.\n\nThe feeling of this beer is great. It has great body, but not as heavy as a stout would be. I would consider it to be medium bodied but the complexity adds so much to the mouthfeel.\n\nIn case you couldn’t figure it out from the rest of the review, the drinkability is extremely high.

My first impression of the aroma is lots of yeast; very bready and doughy.   Then prunes, dates, and pure malt; not overly sweet, and very intricate.   the flavor is bready as well; plenty of spice and dried fruit, but not sugary., and surprisingly not as sweet as the other abts I’ve had.   No alcohol flavor.   The palate is very smooth and full, almost perfect.   Goes down cleanly with a finish that leaves a pleasant but not overly sweet taste in your mouth for quite a while.   I knew that they would have this when I was planning my trip to Amsterdam, but I was almost in disbelief until I actually ordered it and forked over the twelve euros.   It was served out of the cellar, like the St. Bernardus 12 that I had the nigh before, and that temperature perfectly complimented its flavors.   As the last of the top three abts to have rated, in comparison I would say that westy is by far the most drinkable and balanced.   I think that Rochefort has more complexities in the aroma, which I really like, but it can be  too rich and alcoholic.   St Bernardus  is about the same in intensity as westy, but lacks the powerful yeastiness and complexity of flavor.   Price wise, is it three times better than St Bernardus?   No way, and I know I’ll be lucky to get another one any time soon, which I guess is part of the mystique.", "rating": "4.5"},

Lovely...and now I can dream about trying a bottle with some age on it. From everything I can taste in this beer now, that would be divine. \n\n\n\nOct ’08. Roughly year-old bottle. Yep. It rocks. 4.3 at least. Mmmmm...mmm.\n\n\n\nNov ’09. Older bottle, best by 23.04.11 on the cap. Splendid, splendid beer. Mulled cider with raisins initially, later a surprising intensity of cherry juice.  This is a 4.5, not a 4.3. I’ll bump to 4.4. \n\n\nOct ’13. 2005 bottle. Pours deep cloudy brown into my St. Bernardus chalice. Short-lived off-white head. Nose is spicy; flavor is perfection. So smooth at this age with microcarbonation, beautiful sweetness, zero sign of the alcohol. This one ages like a beauty. Compared to the St. Bernardus SE I had a few days ago, this is sweeter and smoother, overall more enjoyable. Rochefort 10 (a few weeks later) is absolutely no contest. Definitely a 4.5. Probably a 4.6. \n\n\n\nNov ’14. 2009 bottle (no collar on the glass). Softer and more subtle than I remember, but not kicking you in the teeth with the first sip can be a very good thing. As I make my way through the bottle the caramels and raisin and yeasts offer everything one could want in a dessert beer. \n\n\nNov ’15 Head to head with a 9-year-old St. Bernardus 12 SE. Spicier, very tasty, probably better one sip at a time. But it loses overall; the Bernardus SE is smoother, creamier, and more rewarding at the scale of a full glass. Splendid stuff.", "rating": "4.5"},

At first, my thought was, this is it, but it kept developing in different directions.  Starts off with a brown sugar and malt presence, and it finishes on a very similar note.  Between these bookends, however, it heads down fruit paths that remind me of dates, plums and raisins, before going back to a brown sugar finish.  The liquid is fairly thin...

The head was borderline tan with slight retention and little if any lacing.  This beer showed incredible depth and complexity in terms of aroma.  The first rush is malt, chocolate and licorice.  As it opened up aromas of fig, cherry, yeast and spice came into play.  Later into the beer I got brown sugar and grape soda.  The flavor was equally complex, seemingly having shifted gears each time I took a drink.  The initial flavor is a fairly straightforward blend of chocolate, malt and dried dark fruits.  As it progresses more tart fruits come into play like cherry and raspberry.  Yeast is noted as well.  Then I got a very distinct flavor of grape soda.  Not grapes, but purple, fizzy grape soda.  The mouthfeel was very nice and the alcohol was completely hidden.  A whirling dervish of a beer.

Swirly head with small tight bubbles around the edge. The flavor and palate are astounding. The beer is heavy and thick, bordering on syrupy, but so utterly smooth.

Perhaps I was a bit too excited as I may have poured too hurriedly into my chimay goblet and this resulted in a dissapointing, smaller head than expected. However, (very) fortunately I have a few more of these to pour with a good deal of prudence. Despite this minor pouring setback the brew had a beautiful chestnut brown color, and still a fair head with nice lacing.  The aromas sweeping off of the glass were fantastic and complex.  Mocha, nutty currant, figs yeast, wheat, cherry, berry aromas emerged and evolved throughout the session.  The body of this brew is simply perfect, with a velvety smooth texture and light warming sensation down the throat.  The flavors evolved tremendously while drinking and each sip seemed different than the previous.  Coffee/toffee charateristics emerged first quickly devloping soft and subtle spice flavors, yeilding hints of clove.  The fruit flavors were always present but evolved from berry, plum to earthy to some surprisingly acidic sour apple tastes, and again back to chocolate covered raspberries and a distant woody smokiness.  Over the hour and a half or so I spent enjoying this the flavors and aromas took me to such different levels that I had to respect this beers fine character.

Very little carbonation and very thin head (may have been too cold on initial pour) but what head there was had a medium tan color.  Flavor profile was dynamic.  When cool, the flavors were dominated by rich maltiness, some plum/ raisin hints of characteristic belgian yeast.

Significant levels of residual sugars combined with what seemed like a wheat character to create a silkiness that was quite enjoyable.  Overall, a great beer, one I’m happy I enjoyed!

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "#1000. Consumed in a can with a straw.j/k Bottle best before Feb 8, ’09 thanks to Eyedrinkale. I can already sense an assertive aroma just from popping open the cap. A pour into the snifter reveals a dark cloudy burgundy with a tall head. The head is firm and defined with cascades beneath it as I swirl. Lacing is clingy and dense. The aroma is excellent with assertive floral sweetness and spiced notes. I pick up cardamom, earth, baking chocolate, cloves, honey, molasses, pineapple; I just can’t dissect it thoroughly enough, yet perfect balance is maintained. This is actually lighter on the palate than I was expecting, though it’s still very full bodied and creamy. I’d say Rochefort’s offering is a little more dense. The alcohol comes through, but it’s not bad. The finish is drying with dark fruits throughout. A thin sweetness akin to honey balances things out. Each sip is a journey starting with the more acidic notes of plums and spices, fading into a semi-sweet territory like molasses, cherries, white wine, licorice, and lingering on a tangy, zesty flavor before my tongue is left with sensations of earth, honey, figs, and other fruits. This is easily one of my favorite Belgian brews with its sophisticated flavor profile, immaculate balance, and assertive palate.  I don’t know if it lives up to 100% of its hype or the fact that it’s so hard to get (especially since a couple of other delicious quads are a bit more handy), but it is seriously a very damned good beer.

Thanks to Dan for the sharing of the bottle first and foremost.  \nDid a blind tasting next to Bernardus 12.  \nAt first, I could not taste a difference, but after a few tastes the balance and the bright fruitness made this beer stand out so much that there was not even a question as to what beer was which (besides carbonation and color issues, which made it even easier to tell).\nThere was a very soft head to the beer.  A slight nuttiness in the aroma and an estery fruitness that was completely pleasant, if a little understated.  The taste was first of bright fruit, then of chocolate, and then, and then and then... this beer is deeply complex, but so simply complex that it is difficult to really get everything with a small sample, or even one beer.  \nThere was a slight, pleasant oxidation of the beer.  And the palate lingers in a honeysuckle sweet remembrance that is at once a jubilant thing  for the experience of having this beer yet is      depressing because I know that it will be a long time before I enjoy this beer again.\nThe hype, for me, is validated.  Is it the best beer in the world, probably not.  It is damn close though, if only because it reminds me of the first time that I had expedition stout; a time when my favorite beer was McEwan’s Scotch Ale (and I had not even found ratebeer yet), and my first taste of Traquair Jacobite Ale.

I also brought back a six pack of the 12 and split my girlfriends six amongst the blond and the 8.  One of the twelves I used during a blind tasting of quads with drewbeerme and holdenn.  This is that rating.  White head sits on top of murky red-brown body.  Aroma is beautiful with lots of dark fruit, and malt.  Taste is syrupy but none the less fantastic.  Raisin, plum, sweet malt.  Large body matches large flavor.  Surprisingly though, Rochefort beat out the Westy when it came down to numbers.", "rating": "4.4"},

Wholesome and rich, with a sweet chocolate/cotton candy aroma.  You can taste the ripe fruit and alcohol, and you notice the setery taste on the top of the mouth.  If I can do this justice, I would say that it tasted similar to a chocolate covered cordial cherry (real one, not those boxed types).  We just got back from Belgium, and I was fortunate enough to pickup two crates.  This is so good, that I don’t even want to drink it, in order to save it.", "rating": "4.8"},

The flavour is wonderful, it is very balanced and the sweetness is very pleasant, as it is not so strong. A lot of fruits in the aftertaste.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Rating #1000   I did a side by side between an approx. 5 year old bottle (labeled at 10.6%) and a 6 month old bottle (labeled at 10.2%).  I will give the beginning stats on the five year old and then the traits / differences of the 6 month old.   The  five year old  bottle had a minor \"pfft\" when the cap came off.  Poured with the color of brown sugar with a nice beige head that was very respectable for the age.  The aroma is full and open with plums, raspberries, brown sugar, thick caramel, earthy malt, red wine notes, buttered toffee, raisins and more - there is something new with each wiff.  Full body that’s thick and velvety smooth with some incredibly soft carbonation.  The flavor starts with brown sugar, Belgium earthiness, plums, raisins & smooth rich toffee-like earthiness.  The finish adds some spice and a surprising sharpness and some astringency.  As it warms the raspberry aspect comes out more and the finish loses some of the sharpness and becomes more lush and adds dark cherry, brown sugar and caramel. (9/4/9/4/18/4.4)    The  six month  version pour deep mahogany  with a dense tan head - everything darker than the older version.  The aroma has cola, brown sugar and other flavors of the aged version, but all of the favors are more subdued and sharper.  There is less earthiness, but more fruit.  More brown sugar and caramel earthiness as it warms, but nothing like the aged bottle.  The flavors are much tighter and hidden, the five yar was significantly more lush and opened up.  Medium / full body with fairly sharp carbonation.  The taste is more sharp with earthiness, very dark caramel, coriander and pepper.  The finish gets quite sharp with anise and  pepper.  As it warms it opens up more, but nowhere near where the aged version was from the beginning. (8/5/8/4/17/4.2)   Overall, it is well worth aging the beer.  I’ve held onto the aged beer for years and it was worth it.  Big thumbs up  for this exceptional beer, but if you have the patience with a fresh bottle it is advised to give this a bit of time to age.  The rating numbers are for the older version as it was quite a bit better.  I forgot to add on the original rating a big thanks to  mkofron  and  mad_scotsman  for the hook-up on the fresh bottle.", "rating": "4.4"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Bottle at ’t Waagstuk, Antwerp. Pours a deep, deep brown bordering on black with a dense and foamy one-finger off-white, bordering on tan head.  Nose is complex and distinctive.  Dusty and earthy notes are heavy, as well as dark pit fruits that round into a nice fruity sweetness.  Also significant yeast presence here, in the form of some interesting esters.  Well balanced between an overarching sweetness and a subdued, massively complex and inviting stable of other elements.  Taste does not disappoint:  the epitome of the sweet/savory interplay that I find in a lot of really well crafted brews.  Dark pit fruits in prunes and plums, caramel, hints of milk chocolate. Slight, complexity-adding yeast funk. Finish is short and sweet, after just a dash of mild alcohol.  The lack of alcohol presence in this beer is really to be marveled at.  Palate is so incredibly sexy:  stunningly smooth and velvety on the tongue, this is the ultimate in sipper beers.  Searched far and wide for this and it definitely did not disappoint. Easily the best I’ve ever had - 4.7 may as well be a 5 for me, considering how conservative I am in my ratings.\n\nUpdate: had the opportunity to try a 25 year old (1983) vintage bottle of this at Ebenezer’s in Lovell, Maine.

Color is Dark brown.  The smell is a fantastic malt aroma, along with different kinds of sweet fruit.  The flavor hits as soon as it enters the mouth.  The velvety caramel complex flavor with little to medium carbonation is something to savor.  All these flavors throughout tasting are just incredible.  Complex flavor that stays balanced all the way through, but keeps changing as the beer warms.  Its amazing how this beer keeps its complexity and taste throughout the duration of tasting.

I’ve studied trappist beers for the better part of two years now and this was the crown jewel of all my efforts at researching this epic brew.  I’ve sampled this on two separate occasions just to reinforce my thoughts.  Plus, with all the hype I attempted to be as objective as possible.  However, this is one of those rare experiences where it certainly lived up to my expectations.  Simply put, this is a beer of legendary proportions.  \n\nPours typical of most trappist quads with a nice fluffy head and good lacing.  The essence of dark plums, raisons and dates drift into my nose.  Further exploration detects the esters of a masterpiece of fermentation along with the dark candi syrup which this is a hallmark of.  Taking the first sip brings wave after wave of deep layers of complexity that forms a tapestry of flavours the likes of which I haven’t experienced before.  Deep levels of caramelization that waltz in and out of your senses along with the delicate essences of northern european hops that masterfully balance out the candied sugars that are intertwined.  The body is matched perfectly for this style as you are allowed to taste the delicate nuances the monks introduced and not bombarded with an over-the-top chewy mess as other inferior attempts have tried to do.  The finish itself is an experience that leaves you wanting to step away from the glass for awhile just to enjoy the afterglow of an almost orgiastic feast of the senses.  A whole additional layer of caramelization sets in with a warmth of light alcohol making its presence known.  Perfectly hidden only to escape at the proper moment to leave you wondering how such a brew came to be so well done.  Minutes pass as the finish lingers in your mouth and I wonder how long I can prolong this experience.

Soft and smooth flavors of sweet plum, bread, earthy fig, rum, and mild chocolate dance and dance and dance.

Medium nectar w/ ample residual effers creats a creamy, velvety texture. I think the palate texture of this brew is what sets it apart. It’s amazing that an ale can feel like that. Flavors are bold w/ a mild to moderate sweetness that is quickly balanced by a peach pit bittering componant. My first sip was pure bakers cocoa. Dark, bitter and chocolatey. Very nice! There is a defined alcohol presence in the flavor profile that really kicks in on the finish. This is not offensive to me at all. Dried dark fruits like black cherry, plumb, w/ slight fig and raisons. Meaty tropshire like a well marbled Porter House steak and leather. Other nuances of chewing tobacco and dark cakebread, bakers cocoa, molasses, red grapes w/ the seeds, and caramel apple. The Cocoa lasts throughout the whole sip to the finish.

If you are ever in Belgium you must pick this up - while it is hard to justify at $25 a bottle it is a steal at $5.\nAroma / Appearance - Caramel, chocolate, vanilla, strawberries and cream create a rich tapestry of scents which blend together to form a very inviting aroma.  The body is a rusty brown color with lacing that leaves a history of the level as you sip.\nFlavor / Palate - Caramel and chocolate greet the tongue on the first sip.  After that comes fresh Swiss chocolate dipped strawberries.  It might be a little alcoholic but it is well masked by everything that is going on.  Honey comes to the fore of a perfumy and sweet aftertaste.  This is one of the most complex beers I have ever tasted.  I am tempted to pop open my single bottle just to have it again.", "rating": "4.6"},

As I poured into a tulip, the beer came out murky dark brown and had a two finger thick foamy head.  The aroma was spicy-sweet, with the smells of fresh hay, ripe cherries, chocolate, brown sugar, and apple skins detectable.  The taste was about as smooth as I have had in a beer of this strength.  Sweet tropical fruit and spiced bread like malts interplayed with earthy yeast and spicy hops, and everything was in perfect balance.  The beer was somehow robust and delicate at the same time.  At this young age the alcohol was evident, but only as soothing warmth.  The mouthfeel was oily smooth, and the beer went down very easily and left a sweet aftertaste.  Very fine beer indeed.\n\nI decided to drink it side by side with a 2006 St. Bernardus Abt 12 for the sake of comparison.  The color of the two was almost the same but the St. Bernardus was much more carbonated.  It also smelled stronger, and had a distinctly sour note in the taste that was absent from the Westvleteren offering.  The Westvleteren was sweeter and smoother than the secular cousin.

Not that it is not excellent (cause it is) not that it is not perfect (cause it probably is) but the hype is bigger than the beer from my point of view. It is objective fantastic, but subjective only GREAT.\n\nI had problems finish it, probably mainly due to my love for not that complexe beers. \n\nStill, what can I say? It’s what beers all about, but still too much of a really good thing. \n\nAs you probably understand, the beer puts me in a total duality of a fantastic experience and a feeing of drinkability and enjoyment. It was like \"Shit, this beer is gooooood\" with a grimmy face.\n\nThx munks, but youre not my first choice and probably never will be.", "rating": "4.3"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Bottle received via SecretSanta.  Pours deep mahagony, slightly cloudy, with a medium sized creamy light tan head, somewhat diminishing to more rocky head with some spotty lacing.  Aroma is caramel roasted nutty malt (biscuit, meal), yeast (dough, earth), some straw and floral notes, alcohol at the end, perfumey as it warms up.  Medium acidity that grows as the alcohol continues to singe the tongue, well balanced malt and yeast flavored body, a hint of hops (floral) with some earth notes, overall a very good flavor, nothing offensive.  Full bodied and warm, fizzy palate with some lively carbonation though still pleasant.  Overall a very good beer, but it is not \"perfect\" in my humble opinion.", "rating": "4.6"},

Typically when I taste a beer I pick out flavor spikes - pine, oak, smoke, etc and highlight them in my rating.  What made this beer so intriguing was that the flavor profile was almost perfectly round.  No single flavor within the spectrum of caramel/nutty/woody etc really stood out, everything blended and balanced perfectly.\n\nMouthfeel was soft and round, very soft small carbonation, complimenting the flavor profile.  Nose was spicy/floral/woodsy/root beer.\n\nWhile I can’t say this is my personal favorite beer in the world, I certainly can agree that this may be the best crafted beer in the world, and so have no remorse giving it a big rating.\n\nAnd...

Thanks BP! Pours a muddy brown, murky with sediment, with a lasting creamy camel head. The aroma is not very aggressive on this bottle, which is faint sugary plums and cherry. I really expected more out of the aroma, along the lines of a Rochefort 10.  Creamy and slight evervescent mouthfeel. Initial flavor of yeast,  dried fruit...very earthy. In the middle I get some licorice and cinnamon. This transitions to a slight bitter and warming finish. I was expecting the alcohol to be hidden, it does come out in the finish.. As it warms, more brown sugar sweetness creeps out.  Great beer, no question. Worth the hype? Perhaps, but not in my book. Definitely not worth paying the absurd prices from  Belgianshopo or trading away your beer cellar. Get a Rochefort 10 or St Bernardus Abt 12 and keep the extra money.

With all the hype surrounding this beer and all the anticipation, (including the price tag), I had very high expectations. I was almost expecting to be disappointed as this beer has been pedestalled as \"the holy grail\" of beers. Truth is; it is deservingly in a league of its own. \n\nAppearance: Pours a deep brown color with a nice beige head that fades into a frothy cap and an attractive halo. It was surprising the head and lacing on a 10.2% ABV beer. \n\nSmell: The aroma is complex and sweet. Dark fruits like plums, figs and dates are all interwoven into a truly enticing aroma that smells only like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! I was surprised at the amount of floral character this beer displayed.\n\nTaste: The taste can only be described as tasting like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! It is completely unique. There is a tartness surge on the front end, then a very mellow smooth silky vinous middle with caramel flavors that lead into what I might try to liken to figs and dates and toasted brown sugar malts; but it is really so well blended that is hard to isolate individual flavors. In the aftertaste, there is again a yeasty tart that maybe be similar to a splash of green apple, and a bit of alcohol warmth. I love the stinging character on the lips. It is not clear what causes that spicy stinging sensation (maybe the acidity) but it begs you to drink more. Truly though, I can only describe this as being in a league of it’s own!\n\nMouthfeel: Super freaking smooth and so creamy it is sinful! It is light and perfectly carbonated to be full and easy to drink at the same time.\n\nDrinkability: Absolutely dangerous. I was pleased to share this beer with a couple of close friends, but I must say, a beer this big may never go down so easily! Is a $300 case out of the question? If it fits in your budget, absolutely go for it; you won’t regret it. It goes down so dangerously easily its indescribable.

Aroma of spices and mint over a massive malty aroma.  Orange rind, plums and dried cherries.  Beautiful rich spicy yeast with overtones of clove, cardamon and cinnamon.  flavour is amazing, sweet caramel, toast, and a rye-like mintiness up front with a lingering burnt sugar toastiness toward the end.  Fantastic jammy fruity flavour as well with plums, raisins, and dried cherries.  Honey dipped almonds.  Very warming finish.  Lingering sweet toastiness and clovey phenolics.  Lace sticks all over the chalice.  As it warms even more malty sweetness comes to the fore.  Lingering peppery flavour and herbal woodiness helps to counter all of the sweetness.  Brown sugar and toffee flavours are also noticible.  Luxurious palate, wheaty body.  I gave the top score to the Extra 8, but this is first rate.", "rating": "4.7"},
{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "I want to say this beer is a victim of the hype, but then I look at all the top raters and all but one give it 4.4+, so then I feel a little stupid. I try another sip, try to dig deeper, but still come up blank. Great? Sure. World Class? Absolutely. Number 1??? But I digress...\n\nFor a start, let me say that this is my 500th rating, after a bit more than a year on the site; a milestone I thought I would never reach (I tend to get bored of things pretty quick), and certainly not this fast. Suddenly, 1000 seems very close. \n\nOnly 20 ratings ago, I had no idea what I would choose for the big 500. Probably one the Speedways sitting in my basement. But, lo-and-behold, my fellow ratebeerian Hopscotch started a goofy contest which held the top prize of a Westy 12. #1. The Big Numero Uno. Hyped so fiercly that mail-order shops in Belgium manage to sell it for $25+ a bottle. Yikes! After all sorts of complications at the end of the contest, my hard work paid off (and believe me, looking through hundreds of pages of pictures of half-naked hot celebs to get a positive ID is HARD WORK!). Suddenly, #500 seemed like a clear choice (though I almost caved and drank it for #492 the day I got it).\n\nNow, on to the beer. I couldn’t have been more excited for this brew. The blank bottle and elegant cap just add to the allure. Of course... the best beer in the world is so small, odd, ridiculous, that it doesn’t even have a label! I warmed the brew with my hands for a good 10 minutes, bringing it to around I believe 50F, popped it and poured it into my brand new, virgin Gouden Carolus challice. The pour was a beautiful thick brown, with a foamy biege head and enough solid crap to form a nice beige base. First smell was pretty bland, though as it warmed, I picked up strong bread (reminds me of Dulle Teve), cherry, fig, alcohol and chocolate. The flavor is more exciting, very smooth and relaxing, distinctly bready, with late licorice, more fig... and a big alcohol burn. Most mention that they see no alcohol, but I am getting quite a kick. I guess now would be the time to mention that this bottle is supposedly only 4 months old (feb 2006), if the article about a Westy vertical on this site is to believed -- the cap is dated 15.02.09. Many have said before that this beer is strongest after years in the cellar, and this tasting has lead me to believe that. Now I just need another bottle.\n\nSo, hyped or not?? I’ll certainly throw it out there that I think your average beer taster wouldn’t at all rate this higher than Roch 10, St.B 12, if it were a blind tasting, and provided they didn’t already have the flavor profile locked in memory. Certainly, the three are distinct, but this just doesn’t have the otherworldy prowess that it’s taken on on the site. So, yes, I think this beer has been hyped out of existence. Maybe for the truely discerning palates, it offers something above and beyond pretty much anything else out there. Or maybe, by the time its 3 or more years old, it’s developed in to the beast it is rumored to be. But, for now, well, it’s just another solid beer.\n\nThat, and I think I’m going to cry, because my glass is nearly empty.", "rating": "4.2"},

Flavor, caramel, sweet and floral, with a beutiful fruity undertone to it. The finish is softly bitter with some more fruits. And just a touch of warming as it lingers in the mouth. Medium bodied with nice lacing.\n\nWhile drinking this I couldn’t stop grinning at how good this was. I had it once before about 8 months ago right as I was really getting started on this site. I loved it then. Some of the beers I had earlier on though just don’t hold up anymore, but my god does this one keep it’s spot.

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "There’s nothing supernatural about beer. You might say the monks of St. Sixtus harbor a metaphysical relationship through this beer, yet in itself it is but the sum of a very tangible - though nonetheless complex - brewing process. I suppose that may seem obvious, but I only fully understood the implications after drinking the Westvleteren 12. In some way I have always believed that one day I would drink a beer that couldn’t be described in comparative terms, a beer that in the words of Hegel would aufheben. The reverie can never be utterly anulled, but certainly dimmed as it has by the disillusion of drinking such a strong candidate. Don’t get me wrong, the Westvleteren Abt is an exceptional brew, but the fact that I can pinpoint its shifting nuances with precision leaves me with a sense of control that could not exist in my utopian nectar.\n\n\n\n\nWestvleteren is no epigone and their Abt warrants careful scrutiny, beginning with its beautiful black velvet robe that radiates a clear crimson hue in the light. The praline pillow-like head evolves gracefully and slips through the lips with a delicate creamy touch. Wondrous scents of banana and dark sugars are immediately apparent. Rich caramel and molasses develop and with each sniff appears a refining shade: chocolate, coffee, fig, plum, red wine, licorice. The complexity is ever increasing and builds a rustic profile highlighted by hints of dust, soil, wood and apple that evolve with warming to reveal buttery raspberries, cinnamon, honey and progressively sweeter and fruitier tonalities. The first sip is equally enticing and coats the tongue in a slightly burnt chocolate bitterness that slowly unveils a sweet pear flavor, not unlike a bite of Poire Belle-Hélène. A soupçon of black pepper enhances the nutty coffee and dark malts which gradually smoothen to reveal raisins and cherries. The finish is surprisingly hoppy, far more than most Belgian brewers allow, but this touch is not unwelcome and adds a certain identity to an almost excessively well balanced beer. My specimen was just a few weeks old, but I’ll be aging the rest of my bottles to observe this beer’s evolution. Perhaps its maturation will yield what I so deeply pursue.\n\n\n\n\nRe-rate: As my bottles age I am beginning to understand the mystique behind Westvleteren’s Abt. Between three and five years of age this is a beer that truly radiates perfection. I had to increase my rating.", "rating": "4.8"},

Not an drop of ’mental space’ within the beer is wasted.  Had a little plate of Gouda cheese with it and it paired well, the cheese doesn’t even come close to overpowering the beer.", "rating": "4.5"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "Re-rate, 7/07 in a horizontal alongisde St. Bernie’s 12 and Roche 10. Bottle courtesy fozapd/Scott, stamped 18.01.09, about 1.5yrs old. Pour was brownish with a tannish colored off-white head, not great retention, but not as week as the Westv 8 on the same night, yet inferior to both St B’s 12 and Roche 10. Aroma and flavor of caramel, brown sugar, choco, lingering spices, stronger version of 8. Alcohol more detectable than with the 8, liquor/scotch type flavors, is this bottle over-aged, not as rich as once remembered. Honestly, against the Roche 10 and St. B 12, this came in last. Numbers dropping a little, but still an average of my three experiences. Thanks, Scott, for contributing to this wonderful horizontal! Excellent stuff. Original ratings follow: Poured a nice medium brown with a huge head that laced superbly while drinking. Sedimentation was under control. Aroma was primarily bready, yeasty, spicey. The high ABV was barely noticeable in the flavor or aroma. Rich deep flavor, and distinct from the St. Bernie’s and Roche 10. There was a true beer barley and bready base coming through (ie. it didn’t feel like they sugared this one up to the point of hiding the beerness... I don’t know how to describe that). My first Quad Belgian, where not just the dark fruits, candy sugar, and spices come through, but some chocolate (slight burnt touch) was noticeable too. Definitely a peppery finish (on second tasting / re-rate, I didn’t repeat this one). Immediate aftertaste was the candy sugar (a sweetness), which then turned to a surprising lowly hop bitterness after 10-15 seconds or so. Mouthfeel was carbonated and slightly less heavy than a stout. Very enjoyable, of course. Would love to put Roche 10, St. Bernie’s 12, and this one side by side one night and have at it. Thanks to E for the trade and Westy 12 experience. The re-rate was on a bottle (stamped 09.08.08) served at ’De Vrede’ across the street from the abbey.", "rating": "4.7"},

I’m not going to trash it because it didn’t quite live up to the best beer in the world, but I will say that out of all the trappist and BSAs I’ve had, this one has got to be the biggest crowd pleaser.  Tons of rich dried fruit and candy sweetness to make it thoroughly enjoyable, enough belgian yeast to remind you that the brew you are drinking comes from a long line of tradition, and enough complex spice, bitterness, and veggie flavors to keep you thirsting for one more sip.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and similar to roch 10.  Now I can’t say that it is worth all the trouble to acquire this beer over roch 10, bernard 12, or some of my other belgian friend, but if this were readily available...even at a similar price of $13+...I would no doubt stock up.

It has been in my cellar since september, and I decided when I bought it that I should save it for rating #500. I think I have entered my 499 beers quite rapidly, just over six months, but the waiting has been way to long, and the beer has been staring at me every time I went to get another beer in the cellar. Now, as I am to open it, I am a little bit nervous. It’s not my virgin-sample of a Westy 12, I’ve had it two or three times before, I am just nervous that it might be bad in any way, or that I might get disappointed. After all, my taste-buds has evolved a little since my first rating. It has a BB date of 28.02.08, so it is ok in that way, hope it is in any other way too. Well, off goes the cap. The first aroma is very vinous and oaked. Then, when it’s poured, black currant, caramel, dried fruits, light alcohol, spices and a light yeastiness comes through. You don’t get it much more complex than this. It looks gorgeous, dark reddish-brown and sparkling, and with some sediments if you prefer that. It has probably the most dense, lasting head that I’ve seen so far, beige in color, and huge. The flavor is rich, with caramel, candi-sweetness, malt, spices, bitterness, cherry and alcohol. Too much alcohol, I think. There are lots of other beers masking the 10% ABV much better, but it is not an unpleasant alcohol-level. The body is full and it has a sweet and bitter finish that is quite long. The flavor and finish is rounded of as the beer warms up, and my starting temperature of 10°C was too cold, especially for the finish to step forward. It turned out I had no reason to be nervous, the beer probably deserves its first place on Ratebeer, but I expected that I could give it a higher score.

Aroma is truly unlike any other beer I have had- not even the St Bernardus can compare. Aroma of light earthy and spicy hints with light barnyard notes.  Next the fruity esters from the yeast come into play, and then finish with a crapload of sweet fruity malt- lots of caramel, chocolate, and special B.  Almost a musty hint in the end of the aroma as well.  Flavor is mostly sweet malt in the front with caramel chocolate malst in the middle- intermingling with hops and even a touch of tobacco.

When the waiter came to check on us, he saw my smile and said \"I know,  I know...\"  Since then I’ve had it at home and at the Belgian beer festivals at Carlsbad Pizza Port. Most recently tried it alongside Rochefort 10 at home. Dark brown-burgundy in color, with a thick, rocky head. Very malty, but balanced with bitter notes of charcoal and a slight smokiness in addition to the hops. Gets better as it warms towards room temperature. Sweet toffee, molasses, and candy sugar flavors fill the palate.  A delight. (After rating, I went through and read the lowest ratings of this.  Several people mention the high cost.  When I bought it, both at the restaurant and at the bottle store, the price wasn’t out of the ordinary for a trappist ale.  I suppose that, since 2000, the beer has grown so in reputation and popularity that it has risen in price.

Served at approximately 12 celsius in my Westvleteren goblet.  Poured a lively dark amber-brown with a decent off-white foamy head - the last 10% of the pour showed a fair bit of tiny black particles (tasty!).  Initial aroma pounded my hindbrain:  yeast; sweet dough, strong fruits, hint of wine, roast malt, roast nuts - more emerged as it opened, other fruits, caramel sweetness, earthy tones.  And oh, the flavour - all of the above, but with a restrained bitterness - alcohol & hops, perhaps? - keeping it in balance.  Each taste had a different mouthfeel as more and more elements vied for my attention - mouthfeel was full-bodied, not flat or carbonated - just complex.

The flavor is equally complex and interesting.  Raisins dominate, but there are massive amounts of other dried fruits begging to be identified and savored.  Caramel malt is there in force as well.  Unfortunately the alcohol flavor is as strong as the alcohol smell -- it has to be looked past.  The mouthfeel is oily and thick, but the alcohol keeps it clean on the finish.

Sweet, overly ripe plums are the first thing I taste, followed by some pears and then hints of chocolate, nuts and even some spiciness.  A caramelized brown sugariness dominates the flavoring.

In fact it is reminiscent of all the best things you have ever sniffed at. Appearance is so very very close to perfection. Deep almost black mahogany red body and just the right amount of off white head and lace. Only reason it gets a 4 from me is that the head always dies just that little bit too soon but it is clearly the most inviting \"drink me I am gorgeous\" looking beer there is. Ok, what do I say about the flavour? Chocolate, cream, vanilla, raisins, pudding, a little biscuit, mazipan and just a touch of spice and malt. Finish is head and shoulders above everything else I have ever tried. I am not drunk, I will stand by this statement. A wonderful gentle warmth from the alcohol, more caramel (but more like toffee this time), just a dab of spice and also some cardboard and leather. Unbelievable length. Nothing has ever left me demanding another sip or being so sorrowful as you drain the last drops as this beer. On top of all this it gets you very very drunk indeed. I have been lucky enough to have had sessions on this and it is truely legendary. Nothing has ever satisfied me so consistently as this always does.

No sherry notes to speak of which is a surprise and a testament to this beer.  Subtle elements of spice are present and with only a hint of warming alcohol, this is dangerously drinkable.  Finishes with some celery and lots of rich chocolate.  Palate is reminiscent of maple syrup and is rich and velvety.

Chewy goodness.

Aroma is a sweet, bread, banana pudding, yeast, and a combination of fruits. Has a thick silky mouthfeel that is quite superb. I am not even sure what exactly I tasted. There was just so much going on that it was difficult for me to isolate any one flavor. Definately spiced with a combination of cherry, grape, plum, apricot, banana, peach, berries, and bread.

Taste is well crafted and of perfect thickness and viscosity. Coats tongue long enough to leave behind flavors of roasted malt balanced with pit fruits. No misused or maligned flavors. Alcohol is recessed in taste for nearly 11% and does not bother the palate in any way.  This beer certainly has an excellent reputation that precedes it and admittedly that worried me about rating it. How do you rank something that is supposedly one of, if not THE greatest beers in the world. Well, after drinking it I have to say it is great and I’ve never had a Belgian of better overall quality, taste, appearance and aroma.

Cloaked, meditating, he weilded a glowing chalice, and muttered in a language I do not speak, but understood to mean, “take this glowing chalice, and become one with our beer.” I was nearly blinded by a glowing pillow of froth, and holding the glass to my nose, it became enshrouded in rings of trees bearing plums, burgundy grapes, hop bushes sprouting vanilla, strands of pale vienna malt, rum barrels and butterscotch. In a haze, I tipped the chalice to my lips, and a sea of velvet washed away first the tongue, then mouth, throat, stretching through to the soul. Vaguely I recall the monk gazing gleefully through my enraptured eyes, swept away by the 12, the most sacred of numbers, the 12 gods of Westvleteren. When I awoke in their humble monastery, a tinge of sorrow overcame me, for I may never experience joy this deep again. But I soon realized that I was fortunate to have had this experience at all, and was ready to continue the journey... \nThanks to Wolf for this rare brew, my 500th rating.", "rating": "4.9"},

{"product_name": "Westvleteren 12", "product_review": "[b]#100[/b], I got my crown! Thanks to JCapriotti and the Milwaukee RB action squad for this beer.  11.2oz. NB Worthy glass. 60°.  The beer fizzed out of the bottle when I popped the cap and continued to fizz slightly. Poured muddy chocolate brown with a 1/2\" off white head. As the head subsides, the foam rings the glass and shows the lacing that will steadily form throughout the drinking of this beer. Nose is yeasty, but hard to get much with the big foam head blocking the beer. When the head dies a bit, I got some cinnamon and spice hints along with the dominant yeast and malt. After 30 minutes the nose starts to blossom and smells like whole wheat pizza crust. The first sip tells me the beer is really \"full.\" The beer has steady carbonation that makes it feel nice and the thickness of the beer coats. The taste is elaborate malts and yeast. Mildly sweet with citrus and estery notes as well as brown sugar, and nuts?. The beer is not sour, but sour enough to keep it from being \"sweet.\" The flavors are complex, but restrained. It is not as \"flashy\" as some beers. It wants you to coax flavors and aroma out of it. The nose doesn’t waft up and hit you while you are not paying attention; you have to get your nose into it to smell it. The flavor is the same way, it is restrained and \"it is what it is.\" The beer is probably a good representation of the monks that created it, \"rich\", but you would never know it. The finish is initially sour then mellows out to a calming, complex, but understated finish. \n \n [b]RE-RATE [/b] 4/27/05 Bottle @ Hopleaf in a Westvleteren glass. Aroma is subtle. Spicy with bourbon? notes. The flavor is huge. Dark fruit, yeast, almost a caramelly flavor. The mouthfeel is absolutely amazing. The beer has the sweetness and flavor of a dubbel x2, hence the quad nomer? Raisins, plums, yum. Once again, it is very good, just too reserved. Very good beer. Scored the same.", "rating": "4.3"},

Slightly hazy reddish brown in color with a light mocha colored head.\nComplex aroma, honey, brown sugar, dates, cherries all melded in malty madness.\nThe flavor follows the aromas, sweet and chewy with some alcohol that didn’t fade as it warmed. I would probably drink more of the 8 if both were comparatively priced and easily available as the 8 hides it’s alcohol a touch better and still delivers that same flavor that the 12 provides.

The smell is strong and enticing:  fruity red wine, with some spiciness.  I hypothesize that opening a bottle and leaving it in an unventilated room would have the same effect as putting up an air freshener or burning a scented candle.  The taste is extraordinarily complex and well-layered.  It starts off sweet with obvious fruit overtones.  In the mouth it gives way partially to some spiciness and a mild roasted flavor.  After swallowing it leaves a sticky sweet taste in the mouth that repeats on you long after you’ve finished it.  The alcohol warms the throat, but is exceptionally well-hidden in the taste of the beer.  Very smooth, amazingly drinkable, and undeniably enjoyable.  I will keep my other two bottles in my cellar a while longer to see what aging does to this fine brew.  Overall, I felt this beer lived up to the hype and then some.", "rating": "4.6"},

Aroma is of port wine, figs, grapes, plum, faint-pleasant alcohol, berries, dates, malt, yeast.  My mouth waters, but I can’t tell if it is because of the aroma or simply the anticipation.  Flavor is of port wine, figs, all those things and more!!  I was expecting quite a bit from this beer - and it delivers.

Now my original rating was pretty down on this beer and though my opinion has gone up, I still do not think it is the \"end all be all\".  Still the same murky brown color with a thin tan head.  Aroma is outstanding.  A complex blend of herbs, spices and dark fruits.  The taste is great, yet subdued.  Velvety grape, sweet malt and Noble hops.  Very fine, but to compare with Rochefort 10, much of the taste is the same yet much more subtle.  While subtle can be a good thing, in this case, I think it robs the beer of true greatness.  8/4/7/4/17 (4.0)\n\n\n\nOriginal rating Sept. 20, 2004: Pours a dark amber color with no head.

This has mild hits of barley and malt with a bit of spice and bread, but barely recognizeable!  Don’t get me wrong, this is a decent brew.  The best in the world?  Are you kidding me?

Malty and faintly acidic in the nose, it had a foamy, creamy and huge lightest-of-browns head with beautiful lacing and an amber red color in the bulb of the glass.

Read most of the reviews and you will see that this is described as heavenly, as angels crying on the tongue, as a beer made in heaven, as a religious experience made holy by the dedicated men of the cloth who produce this unctuous brew. So I pour this into two small Chimay glasses, as this should rarely be a beer that is savoured on one’s own. In fact my colleague in taste was one who is unique amongst the Ratebeer community. My 18 year old son, of legal age in these latitudes was the willing fellow supplicant in the search for the beer nirvana. Aware of the beer’s standing he treated it with reverence in a way that belies his youthful years. And so it came to pass. Said I, let us exorcise the demons so often worshipped when the meter ticks over to beer 666. Two pours were taken, the first without the sediment so that the rich and bright body of the beer could be noted. A deep and lustrous copper hue with creamy head presented itself. And then it was left to settle. For a respectful period of time. From the nose came a potpourri of flavours, plums, grapes and subtle hop aromas. The initial flavour to greet the tastembuds was the intense frutiness from the nose combined with an equally intense breadiness and clear alcoholic mouthfeel.

One recommendation, make sure you add some of the yeast, it gives the flavour an added dimension.  A deep chestnut brown brew with a very enticing aroma of liquorice, hops, rich maltiness and a very complex fruitiness that’s hard to describe (for me!).  The flavour, for me at least, is the perfect mix of strength, poise, and elegance.  Full and malty yet not cloying.  Hoppy and bitter yet not astringent.  Fruity and complex yet not overpowering.  I could go on.  The alcohol is just about noticeable, but it hides it well like most Belgian beers, and the strong bitterness in the long finish balances the malty palate perfectly.  A beer for the desert island and for life.  So, religion does have it’s uses!  (bottle at Botteltje, Oostende)", "rating": "4.6"},

Lace quickly slips back in with minimal spots sticking.\n\nAroma is soft and yeilding, complexing and layered; at it sits a welcoming orangey fruit yeast tone releases over some really nice cookie sugars and waffer light chocolate. Deeper wiffs bring out some darker fruits within of raisin and fig with and soft dry woodish earthyness. Slight phenolic notes emerge here and there as it warms giving it a bit of spice and burn. There's more here then I can really put my nose too. Cocoa filled fruits and light spices is what I can figure. It's very appealing however way you smell it.\n\nTaste has a refined roundness with an encompassing natural tasting softness of fruits, earth, yeast, spice, cocoa, and some slight roastyness. Its quite soft for what seems to be such a big beer. The flavors carry alot of the effects over from the aroma, lending a bit more dark fruits then the smell would lead you to believe is there and they're there in good stature. There's some artfully placed sweet malts throughout that bring out the darker fruits and sweetness bringing in raisin, fig, apple, and touches of banana, oh but there's a bit more that continues to ensue. There's delicately hidden melding of chocolate cookie sugars, bits of yeasty spices, and mild caramel. There's a milding woody earthyness that keeps a small drying presense throughout as well. Again, there's more here then a can put my mouth too and intermingles with the body and feel of the beer. Quite complex and full of softly spoken actions. Very enthusiatic and engrossing to say the least.\n\nFeel is beyond words here. Wow! Amazingly full, yet calmingly smooth and fluffy with a heavenly fine carbonation that continues to give way to the flavors, never too sharp and never too distant. Well rounded, superbly soft, and exceptionally drinkable. Its nearly a meal! It doesn't seem to have 10.8% ABV, its masked very well. One isn't enough, not nearly enough.

Pours a deep, dark, rich amber brown-- some red edges and even a hint of deep purple.  Great, dark cream head that lingers in a thin, dense-but-rocky whisp very long; very, very good lacing.  Looks stately and just excellent, but I expected a little darker brown, murkier body.  This one looks a little young.  Nose is rich and decadent-- cake, raisins, a hint of peppery heat, and a touch of vinous sourness and sharp vanilla pungency.  Subtle chocolate notes, but I think this is still too young for that malt depth to be fully charged.  First sip reveals what it's all about-- very full-bodied with dense, creamy texture.  Peppery yeastiness and alcohol heat cannot be ignored, but it's balanced against a backdrop of swirling dark dried fruit and cake flavors.  Feels absolutely divine in the mouth.  I do feel that the flavors haven't really come into their own yet, as everything is a little too sharp.  Finish is very elegant, even despite the apparent harshness of the beer in its relative youth, but is a little too peppery for me-- seems like the yeast.  Also a touch of burnt malt flavors way in the back of the finish.  Immediately warming in the throat and a little bit prickly.  Tremendously long-lasting finish with bits of brown sugar and cake lending some of the big impressions.   Mouth-watering and complex, it reveals new layers and just tickles, teases, and toys with your senses-- once you think you have it pegged, you find something new inside.  Truly very good, very unique stuff, but I feel that the bottle I had needs to sit awhile to grow into a top 5 beer.  The appearance and mouthfeel are already there, but sadly, it needs to round out its maltiness quite a bit.  Still, a damn treat whenever I can get it.", "rating": "4.5"},

Only one was not taken blind (ommegang three philosophers). So basically, I've taken the 5 following beers blind in the same session: rochefort 10 (only one I had before), westvleteren 12, st-bernardus 12, weyerbacher quad, gulden draak. All 5 were taken in a Chimay chalice  A deep chocolate body with a fully diminishing off-white head, initially well-laced. Bottle-conditionned, with some beige sediments at the bottom. Aroma is a nice blend of vanilla and chocolate (black, brown and white), milkshakish, slightly vinous. It didn't grab me particularly, but seriously, let this warm and this becomes a tremendously complex malt offering. Full-bodied, creamy with a good carbonation. Taste is loaded with dark fruits: blackberries, plums, dates. It's a complex caramel cream with a chocolate syrup, no it's a cake, it's a pudding with a little alcohol bite. Very complex with a well-expressed yeastiness. Definitely the most complex of the ABTs. It's delicious for sure, but doesn't strike to me as the best beer in the world. It's the best balanced of the big dark ABT trappist styles to my liking, but it's not necessarily the most intense, although such a refined aftertaste is hard to match. Maybe I will rate it higher in a future tasting. It sure held the competition in a blind tasting, so I know this is pure world-class stuff, I'll have to get into deeper analysis eventually and will definitely enjoy doing so.

The in your face aroma with the flavor is an onslought of your senses. The malty caramel and fruit flavor leads to a gentle warming sensation towards the middle of the glass.

I invited 3 friends and Hotstuff to join me in a little Westy 12 sampling party. Two showed up and the third gets his sample tomorrow as well as 2 other co-workers. My Rating: This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a cloudy yeasty semi opaque dark brown beautiful body. The aroma was its weakest point as it was only a sweet mild malt aroma. I would have expected a stronger more pleasant aroma for a higher rating. It has a very complex flavor of roasted notes as well as spices and the taste that a high alcohol content brings to a great brew. It had a tingly mouth feel in its finish as well as an alcohol taste. This is truly a brew to sip and enjoy as long as you can make it last because you certainly can’t get too many of these especially at $10 a bottle. This brew has to rate as one of the best beers available. It is truly a masterpiece! The high point of the tasting came from a younger gentleman who had never had a great beer before. He rated it as the best beer he had ever had. Who would have guessed! The low point of the evening was when the host offered up a couple of more beers after the Westy’s. Sorry to say, he had Miller lights in the fridge! Gag! The friends rated the brew as 8-3-10-4-16 and 6-5-9-5-19 per the RateBeer rating system.

Yet another smell, and I sense chocolate. Hehe....\nFlavour: Aah...this is a big beer! Must sip it very slowly, in order to catch all the delicat flavours. It's more than full-bodied, has chocolatey undertones plus that feel of exotic fruits(mostly lemon), much more pronounced than in Maredsous 8, which happens to be my favourite Belgo this(!) far. The body is also a bit oily(like Nils Oscar Julöl 2003) and unbelievably pleasant to gargle around with in the palate. What a beer, the texture is amazing! From an intellectual(common sense) point of vies this beer is perfect. But when giving the points, there is always the personal liking that has to be considered. Therefore it's only a \"17\". I love it. But there are beers that I love better.\nOld rating gave  7/4/8/3/15. \nNut brown color. Creamy off-white head.

Plums were right there..raisins coating the back of the tongue, sweet sweet vanilla and complex malts caressing the sides of the tongue, oak and slight spicing give it an aged feel, with medium carbonation in the mouth. Something of a bittersweet citric orangey apricot that adds a minor and i mean minor but PERFECTLY balanced citric aspect to counteract the vanilla sweetness. This beer definitely got more pungent in every respect as it warmed, just wonderful in every respect of the word. Aftertaste is fairly dry, like chewing on a vanilla covered orange peel, or apricot skin..just magnificent. World class beer for sure, and a nice choice for beer 250, 1/4 way to 1000!!!", "rating": "4.6"},

Like sucking on the world’s best candy with the lovely candy sugars.  Fruitiness is quite subtle, softer fruits like apricots and pears.  Incredibly long finish, a sweet, tart, sugary, fruity ghost that haunts the tongue for several wondrous minutes.  Best word for the palate is just soft.  I don’t drink it as much as it somehow deems me worthy of placing it in my mouth and it gently works its way around my tongue and down my throat.  Is it strange to be repeatedly thanking the bottle for allowing me to be near it?  The Westy didn’t taste in any way overcarbonated, but it acted like it in the bottle.
