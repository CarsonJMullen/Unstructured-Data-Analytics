3,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Boxed beer at home, proper glassware. Pitch black, oily thick pour with a brown head that quickly disappears. Maple upfront alongside roasted coffee, bourbon in the nose. Taste is beautifully layered coffee, chocolate brownie, lots of bourbon barrel character, lots of burnt caramel - with the most balanced balance there is. Big bodied, oily rich mouthfeel, medium carbonation.
Truly one of a kind beer, brewed to perfection.",4.7

6,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"There are not hundreds of beers on my bucketlist anymore, throughout the years I have had the pleasure of tasting many of the world's great beers and I am grateful for each and every one of them, but if there is one beer I have been eager to sip for nearly a decade now, it must be this one: Toppling Goliath's Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout, or KBBS as it is sometimes abbreviated.  A coffee stout aged for over a year in bourbon barrels, it was first released in 2012, but the story goes that at that time, only six people showed up - after which founder Carl Lewey stopped selling it and kept the rest of the batch for private consumption.  I guess he must have known already back then that he was onto something, as the buzz around this beer began to grow and it quickly became one of those modern whales every beer lover in the world wants to taste at least once.  In 2015, KBBS reached number one in the list of top beers on this very website, stoking the hype even further; nine years later, it still holds that same enviable position, as it does on BeerAdvocate (as well as second place - though only recently - on Untappd and Brewver).  It goes without saying that I am very happy to be able to finally taste it today on my birthday, from a 2022 vintage bottle (numbered 1679) just over a year old - and of course I know that a beer like this will probably only improve in coming years, but I just could not resist having it in my collection any longer...  Builds up a light brown, mocha ice-coloured, minute-bubbled and therefore densely creamy head of medium thickness, slowly receding and opening yet retaining well around the edge, with some dots of lacing here and there, over a pitch black beer.  The bouquet is intense - and indeed overwhelmingly beautiful, one sniff already managed to convince me instantly of the whole hype around it: top quality Swiss chocolate, chocolate ganache, top class real maple syrup, the finest Colombian coffee, warm bourbon of some high-end brand, vanillin-breathing oak wood and a lot of it (I love it), homemade coffee brownies, Alicante nougat, armagnac, fudge, expensive Belgian chocolates, crème au caramel, artisanal mocha ice cream, coffee liqueur, more dark bitter chocolate underneath and then all kinds of subtle hints ticking all the boxes of a high-level U.S. style 'impy' varying between almond, roasted pecan nuts, cinnamon, fresh bayleaf, pipe tobacco, fresh fig and even more fruitiness warming up (blackcurrant) but then making room again for wet leather, walnut oil, charcoal briefly showing up only to vanish again in seconds, haemoglobin, rum-soaked raisins, date jam, a very vague minerally touch (clay) - before all that dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon and oak return, all intertwined into one monolithic, perfectly aligned and beguiling 'block' of aroma.  In the mouth, the most noble and refined sweetness unfolds, date jam, candied cherries, golden raisins - in a very dense, concentrated manner, with very slight sourish and umami notes here and there, but too subtle to describe; mouthfeel and carbonation are absolutely perfect for this style of beer, rich, velvety, viscously thick yet still oily-smooth, heavily yet supply gliding down the tongue, leaving behind thick layers of fine dark chocolate, toffee, nougat, almond and hazelnut paste, with both the coffee and roasted malts providing bitterness balancing out the sweetness.  An overall bittersweetness fills the mouth in a most complex way, releasing accents of amaretto, bayleaf, cinnamon, light sweet pipe tobacco and, much lighter still, even 'blood' or the juice oozing out of a medium rare steak - all of which matches perfectly without even the slightest sign of a false note, and all of which is enveloped in a noble oaky woodiness (think vanilla and actual wood flavours) and, of course, a long, warming, soothing bourbon bittersweetness, bourbon of high quality in this case, with armagnac- and walnut liqueur-like features.  The finish goes on and on, warming on a cold January night, but more importantly, providing an extended enjoyment of this formidable brew which seems to last forever.  Hops are present 'behind the scenes', with spicy and even very faintly citrus peel-ish details that all contribute to the vast and massive landscape of flavours.  The coffee returns every now and then retronasally, in a most sophisticated way.  This is one to enjoy very slowly and over a very long period of time: as the temperatures shift, one shade of beauty is replaced by another.  This is the one beer I spent the most money on in my twenty-five years of tasting beer in a serious way, but I have no regrets - on the contrary, I am filled with joy and gratitude that after such a long time, this most coveted of the world's craft beers (or one of the most coveted at least) finally reached me.  The number of bottles released each year seems to have grown in past iterations, probably since Toppling Goliath extended their production capacity with a new brewing installment in 2018, so who knows, maybe one day this gem will become a bit more widely available, and when that happens, I will be happy to pay for a second one.  As for now, I suppose I could consider selling the empty bottle, as I noticed one being auctioned in the States for no less than a hundred dollars...  Anyway, to conclude this long journey through this awe-inspiring brew: I think scoring becomes a bit meaningless in the light of not only this beer's inherent perfection and majestic beauty, but also in its consistent high scores in the decade in which it has been in existence.  Additionally, I cannot find anything I do not like here, not even after examining it with a microscope, so to speak, so here you go: the perfect score, mostly symbolically because American style imperial stout really does not get much better than this, at least not in what I have tasted so far.",5.0

10,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,Bottle at El Catador Whale Killing tasting. Rating 12000 on RB. It pours jet black with a small tan head. Lovely notes of roasted coffee and maple.

12,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle, 2018 vintage. Thx a lot for sharing Andre. An oily dark brown one, headless. Alcohol, coffee, roasted malts, some soy and licorice, bourbon, oak, dark chocolate and some coconut. It's full bodied, warming and smooth on the palate. Some bitterness. The flavor has dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, oak and coconut, vanilla, booze and alcohol and some raisin. Everlasting finish. Sure delicious, not easy to drink, but very, very, very nice. 230311",4.6
13,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"12 oz bottle. Pours nearly pitch black color and capped by a small tan layer of foam that settles in quickly to a thin film and leaves some nice legging on the glass. The aroma shows notes of rich, dark chocolate, maple syrup, and roasted coffee over a dark roasted malt base with further notes of bourbon and oak laden vanilla. The maple syrup is dominant but the underlying chocolate, coffee, and oaky vanilla shines as it warms up. The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and maple syrup right up front along with the bourbon oak, vanilla, and a moderate bitterness for balance on the back end. The maple syrup is sweet but tastes like quality grade A stuff compared to fake adjuncts found in other similar beers. Full bodied and slick with moderate carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and bourbon oak on the finish with lingering maple syrup sweetness after each sip. This is really tasty and definitely one of the better maple stouts I’ve had for sure, but not sure it quite lives up to the hype or the price to get it. Still a great beer.",4.3

15,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Flaska från TG, 2020. Svart med bruna/rubinröda toner i kanten, brun liten skumkrona med fina bubblor i kanterna. Doftar av kaffe, lönnsirap, choklad, vanilj, choklad- och vaniljwafers, lätt whiskeyton. Även en angenäm lite bärig ton som drar åt inlagda körsbär som jag helt saknar i MD:n. Mycket samma i smaken som i doften. Snygg och mjuk kaffeton, mocca, lönnsirap, choklad, hasselnöt, nötkräm. Ruskigt fint integrerad fatkaraktär, men egentligen inte jättemycket smak från whiskeyn. Väldigt snäll eldighet på sin höjd. Väl avvägt, elegant trots kraftpaket. Görs helt klart öl som är större och maffigare, men här balanseras det med elegans. Finns oerhört lite att klaga på. Skulle jag få önska något så skulle det vara något mer fatkaraktär, lite mer smak och eldighet från whiskeyn. Oerhörd kul val att bocka av från listan.",4.8
16,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"2020 bottle shared by a friend. Darkest brown pour with a medium light brown head. Aroma of malt, maple, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and some coffee. Malt and vanilla flavor giving way to coconut(!), maple and chocolate before a sweet bourbon and maple finish. Just a tad less sweetness and it would have been perfect, but definitely deserving of the hype.",4.8

Pours jet black with a small dark brown head, as drowland said it was smaller than expected but we also didn't pour it super hard. Aroma has a ton of maple of coffee right away with vanilla and oak as well. The flavor has a strong coffee front end with the maple and sweetness of the vanilla in the finish. Had this side by side with MD and we actually preferred that over KBBS, but this is still stupid good. Honestly, if Bourbon County releases a Maple variant it would be somewhat close to this.

Yeah, we bought a $100 beer and each of our pours were $25 each, but hey, it's family and the top beer of the moment, so why the hell not? We had side by side with 2018 Mornin' Delight and I think actually liked that a bit more. Jet black pour with a small tan head that fades to a ring. I honestly think there'd be a better head, but I had to carefully split the bottle into four pours. As soon as I cut through the inch of wax and cracked the cap, I was hit with a punch of maple and coffee. After the pour, the aroma shows fudgey bourbon, vanilla, oak, maple, coffee, rich fudge, touches of dark fruits. Rich flavor, on the sweet side, super smooth, bourbon, vanilla, oak, coffee, maple.

This is really something else. It's got a thick mouthfeel that coats the inside of your mouth but still somehow manages to not be oily, a hint of coffee, a big, bold blast of make syrup that adds a bit of sweetness and a lot of complexity, and a gigantic bourbon flavor that makes you think you've gotten to the stage of alcoholism that you are hiding booze in your coffee at work.

Pierwszy łyk i wow, gęste w kurwę. W zasadzie powtórka tego, co w zapachu + dochodzi jeszcze kwaskowata kawa i ciemno-czerwone owoce. Alkohol po ogrzaniu się skromnie pojawia, ale jest maksymalnie szlachetny, taki typowo od beczki.
Za smak daję 4.75 i to głównie za kompleksowość. Subiektywnie może nawet ""tylko"" 4.50 (nie przepadam za kwaśną kawą) - dosyć mocno przypominał mi niektóre kawowe RIS-y z Cycle - główna różnica, to lepiej ułożony alkohol.
Ten aromat długo będzie za mną chodził po nocach.",4.8

69,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"From notes. Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Travis’s house on September 24. Gold-waxed, 2014 vintage, 12 oz bottle shared by me. The pour is a thick and heavy dark black with a thin ring of dark mocha colored head that leaves no trace. This thing just sticks to the glass. It’s amazing. The aroma is unbelievable. The balance of heavy maple, chocolate, vanilla fudge, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, molasses, and brown sugar is just amazing. The bourbon barrel adds a wonderful oaky complexity and a hint of bourbon that really ties all of this together. The flavor is equally as amazing. The chocolate and vanilla fudge right up front are spectacular, and the maple comes rolling in with the dark fruits, sweet molasses, coffee, and brown sugar. The bourbon holds off, but remains detectable in each aspect. The balance is great. The mouth feel is unlike anything I’ve had. Period. This is so thick and viscous, you think you might actually be drinking syrup. The carbonation is soft and velvety with a lingeringly maple, coffee, chocolate/vanilla fudgey, light bourbon bounty of liquid sex. Jesus H. This is everything a beer should be.",5.0

72,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle from mid-2013, drank early 2016. The aroma can be smelled across the room: maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, buttery oak, coconut, butterscotch, a little black licorice. Very sugary, very rich, very deep. Legs for days--a swirl makes the liquid stick to the sides of the glass. Flavor is incredibly rich and sweet: sticky vanilla bean, chocolate covered cherries, plums, fruity coffee beans. Mildly bitter toasty oak mid-palate, along with graham cracker. Dark chocolate swoops in and coats the tongue at the swallow. Finishes quite tangy and fruity, though heavy roast settles in long after. Creamy, sugary, syrupy, thick. I keep coming back to what one of the guys I shared this bottle with said: ""I think I just saw the face of God.""",4.6
73,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Kbbs ’14

Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small dark brown head, soon collapsing to a tiny ring of lacing with some spider web in the middle of the glass. Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.

Although I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin’ Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.

I cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers I’ve ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.

Tastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.

This beer is beautiful throughout, it is indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin’ Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD. I understand this beer is highly sought after, this time it is most certainly well deserved.",5.0

It’s flat black in color with a dark tan ring head. Wow, smooth doesn’t begin to describe the taste. Chocolate is the primary flavor and is accompanied by velvety bourbon, dry cinnamon with a slightly woody finish. The rich syrup lends only sweetness at first without any distinct maple taste, but it increases greatly as the beer warms to eventually become the dominant flavor. The body is a tiny thin for an imperial stout. It’s a beautiful beer, but I wouldn’t consider it the best barrel-aged stout I’ve tried.",4.4

91,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle (12 oz). 2014 vintage. From Brian, thanks! Split 4-ways.



Appearance: Pitch black with a small very dark brown head, little lacing and some legs. 



Aroma: There’s a burst of coffee at first followed by a really fruity presence and rich caramel/toffee. There’s also some spices/cinnamon, bourbon, vanilla, brandy (might just be the fruits though) and fudge. 



Taste: Quite sweet, but well balanced by the coffee acidity. Rich caramel/toffee presence, lots of coffee here too, quite fruity, bourbon, mild spices/cinnamon presence and fudge.



Palate: Full body. Medium carbonation. Thick and silky mouthfeel. Lingering caramel, coffee and fruity finish. Nice alcohol warmth. 



Overall: Excellent barrel-aged RIS. The malt depth is impressive and it’s extremely flavorful and tasty which I guess helps to get some very high ratings from small pours. I liked it a lot, but I didn’t enjoyed it nearly as much as GI Rare (which stunned me when I had it 2 years ago) or Double Black on tap (which was as tasty and more drinkable - yeah no kidding - despite being listed as more than twice the abv of this one).",4.3

Vanilla. Some cookie dough. Holy shit. Delicious. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of soft chewy lighter carbonation. Great thicker chewy texture. Moderate bitter taste. Fucking killer stuff. So damn good. Meets the hype. A highlight of the weekend for me. Fucking good.",4.4
122,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"The bottle pours with a deep dark glass staining pour where a swirl puts up a sheet of rich liquid that clings to the glass. A tan head could be teased up with modest agitation. The aroma doesn’t mess around as it pulses with rich chocolate, booze, sweet coconut, smooth bourbon and then some dark roasted malts to big dark roasted coffee notes. The taste is rich and nectar sweet where smooth slick residual sugar intermingle with oily rich dark roasted coffee notes and big velvety chocolate goodness. Wow! It quickly picks up supporting notes of thin slippery sweet smooth bourbon mixed with marshmallow and vanilla. Wow. There aren’t many sippers out there that will entice your senses into a state of speechlessness. Wow!",4.5

A culmination of all things good. World-class for sure!",4.8
125,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"12oz unmarked bottle brought to share by cparles to Ian’s that was apparently filled by the brewer for various people from the last keg of the first batch - what do you really say to that. Black with no head. Unbelievably fresh and full bodied coffee combined with freshly roasted and ground beans (which was surprising but apparently it was kept at a constant 39 for the last year or so which makes me think I need to get a fridge for certain beers), thick without being overwhelming, chewy, vanilla, light cracked pepper notes that develop on the finish as it dries out and coats the palate. The oak and booze are present but perfectly compliment everything and combine to form an incredible beer that is probably the best stout I have had.",4.6
126,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle thanks to the Minhs back in November 13’. Pours a black with thick creamy tan head that diminishes quickly.

127,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"This one poured a very thick black color with a small tan head. Aroma was just huge maple, light barrel and remnance of coffee too. Flavor was just liek the aroma, maple and maple, old coffee and bourbon underneath. A bit too sweet to be amazing, and as the maple wears on you, the stale coffee slightly takes effect. Still pretty good though.",4.1
128,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,Big thanks to beerman6686. Pours a dark brown black with a brown head. Aromas of huge maple and maple and maple. Is there maple in here? I didn't know.

130,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle 9/300. Pours like a thick, spent motor oil. Medium to low carbonation. Little to no head, more like some tan bubbles of carbonation settling on top of the oily splotches. The aromas are insane!! Coffee for days and days. Wow. Smells like freshly ground beans. The dark chocolates give off hints of oak/bourbon, but not much. Coffee dominates this nose. The taste (finally!) has the loads of coffee that you would expect, but digs deep to give you plenty of character. Bakers chocolates graham cracker, charred marshmallow....taste like s’mores! Seriously. Again, wow. The body on this bad-boy is so chewy, you could stand a spoon up in it! Flavors last for an eternity. The sticky mouthfeel lets more flavor cling to your palate....maple syrup...oak...vanilla...and an ever so slight presence of bourbon. Very well hidden. The finish is very warming. Gave me chills after the first sip!! I knew this beer would be special, but wasn’t sure that it would live up to the hype. It did...and then some! Was close to giving this a perfect 5, but couldn’t quite say that it was the best in appearance. Other than that, second to none.",4.8
131,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Ip trade at the brewery! Thanks to beechner224 for the Cali huna! Pours a nice dark color with a small head smells of coffee with a lot of whiskey.

Very tasty, but I prefer mornin delight.",4.4
139,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"12oz bottle shared during Christmas Eve with friends into Utopias glass.



Pours black, mocha head, thin ring, wisps on top. Nose is rich milk chocolate, coffee, burnt sugars, some bakers chocolate. Flavor is maple syrup, chocolate brownies, light oak, smooth alcohol, caramel, and coffee. Full body, rich, light carbonation, sweet & creamy finish.



This is one of those beers that came along in 2013, was super-hyped, and delivered. I easily finished half of the bottle and shared the rest and was still left wanting more. Very rich & decadent but very smooth and easy to drink for such a huge beer.",4.4
140,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Opaque black pour, almost no lacing. Aroma is more subdued compared to Mornin’ Delight. mildly sweet, vanilla, bourbon-soaked oak, maple syrup, espresso, dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, sticky caramel, and pancake batter. Sweeter in taste with greater emphasis on the maple syrup, caramel, and pancake batter. Extremely slick, just coats the inside of your mouth. Smooth, creamy, and full-bodied without being overly heavy. As with Mornin’ Delight, the slight ’twang’ in the finish prevents it from a perfect score. Such an amazing blend of aromas and tastes.",4.9

146,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"bottle # 280 of 300.

poured thick as synthetic pancake syrup, but darker. creamy khaki head. the nose on this is really impressive, if overwhelming: hot pancakes drenched with loads and loads of maple syrup. soft/woody bourbon undertones, bitter dark chocolate, and almost too-sweet syrup flavor dominate the taste buds. full bodied, thick and sticky with a long finish.

this is a delicious beer but it was difficult for me to just finish one 12oz bottle. it isn’t as life-changing as many of the reviews lead you to believe, though. except for the possibility that it will give you diabetes.",3.7
147,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"great beer that lives up to the hype....strong nose that almost puts me in a diabetic coma, light coffee, thick maple sour, bourbon, sweet but pungent... the taste is balanced better not as sweet as the nose, more stout and bourbon, decadently awesome",4.8
148,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle 230/300 poured into snifter after having 15 minutes on the counter to warm from the fridge. 

A- Pours a viscous pitch black with a dark brown/mocha head about 1/4 inch high with insane retention for a stout. Detectable carbonation bubbles, but on the low side, as appropriate for style. Over two minutes, the head fades to a mocha ring around the edges of the glass. 

S- Mother of god- this smells like Vermont maple syrup aged in a bourbon barrel, dipped in chocolate, and wrapped with the tears of angels. Honestly though, the syrup sweetness with the wood notes really dominate, although the bourbon notes are just hanging out behind them. 

T- Maybe I am just riding the hype train, but this tastes absolutely amazing. A huge sweet maple sugar (think the little maple butter candies you can buy up in Vermont) followed by a super mellow bourbon barrel character mixed in with chocolate, caramel, and a balancing roast and bitter note. 

M- Thick. A bit more carbonation than I expected for this, but it works well with the beer. This is an oil slick of a beer, as it should be for the style. This is definitely a sipper, but I could (and will) drink a full 12 ounces in one sitting happily. 

O- This is by far the best tasting and smelling beer I have ever experienced. Insanely good, better than BAVDL and BCBS rare in my opinion. I am actually a bit upset I decided to open this bottle, because I don’t know if I will ever get it again. I guess I will be at the release if they release it in the future!",4.7

150,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"9/7/13Huge thanks to my buddy Matt for sharing this awesome bottle. Aroma pancakes breakfast. Not maple, maple plus pancakes, maybe some cinnamon. The mouthfeel is perfect balance between thickness and carbonation. Taste has the perfect amount of bourbon but was not in the aroma. Bit of maple and chocolate. And coffee, but the coffee was really in the back or rather perfectly mixed. I really like coffee bombs, I guess it could have used more coffee in this but that might have thrown it off. Because everything really is perfectly balanced. No burn at all. Tried this at an amazing tasting up against some of my favorite ba stouts and this was the best. We opened BC Coffee (my previous #1) right after this and it didn’t even come close.  Even later in night trying Rare and Murda’d Out, this still stood out as the best.  Fuck man, amazing.



2014 vintage, on 10/18 at the Malloy tasting, thanks steve, reminded again if how good this is. More maple than I remember. Ton of coffee, not much bourbon, maybe just covered by the intense coffee and maple. Either way amazing. This and vanilla darklord are my top 2. And I’m not sure if I could settle that debate without a best of 7 head to head.



11/22/14 13v14. Still amazing as it gets. Intense coffee, maple and bourbon. 14 is a little more sweeter and just has all around bolder flavors. I thought it was better fresh, although it was a split decision between the group.  Not much drop off on it.",4.7
151,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"A- pours an oily and sleek deep deep brown with a thin, quick deep tan head that does not linger. S- reminiscent of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - just a little better. Whiskey, rich vanilla, molasses and toffee persist. A hint of grains, chocolate covered raisins, graham crackers, marshmallows, caramelized sugar, wood and sugar cookie batter. M- light carbonation supports a full body and a smooth, oily full palate. T- tangy cacao, coffee, burning alcohol and vanilla get you going up front. More sugary maple syrup, dried fruits, marshmallows, fudge, mocha and molasses form a sweet and solid middle. Some tangy hints of overripe apples and bing cherries. Whiskey persists throughout. Walnuts, grains, dry grass bitterness form towards the end. Ending is long and sweet with a rich chocolate, maple, toffee and cake. Is this Heaven? No, it's a beer from Iowa.",4.7

Thank you to Loineshawn for the wedding occasion & to Adam for the pour. 







Pours black with a small head, but one that is fairly well retained and leaves lots of lace that oozes down the glass with the weight of the legs.



The aroma is big, lots of coffee & fudge, a little bit of bell pepper, but honestly not in a bad way at all. Plenty of dark chocolate, some nice rich vanillin forward bourbon. 



The flavor is again huge and rich... The coffee is really well done here bringing a nice big roasty character with a mild bitterness. There are some really nice sweeter flavors of raisin, fudge, & maple but it’s got some nice dark bitter chocolate as well. The vanilla and oaky elements from the bourbon are well presented. 



Plenty sweet, plenty rich, plenty awesome, goodness gracious.",4.4

Wow, really great.",4.4

160,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Pours as dark if not darker than Morning Delight, unclear thick black coffee with a dark caramel head with a cinnamon hue. Aroma is so smooth, bringing vanilla sweet barrel from the whiskey and some maple and toffee.

163,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Silver-waxed bottle shared by TheAlum- thanks a TON, Adam! Bottle #127. Pours a deep brown, not quite opaque, with amber edges and a tiny dark tan head that settles quickly into a ring. The barrel notes blast immediately from the aroma- vanilla, brown sugar, whiskey, coffee, maple syrup, caramel, and oak. Layers and layers of sweetness and roast. Same can be said for the flavor, with maple syrup, coffee, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, and cocoa beans. Medium-bodied - thinner than Mornin’ Delight for sure - with modest carbonation and a warm, sweet, roasty mouthfeel. The sweetness isn’t overwhelming here, nor are any other notes. They’re all big but don’t push one another out of the way or offend the palate. Man, this is good. I put it even with Mornin’ Delight because I like the bigger body there and extra splash of complexity with the barrel here. Lives up to its billing.",4.6
164,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Very black with very brown head, initially creamy but disappears after a couple of minutes leaving a ring of foam around the circumference of the grads. Super sticky. Strong sweet aroma, bourbon barrel aging is evident, kind of syrupy chocolate/fig/molasses combination. Sweet sweet sweet flavor. Reminds me of Morning Delight with muted maple tones and the bitterness almost completely deleted. Well, there is a little bit in the far finish. A fantastic beer but i think many would call this a dessert beer so your mileage may vary.",4.5
165,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle. Pours deep opaque black with a medium deep brown head that slowly dissipates leaving good lacing. Aroma is incredibly rich bourbon, molasses, chocolate, maybe even dried cherry. Flavor is otherworldly. Quite sweet with noticeable bourbon. A ton of chocolate and dried fruit, maple. Light bitterness at the end. No astringence. Full body, ultra creamy mouthfeel. This is the real shit! At this level of sweetness its really a dessert beer, but oh what a dessert beer. The only real points docked are due to the sweetness which becomes a bit cloying after a while.",4.8
166,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Bottle… This beer rocks!… Dark Lord black pour with a small, wispy, beige head. The bouquet is a sumptuous swirl of fudge, coffee, toasted oak, vanilla and bourbon, accompanied by a hint of vanilla and a rumor of cinnamon. Full-bodied and chewy with pillow-soft carbonation.

An even more impressive taste, full of butterscotch, coffee, and smooth roast. Some maple. and vanilla bourbon. So decadent. Surprisingly drinkable given the richness of the flavors. Mild carbonation, and this lingers on your palate for a long time. Simply, this is the best stout I’ve ever had, and personally preferred to BVDL.",4.8

Throw that in a barrel however, and something magical happens.

177,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"As soon as I cracked this cap, the room was filled with luscious bourbon, roasted malts; caramel; and impressively pungent, high end coffee. Jesus, this smells amazing. 



Taste follows suit: roasty initially before bourbon and coffee interrupt everything and take center stage. Impeccably rounded overall profile. Rivals the very best stouts I’ve ever tasted. World class status is merely implied after the first sip. 



And Kentucky Brunch’s body coats the mouth unlike almost anything else I’ve tasted. The Peg’s stouts are its only peers in this category. 



Holy moly, this is better than Mornin’ Delight... and that isn’t said lightly. Toppling Goliath killed it. Again.  



Update: So it’s been a week, and I’ve decided to upgrade my rating to a perfect 5.  I previously gave it 4/5 on appearance (which is incorrect upon looking at my picture of it afterwards; was trying to be overly picky at the time) and 19/20 for a total of 4.8.  However, I’ve been thinking about this nonstop for the last week and feel comfortable saying that KBBS is a perfect beer.  It’s arguably the best brew I’ve ever smelled, tasted, and enjoyed on the palate, and that makes it a 5.  Hats off to the TG guys: Kentucky Brunch truly is a masterpiece.",5.0

179,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Draft on tap at Kentucky Brunch Release (Decorah, IA). Pours a rich thick deep black hue, opaque and thick, a frothy brownish head atop dies to a creamy ring, laces ok. Good dark ominous body, good legs. Aromas offer maple and coffee, sticky caramel and some vanilla. Roast, toast, and toffee. Maple syrup, gentle oak, vanilla, and faint whiskey wafting. It’s cold, so some warmth should open this up more. Initial is thick and sweet, touches of maple, oak, and cocoa. Sticky caramel, dark roast is mellow grows as it warms. The coffee comes out a bit more roast, a good intensity up front as it trails off, firm presence in the middle. Sticky and firmly flavored, roasty with good vanilla, barrel flavor as we round the corner. Vanilla, coffee, sticky caramel. Toffee, espresso, and richer coffee as we round up, a bit more roasty, sticky, barrel flavor. The base is still thick and firm, not making this pick up much if any heat from the barrel. Oak, roasty, and coffee. I think this is much more drinkable than the Mornin’ Delight. It’s sweet, but not nearly as much. Thick and full, but not overwhelming. The coffee element comes on at just the right time. Really well put together. I prefer this to Mornin, which may just be sensory overload. This one is the gem. Finish is luscious espresso, oak and chewy sweetness, roast. Really nice experience. Damn impressive.",4.4
180,Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Tap at TG.  Incredibly rich aroma - tons of fresh coffee, like stuffing your nose in a bag of freshly roasted, oily beans.  Lots of chocolate, some caramel, a touch of dark fruits, roasty,  slight alcohol note.  The barrel notes are a bit subtle to me, but add a slight whiskey character and some complexity.  Pours jet black, opaque, thin brown head lingers for a minute, slight lacing.  Flavor follows the nose - massive dose of espresso, lots of rich chocolate, nice roast character, bitterness helps balance the big malt profile but is not aggressive.  Alcohol is pleasantly warming and generally well hidden, again some complexity and whiskey notes from the barrel.  Fairly sweet brew but not cloying, moderately bitter, fairly sweet/rich finish.  Very full body, chewy, velvety texture, low-medium carbonation.  Killer brew, absolutely fantastic.",4.7

188,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the ""best beers of the world"" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny.",4.8

244,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Imperial Stout z dodatkiem miodu wrzosowego uwarzony 26 października 2016. Leżakował przez 3 miesiące w dębowych beczka po bourbonie. 

💣2-gi najlepszy RIS na świecie!!
Tuż za słynnym KBBS z Toppling Goliath Brewing Co.!!💣

Alkohol: 12% obj.

Kolor: Czarny, nieprzejrzysty.

Piana: Ciemnokremowa, nietrwała, złożona z drobnych oczek. Początkowy, wąski pasek piany szybko zniknął z pola widzenia. Zero zdobień szkła.

Zapach: Aromat jest śliczny, ale stonowany. Nie jest sztuczny i przesadzony w żadną stronę.
Czuć od groma ciemnych owoców, karmel, śliwki, czekoladę mleczną i wanilię. Po chwili otwiera się jak kwiat, aby wydobyć z siebie nuty dębiny, drewna,melasy i miodu wrzosowego.
Tylko przez chwilę powiało słodami palonymi i delikatną kawą.
Aromat jest krzyżówką nut, które znam z Imperialnych Stoutów oraz Barley Wine.

Smak: To co mnie najbardziej interesuje w tym piwie, to oczywiście smak.
Trzeba dać mu trochę szansę. Początek wcale nie jest łatwy. 
Ot taki uniwersalny Imperial Stout bogaty w nuty czekolady, kawy z dodatkiem mleka, melasy, ciemnych owoców i orzechów migdałowych.
Po znacznym ogrzaniu trunku, zaczynają się pojawiać ciekawe elementy: miód wrzosowy, przyprawy korzenne, zioła, dębina i wanilia.
Szlachetny alkohol rozgrzewa w klatce piersiowej. Tekstura Kaggen’a jest jedynie umiarkowania, na próżno można szukać tutaj gęstych, zawiesistych niuansów.
Pełnia zmienia się wraz z czasem, zmierzając do półwytrawnego finiszu.
Alkohol dobrze zakryty. 

Wysycenie: Średnie do niskiego.

Podsumowanie:

Närke Kulturbryggeri Kaggen Stomaktsporter 2016 - no cóż legenda, legendą, ale na kimś kto wypił już trochę wysoko ocenianych Imperialnych Stoutów w swoim życiu, nie zrobi to piwo większego wrażenia.
Należy mu oddać jednak honor za ciekawy profil smakowy, niestandardowy dodatek (miód wrzosowy), interesujące nuty beczkowe i gładki odbiór.

Z całym szacunkiem dla moich szwedzkich kolegów, którzy nakręcają spiralę wokół tego piwa - nie jest warte swojej ceny 😉

Nie ma się co zabijać dla tych 25 centylitrów.
Jest wiele ciekawszych i tańszych piw i to nawet w Europie.

Peace’n’love my dear Swedish mafia!!😉🍺💣🍻💥",4.0

Ogólnie piwo pije się bardzo ciężko, na siłę, butelka jest maciupka, a i tak zmuszenie się do jej wypicia to duży wyczyn.

249,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Fat på Närke Kulturbryggeri, 15 årsjubileum. Testad som 2008 och 2016.

2008: Svart med gräddig beigebrun krona. Kola, riktigt krämig saltlakritsfudge, svarta vinbär, tjärpastill, lakritsremmar. Stor, fin kropp med mycket fatkaraktär. Tanniner från eken är fint integrerad och ger en snygg syrlig ton tillsammans med sötma från bourbon och tjärpastill, rörsocker, fin maltsötma och rostade toner. Efter ett tag kommer mer fruktiga toner av mörka bär; typ björnbär och svarta vinbär. Fortfarande viss värme från alkoholen och fatlagringen, men det är så oerhört snyggt integrerat och sammanhållet. Smaken från de första munnarna ligger kvar långt och länge. Oerhört välgjort och så väldigt fint mognad. Samtidigt syns inte den minsta tendens på att den passerat sin peak. Mästerverk! 4,7

2016: Svart med tjusigt krämig beige skumpuck. Väldigt tydlig ljunghonungston i doften. Även mörka bär, björnbär/svarta vinbär, kaffesirap, tjärpastill, lakritsremmar. Ganska stor, rund och len kropp. Snygg fatkaraktär som fortfarande känns ganska ung och pigg. Sträv och lätt syrlig från eken. Lite eldighet och värme från alkoholen och fatlagringen. I smaken också honung, kola, bourbon, rostat socker, rörsocker, sötat kaffe, rom. Märkbart sötare och eldigare/spretigare än den äldre årgången. Gör sig nog väldigt väl av att ligga till sig. 4,5",4.7

Opaquest dark brown, a total black hole swirl of a tan head. Rich sugary dusting. Dark smooshed figs, toasted coconut and isolated grab of raisins as it warmed and a welcoming porty porter core. Initial taste is a proper shotgun burning raidance of Meaty, juicy darkest malts - treacly charred sweetness seeping through. Vanilla pod crackles. Soily/dusty coffee dryness. Stabbing richness towards the finish, speckled fizzing out heat on the finish. A lot more layered and flavorsome than a Dark Lord, although a little more chewy meaty and leap at the finish - it’s up there and it’s mysticality will only increase each year this isn’t made.

296,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Some kind of celebration punching my 4K rating at RateBeer.

The big advance of this is the fact that it’s quite easy to grab something interesting from my notes and make it my “celebration”. So what could be more appropriate than world greatest Imperial Stout. I’m lucky to have sampled this by several occasions, but this 2007 vintage where pulled out of my cellar late one evening after a great beer tasting session. Everyone had gone home and I just felt for splitting this bottle with my beer buddy Gunnfryd. The big question where if it still was able to kick balls after a set of other superb ales (lots of good memories from those days my buddies cared to bring fine beers at our beer evenings). Back to the beer. Pours pitch black with a small but nice, dense brown head. Body feels thick and heavy with a appropriate moderate level of carbonation. A sight for sore eyes. Strong aroma of everything dark, like dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate with leather, wood and smooth, refined alcohol. Flavor is sweet but in perfect balance with the bitterness and alcohol. Everything from the aroma is present in such a perfect and smooth combination.

298,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 bottle, from trade with GTH. At last! One of the really big White Whales and a very appropriate selection for my 3000th entry here on Ratebeer - what a ride it has been! :-) Pours a tar black body with a medium light beige head. Nose is coffee, deep malty tones, leather, tar, honey, hints of wood, alcohol, licorice and vanilla. Very elegant and bourbon-like, despite not having touched any such barrels. Taste is burnt toast, licorice, coffee, leather, dark chocolate, dark malts, honey and hints of cellar must and alcohol. Medium body, soft carbonation. Very nicely balanced and well brewed, but times have certainly changed and while Kaggen might have been the top dog some years ago it’s no longer rare to encounter world-class imp stouts like this anymore. Regardless, this beer is still a beauty.

299,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Traded a Blabaer 750ML 2011 for this tiny bottle. Enjoyed at 50 Degrees F and allowed to warm up slowly. This is a 2009 vintage at 9.5%. Full macho American pour into my large stemmed De Dolle Glass.



A - Pours oily, totally black out of the bottle into the glass. A 2 finger coffee colored head forms and fades over the course of 90 seconds to a thin ring and minor sea-foam consistent bubbles. The stickiness of the head is resilient as it swirls around in the glass. Pitch black, not oily but pretty damn black in the glass. 



S - Nose is interesting. I get almost a mix of espresso creamy latte with lactose and fresh roasted coffee mixed with the sweet booziness of rum barrels. There is a hint of vanilla beans and dark chocolate.



T - Interesting. This may be the most roasted beer I’ve ever had like a mix between roasted coffee and roasted oak over a fire. Not campfire smokiness but just very roasted. There’s a huge chocolate presence at the start, the middle is latte with vanilla added and the finish is this roast bomb with an almost astringent booziness like what you get after drinking cheap cough medicine. In the back of my throat I get a grain alcohol like taste like swallowing freezing cold vodka but the burn is always the same.



M - Velvety and sort of fudge like but you know the feeling you’re left with after eating chocolate covered espresso beans? that’s pretty much what this feels like but in liquid form.



O - I’m overall pretty disappointed in this beer. Tickers GOTTA tick but I really don’t feel that this is worth either the hype or the trade bait. There’s too much roasted notes, way too boozy for a 9.5% beer and the astringency never goes away. It’s a great stout but certainly one that I’ll pass on at the next bottle share should it show its face.",3.8

302,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(Original review 2012-08-16): 2007 bottle shared by (and split with) blatantdream. Thanks! 



Almost zero release of air pressure when opened. Viscous body pours from the tiny bottle leaving minimal bubbles up top but no actual head. Chocolate and roasted malts swirl amongst toffee in the nose, creating a delicate aroma that simply isn’t strong enough. The first victim of age, perhaps? 



Stormaktsporter boasts an intense, potent, complex flavor profile. Deeply roasted malt; rich, decadent chocolate; booze character integrates marvelously with the stout base. Not super complex, but the chocolate in this beer is arguably the best of any stout I’ve encountered. Also, the balance here is impeccable. 



Massive body carries all of these flavors to my palate. Rockin’ mouthfeel. Somehow, this ~5-year-old bottle is completely void of oxidization.

307,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"250ml Bottle 2005 Vintage 9% abv. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wonderful deep brown head. The wonderful roasted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, some distant ripe fruit.

312,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a very small sized head of frothy fine to large sized dark brown colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a no visible carbonation opaque and a fair lacing.

Taste is thick dark chocolate, roast, ashy anise notes, touch of molasses, on the front, leading into some rum and oaky raisin and fruits with some slight fig, touch of oak, slight spicy and floral honey in the middle with a hint of vanilla, touch of chocolate, finishing fairly roasted, bitter, slightly sweet from the honey and some floral and spicy notes round it out. Thick through the palate, a bit harsh on the carbonation but not too bad, definitely pushes the tastes through. This is world class for sure.",4.8
320,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"[Bottle] purchased at the football pub in Rome. Pours a clear black with a creamy tan head that slowly dissipates. The aroma has a surprising amount of crystallized, floral honey, light roast, very light barrel, and chalky malt. The flavor has a little more balance. The honey is strong still, lots of floral notes, stronger barrel character than you would think on the aroma, toasty on the back end, and the finish lingers with a little bit of everything there. Nicely complex, but the main thing about this beer is the balance. the aroma is a little less so, but the flavor is stunning. The palate is a touch thin, especially for an imperial, but the alcohol only makes a very light appearance.

321,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle very generously shared by Levi.  Thanks a ton my friend, what an absolute treat.  Pours a very dark brown with reddish highlights around the edges.  A lasting mocha ring, with a skim that lasts as well.  Aroma is sublime: Crystallized honeyed malts, lots of floral character.  Some smoke, chocolate, toffee.  Very, very nice.  Taste is also amazing.  Lots of wood character, seems like red wine even.  Vinous, floral, a bit boozy.  Smoke, chocolate, oak.  Slight booze heat that lasts.   Just amazing, slightly more restrained booze to fill out the palate would make this a 5 for sure.  I could smell and taste this one all night.  Thanks again Levi.",4.7

324,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks a lot, Brad! Served alongside Stormaktsporter.

2009 vintage

The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter.

A distinctly European aroma. It seems to me that Närke, Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, etc. possess distinctive characteristics not found in American stouts. Hooray for diversity and the unique aspects found in beers throughout the world. Anyhow...the beer smells terrific. Roast, chocolate, barrels, a touch of booze.

The flavor does not disappoint. Thick, chewy, viscous stout that coats the palate and melts in your mouth. The barrel character is outstanding. Present, but not overbearing. Beautifully balanced. Dark fruits, chocolate, roast, malt, barrels blending together in harmony.

Highly recommended, should you have the good fortune to sample this.",4.6
325,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Thanks to nbutler for the pour.  I finally get to try this!  Pours black with an espresso head.

Really awesome.  It lived up to the hype for me.",4.3

328,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm. Nose is caramelly, rich chocolate, hints of toasted coconut, fermenty umami, and oily roasted nuts. Some strange metallic fish scale notes. Mouth is rich and swells with alcohol in the mouth, especially compared to the unoaked. I definitely preferred all the vintages of those. Although this is quite nice, it’s a bit of gilding the lily for me. Also the fish notes are strange--my lasting impression is of a German Chocolate cake doused in fish sauce.",4.1
329,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 nip bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm.  A few days earlier I drank full bottles of the 2006 and 2008 Stormaktsporter, and while both were considered very, very good, I felt the 2006 was faded and the 2008 was still a bit too bright and green.  This led me to choose the 2007 as the Kaggen! vintage to try at Akkurat a few days later.  My previous rating is from a nip bottle of the 2005, split two ways in 2008, sampled amid a number of other beers of varying style, bitterness and alcohol.  given the tendency of Narke beers to be somewhat mellow, focusing more on presenting a flavorful, balanced beer drinking experience rather than a bold, in-your-face drinking experience, my thoughts were lost, only preserved in notes taken four years ago.  So I truthfully had no opinion about the Kaggen from that long-ago taste.  I decided on this trip that I would experience Narke Stormaktsporter as if it were completely unknown to me.  The hype surrounding the beer is hard to ignore, but I feel like I can be honest with myself about quality given all of the things I’ve drank, where I’ve been in my beer travels, and how often I seem to go against the grain.  I’ve spent untold amounts of money on beer I didn’t enjoy, cheap and expensive both.  I trusted myself to honestly evaluate the Kaggen without consideration of rarity, reputation or pricetag. Combine this with the fact that so many people have had 4.5+ ""wow"" moments with this beer, and I know there’s something in here to find.  My previous rating was rather unexciting, so I figured I didn’t get the full experience, and this was my shot. So with that all said, how was the beer?  



First pour: early on the beer has limited expression given the temperature, a bit colder than is ideal. Early on the nose presents  a chewy and creamy melted chocolate chip dark malt character with light touches of faded whiskey and oak. The body is exceptionally savory and frothy, suggesting chocolate fudge and fluffy but savory cake.  There is slow growing alcohol warmth as the beer begins to blossom and open up with time, and after about 10 minutes it becomes difficult to put into words... surreal decadence, that would put it best. Prickly, just-bitter cocoa nibs and fudge cake softness with a velvety body.  Later on, approaching room temperature, the nose develops some metal and paint yeast notes but it’s really quite mild and doesn’t spoil the decadent spongy fudge cake deliciousness.  Some mild smoke and char are at play later on, and the whiskey remains happily subdued and well-matched for the moderate roast and soft, decadent body.  The last sips show a bit more whiskey and alcohol, as expected, but still remains creamy and chewy and perfectly suited for it’s size.  Delicious.  And no fish sauce whatsoever.



previous rating of 2005 vintage sampled in 2008: Appearance is deep black, no apparent light passing through the edges of my glass.  A deep brown head sites on top, and when swirled the brown, thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass and slowly crawls back down.  Very attractive splotchy lacing.  First impression of the nose is rich dark chocolate and a slightly hot aroma of whiskey with faint charred wood as well. For sure the whiskey is not overpowering, and I’d probably say it’s one of the few beers that used whiskey barrel aging is a truly complimentary role.  The (faint) char, rich (but not heavy) smoke, and malty scotch notes work together really, really well.  First taste is rich chocolate and sharp whiskey, again, complimentary rather than dominating, with oak barrel and delicate, toasted chocolate malts coating the mouth.  Over the back it’s slightly warming, very mellow and smooth, leaving a rich toffee, amaretto and resinous whiskey coating on the tongue.  A few times I even pick up some nice, moist tobacco as well.",4.3
330,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2009 bottle.  Some bottles come with so much hype that you really don’t expect them to live up.  This is a really special beer.  Dark beer with ruby hints around the edges when held against the light.  Brown ring and faint slick of a head in the snifter.  Huge nose dominated by the bourbon but with plenty of wood, smoke and alcohol notes.  Sticky brown bubbles while you drink.  Tons of bourbon flavors with oak, butter, molasses, over ripe fruit and some smoke.  Great oily mouthfeel and nice warming alcohol.  Incredibly complex and well balanced beer.  Many thanks to my Secret Santa for sending this bottle.",4.7
331,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle at Akkurat. 2008 vintage. Pitch black pour, tan ring of foam. Aroma of dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, lots of oak. A teeny bit of soy sauce here as well, but much less than the unbarreled version. Taste is wonderful, quite sweet, lots of vanilla oak notes, molasses, light roastiness, so tasty. Smooth without being slick, light carb, full body. Altough it’s on its way as well, this still drinks fantastic and is much better than the regular IMHO.",4.3
332,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,Bottle.  2008. lots of malt and chocolate. Seems like a very different beer from when opened to the final sip.  Coffee and oak/wood flavors are present with some licorice.  Hard to explain because of the complexity. a must try.,4.6

336,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle 2008 version, 0.3 taste 2007 version @ Närke Kulturbryggeri (Örebro, Sweden). *Hearty-rate*: the perfection in form of imperial stout. Drink it, period. *Rational-rate*: every time I have Kaggen! Stormaktsporter I never feel used to such a masterpiece. As I said to everyone: had many of the BIG IRS whales, like Black Tuesday, Darkness, Darklord, The Abyss, Eclipse, Dark Horizon, ecc., ecc., but this one tower above all. The reasons? Color is intense black, with a brown head like moka. But complexity starts from the aroma: you could never get enough of smelling, you touch something different every time. And difficult, extremely difficult to hive off single components. It’s burned sugar, molasses, apricot, oak, vanilla, plum, cherries, chocolate, coffee, syrup, spice, herbs. Bond between all that stuff is almost indivisible, even more in taste, it comes out an holistic property. Difficult to explain. But fact is, and could seem a paradox, separately from complexity, Kaggen! isn’t difficult to have, even though 25 cl is the best format, because hits directly the bull’s eye of senses without hesitation. You don’t need to be an experienced taster for appreciation and understand you’re facing something SO BIG. Moreover, it’s pointless making long analysis and list all flavors, since the best side it’s just the wholeness of such a full body; warms mouth and palate, in a great alternation between sweetness and bitterness (more the first) and the PERFECT balance of malts and hops. Herbaceous character, given by heather honey, isn’t invasive and oak aging as well. It’s ambrosia, no way. Breweries like Närke aren’t just their hype-geek productions, try other ones (cAmarillo, Örebro Bitter, and so on) and you’ll catch how they great could be as artisans. Long live HG and Berith.",5.0
337,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 bottle. Pours thick and black with an average brown head. Looks decadent. Nose is mellow yet potent at the same time. Light smoke, melon, spice, chocolate, roasted coffee, oak, apricot, maple syrup and alcohol.  Super complex. Flavor is sweet up front. Rich. Bitter peeks through and becomes more prominent in the middle and balances well for a bittersweet dry finish. Mouthfeel is like heaven on the tongue. Unreal how good this is. Believe the hype kids.

338,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"25cl bottle. 2008 vintage. Pours a thick black color with a nice medium brown head. Creamy foam. Alcohol legs sticking to the side of the glass. Aroma is complex and heavenly: to me it smelled like they placed the finest RIS in a delicious port wine barrel. Chocolate, oak, red wine, red berries, coffee, licorice. Taste is on the same level, extremely smooth and balanced, with a fantastic complexity. Again, chocolate, red berries, red wine, wood and coffee beans. I’m not sure if this is the age of the bottle speaking here, but this was the most gentle and yet delicious imperial stout ever tried. It retained all the flavours os typical roasty ones, but without the sometimes overwhelming bitterness. This was less bitter then average RIS to me, it struck a perfect balance. And yet so much complexity. Heavenly. Body is thick and oily with a the perfect amount of carbonation. This is probably the first exceptionally-hyped beer that I truly enjoy as expected. Actually, probably even more tha that. Perfection is not of this world, but I can see giving this a perfect 5.",4.9
339,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/30/2011.  Poured from a 8 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. 2008 vintage. 

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter has a typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace. 

The aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose.

The flavor is pretty much exactly what I want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. Smooth, sweet bourbon comes in first and slowly lets in the fig, raisin, cherry, and roasted malt blend beautifully together. Some dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, and light espresso notes are in the background. The finish has a bit more bourbon and finishes fairly clean.

The carbonation is smooth, with just enough crispness to excite the tongue along with the bourbon. The body is on the fuller side of medium and consistent all the way through. Slightly sticky on the lips.

Clearly, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. No individual flavor really stands out, but the flavors in concert work so well together.",4.4

On the palate it is medium heavy with some suds which is surprising since the nose would suggest a creamy, thick mouthfeel as well. The alc. is very well controlled. The malty sweetness dominates but everything is still really complex. Develops in the glas and gets thicker after a while and has an aftertaste to die for.

Thanks to the tremendous generosity of Jan and Charlotte I got to try this gem at the end of our tasting when we visit them for the first time. I can’t deny that I had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fullfill them. Did it ? Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful de molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wondeful deep brown head. The wonderful raosted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, soem distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel lie you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anythign but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ).

Nose is rather underwhelming, it is heavy on the dark fruit and has hints of vanilla, smoke, honey, tobacco, some blackstrap molasses, and oak.  The taste follows the nose quite closely.  Lots of dark fruit, smoke, honey, brown sugar, and chocolate...definitely the highlight of the beer.  It is on the thicker side and coats the palate nicely with light carbonation.  Excellent imperial stout, I can definitely see why this gets the hype it has.  I was a little let down by the nose for this being a world class imperial stout.",4.3
358,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"From a bottle at SMÖF 2011. Dark beer. Licorice, tar, dark chocolate, vanilla and a bit smokey aroma and flavor. Nice balance and a lovley beer. 2008 years version.",4.6
359,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 bottle.
Pours pitch black, with a faint reddish hue, beige head.
The aroma is heavily roasted and fantastically complex. Dark chocolate, mint, coffee, tar, malt, tobacco, honey, candied sugar, along with balanced notes of wood, vanilla and tobacco..
Quite sweet, full bodied, high bitterness, creamy CO2.
The taste reflects everything from the aroma, together with wood, vanilla, licorice, mint, and an astringent tannin structure. Amazing. Again. (2011-10-28)",4.8
360,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Black colour, small creamy tan head. Aroma somewhat sweet, quite balanced, liquorice, caramel, bourbon, honey, vanilla and nuts. Some roasted tones.

361,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Black body, 1 inch of brown head.

Aroma has a beautiful smoke and dark chocolate/coffee mixture. Heavily roasted malts and some ashiness. Barrel comes through very well. Charred oak and light caramel.

The barrel is upfront in the flavor. It hides a lot of the depth and complexity that the base beer had. I don’t get as much of the sweetness and the ashy flavor is a little toned down. The alcohol cuts through that and leaves an acidic heavily roasted malt/coffee flavor on the palate. Lots of dark cocoa charred oak and light caramel. Creamy mouth feel with low-medium carbonation.",4.0
362,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 bottle courtesy of the infamous daknole -- many thanks, my friend!!  I had been looking forward to this for a long time, like most people who have this beer, and I have to say that it did an amazing job of living up to the hype.  Yet, I also have to say that we had this next to a COMPLETE vertical of Goose Island BCS, and Chicago definitely held it’s own.  The beer smells of char, honey, vanilla, cocoa, and dark fruits.  Tastes of each with an even stronger note of burnt malts in the flavor and added notes of leather and tannins.  Certainly a work of art worthy of the attention.",4.5

364,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"25 cl bottle vintage 2009 @ Man in the Moon, Stockholm. Rated on 14.05.2011

Aroma has roasted malt, chocolate, oak and lots of vanilla typical to bourbon aged IS. The bourbon comes a bit too much through here. Very smooth and thick palate like the basic stormakts has. Flavour is rich and very complec with bourbon, honey, vanilla and chocolate. At the end of the glass the bourbon has covered my whole mouth and the thick palate has become really sticky. 25 cl of this is really enough. Kind of reminds me of Goose Island Bourbon County, but this is slightly better. Worse than the non-Kaggen version though.

8-4-8-5-18 = 4.3

25 cl bottle vintage 2018 @ home. Rated on 11.2.2023

Aroma has bourbon, cocoa and some vanilla. Also licorice. Flavour has alcohol, bourbon, dark chocolate. A bit sharp on alcohol, perhaps would still need some ageing.

Sweet, holy chocolate poured from the belgian masters secret wells, slight burned by swedish dark glass blowers, aromas of coffee from a perfect 1 euro espresso served by a milanese barista topped with vanilla from a secret paradise island. In all quite OK.",4.4
370,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 bottle bought on import. Pours almost jet black with red-brown tinges and a fine brown head that vanishes fast to leave an slightly oily look. Aroma is vanilla, a little oak, old port wine and a touch of honey. Initially a little musty and dusty on the palate, then the slightly oily texture reveals chocolate, coffee, a little more vanilla, and a touch of red fruit. The aftertaste is dry and spicy with hints of honey and mocha. By the way, they’re not wrong about the minimum temperature - it really does bring the richness out.",4.2

376,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"One of my long time wants.  ’08 Bottle served right after the regular version.

A- Pours opaque black with a small half finger tall mocha colored head leaving little to no lacing down the glass.
S - Smells just like the regular version with a few extra things tossed in. Compared to the regular version this one has a bit more vanilla, charred oak, peat whiskey, and just the faintest sour note. Excellent stuff.
T - Just like the regular version the taste is a bit of a letdown from that amazing nose but with the addition of the cask maturation it has really helped to round things out. Hints of rich bakers chocolate, sweet vanilla and charred oak tannins, licorice, dark fruits, and a tiny bit of light soy sauce. Only the faintest hint of alcohol creeps in as it comes to room temperature. The finish is a mix of sweet dark roast and some dry wood tannins, lingering for a short period of time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth feel with a mix of sweetness and dryness lingering through the finish. Only the faintest hint of booze can be detected.
O - Damn, I really wish I had a few more of these. I don’t like to say that a specific beer is the best I have ever had, but if you asked me what is the best RIS I have had this would be near the top of my list. I am glad I could share this one with a few people who could appreciate it as much as I did.",4.5

Pours black with a small brown head that vanishes quite quick. Aroma is very pleasant, oak and dark chocolate hits immediately. Behind that some vanilla and coffee. As the beer gets warmer in the glass the aromas of sweet honey and dark dried fruits arise. The beer is full bodied and starts off quite sweet but finishes dry and unfortunately quite abrupt. Flavours of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and raisins shines through in the taste.  Bourbon cask aged beer is not always a favourite of mine but here it works all right.

Bitternes is similar to that of very dark 85 % + chocolate, possibly with a hint of chili. Generally gives the impression of being a much stronger beer than it is.

396,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"250mL 2008 big thanks to omhper! The pour is significantly improved over the normal 2007 Stormaktsporter. A very lively, large, blooming, deep brown head erupts on a near jet black body. Lacing is sheety, large, and sticky. Aroma is very intense: fruity, floral, buttery, maple, something not unlike bourbon but more akin to brandy and spiced orange. As it warms, very heavy buttery bourbon comes through even though this has no bourbon component in the aging. More spiced orange comes through again with licorice and mild peat. Later, I get a lot more orange, potpourri, heavy clove and cinnamon. Taste is very different from the normal version. Up front this is sharp and citrusy, mild butter and spicy oak in the mid, and finishes neutral, tannic, and rich with bourbon, oil, and coconut similar to Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Palate is slightly carboardy and mildly dusty. Not super oily or thick. Very different from the normal Stormaktsporter. Not coffee, chocolate, or bourbon forward. More neutral malty, bitter orange, mild coffee. Pretty good but not mind blowing. Definitely not the best beer in the world unfortunately. Inferior to Misto BA or even De Molen Heaven and Hell. Overall relatively weak sauce, tart, mild, thinner. Definitely a sad product of hype, rarity, and biased ratings.",3.8
397,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Shared with GT2. Pour is jet black with a deep brown head that leaves some sheety lacing. Aroma starts out as a bouquet of floral and orange blossoms and warms into a bitter chocolate, vanilla, caramel. Taste is very bitter chocolate, cocoa powder on the finish, boozy, some citrus. It’s a little less robust than I was expecting. Palate is a bit oily, a bit thinner than I expected, but that doesn’t really detract. Really like this one.",3.8

Palate is second to none. This is a beer you almost don’t want to swallow... Taste is just amazing and doesn’t let the other qualities down.

French-roast coffee, some roast, some tar. The barrel is both restrained and yet very present compared to the regular Stromaktsporter... Flavours of tarry roast, tight and nicely bitter; very balanced. Loads more berry in the mouth, as opposed the nose, shows its kinship with the regular Stormaktsporter here: Loads of choke cherries.

433,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"I can’t thank Jan enough for getting me this one, 2008 bottle, side by side with the regular 2008 Stormaktsporter.

Pours just like the regular version, pitch black with a thick tan head that recedes ever so slowly to a clumpy cap and leaves very good lacing.

Oh man, the smell on this one is wonderful.  It takes the chocolate sweetness and the fruity esters from the base beer and layers on a hefty dose of earthy leather notes and some spicy oak.  Espresso and honey as well.  Whoa.

The taste has an initial spicy kick from the oak and earthy sweetness from the honey.  The heavily roasted malts hang out underneath as well as the chocolate, which really takes a back seat compared to the regular version where it steals the show.  The finish is completely different as well with a hefty alcohol burn coating the throat.

Mouthfeel, much like the regular version, is stunning.  Just completely coats the mouth, so smooth with just the right carbonation.

This was definitely an interesting comparison to the normal Stormaktsporter and they differed more than I expected.  This beer is probably more complex and definitely has an earthier, oakier character.  Definitely one of the better beers I’ve ever had and marginally better than the normal version.

Served in a tulip, 2007 vintage. Beer is black. Thin head that breaks and floats toward the walls of the glass, no lacing, the head is a little sad, hard to motivate, carbonation is low, looks like a big stout to me!

Yep, this beer smells perfect. I could have smelled it all day long, just smelled it. I didn’t want to drink it, I was afraid I couldn’t smell it anymore. This feeling was universal I have to say. There was chocolate and vanilla in there, a healthy but not overly oakiness as well. There is sweetness and mild alcohol but its not cloying or hot at all. Its very ""complex"" -- it almost turns to a liquor aroma after a while, a mild whiskey or something slightly fruitier, but its not oxidized.

Beer is a little lighter in the body than I was expecting but I suppose I should have been expecting the way it was due to the ABV being so high. Leads off with a definite sweetness, mild alcohol but its not drying. Great palate connectivity, the beer sort of coats the tongue, lingering with these subtle fruit flavors and general sweetness, creamy in the mouth, no help from carbonation at this point but this beer doesn’t even need it. Its a very good beer. Have it again? Definitely. If I ever get a hold of a bottle of this, it will be shared with a group of beer nerds who fantasize about this as much as I had.

444,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Rating 500. Version 2009. Tasted 14 oct. 2010. At first, till some weeks ago, I was thinking Närke probably should be overrated. Cause of the low brewingcapacity, and the very hard to get beers, this beers just had to get an higher rating then they deserve… Ok the beers should be good, but that good like described? Then, soms weeks ago, I had the chance to taste some beers of this brewer (thanks to Brouwerij De Molen, with the beerfestival!). And I took the chance to taste 3 beers of this brewer, that are not at the top of the ratebeer-rating, but decent. And damn, they are very good, maybe even great. So I got myself also Stormaktsporter and Kaggen Stormaktsporter at 25cl bottles. And now is the time to rate this 2 beers next to eachother (lucky me). So my 499th rating is the Närke Stormaktsporter 2008, my 500th rating is the Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter 2009. And here we go my 500th rating: Pours out a bit darker then the non-kaggen version? Really pitch black. A small head, brownish, won’t holds that good as the normal version. Smell is diferent, more sourness comes up, and something for sure different, the bourbon? Coffee, fruits, something pleasant (bourbon?), wood, chocolate. Very nice smell for sure, also the vanilla seems to come trought a bit more... Taste is different for sure also. Ofcourse the taste is roastiness, coffee, chocolate,… but some more liquorish for sure, more alcohol, and the bourbon comes up with a kick. The sweetness goes at this one more to some sourness. The mouthfeel is pleasant, about the same, oily like i like it. The taste is maybe just a bit to sharp for me at the start. Maybe I’m weird, but I like the normal version just a bit more, It seems more balanced then this one, but that’s maybe cause this one is younger, and after some aging the sharp start will be softened. A very good brew for sure, and wanna try this again in some time, with an aged bottle. But till then: overrated? NO! Best beer? no... Top-beer? For sure! Very decent imperial stout for sure, well done Närke! Maybe I had to wait a bit longer to open this bottle, or the other version, as my 550th rating or so, but now it’s more easy to compare them. Edit: retasted to celibrate something special. 2009 version on 12/09/2014. Almost like i remembered this beer. The honey seems faded away some, but while warming up it’s still there.

447,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 edition.  


Huge thanks to a very generous BA for the chance to finally taste this one. 

Pours jet black with a mocha head and a tad bit of lacing as it makes its way down. The smell is incredibly complex and quite forceful--I could actually get a pretty good whiff of it upon opening the bottle even before pouring it into my glass. Nose consisted of nearly every imperial stout adjective imaginable with great notes of chocolate fudge, vanilla, espresso, burnt dark fruits, roasted malt, and a bit of barrel characteristics. The taste brought things forward even more, really just layering the complexities in a very intense manner. 

The chocolate fudge really stood out to me at time, but in all honesty it was really difficult to pick out individual throughout, as everything was just so well integrated. In essence, all I can really say is that this is exactly what an imperial stout should taste like. I would say that for a beer with this incredible amount of flavor, the feel was a bit thin. However, the carbonation was really nice and let the flavors shine through. Drinkability was just out of this world. I can’t wait until the day when I get to try this again.",4.6

464,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 Kaggen enjoyed at Akkurat

A: Deep black body with a smallish khaki head of tight bubbles.  Receded over a minute or two leaving behind some whispy lacing.

S: Delicate milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and some oak.  The bourbon barrel aging is undeniable but it is quite restrained and silky.

T: Like the nose, the bourbon barrel aging is graceful.  That said, its subtleties are somewhat lost in its meekness.  I prefer barrel aged stouts that are a bit more potent, but refrain from burning your throat off.  Milk chocolate, oak, vanilla, and bourbon are all here.  Surprising, not as much roasted malt as I was expecting.

M: The mouthfeel is the standout element of this beer for sure.  Nice and thick, with a luscious, velvety feel as the beer coats the tongue.  No burn with just the slightest hints of the 10% ABV.  

O: Quite nice.  I think just about anyone can appreciate the quality here, but its just not quite the bourbon barrel RIS that I absolutely crave.",4.2

Sweet malts, sweet honey, dark fruits, some spicy oak and bourbon, smoky, roasted malts.  Really surprised at the smoke element in this.

Into a tulip, Kaggen pours black and opaque with a small but lasting dark tan head. A gentle swirl coats the glass with oily legs and a few wispy bubbles. Sticking my olfactory receptor into the glass reveals aromas of chocolate cake, honey, caramel and whiskey. This beer is brewed with heather, and you can tell; it has a slight gruit-like quality. Further inspection brings out a light fruity tartness, not unlike aged Port, and a hint of anise and vanilla. On the tongue I get even more fruit than the aroma suggests, lightly tart and lightly sweet, somewhat vinous in quality. Chocolate, caramel and vanilla follow with barrel tannins and a pleasant and subtle roasty astringency balancing the sweetness. Whiskey is present throughout, but the mellowness is amazing; this beer has no noticeable heat. The mouthfeel is velvety and full, but not American full-bodied; I could actually drink a pint of this without worrying about rising insulin levels. Just an all-around exceptional beer, far exceeding my expectations and well worth the exorbitant hype.",4.9
478,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"11oz bottle, 2008 vintage.  Pours the same oily, opaque black as the regular Stormaktsporter but with quite a bit more beige head.  The aroma has a great, milk chocolate milkshake thing happening, licorice, wood, a little saw dust, toasted bread.  Flavor of brown sugar, cherries, malts, toasted breads, licorice, coffee, oak, vanilla.  Full bodied and sweet with this really nice, enveloping mouth feel.  This is great from start to finish and totally worthy of the hype.",4.8
479,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 edition bottle shared with tarjei at Mikkeller bar 8.5.2010. Pours black with a creamy brown head that quickly disappates. Alcohol, coffee, roasted malts and dried dark fruits in the aroma. Acidic, sweet and bitter flavors all nicely balanced and mellow with coffee, roasted malts and chocolate present. Medium to full body. Creamy texture and velvet smooth to drink. I can definitely see now what the fuss is about. Highly recommended!",4.4
480,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 vintage pours like liquid fudge brownie with mahogany edges and mocha head. Swirling it up seems to stain the glass some. The aroma has dark roasted malts, chocolate fudgy brownies, vanilla, caramel covered oak and the some bourbony whisky booze at the end of the draw. It has a smooth rich punctuating aroma. The taste is just as smooth and rich as the aroma with bold notes of dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, dark roasted malts and then rolls smoothly into an even mix of vanilla, aged oak and bourbony like booze.",4.4
481,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle shared with Robert. Aroma was bourbon, vanilla, and roasted malts. Poured black with small tan head. Taste was similar to smell, with a very smooth mouth feel. Great Imperial Stout.",4.2
482,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle shared by robert at SL, bottle via Sloth thanks bert! Pours a black oily color. Small head. Good nose of roasted malts, some dark fruits.

Thanks robert and bert!",4.1
483,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Medium dark brown head. Opaque black body. Earthy burnt sherry aroma with chocolatey toffee and soy sauce notes. Sweet burnt linoleum and earth taste with alcohol and honey notes. Complex and harmonic. Mild, soft, velvety mouthfeel with faint alcohol burn. Light, full body. Dry linoleum and earth aftertaste with resiny peas and honey notes. Very, very harmonic. Fantastic mix of the sweet and inviting and the harsh and forbidding. Now this is quite something.

Aroma is chocolate and smoke with loads of oak and layers of char.  Plums and rich fruits permeate the aroma, along with the barrel presence.
Taste is sweet, rich oak, lots of barrel character; vanilla, alcohol, char, chocolate, red fruits.
Finish is sweet, slightly ashy, lots of barrel, and vanilla.
Very good beer.",4.1

486,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Thanks to Degarth for the share.  Pours translucent dark brown.  Nose is sweet brown sugar/ molasses, some smoke, chocolate, light smoke, some fruit, and barrel.

Loved it.",4.5

490,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Tasted 2010-05-07. 2007-version. Had it bottled at Mikkeller Bar after a very wet day at the Copenhagen Beer Festival. It poured black with a super creamy texture. Sweet notes of cocoa, coffee, vanilla, liquorice, smoke, roasted malts and a lot more vanilla and cocoa.

493,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 version. Thanks to ChristianScheffel for sharing this. When I rated the normal stormakts porter, did I say, that it couldn’t be done better. I can’t say that the kaggen version is better, but it is at least as good, therefore it can only be a new 5.0 from me. The beer pours black with a brown head. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, liquorish, tobaco, plum, raisin, vanilla and oak. Flavour is roasted malt, chocolate, alcohol, plum, tobaco, wood, oak and vanilla. Perfection in a bottle. 5.0

Rerated 2009 version@BBF 2010. Almost perfect, just a hint of bourbon, which pulls a little down.",4.9
494,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle thanks to Peter, enjoyed along side the regular Stormaktsporter.  Pour is near-black with a perfect 1/4 inch layer of brown head that lingered to the end. Interesting to note that a sample pour from the same bottle into an identical vessel did not have any head at all; no idea why. Aroma is prominent molasses and caramel with more subtle notes of vanilla, coconut, and very light ash.  Maybe a touch of chocolate dipped orange peel as well.  Flavor has a full vanilla and caramel burst up-front with a similar finish to the regular; toffee, roasted malt, and light fruit.  However, the finish in the Kaggen! is a bit softer, rounder, and more pleasing to me.  The barrel seems to have added a nice vanilla component while also softening out the ""sharp"" edges of the non-barrel version.  It really is incredibly good.",4.7
495,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle. 2007 vintage.

An aroma of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, raisins, oak, fudge etc. that invites you to a wonderful taste that is perfectly balanced with no taste taking over the show. It feels quite different on the palate, however, much more carbonation that I expected but this isn’t a bad thing, quite the opposite. It looks beautiful in the glass, pitch black with a brown head.

Quite possibly the best beer of all time.",4.9
496,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle.

Vintage 2006 - Drank 2010.

A - Deep black with a small brown, foamy head. Settles fast with just a bit of lacing left that also disappears fairly fast.

S - Very rich. Upfront is chocolate and fudge like smells, quite sweet. There is a very slight touch of coffee and a fair amount of tobacco as well. Also can smell some vanilla. Overall fairly sweet but very nice to smell.

T - Follows the nose a bit. Upfront it is fairly sweet with a good amount of chocolate/fudge along with some molasses. A good amount of vanilla and other oaky flavors are also quite present here, along with just a bit of whisky like taste. Just a bit of coffee is there. Also a bit of dark fruit as well. A number of flavors that fade in and out and change with each sip, with the constant really being the chocolate and the vanilla/barrel tastes.

M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy.

D - Easy to sip beer. This depends most on how you feel about sweeter tastes in beer. I really like the flavors it uses so I would gladly drink more. The ABV holds drinking multiples (but so does my wallet and availability).

Notes: A very enjoyable dessert like beer. Glad I was able to finish off my time in Sweden at Akkurat and finish of the night with one of these. Yes there are better beers, and definitely yes, you can get more value of beer for the cost of this, but it is a very nice beer that is worth trying if you have the time and money and are in Stockholm.",4.9
497,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle, 25cl, 2006 edition. Thanks to Scheffel for sharing this for my 1000th rating. Pours a pitch black beer with a big lightbrown head, with a nice lacing. The aroma is coffee, licorice, wood, vanilla, sweetness and fruit. The flavor is likewise malt, coffee, licorice, wood, vanilla, sweetness and fruit. The palate is soft, round, smooth and very pleasant. Overall a complex and balanced beer with all the right aromas and flavors for a beer. Just perfect. (Rating #1000)",5.0
498,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"6 cl sample on tap at SBWF -09, 2007 version. Some may think that this one is overrated, but I can’t agree. This is heaven liquified. There are heaps of vanilla, honey, chocolate, dark sugar, syrup, dark fruits, coffee and roasted malt and it all comes together in a fantastic, balanced complexity. The mouthfeel is silklike. This is a real treat!",4.8
499,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 version, purchased at Oliver Twist. I’ve got the ’07 waiting for the right tasting event back home. Aged in Mackymyra single malt whiskey barrels if I’m not mistaken. Served in a snifter. The bottle was given to me WAY too cold, so I let it warm for a bit.

A - First, I don’t generally dig snifters for my RIS consumption - they generally reduce head volume by quite a bit, and my favorite brews don’t benefit much from the aroma ""retention"". In any case, it had a late-rising dark mocha, even slightly red, half-finger of foam that dissipated pretty quickly to a ring with a few bubbles at the surface and some ""legs"". Pitch black - there’s some pretty lace that’s generated with each sip but it quickly slides down the edges of the glass and back into the abyss. It actually looked a lot like Dave’s (d0b) pour of the Cigar City 110K+OT in my Darkness snifter. I’m going to give it the benefit of the doubt, but if I get subpar head volume in a different vessel next time I may dock this a half point.

S - Sweet Jesus - this thing smells epic. Huge whiskey, vanilla, oak, dark fruits, honey, roasted malts, tobacco, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, molasses, and probably all the other descriptors used by my reviewing colleagues. The closest comparison I can think of was the incredible BA Decadence ’07, but this brew brings a slight sour note to the table that is almost a little reminiscent of the most recent Perseguidor (batch 4). I’m not sure how much time this brew sits in the barrel, or whether Swedish whiskey is more conducive to ""bugs"" but it’s a wonderful addition that adds a touch of depth and richness that can be lacking in other BA beers. There’s not a trace of astringent alcohol either.

T - OK - you can pretty much taste everything listed in the smell, as there is really no drop-off in complexity. Whiskey, vanilla, wood, bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, roastiness - they’re all here. Near the back end of the palate it fleetingly moves into BA barleywine territory somehow, with the burnt molasses flavor in there, but then it finishes with huge tannins and oak - like on par with Toronado 20th here. I’m at a loss here, because I keep picking up slight sour beer elements that my fellow colleagues didn’t mention - perhaps this is caused by the age, or the barrel used? In any case, it’s as if someone took an amazing BA beer like Decadence and spiked it with a touch of Consecration or something.

M - There’s a little heat to go with the full silky smooth body and lots of stickiness. The residual feel is that ""I’ve been licking a piece of wood"" kind of thing that shows up in barrel-aged brews. Fairly mild carbonation. No complaints here.

D - This is the only place I can really knock this brew. I was worried the 250ml bottle wouldn’t be enough for me to really enjoy and reflect on, but it was plenty. The alcohol is well hidden, but the buzz creeps up pretty fast. Also, the heavy tannic finish and the somewhat mind-blowing flavor depth make this a true evening-ender. But what an evening!

It’s not very often that a brew comes along that changes my perception of what a style can do. I’m not sure if the slight sour notes were intentional, or a by-product of the barrel aging process, but any beer that marries the best of brews like BA Decadence, Parabola, and Bell’s BB Double/Cream Expo blend with stuff like Toronado 20th and Persguidor opens up my mind and palate to the amazing possibilities of beer. I understand this stuff is hard to get, but it should be tried be every beer lover at least once.",4.8
500,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Thank to OteyJ!
POur is Obsidian with a tiny beige head.  Aroma is rich decadent honey, vanilla, some light oak, and a touch of lactic sugar.  Lightly Roasted as well.  Flavor is intensely vanilla, some oak tannin and chocolate.  The finish is coffee roast and boozy.  Date, candied Prune throughout.  Love it .",4.7
501,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Epically black pour with a massive tan head. The aroma is bursting with vanilla, lactic sugars, honey, and a back-note of roast. The flavor is huge vanilla, oak tannins, huge roast, dark fruit, honey, and some moderate alcohol. The palate is thick and coating with dry roast and a sticky-sweet  goodness. One of the best imperial stouts out there.",4.8
502,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"I have been waiting for this beer for a long time; huge props to my man oteyj for trading for this baby. Somehow has a darker pour than the regular Stormaktsporter, with a similarly beautiful brown head, slightly less thick and more bubbly. Aroma holds tons of vanilla, wood, lactic sugars, honey, and lots of caramel and molasses sweetness. Just a touch of roast as well. Flavor surpasses the aroma easily; tons of vanilla, oak, dark fruit, prune, and more roast. Words almost don’t do the palate justice; you can feel the booze, but it is just so unbelievably well balanced on every front. Absolutely phenomenal.",4.7
503,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"YESSS thanks to my main man footbalm for saving this great beer for a special occasion. Bottle 2006 Pours out black topped with a cream brown head.

504,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2005 vintage, 180ml bottle, into smallish tasting glass. Big props goes to Alex for breaking this one out at our Pre-Night of the Living Ales Tasting. 

A - Pours black, tan head, a bit of retention and a hint of lacing.

S - Honey, chocolate, molasses, coffee, oak, etc. This is a very complex beer, so it’s hard to pick out everything in this one. I’m sure I’m missing some notes but rest assured, it’s awesome.

T - Even better then the nose. Lots of honey up front, some chocolate, oak, dark fruits. Lots of stuff to pick out here and like the nose, very complex. 

M - Maybe a touch too light, but very rich and smooth. Sweet finish that makes you want to come back for more.

D - We split this bottle several ways, but I could have easily drank the entire thing (if I were being greedy). It was very special to have the 2005 version, which already has 5+ years on it. I won’t probably ever get to try a ’05 again, but perhaps I’ll get to compare some of the newer vintages versus this.",4.4
505,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"A: The pour is thick and pretty much black as night with a small, creamy mocha colored foam.

S: Rich aromas of chocolate, coffee, honey, vanilla, and black cherries. There’s a slight floral note to the beer as well which probably comes from the honey. The oak really imparts some incredible aromas to this beer, and I just can’t stop smelling it.

T: Much like the nose, this one has plenty of barrel character. There’s quite a bit of vanilla, a noticeable charred oak flavor, and a light smokiness. The chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and dark fruits really come through on the palate as well.

M: The carbonation is very low, but that works well with this beer and it doesn’t feel syrupy. It’s quite viscous and creamy and really feels smooth on the tongue.

D: A really fantastic beer which I wish was more easily attainable. I would gladly enjoy this one several more times.",4.5
506,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Did NOT think I’d ever have the chance to try this beer. Once again, Justin and Greg blow us completely away with their generosity. Unbelievable. Tampa Crew for the win. 2006 bottle, and probably slightly on the downside. Sweet nose of roasted malts, chocolate, and what seems like just a hint of licorice and smoke. Solid and creamy mouthfeel with just a hint of prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Sweet and grainy, almost as thick and rich as a milkshake. Nice bitters in there just enough. Really amazing beer, reminds you of why you love imperial stouts.",4.1
507,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Acquired in a trade with bosse

2006 Version

A:  Pours a nice dark rich black with a small brown head.  Some okay retention with just a few spots of lace.

S:  Lots of roasty, dark chocolate, coffee, and mild oak.

T:  Roasty and chocolaty up front.  Coffee in the middle with hints of oxidation and coconut showing through.  There is a nice malty sweetness that is nice without being too sweet.  The oak is rather mild and can be picked up in the finish.

M:  Medium in body, smooth and easy drinking.

509,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 vintage, draught at Bishops Arms, Vasagatan where it was poured into a tall tulip glass and served at a comfortable drinking temperature.

Thin, but lasting, yellowy fawn head covering a dark brown body with a deep ruby tint. Succulent aroma of dark fruits, like plums and raisin. Plentiful taste of chocolate, cocoa and vanilla, but never too sweet. Dried and dark fruits to the aftertaste, with notes of figs. Bitter berries and warming alcohol on the swallow. Full bodied, however, far from heavy to drink. Lingering all the way to Linköping. Complex and comprehensive. I paid 145sek for 180ml and it was well worth every krone.

512,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Review of 02-02-10
I drank this 2008 version 250 ml bottle into my Rochefort chalice.

The beer pours pitch black with a nice creamy dark tan head. Its very pretty and fluffy. The head rises about 2 fingers stays around a couple minutes and leaves a sopay head. The lacing is a little lighter than I would have hoped for. 

The aroma is medium in strength, pretty matly to start lots of sweet chocolate, some vanilla and light bourbon on the end. There is a tiny bit of oak. Overall, its pretty understated.

The taste is super smooth its sweet up front with sweet chocolate, in the middle it brings some depth with some nice oak/bourbon than as the beer finishes you get a little more oak and vanilla.

The feel is very nice, very viscous and a very lasting taste.

The drinkability is nice, can’t really taste any of the alcohol.

Review of 07-06-2010.
Re-tasted at the brewery
- 08 kaggen vs 08 stormaktsporter, the stormkatsporter was the better by everyone.
-05 kaggen(first year of Kaggen) vs 05 stormaktspoter, the kaggen won this around. 
- Tried the 09 kaggen directly from the barrel. Its on Wild Turkey, only going to be about 800 bottles, this one is going to be special. Unreal vanilla already presenting, aroma is one of the best ever, taste still getting there but this will be awesome.
-06 version that was not barrel aged put into a glass bottle and just sat for 3 years, awesome vanilla notes on the front, beer itself is almost syrup lots of acid, a little tough to drink but interesting
- 08 kaggen that is 4 parts kaggen and 1 part smoked beer. This is not a commercial beer, made by the brewery for him and his friends. This was the best of the lot, unreal balance and totally amazing. They need to make this, it would hit top 5 easily so balanced with tons of vanilla, smoke, wood, and coffee. AWESOME. 

Each version is totally different, the 08 that I reviewed and gave a 4.55 is widely considered in Sweden as the worst batch. The 05 was clearly better than the 08, the variants were unreal. Everything about this beer is awesome, good variations, good story, super rare, and even better people-owners at the brewery.",4.9
513,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"06 bottle thanks to the wonderful folks at the ratebeer tasting at Flossmoor. I only rated this beer on a single sip but I am still thankful to have tried it. Pours very deep near black with a small tan head. Aroma of dark fruit, black licorice, cocoa powder, woody and very rich and strong roasty caramel characters. Flavor is extremely chocolatey, lots of vanilla, roasted nuts, and dark fruits, berries being dominant there. Nice creaminess to the body even in a small sip. Almost no carbonation as the bottle had been sitting for awhile. Good stuff, would love to try more one day",4.3
514,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle at the Bishops Arms in Malmö. Business trips can be so nice! Dark beer with a very thin deep brown head. The aroma had first something smokey, afterwards dark fruit, coffee and chocolate came through. Thanks to the very low carbonation, the same flavours came in very strong. A kind of chocolate bitterness at the end. Excellent balance and for sure one of the best beers I ever drunk.",4.5
515,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Rating #1500!  250ml bottle via trade, huge thanks to bierkoning.  2008 vintage, released in 2009.  Shared at a very small tasting with a few guys from BA.  This was really one of the defining moments in my beer drinking career.  Tried this next to regular Stormaktsporter.  This beer was everything I hoped it to be.  Insanely flavorful and complex, yet also subtle.

So from what I understand, ""kaggen"" is approximately Swedish for ""barrel aged.""  So if I ever make it to Sweden and go to a beer bar there, I’ll have to tell them to give me something kaggen.  I wonder what the Swedish equivalent of ""-bal aged"" is.  Maybe ""-kan"" or something.  Yeah that sounds right.

Phenomenal appearance.  Looks almost exactly the same as it’s non ""-kan"" brother - pours darkest brown, not quite black, with a creamy tan head that settles over time, eventually leaving smooth thin foam and swirls in the beer.

So much going on in the aroma.  Very complex and intense yet nothing overpowers.  Roast, chocolate, caramel, anise, dark fruits, tobacco, and wildflower honey.  Definitely some barrel notes as well: oak, vanilla, and whiskey.

Flavor is similarly complex and amazing.  Tastes even better than it smells.  Just the perfect level of sweetness with caramel, chocolate, toffee, dark fruits (raisin, plum, date), vanilla, herbal and floral notes, tobacco, oak, leather, well-integrated whiskey, and maybe even some hops.  Slight floral notes and a little smoke.  It’s amazing how many flavors they pack into this beer.  It’s subtle and balanced a la Kate the Great rather than in your face a la Black Tuesday.  It’s on a whole other level from Kate though, really putting almost all competitors to shame.

Very smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel with medium-full body and an incredibly long finish.  Not at all cloying or syrupy or boozy.  So this is called an imperial stout, but feels more like a baltic porter in my opinion.  A really, really awesome baltic porter.

Overall, just a flat-out amazing beer.  The drinkability is insane for what it is, and it’s almost tragic how small of a bottle this comes in.",4.8
516,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,Wonderful taste and palate! The taste lingers on for minutes and changes charachter during this time! A great experience!,4.9
517,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Enjoyed a 2006 vintage at the Flossmoor Station RB tasting, 1/16/2010:  It poured a thick, dark brown opaque body with a smallish tan head.

A treat, to be sure.",4.0

Anyway, Pours a very dark brown color with a medium beige head floating on top. A sweet cocoa nose, dark fruit, huge burnt molasses- very nice. A wonderful flavor; massive roasted molasses, caramel, dark fruit, juicy and yet somehow loads of dry chocolate and cocoa. Very smooth, actually no heat at all- the smoothest beer at 10% ever made I’m sure. Reminded me of a aged Expedition Stout- and that is a massive compliment. Awesome.

522,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"What Hell was this beer?? Thank you so much Omhper for this Beer!!  I have no idea how to reward you after that! Very dark color, with an amazing beige head that keeps a thin layer until finish. Aroma is too much complex because change every minute. I let at a nice temperature, around 8 to 12ºc and the aroma changed.start with Roasted malt, chocolate, coffe, some vanilla and a little bit  bit of alcohol, but after some minutes I could feel some berry fruits as well.  Flavor is outstanding. You can feel each item of the aroma while you drink. Is good even the alcohol but I use to not like to feel alcohol in some kind of nice beers like that. Aftertaste is loooong and you can feel the mix of flavors. Like some bitter coffee and berry fruit that let a sweet sensation. That beer really surprised me. Now I’m felling some toffee at finish.. Wonderfull!!  Thank you very very much Omhper for this gift!",4.7
523,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Wow.  I guess I was in the right place at the right time.  Huge thanks to beernbourbon for cracking this open at the chicagoland ratebeer tasting. Thanks Vince-  Your kindness will not be easily forgotten.  




2006 bottle pours a deep brown with a small tan head.  THe aroma has smoke, dusty cocoa, chocolate, and a nice vanilla nuttiness to it.  Flavor  of  bourbon, earth, some light fig like dark fruits.  Quite smooth and drinkable.  The alcohol is an afterthought.  Could have gone for a slightly bigger body.  Nothing about this beer pounds you over the head.  It is a nice subtle, tasty mixture, of chocolate, toast, roast, nuts, smoke, fruit, and barrel that blend together marvelously and leave you dying for more.  Quite a good beer, just wish I had a couple growlers of this. Thanks again Vince for sharing!",4.3
524,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 vintage.

Pitch black, opaque and viscous. A couple of centimeters of beige head settles into some lacings.

The smell is wonderful. Sweet roasted malts with very smooth bourbon notes, oak, lots of dark chocolate and some dark fruits. Pleasant vanilla aromas and honey. The alcohol is noticeable, but well integrated. A gentle barrel-aged character. The smell is very complex and perfectly layered, everything is in its right place.

The taste lives up to my high expectations. All the great flavors of an oak-aged imperial stout are present, but presented in a way few if any other beers I have sampled can match. Lovely sweet and thick malts with a prominent yet subtle roasted character. Lots of chocolate and fudge, and notes of dark fruit. The bourbon flavors gather momentum in the middle and delivers big notes of vanilla and some almonds. Honey, burnt sugar and molasses add another sweet layer to this incredibly complex beer. The very long finish is outstanding with some bitterness, warming alcohol, notes of licorice, boozy raisins, roasted malts and everlasting bourbon notes. The flavors in the mouth is really great, but the finish is just unbelievable - truly amazing.

Full-bodied, thick and creamy. The carbonation livens up the beer and does a great job at spreading all the flavors in the mouth.

This is really as good as the rumor has it. It’s tasty, complex and amazingly balanced. But the pièce de résistance is the tight fit between the flavors and aromas, and the way they present themselves in a perfect flow without any cracks. From start to finish, there isn’t anything that seems out of place, nothing ought to have been done in another way.

Flavour has nice complexity, a fair bit of which I’m sure is contributed by the oak barrels.  Has a woodiness and vanilla in tastein addition to the more traditonal flavours of coffee, and chocolate.

541,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Many thanks to StFun for sharing this most sought after brew and tjthresh for hosting this last moment tasting, 2007 version: 

Opaque with oily tears, a bit more carbonation than the ""regular"" Stormaktsporter. The aroma has note of cavendish pipe tobacco, vanilla, liquorice, plum, fig, espresso, wood, and a hint of peat moss. The taste is dark fruit and rich tobacco with a surprising touch of sourness, Smoky and peaty undertones before the coffee bitterness. A constant mocha and vanilla vein runs throughout the brew. The mouth feel is a tad thinner than the ""regular"" version but a bit more carbonation makes up for it. Big fruity and twangy tones with a hint of wild funk makes it more complex than the non-Kaggen version but at the same time it is slightly less wonderful. Still I would love another chance to taste this again. 

 Think of this comparison... a great steak is a great steak, I am comparing grade A prime Filet Mignon to grade A prime Porterhouse. Both are wonderful and worthy of the praise.",4.2
542,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"This has been on my wantlist for years. I had the luck to try the 2007 and 2008 Kaggen on draft at the Stockholm Beer and Whisky fest, alongside draft Stormaktsporter from 2008 and 2007, and bottled Stormaktsporter from 2006. The 2007 Kaggen was my favorite of the bunch, it was a bit better rounded than the 2008.  
 

Pours very deep brown, nearly opaque, capped with a thin brown head. Beautiful lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, oak and perhaps a bit of honey. Flavor begins with roasted chocolate malt, coffee, licorice, and molasses, with oak and charcoal in the background. Hop bitterness builds a bit towards the finish, and remain on the palate along with dark chocolate. Some alcohol in the finish as well. The body is a bit thinner than I expected. I’m glad I finally got to try this; especially in the vertical/horizontal with the Stormaktsporter. I enjoyed this and wouldn’t pass it up if I encountered it again.",4.4

Finish is superb as well, onctuous malts with barrel/wood and a warming alcohol coats the palate.

4/25/2009:  Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter had a touch act to follow behind the Kuhnhenn Fifth Dementia, but it still held it’s own very well (although it might have seems a little bit more bitter than it really is due to the massive sweetness of the preceeding beer!).  Kaggen Stormaktsporter has a rich, deeply caramelized, and chocolate flavor.  Coffee comes through when it gets warmer.  Actually, this beer is very similar in intensity to the Fifth Dimensia with more hops and bitterness.  There are  also great sweet char and licorice characteristcs present in the flavor of this beer.  To be honest, this beer really does have just about all of the flavors I would want in a great Imperial Stout plus enough alochol to back it up without being too much.  This is a damn fine and goes down far to easily!



Sample from bottle shared by at Dark Lord Day 2009!  Thank you so very much Craig.  This is really one of those beers that I would probably never been able to try at any time in my life had it not beed for your kindness and generosity.  I really appreciate it!  Rating #255 for this beer.",4.3

Poured a very black pour, with small brownish head that clings to the glass. Pitch black, opaque. Aromas hit me like a ton of bricks, chocolate and caramel dance with some creaminess and vanilla that smooths it out, a touch of wood as this brew starts to get out of control. Initial is a wonderful mix, alcohol comes in more potent as a wave of chocolate and espresso soak up on the palate. Caramel and vanilla come into play, a touch of pit fruits, and the barrel becomes clearly evident further into the body. My only qualm would be a little thin on the palate, but that would just be nitpicking. Finish leaves a good bitterness, oak, and roasted flavors. Top notch brew. Thanks again, Craig!",4.5

Thank you Bonus Beer Bob for the chance to try this incredibly rare beer.  While I’ve had it once before, this was the only time I’ve had more than a couple of sips, and enough to properly wrap my head around the beer.  Thanks dude.



Pours a thick, viscous, oily black.  Tan, creamy head.  Beautiful.

Chocolate, honey, creamy espresso in the smell.  Notes of brown sugar and vanilla.  Complex.  Wonderful.  Inviting.

Huge, rich, creamy chocolate, brown sugar, tobacco, dark fruits, oak all slowly unveil themselves in the taste.  Caramel and vanilla notes.  Honey carries through from the smell as well and provides a very nice, unique note in this beer.

Super rich, super creamy mouthfeel with virtually no alcohol heat.  Excellent.

Extremely drinkable.  



Every once in a while, a beer lives up to the hype.  This is one of those.  Incredibly complex, with layers of complexity that are slowly peeled back, sip after sip.  All this, and no noticeable flaws to dampen the enjoyment.  Awesome beer.  Keg for my home, please?  Ha, I wish.  So, in summary, this beer sucks.  Don’t seek it out.  Avoid at all costs.  /sarcasm.",4.8
568,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 edition. Served at about 45 degrees fahrenheit in 13-ounce snifter. Pours an oily dark brown with just a little lacing on top. Aroma is very complex: Coffee, berries, other dark fruits... Smells really good. Flavor is quite similar to the aroma. Not as sweet as the average impy, but there’s definitely a little sweetness. Only slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is quite oily, I like the sticky, thick viscosity. A nice warmth develops in my chest after a few minutes and lingers. The flavor I can’t give anything but a 10 because it really is super delicious, though very unique. I guess you could say that this is quite ""elegant"". Very classy; It is really a big beer that at the same time is very graceful and not at all assailing. Overall, world-class, though perhaps a little overhyped. I mean, it’s just wonderful, but the margin by which this is better than other top-notch impys isn’t that great. Nevertheless I’m glad I got a chance to try it. Bravo...Thanks Narke.",4.5
569,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Deep black in colour with a thin tan head and light lacing.  The aroma is of vanilla, bourbon, roasted malts, some alcohol but all the while rather sweet.  The flavour is warming, quite sweet, creamy, vanilla, roasted malts and some oak.  Warm and sweet mouthfeel, medium/large body, medium carbonation.  Finishes long, warming and quite bitter.


This intensified more and more as I drank this.  The alcohol is quite warm at time and the chocolate picks up at the end.  Initially I really didn’t care all that much for this.  My initial rating was a 3.6 but the more I drank this the more flavours came out.  Lots of smoke started to come out as did some oak.  The body starts to intensify as it warms as well and the mouthfeel became really silky.  Very good, world class.

More chocolate and dark fruit and even some whiskey and smoked flavours are introduced. I wish I had a greater vocabulary to describe this. Has it been mentioned before that is an extraordinarily complex beer. Now I’m just rambling on. I’ve never had a beer this smooth, it’s ridiculous. An oily silky smooth mouthfeel. Warm finish and brilliantly balanced. Perfection.",5.0

580,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Thanks to BrianK for sharing.  Pours a deep dark black velvet with metallicy bronze hints as the light hits it with a shimmering deep brown head which lasts very well and has nice lace.  Aroma is oak and vanilla upfrotn but not in your face or over teh top buttery like some others- more clean and refined than most BA beers, light bourbon and caramel as well whcih mix well with the deep dark chocolate malts, and fruity fig-like esters- hints of espresso, vanilla dn a bit of licorice as well..  Flavor is also loaded up with big sweet chocolate malts, more bourbon and oak, more vanilla ( almost a Charleston Chew candy like character) on the flavor turns more to licorice, leather then a nice earthiness (burlap sack and cedar cigar box) along with more coffee and roast in the end with a perfect bitterness.  Smooth slightly oily palate with lingering caramelized reduction of brown sugar and port. Awesome!",4.6
581,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Skillfully produced beer.  At first the oak-barrels came through a little too much, but after just 10 minutes sitting around the smoothness and complexities really shown through.  All in all a top notch brew I wish I could get more of.",4.5
582,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle thanks to Omhper, I’m very grateful to you man!
Appearance: dark color. Beautiful brown head, medium size, lasting and dense.
Aroma: intensive chocolate and a sweet roast malty. After, a lot of aromatic reminiscences like pure cacao, coffee-grains, truffles, oak wood, ripe fruits, vanilla and milk cream.
Flavor: start with a robust and multidimensional chocolate taste, is like to chew a chocolate-marzipan cake or a mousse of chocolate. Roasted malty some astringent. Intensives and complex reminiscences like liquory truffles, wood, toasted hazelnuts, candy blackberries, figs, dark raisins, ""sweet of milk"", maybe cinnamon, chocolaty tobacco, cream and liquor hints similar to Porto wine, woody whisky and coffee liquor. In the end I can feel a light dryness from the hops. Hidden alcohol degree.
Palate: coating the tongue and all the mouth, full body, creamy and oily texture, fleshy. Low carbonation.
Remark: amazing beer in all dimensions, very complex, good barrel background, intensive beer but balanced at the same time. A lovely shock for my palate.",4.6

584,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 Vintage bottle from MaltOMeal at the December Houston tasting.  There are beers that fall short of hype, there are beers that meet the hype, and then there is Narke Kaggen Stormaktsporter, which annihilates the hype and then kicks its butt again.  This beer is almost flawless; from the pouring of the motor- oil-in-a-black-hole-tinted liquid to the final sip of bourbon barrel soaked chocolate syrup, this beer blows most others out of the stratosphere.  The nose is a symphony of bourbon oak, chocolate, woody sugar, and molasses. As I said before, this beer pours as dark as motor oil in a black hole.  Darth Vader looks downright pale compared to this beauty.  A waterfall of flavors tickle the taste buds with each precious sip, notably the aforementioned chocolate syrup seemingly poured from a bourbon cask after maturing for 30 years, with a stark dark fruit presence that rounds out the experience.  Mouthfeel is downright pudding-like; chewy, thick, and heavy.  I did not want this taste experience to end.",4.9
585,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"bottle thanks to anders37.  This was #1 on my wantlist all year long and had it as one of my New Years resolutions to try this.  This poured pitch black with a very tiny, light brown head.  Nose was of roast malt and oak with some bourbon.  As it warmed, the aromas enhanced to include some coffee and chocolate.  Taste was incredible.  Delicious chocolate, fruit, vanilla and bourbon.  The texture was chewy, yet there was no harshness here.  Slight alcohol warmth.  Very complex.  This was the best tasting beer I have ever had, by far.  Truly fantastic.  Give me a supply of these and I would never drink anything else again.  The perfect beer.",4.9

Lived up to all the promises.",4.9
588,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Huge thanks to pilsnerpeter for the chance to try this one.  Deep pitch black beer with a thin creamy dark brown head.  The aroma is incredibly intense.  Very rich dark 80% chocolate, tootsie roll character.  Black licorice and a very interesting herbal/cocoa aroma.  As it warms it gets a little bit muddy.  The flavour is fairly boozy.  Soft peppery spiciness, a touch of pine and even a light earthiness.  Not really tart per se, but there is a lightness that is quite unusual for an impy.  It’s big and slightly sweet but it isn’t syrupy.  Light sage like herbal character.  Man, this stuff is very tasty and very unique.  Fairly savoury character with a lingering roastiness.  Man, this stuff is so good.  A lightly pruny sweetness as it warms up... awesome stuff.",4.5

Roasty flavor up front with smooth creamy center and sweet bitter dry finish.

This is the best beer I have ever had. 

Jet black. Brunt tan, dense, creamy, thick head. Huge roast, chocolate, plum, vanilla nose. Creamy body just a little higher than medium. Roast, chocolate, oak, plum, and vanilla on the mid-palate. Long backing chocolate finish. Some beers just live up to the hype that surrounds them, even if the hype is huge. This is definitely one of them.",4.7

He enjoyed it as did I though his gf of the time did not. I am always amazed when a beer is so praised and I find that I agree. Much easier for me to say """"naaah"""". But this had a velvey texture and abunndance of flavor - bitter sweet. roasy - so much that a drunken guy can’t quite convey.

Huge tarry nose with lots of licorice/anisette boozy notes, but smooth. Salty dark chocolate is evident as well. Slick and peppery on the palate. Boozy and warming but not sweet or cloying. Has a a lot of licorice flavors and anisette-like qualities, but not overly sweet. Some molasses notes and peppery phenolics come through with a piny character (not piny as in hops) and lots of rich smooth coffee roast later on. There’s also a burnt marshmallow flavor which describes the smooth tasty sweetness and charred character. Unique and tasty. Has some subtleties that make it stand out from other barrel-aged giants.

The moutharoma is again filled with all kinds of delicious deserts. Caramel fudge being the one in my mind the most. nice to have a sweetness this complex that isnt caused by suger alone.

Tasted at the first, great, Borefts Beer Festival 2009 @ De Molen. Ttried the 2007 and 2008 versions. The 2007 edition is a bit better then the 2008 version, but both are superb beers.

Unfortunately, few are afforded that luxury. Very smooth and subtle in all regards, light roasty coal, chalk, and a bit of alcohol. Flavor is deep, with pure imperial stout notes and a nice aged character... some oxidation and sherry. The honey really balances this out. There is a bit of booziness here, no doubt. A great drinker, I’d love to have more, and while this is a fantastic beer, I can’t say this is the best imperial stout. Still, very very good.",4.1
632,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Finally got to try this, very hyped, beer and for an affordable price at 30USD for a, approx, 8.5oz bottle :-)

Appearance: Dark dark dark red with a creamy beige head.

Aroma: Oak, Vanilla, Honey, Portwine, Fruit

Flavor: Bitter chocolate, Vanilla, Cream, Brown sugar, Cherries.

Palate: Smooth as silk but liquid is very thick and creamy. Low carbonation.

This is, hands down, one of the best beers i’ve ever had the pleasure to sample. Very filling tho and sharing a small bottle among 2 people were just perfect. If you can ever get hold of this little beauty, do not hesitate. Highly recommended!",4.5

A great complex brew.  It didn’t blow me away like the first time i had speedway, but a damn good beer.",4.4
634,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 vintage courtesy of the unbelievable generosity of Ughsmash.  Many thanks for knocking out the last of the beers I most sought out.

Ah, Kaggen - how you have eluded me all this time.  So many perfect scores have been bestowed on you.  So many arguments have been fought over whether you are the best beer in the world.  Finally my time has come to evaluate all the hype and praise.

In a nutshell, if falls far short of expectations.  The aroma was very nice.  The excellence of barrel-aging was very evident in both the aroma and flavour.  This alone allows me to appreciate the high degree of skill that was involved in this process.  However, there was a stark lack of balance here with each flavour component seeming a bit disjointed from the others.  The body was also a tremendous letdown for me as I was expecting something quite....well, ""imperial"" in nature.  I got very ordinary and run-of-the-mill.  Nothing huge in regards to the viscosity.  Which is fine if there’s a multitude of complexity and refinement in the flavour as was evident in the original batch of black hole from Mikkeller, for example.  However, while there were some interesting vinous notes along with some nice use of specialty grains, it was all rather uninspiring.",3.9

Oh! Kaggen, if you leave me

Don’t ever leave me alone 

Alright, now to the ratings.  First the 2006 version.

Pours black with tan head.  Aroma is of roasted malts, honey, raisins and some rummy oak.  Way more dark fruits and alcohol than the 2005 version.  Taste is chocolate and raisins again, mixed ever so well.  Rather oily and slick mouthfeel.  Finish is somewhat boozy with more chocolate covered raisins.  Delightful stuff.  8/5/9/4/18

The rating I’m giving for this beer is for the 2005 bottle, because it was that freakin’ good.  Pours deep black with magically appearing tan head.  The aroma is heavenly; sweet chocolate, honey and the perfect amount of bourbon.  If someone could turn that into a candy, they’d strike it rich.  At first taste my thought was ""Liquid perfection.""  The maltiness is off the charts but in the best way possible.  Chocolate, caramel with light bourbon and vanilla touches make for a delightful experience.  Palate is oily, slick, and full.  Finish is predominantly chocolate and lingers almost forever.  If Rick James were still alive he’d say ""Kaggen’s a hell of a beer!""",5.0
646,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Aroma has definite vanilla and bourbon notes up front.  That gives way to some deep vinuous notes and bakers chocolate if you take your time.  An incredible aroma for sure.  The appearance is black with a deep brown head.  The palate is medium to full with carbonation that is just bordering on being too high.  The taste is deep chocolate, very thick roasted (almost burnt) malt.  Bitter chocolate and burnt coffee in the aftertaste.  Earthy and tobacco flavors throughout.  Just a bit of alcohol in the flavor, but not nearly what you would expect for 10%.  Very strong flavor profile.",4.2
647,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Thanks to WeeHeavySD I finally got to try this before that bullshit Belgian Festival.  We should have just gotten more beer and stayed at the hotel.  Anyway, this lives up to the hype.  Dark and surprisingly sweet.  No alcohol detected.  Just sweet, syrupy stoutness that left a nice, silken, candy coating on the palate.  It must be a real pain in the ass to make this stuff because it’s pretty complex and you practically need to be fellating the brewer to get your hands on some.  But, ya know, dog bless the person ready to go through the trouble.  I rather enjoyed this ale.  You know how it is... sometimes you hear the hype and it’s usually mostly based upon how difficult the stuff is to get.  Then you try and and it’s pretty good, but not worth the hassle or the hype.  This actually fits into the category of worth the hassle and the hype.  Nice.",4.2

653,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"New Rating: 9/5/8/3/17 = 4.2  2008 bottle.  Much bigger sample this time.  Consumed in August 2010 immediately after regular Stormaktsporter.  A virtually black body props up a thick and frothy head of mocha colored foam.  Settling to a pronounced, bubbly edge, the head leaves scattered spots and organic splotches of lacing on the glass.  The nose is pretty damn nice, showing rich notes of dark chocolate, scorched caramel, and black strap molasses, with an overtone of slightly smoky whiskey and oak char.  Dark fruits, most likely fig, brood within, along with hints of sweet pipe tobacco.  It seems a bit less earthy than the regular Stormaktsporter, no doubt a result of the barrel influence taking precedence over hops.  Flavors are nice, but not as complex as the regular version.  The whiskey again seems to overtake underlying subtleties, replacing them with a velvety smooth vanilla character and soft barrel char.  Caramel and chocolate are at near perfect richness, towing the line between sweet and earthy.  The palate is substantial, though it is thinned a bit and warm with alcohol.  Carbonation is noticeably softer than that of the base version, which is welcomed.  Overall, it’s a mighty fine imperial stout, but there’s not a doubt in my mind that I overrated on my first go-round, as have many others.

Original rating: 10/5/9/4/18 = 4.6  2006 bottle, courtesy hopscotch.  Thanks so much Eric!   Pours a dark chocolate brown body.  Pure liquid fudge at the deepest point, glowing golden brown at the edge.  A swirly tan head with a bubbly edge forms the crown.  There’s no lacing to be found, but a tilt of the glass reveals thick, sugary legs the slowly meander back to the body.  The aroma is nothing short of astounding.  Melted dark chocolate and caramel are rich and decadent.  Figs, cinnamon, and nutmeg add fruity and spicy highlights.  Oaky bourbon and vanilla permeate everything, imparting the signature aroma of something that has been hibernating in a barrel for ages.  The flavor is nearly as great.  Fudge brownies drizzled with caramel come to mind.  Bourbon soaked figs provide further complexity and depth, while candy licorice hints at a light smokiness.  The body is medium-full, slick, and creamy.  Finishes long and chocolaty, with the faintest hint of alcohol burn.  Phenominal, world-class brew.",4.2
654,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Courtesy hopscotch.  Thanks a ton for sharing Eric!  Pours black with dark brown edges, and a swirly light brown head.  Smells of sweet caramel, bourbon, light vanilla and chocolate, and cocoa.  All blended together magically.  The flavor had a very thick mouthfeel, heavy on the palate.  Big bourbon, oak, chocolate, and black licorice made up most of its flavor characters as well as some dark fruit poking out towards the finish.  Alcohol was masked quite proficiently, as I only got a mild alcohol burn in the finish.  Beautifully crafted brew.  Can see why this is so sought after.",4.6
655,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Merritt Island Throwdown ’08: Bottle, courtesy hopscotch. Poured a dark muddy brown, with red highlights. Minimal white head. Decent wet lacing on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, tobacco, caramel...nice. There’s a slight booze-factor there, too, and an intriguing smokiness. Flavors of chocolate and caramel hit you first, with licorice and dark candy next. Brown sugar hits you late, and finishes on a spicy note. Full-bodied, and very sticky in the mouth. Creamy on the palate, and thoroughly enjoyable. Can’t say this is #2 in the world, though.",4.5

Chocolate flavourS - mix of milkchocolate and full black; rum, but a better kind than I’ve ever tasted; surprisingly sweet, with a vanilla icecream touch, plus a good dot of moccha  icecream.  Dark rock candi sugar, very little wood, but lots of ethanol & higher alcohols. Liquid black chocolate on rumliqueur. WITH raisins drenched in honey. Utterly viscous, slick as none, soothing best bar none.

662,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006. Been waiting for a while for this one. Dark milk and bitter chocolate, toasted vanilla initially on  the nose. Creamy peanut butter.

Roasted malt and toasted marshmallow on  the tongue initially.Bitter chocolate. Some dried vanilla, a touch of soy, peanut butter and an underlying fusel alcohol note that distracts from the overall essence of the beer. Viscous and chewy mouthfeel.

Flavors brings lots of bourbon influence again with vanilla and pistachio frostings; delicate and nuanced with coconut, sweet vegetables and wood.  Simple, straightforward, and laid back.  Meaty, sugary with wine impartation and mildy salty.  Palate is tinny and soft with tepid carbonation and a full, velvety texture.  Balanced; smooth, with some citrus sugars and honey-blended espresso in the finish.  Somewhat underwhelming, but irrefutably well made and delicately done.",3.8

Has a bit of a strange flavour for an imperial stout but it’s really fantastic. Full creamy and chewy body with a nice light feeling with the carbonation despite the coating ability of this thicker stout. Missing is the sometimes annoying charred bitter and astringent malt character, surprising given the coffee flavour towards the end. Finishes out with chocolate and a bit of soy. Really well done and a very good stout.",4.3

It survived the trip from Denmark to the US but after being stopped at customs it was sent right back.  The owner of the beer was nice enough to send it back again but it didn’t make it back unharmed.  Some of the beer had leaked out of the bottle and also losing the carbonation and tasting a little oxidized.  I had a few extra points to the overall score just because of this but the intense flavors were still there even if there wasn’t a head or a larger/creamier/more carbonated body.  2006 Vintage.  Dark opaque black body with no carbonation, this beer looks literally as thick and creamy as motor oil.  Aroma is dark chocolate malt, some bourbon (very faint vanilla), very well balanced none the less, some toffee and dark fruit, enjoyable.  Flavor is soy sauce (most likely due to the oxidation) dark chocoate, coffee, subtle hops, once again subtle bourbon, the delcious flavor even outscores the soy.  Medium body and no carbonation.

The beer pours out a thick, viscuous liquid, almostly looking like the consistancy of flowing blood it was that thick. A creamy one finger thick brown head which stayed the entire length of my enjoyment. Aroma...where to start. Dark chocolate, bourbon, soy sauce, alcohol, nougat, licorice, dark fruit, espresso beans, and lightly smokey somehow. Mouthfeel is monstrously huge. Coating your entire mouth would do it right. Flavors had nearly the same character as the aroma with a finish that was long and intense. The next time I have this beer I will worry less about deconstructing it and more about enjoying it.",4.5

The head is brown, dissipates fast but laces a bit. Caramel, alcohol and very dark, bready malts on the aroma. Smoky caramel and dark, dark smooth malts in the flavour.

Incredibly smooth and full it reminds me of an LBV port but with less fruitiness, of course. As I got further into it I noticed more oak and black(?) bread.

It’s a beer to be enjoyed slowly for sure. I split the (small) bottle with my heterosexual life partner who was probably even more impressed then I with this remarkably crafted beer.

I’m hard pressed to remember a more complex beer than this one. There are endless layer and each sip is a journey. It’s not my favourite of the style (I’m not sure what beer is anyway) but it displays such craft and shows what can be done with ""mere"" malts and hops.",4.6
676,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"1000th Rating.  God damn this has been a long time coming.  Via trade with Magic_Dave6, thanks dude.  I’ve wanted to drink this for a long time but knew it had to wait for 1000.  And it seems to have been worth the wait.  This is the 2006 vintage and it pours a beautiful deep deep black with a light brown  head that started frothy and faded to a kind of island.  Nose is huge with notes of chocolate, coffee, and some roasty malts, it’s a damn big nose, speedway has a big nose, peche mortel has a big nose, this nose seems bigger to me, maybe its the moment that is taking over my sense but I’m not sure, it smells pretty damn good.  Taste is pretty damn nice as well, it’s chocolaty, smooth, with bits of coffee and malt and toasted roasted malts.  There is a lot going on here, right now I’ve got a nice coffee bean aftertaste going but the actual taste is pretty diverse and damn fine.  This is pretty damn stellar, and I think I may have to rate it above speedway, I know I know, but its damn good, its damn near perfect.  What a beer to rate for number 1000, it was 1st when I traded for it, and now its 2nd, hopefully soon to be first again.

Already much lighter than what I expected from what was purported to be an imperial stout.  Rich sweet aroma of dark bittersweet chocolate, butterscotch, and brown sugar.  Taste is sweet chocolate, a bit of woodiness, and some floral essences in alcohol, finishing more towards roasted coffee.  Although the alcohol is present, this does not taste like a 10% beer at all, as the flavors and the body almost have a delicate feel to them.  Very nice combination of bitter and sweet leads me to think that this would be an excellent dessert beer.  What Dark Lord gets right in being big, this beer does in being refined.  Though I could not call it a stout, I would say it is arguably the finest porter I’ve ever tasted.

Smells of fruit, spices, chocolate, hints of oak and cherries, boozy in a complimentary way, caramel.  Tastes of chocolate, dark fruit, hints of warming alcohol, lots of burnt coffee hints, caramel, dry oak, charcoal.  Mouthfeel is oily and slick and the finish on ths one yields a nice oak character.

Fantastic, sweet flavor with a huge taste of chocolate, toffee, vanilla, honey, etc. Now I can die happy.



Bottle at Bishops Arms, Karlstad, Sweden, 2008/05/17. I had this beer a second time. Sadly it happened to be Bishops last bottle (2006 version). Did I ""hype"" this brew the first time? Hell no! It was bloody amazing again. The beer is extremely well-balanced. Aroma is amazing... I could smell this all day long. Wonderful chocolate and vanilla aromas here. Flavour of chocolate, caramel, toffe, honey and vanilla, exactly as I remembered it. It also had som plesant fruity notes, as far as I remembered. Mothfeel was thick, creamy and smooth. If I was honored to have this once, having it twice was far beyond my own imagination. Hopefully I find it again someday, but one can’t be sure about that.",5.0

693,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"First off, a huge thanks to wetherel for sharing this gem at the PP Bottle Shop with myself, deftim13, Sean & Ryan of the shop, and DenverLogan! All you need is just a tiny serving of this concoction to know it’s something truly special. It pours a still silky black-brown with some light beige swirls on the surface. The aroma is more subtle than the flavor, but a delightful mix of old oak wood, bourbon, cocoa powder and vanilla. The nose increases with warmth into a more warming character of well-rounded bourbon, molasses, soft espresso and alcohol...but not too strong by any means. The flavor extracts the aroma notes and multiplies them to another level entirely. I tasted coconut with chocolate, medium coffee and brown sugar with plenty of oak mixed in. Extremely well-balanced and complex, with the alcohol subdued fantastically. I wouldn’t know this was 10% upon tasting if not for the label. Finishes smooth with incredible mouthfeel. This is one of my favorite styles of beer. It lives up to the hype in my book, a magnificent beer for my #300 rating.",4.7

A hint of bourbon barrel, but it’s not overpowering.  Great mouthfeel.  Medium to heavy body.  A little bit of sting on the tongue, probably from the alcohol, which is well hidden.  Some sweet brown sugar flavor.   Low carbonation, but a beer of this magnitude doesn’t need much.  4.5-4.6.

Pours pitch black with a lovely creamy tan head that maintains a thin but complete covering, minimal lacing.  Aroma gets your attention and throws a lot at you - first with the oaky bourbon, and then a host of others come into play - dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, molasses and dark fruits are all present, creating a wonderful aromatic blend on the nose.  While it strongly becons for a taste, wow that aroma is filling and grand to ponder!  Finally moving past the aroma reveals that absolutely everything from the aroma blends together in a near perfect harmony.  The first sip tells me that this single 8.5oz. bottle is just not going to be enough to satisfy what its started, so I better enjoy this for all its worth.

The drink poured the colour of black treacle with a small beige head, and as I lift it to my lips once again a fury of thunderous claps swirls around. An infuriated Thor was riding his chariot across the storm clouds that were gathered menacingly across Otmoor and wielding his mighty hammer mjollnir. Without delay I sipped this brew as streaks of bright white light flashed all around, the aroma was honey, finest cocoa, and dark sticky fruits, the taste was sumptuous, filling, rich and simply stunning, it was like a cadbury’s flake moment, the taste of marshmallows dipped in the finest chocolate and left to drip all over your hand vanilla, figs and dark sugars make up some of the other flavours. The crackles and bangs continue outside, Thor is busy tonight but I sip again, the full range of flavours literally beats my tastebuds into submission, its almost numb with this full flavoured onslaught. I head outside to greet the mighty Thor with my chalice held high, the cracks and flashes continue to surround me, next doors firework display was quite something and more than served it’s purpose not just for them this evening.

My views on this beer are very much like that of Westvleteren 12 now, its still a great beer but its either not as good as I recall from the first taste or my in this case maybe my palate has changed, whatever its not quite worthy of a 4.7 any longer. In the mouth its is still gloriously smooth and silky and there is a wonderful richness of flavour and such great depth, the smooth creamy chocolate and dark sugars still show but for me like a great many things its not as good as the first time, still great though.

702,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Secret Santa hooked this one up!!!  The dilemma is this, I have convinced myself that this is indeed going to be the singular greatest beer I have yet to consume, causing me to ponder if this will actually live up to the billing.  Upon pouring, my heart races a bit.  A nearly completely light obliterating black, the only glimmer of color is the faintest brown, trying to escape around the edges.  The aromas coming forth are an opus of complexity, the likes of which are rarely attained.  Oak, vanilla, roasted malts, smoke, Valhrona Chocolate, the sugar crust of a creme brulee, Black Mission Figs, date syrup, plums all make their presence known.  Waves of olfactory pleasure engulf my psyche, pulling in more inward into a contemplative state.  I continue to inhale, wondering how this is possible.  The flavor is other worldly.  The roasted flavor is the first to makes its presence known.  As I continue, a light brown caramel teases the senses, sublimely yielding to a playful balance of oak, vanilla and Italian meringue, though ever so slightly.  The warming alcohol finishes what in essence is the brewer’s tour de force.  Perhaps it is not simply brewing, but is rather alchemy, transforming simple ingredients into a master piece.",4.8
703,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Huge thanks to TheCheeseMan for sharing this one with me. 2006.

But mainly hot alcohol. Taste and palate is sweet, chocolate, no roastiness, very little, if any hops. Some vanilla and wood I imagine. Perhaps this was still a bit young, but with a beer this rare, who can afford to wait.. (seeing how it’s only available in pubs in Sweden). So.. best beer in the world? No way. Really good -yes! This beer however, is very malt dominated, there’s not much else going on here.. Maybe I’m blasphemeing.. but I think anyone can make this beer. Severly hyped because it’s so rare.

Intensely sweet, syrupy aroma: tons of nougat and dark chocolate and a hint of licorice; the barrel presence is just enough: slightly tart, toasty bourbon and well-roasted; nothing harsh.  Very woody, toasted oak and cedar upfront; excellent bourbon character: mildest sour-mash quality (if at all) with loads of nougat and milk and dark chocolate; slightest roughness from the bourbon, but otherwise a generous, layered BA impy stout; the barrel itself seems to be the highlight here, and it would be interesting to try this alongside the regular Stormaktsporter.  The beer underneath seems to lack the density of something like BA Speedway or BA Blackout, and that’s the only setup for this beer; the barreling itself is beautifully done.

The aroma and flavor develop during the tasting and you can almost say you’re tasting a different beer in the end than in the beginning. Sweet aroma of raisins, prunes etc. A deep flavor of caramel malts and even some rancid fruit taste but in a good way. Also chocolate and honey come out in the flavor.

Soft palate structure, actually quite seamless, with a woody, spirity note that’s not really adding to the beer. The fruitcake, zinfandel-like flavour is ok but the disjointed flavours from the spirity note mess with my head.",3.6

The appearance is simply superb with nice lacing. Flavour of slight peated malts, dark chocolate, coffe mokka, raisin bread and a hint of honey leaves this beer in a perfect balance. The use of noble hops comes out just enough in the taste but not overwhelming. The slight bitter aftertaste with notes of basterd sugar keeps on talking while some alocohol is well noticable but not attacking. N° 1, IMO a well deserved place and certainly not overrated at all and after all a superb brew and some left to stash away for quite some time :-) Nice to notice too that I am the 100rd RBian who rates this excellent beer!",5.0

It has great aromas of mocca, black chocolate, sping flowers and orange boosems. All these fine hints are working well with the touches of honey, vanilla pods, fine toasted oak and delicate fruity sensations. The smell of fresh torrified coffee beans is not far away, it works so well with the caracteristics of the best roasted barley and some soft cara-malts. The taste is like the smell suggests, very intens and super elegant at the same time. The smooth mouthfeel is so refined and not heavey at all. Lots of fine coffee hints, black chocolate, vanilla, soft toasted oak, wild flowers, cammomille, honey, maple sirup, lots of cerials burnd raisins like in the baked crust of raisin bread. The beer has a great balance and a medium body with a super refined lingering afthertaste of hops and elegant and tasty bitters. I think this beer deserves to be the Nr 1 in the world.

The aroma just screams coconut, to the point of not much else getting through. So bourbony - it’s completely dominant. Piney, minty American hops mixed with coffee and chocolate in the US stout style underneath. Bourbon doesn’t affect the flavour nearly as much - no noticeable saltiness or booziness, which I appreciate, but I didn’t detect any oak character either. The barrel-aging doesn’t seem to have added much besides the rampant bourbon aroma, it’s more like an imperial stout with a shot of bourbon. And the thing is it just doesn’t taste like good bourbon either, it really reminded me of white label Jim Beam. I dunno. I mean, it’s quite a nice beer, but obviously you’re gonna have high expectations with a beer like this.

I’ve had this twice before at GBBF and at RBESG and both times I was blown away by it.  Serving temperature is very important.  Too cold and you lose a lot of depth of flavour.  Pours oily, clear dark brown.  Heathery aroma is quite distinct.  Lovely in mouth, but for me, the outstanding thing about this beer is the finish and is possibly the best finish I have tasted.  Breath taking.  It stops me in my tracks.  As it warms up, the beer opens up and the aroma and finish are truly sublime.  Gorgeous, lovely and I have another 2 bottles to hone my review.

Jet black, espresso head. Toffee liquorice vanilla aroma soft but very powerful. Mocca and whisky taste - again very powerful, but quite mellow. Whisky definitely dominates, quite alcoholic. Excellent sipping beer, not for glugging, that’s for sure. Looks like it’s been made to taste of whisky rather than to taste of wood that’s been steeped in whisky, or even to simply age itself. In retrospect, this isn’t vastly superior to any of the other whisky-laced beers, but as my first in the style I was very impressed by it.

726,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"The look: Black body with a tan ring of foam

The style: Woody barrel aged Imperial Stout

The stuff: Barrel harmoniously joined by bitter black chocolate and sweet milk chocolate.  Barrel is apparent indeed, very woody.  Roastiness level is somewhat low leaving room for the woody flavours.  Dried raisins concentrate but never vinous.  By the end the whole thing turns into a cake.  Sweet yet dry.  Great body.  The carbonation is appropriately very active making the beer more drinkable than it ought to be.  Initial opinion was a 4.3 but woke up the day after carving for more.  So this is ratebeer current #1 beer.  Hmmm… Amazing what rarity and a high price tag can do.  I was hoping for something more from the beer on top of the mountain.  I expected a new twist on the style, something different, something “out there”, you know, an experience.  It’s a great beer no doubt but it doesn’t break new grounds and I can think of a few very similar and in some cases superior beers that are much cheaper and easier to find.  Get drunk on that stuff and you’ll end-up as broke as the ten commandments.

The how: Back from Japan tasting at MartinT. Bottle from Rastacouere (a huge tank-you here)

A Mes rate: 2006 bottle shared in the private gardens at Dorset Square in Baker Street with the legendarily generous HogTownHarry.
 After lusting after this beer for some time all of a sudden I have had it 6 or 7 times. Possibly the beer I have drunk the most of without rating. (with the exception of possibly the Cantillon Blåbær.) I wanted to give it the respect it deserved and rate it with a totally fresh palate and that I did on a Thursday afternoon that was to be the beginning of a top 50 fest of beer rating thanks to Harry. Anyway... the beer.
It’s black. Totally black. No light penetration what-so-ever. A slight but solid brown head. Certainly the darkest coloured head I have seen in a long time. It’s more akin to chocolate ice cream.
Aroma is superbly roasty and full of amazing hops too. Peaty whiskey, outlandish malt, dark, dark chocolate and some lovely sugar and smoky hints. So incredibly nosable. I was appraoching half way through my glass while Harry was still sniffing at his!
Flavourwise it is not quite on the level of the aroma but still utterly stunning. Once again, incredible hops are balanced perfectly with the most unreal malt I have tasted. Beautiful rich dark chocolate ice cream, hints of tartness, spice, boozy peaty whiskey notes, utterly gorgeous lip smacking vanilla, viscous, oily and huge alcohol but oh so bloody good. Finish is of biblical proportions and just doesn’t stop. The light sting of alcohol reminds you that this is really serious stuff. Palate. Oh... my... f**king... GOD. Honestly it is unsurpassed by all I have tried previously. Totally unexpected carbonation that is so very good. Fizzes and zings around the mouth and prepares your palate so very well for the following rich velvet cream. Impossible to explain. It’s just stunning.
On the way to tipsy after half a bottle. Totally incredible beer. Having had this along side the regular Stormaktsporter I have to say that in all honesty it is hard to pick the winner between the two. Both are stunning but when geeking out and writing numbers the Kaggen just edges it. Oh, another thing, it has the best sediment of any beer ever, I’m convinced of that. I once drained every last drop of the sludge of three bottles into a glass and filled it halfway with water. It was STILL gorgeous. I kid you not. Right, that’s it. I’m off for a wank. I mean... erm... oh sod it.",4.8
729,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"My Bottom Line:

This coating Imperial Stout’s complex and portly malt profile spreads its heavy wings from vanilla realms to dark chocolate abodes, as a witty barrel apport and alcohol warming nearly balance out the wealthy grain bill.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-A ring of foam surrounds the pitch black with thin brown sleeves.

-Some cherry fruitiness is found within the sweet malt dominance.

-The roasted cereals are quite well developed and lend a cushiony mouthfeel.

-The bubbling is prickly yet soft, which helps drinkability.

-The malty and honeyed sweetness also emulates anisey licorice, and perhaps black beans (although subtly).

-The body on this one was thicker than Nogne O’s Dark Horizon, which sits at 16% abv.

-This is a fantastic example of the style, but I am not sure it has enough distinguishing features for me to choose it amongst my favorites of this tenebrous empire.



Bottles; thx David and François!",4.1
730,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle (250ml).  Shared by an astoundingly generous mes_and_sim - I can NOT thank you enough for this, Mes.  We sat in Dorset Square, a private park that was the original grounds for Lord’s Cricket Grounds, near Baker Street tube station - in two small wine glasses.  Off the top, this is THE best Impy Stout I’ve ever had - I could easily have gone 5.0.  Thick, oily b lack pour, with a solid long-lasting dark brown head.  Aroma - well, many things, almost overpowering, I sniffed it for at least 10 minutes before actually drinking any - perfect aromatherapy for a stoutie - deep, deep roast malt, molasses, tawny/crusty port, lush herbal hops, light lactose, coffee and chocolate, hints of lactose sourness, aged cabernet-franc wine .... one word:  wow.  The taste follows right on - vinous, oatmeal-y, the hops increase as you get down to the light sludge in the bottom of the bottle ....  hell, this is thick, silky, oily, and surprisingly carbonated, smooth long bitter/malty port-like finish and aftertaste.  Spectacular, not even a little bit overrated, I want more.  My last note was ""Holy fuck!""   Buddies for life, Mes - I take back anything I ever said about ManU!!",4.8

732,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"A really good beer... but not the best.
I tasted this before it was bottled and it’s a wham-bam-thank-you-mam-beer.",3.7
733,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle from the Bieres Sans Frontieres at the GBBF, so another thanks to Andy for getting this rare drop to England. (I met a guy from Sweden while I was at the bar who said he lived 30 miles from Närke Kulturbryggeri, and apart from one bottle at a beer bar, BSF was the only place he’d seen Kaggen for sale.)

And after all the anticipation, a pour for me, a pour for Traci, and we begin: Brown-highlighted black, lovely rusty crema-like foam. Aroma begins with a bright dose of dried fruit: raisins, moves to dates, then figs. Now a touch of muscovado sugar, now vanilla, bananas, cardamom. Underlying all that, a building dark chocolate awareness that several sniffs in takes charge. Then eventually is replaces by rum cake. Deep sustained high-cocoa content chocolate flavor--someone playing a ""chocolate"" note on a grand piano and holding down the pedal. Even a minute after a sip the chocolate coats in sticky bitterness. Vanilla sweetness that is tentatively present from the beginning begins to grow, but the iodine bitterness keeps if from getting sticky. 

This is such an interesting beer to beer to be #1. It’s certainly a big beer, but it’s one of the most subtle, refined Imperial Stouts I’ve tasted. It doesn’t surprise me at all that this is a recipe grown out of years and years of homebrewing—it tastes like every flavor has been subtly tweaked to exactly how the brewers wish.",4.4

738,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Rating number 1000. December 2006 25cl bottle. Pitch black with a thick, creamy and long lasting light brown head. Intense aroma, oak above all, with much vanilla character. Plums, dates and figs. Some alcohol gives it some bourbon after a while, and portwine is also in play. The flavour has all that barrel character plus the full blown impy stout richness. Rather sweet but balanced by some hops, the dark malt bitterness and some alcohol. As it enters the mouth, oak and vanilla dominates, then comes some fruityness along with warming alcohol, and perfection is reached with the long lasting black aftertaste of espresso, charcoal, licorice and dark chocolate that sits in the mouth for a long time.


Hyped beers demand extra concentration when drinking, which in turn may give a great beer an even better rating because I pick up all of its complexity - my first Westvleteren 12 took an hour to drink, and this will also last. But they are hyped because of their qualities in the first place, and this beer is worth all the attention.



Re-rate same batch, March 2010: Has held up perfectly. Still the same balanced and complex beer. I’m not regretting the 5.0

739,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"I have to keep my benefactor under wraps, per their request, but suffice to say it’s a them and I thank them profusely and promise to show my thanks very soon. This bottle is a 2006 vintage. 

The aroma is beef bouillon, soy, dark chocolate, burnt and roasted malts and marshmallows with faint porto notes. The beer pours a gloppy black and settles with a thinnish mocha head, but initially the head is finger thickness and creamy looking. 

The first sip is fairly boozy and the barrel aging is immediate and unmistakeable imparting vanilla, pineapple and coconut notes. I also get some nutty Maderia notes and gobs of dark chocolate. Fairly hot on the swallow with a cream and chocolate chaser. It almost tastes like a dark chocolate liqueur. The finish makes me think of a vanilla liqueur with faint nutty and chocolate notes that invoke german chocolate cake. A very enjoyable beer that is definitely not a product of hype or hysteria.

First off, I thought this really lived up to the hype.  It was flat out unbelievable - right in between the imperial stouts that need to be a bit bigger and those that go overboard...no matter how hard I tried to find something I didn’t like about it, I simply couldn’t - it was the definition of balanced.  Each sip was proceeded by a heart-felt ""WOW!"".  Every part of this brew was so insanely complex.  The aroma wrapped up vanilla, oak, dark chocolate malts, espresso, licorice, dark fruits, etc - I smelled it for who knows how long.  Flavor was exquisite - wrapping all those smells into a perfectly chewy and smooth palate.  Talk about wanting to lick your gums and lips.  The finish was balanced between sweet and bitter - the slight alcohol burn warmed but nowhere near overpowered anything.  Will I get my taste buds on this one again?  Let’s hope so.

Pitch black color with brown head. Mild aroma of roasted malt, with some soap (disappearing later), dust, apples, oak cask. Full bodied, the mouthfeel is round and smooth; dark chocolate flavor, very rich, with an accent of oak; it still has a respectable sweetness; there is some liquorice and tar; correct bitterness, with some more roastiness in the final, and pleasant alcohol warmth.
Tasted in parallel with the same vintage of ordinary Stormaktsporter, the Kaggen clearly holds up to the age much better.

2011-10-16, vintage 2006, 5 years old, 8-4-9-4-17=42
Black color, with medium sized brown head, not persistent. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, whiskey; nice but less impressive than it used to be. Round body, smooth mouthfeel, with excellent chocolate flavor, followed by pleasant whiskey booziness that (compared to the 5 years old unoaked Stormarktsporter) provides the edge that the fading bitterness cannot provide; also some liquorice, tobacco and tar. Warming alcoholic final.
Very good but declining.

2009-06-16, bottle at Glenfiddich Warehouse N.68, vintage 2007, 10-5-9-4-18=46
The bottle is served too cold.
Black color; the creamy head reduces quickly. At first it has a nice cheesy aroma; then liquorice and some roasted malts and ashes; it evolves as it gets warmer; very late, there are traces of vanilla and paper, tobacco, alcohol and very light paint remover. The cheese crust is the best part for this kind of beer.
Very good body strength, the mouthfeel is oily but not sticky, extremely smooth; possessive chocolate and roasted malt flavor, with a minimal sweetness to complement it; some vanilla appears only late, creating a dynamic effect; the liquorice too can’t miss this appointment; the subdued alcohol presence is vibrating. The final sensation in the mouth is still full, turning maybe too much on the roasted malts for my palate, but expected; and there is some pleasant espresso touch too, and tobacco.
Great!
I remembered a more complex brew.

This is the best imperial stout, and the best beer, that I have ever had. Perfect roast, some sweetness (I found it to become sweeter the longer I drank it), fruitiness, liquorice...and a long finish. The aroma, especially towards the end, was simply amazing. Basically, it was just an honor to be able to drink this and it may be some time before I find one that can surpass it.",4.9
755,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2005. The body is a scary opaque black, oily with a downward plummeting motion effect from the center outward, like it’s falling into itself. No head forms. Instead, small, piled-up clusters of thin-skinned bubbles flitter to the edges of the glass. The end result bears a distinct resemblance to boiling liquid, where the rising bubbles are restrained by a gelatinous coating that is plastered to the perimeter of the glass. Wow.

I spent half an hour nosing this. Every nuance is so rigid in its foundation and exacting limits, I became positive that I have never been so sure of exactly what I was sensing. A vinous aroma with wildly wrought notes that belie the whiskey barrel heritage broke down as follows...First press sugarcane-coated roasted malts lead the charge. Lightly floral alcohol is seemlessly integrated into the nose. Overripe, sunken-walled oranges and sun-kissed apples are next. The oaken scents resemble freshly splintered wood, imparting vanilla. Hints of Sumatran coffee wafting through a door in a mountain village (I really started to drift away with each successive inhalation). German chocolate cake made by someone with a penchant for adding twice the amount of liquor as the recipe called for. Rum notes, finally, that seemed to have scents identical to the esteemed Ron Zacapa Centenario.

The flavor showcases mild sweetness deftly counterbalanced by roasty bitterness and late drying from robust alcohol, the likes of which are now more easily discernable. The barrel aging time period appears to have been perfectly calculated for maximum enjoyment; it’s very balanced, not too much, nor too little, for a complimentary flavor addition. A subtle change in an ethereal flavor component takes place - what seemed like an amiable rum and chocolate cake combination in the aroma now tastes like rum cream. The finish is powerful and warming. Alcohol and vanilla linger. A very elegant finale. The palate is caressing and extremely full bodied without ever feeling overbearing. I love the way each part of my tongue and the sides of my cheeks are washed with flavor, then patted dry with alcohol and spicy tannins. 

I can’t adequately sum this up, but the numbers should sufficiently relay my experience.",4.6
756,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Alright, I had the chance to get a sample of that (2005)  in Copenhagen, then I tried the new 2007 version at Oliver twist a few weeks later and retried, some days after, the 2005 thanks to my very generous Göteborg hosts: Marsiblursi. First off, the regular Stormaktsporter is an excellent imperial stout and rather tough to beat in complexity. I don’t quite understand the purpose of setting it in a barrel. It is apparently a rather short journey that it takes (2,5months), yet the effect is considerable as bourbon is obvious in the nose, but the low duration has allowed the body to keep most of its thickness, silkiness and richness. 
 So what do I think about it? Well, first off, I prefered the 2005 version which is 1% lighter and more developped and rounded around the edges at this point. The 2007 is still a fair bit boozy. The 2005’s complexity is more obvious and the concentrated fruitiness from the regular comes across more naturally. Appearance-wise, they both wear a fair diminishing dark beige head. Totally opaque, oily body, pitch black. The 2007 actually left legs on the glass. Gentle alcohol flavours, rum-soaked grapes, heady nose with wild leather smokiness, mint, vanilla (strong), chocolate roastiness and hard to pick up single fruits. Complex nuances, age-worthy, silky full body with honeyed and brown sugar tones. Very creamy, smooth carbonation. it manages to feel quite vinous at the same time, full on truffles, earth mushrooms powderiness and growing date square undertones. You can eventually all kinds of little nuances, which is the sign of a great beer. Still, at the end, I’m not convinced I prefer the barrel version and remain unconvinced that the rarity does not make me try harder to pick out stuff. Certainly a fine experience though. I’ll just give both Stormakts the same score.. but it is a sipper and I’m less into those that I once was.",4.1

Some cola and soy sauce like notes could also be detected. You feel the warmth of alcohol but no evidence of alcohol over the palate. Full bodied with a smooth texture.

763,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2/8/07.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with omhper on RateBeer 12/11/06.  2005 Vintage.  I hate my glass.  Somehow it manages to present an entirely different (and worse) aroma of this beer than the delicious treat my friends’ glasses have shown.  So I’m combining the two into some sort of amalgam.  Starts briefly with a very raw acetone nose, some grapey and intense black rum-cake notes as well.  Fudge liqueur, boozier than the regular Stormaktsporter, and with some tangy wood-solvent in the nose that fades later.  Flavor is amazing, with rich ash-rum and black raisiny chewiness and some almost overpowering sweetness that just drops out with perfect elegance into a deep, dry, ashen and faintly cocoa-flavored trail-- grainy like a black-and-white, low-light photograph.  The flavor depth that these elite Scandinavian breweries somehow routinely extract from their malt bills is absolutely astounding.  Somewhat thinner, drier mouthfeel than its silky sister; fluffier and slightly more scratchy carbonation.  Tobacco all over the finish.  This is a fabulous beer and deserving of all the praise, but I still prefer it in its more drinkable state, untainted by the funnel of whiskey saturation.  Thanks so much, Per!",4.4
764,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2005 Vintage from Akkurat, Stockholm. 

Pours oily jet black, with a beautiful creamy brown head rising ever so slowly from the body. First note of the aroma was bourbon, and quite a lot of it, undertones of vanilla oak, bitter dark chocolate, rye bread, honey sweetness and a hint of smoke. It didn’t blow me away like I’d expected, but was very enjoyable nonetheless. To the first sip, the mouthful was so perfect, slick and heavy, but so smoothly carbonated. Sensational, exactly what I’d expect from a great Imperial Stout. 
Flavours of oak and vanilla run through the first impression, followed by a boozy rumminess, dark chocolate truffle, rye bread and some earthiness. From memory, this was quite different to the un-kaggen version in that it had a far more boozy flavour and finish to it, despite the lower abv. The finish is also quite bitter and smokey, in a stunning kind of way. 

Overall I’d say its approaching perfection, but probably not my favorite beer ever. Perhaps the un-kaggen version suited my palate better.",4.5

 2005 Vintage.  Poured a medium-viscocity, lovely shade of black with idyllic initial cap of creamy deep brown head.  The aroma had just a remarkable rich vinous and plum character that formed a perfect complement to the lightly-burnt dark chocolate and coffee malts at the core.. additional layers of complexity evolve throughout the drink, with vanilla, oak, and ever-so-slight bourbon in one wave, darker honey in another, and mild smoky caramel beyond that... just hard to fathom how so many wonderful components can be blended so intricately. 

 Semi-sweet honey accompanies the rich tapestry of dark chocolate and fresh coffee onto the palate.. a sweet wash of bourbon sugars and vanilla comes before the drink is halfway completed.. well-toasted caramel, smoky tobacco, and dark fruits blanket the back-end, then coffee and woodsy bitterness accent the warm and magnificent finish.  This falls between medium and heavily-bodied, with just enough carbonation to keep it moving.. the flavors wash over the proper taste buds with surgical precision.. the long, warm, vibrant finish leaves great satisfaction, save for the realization that this remarkable exilir may never touch my lips again.  Just brilliant!  

 2006 bottle thanks to Craig!  Poured rich, inky black with a great initial cap of tan head.  After a couple minutes to breathe, rich bourbon and vanilla really came to light.. layers of dark chocolate and roasty black patent malts.. mild smoke and some oak.. sweeter uptake at the back with mild alcohol.  Deeply-roasted dark chocolate and molasses roll elegantly onto the palate with trails of vanilla and some smokiness.. bourbon fills in the back and nasel passages.. thickens up toward the finish with roasty chocolate and mild coffee bitterness.. long, sweeter finish with a perfect blend of barrel and stout.  Thicker on the palate with light bitterness and great balance.. wonderfully complex. 10 4 9 4 18",4.8
766,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2005 vintage generously shared by cquiroga on 2/8/07: Pours an oily viscous opaque with mahogany edges and a thin ring of light brown head that almost turns the glass brown.  Has an amazing, big, complex dark fruity plum and raisin nose with lots of floral dark honey, some tobacco, and sweet caramel malt with good oaky vanilla bourbon notes throughout.  Body starts with a healthy dose of sweet dark caramel malt softly melding into bourbon toffee sprinkled with tobacco and dark chocolate with some bitter roasty notes toward the finish.  Has nice brown sugar and raisin flavors as well.  Nicely-balanced throughout and very drinkable, especially given the intense complexity.  Slightly sweeter and more viscous than the 2004 vintage regular version.  A great beer, very deserving of its ratings.  Thanks again to cquiroga for sharing!",4.6

Balance, balance, balance. Flavours are very well adjusted to each other. Medium to full bodied. Chocolate, spice and vanillasweetness mingles in the perfect end.

Extremely well balanced, the whiskey is very well integrated compared to other whiskey stouts I have had. Long roasted finish with a warming alcohol sensation. No doubt a very very fine beer, but since whiskey will never be my favorite it isn’t worlds best for me. But again, very fine indeed. HUUUUGE thanks to Rick Gordon for providing me with this extremely rare gem!
Rerate of 2006 batch. Not nearly as complex as the first batch and a lack of body as well imo. It’s not bad, but considering it is supposed to be the best in the world, this new batch dissapoints. Over hyped, I can name plenty of more interesting and complex beers.",4.0

774,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"From a 25cL Bottle, Vintage 2005.  
Pours an incredibly dense chocolatey black color, inpenetrable by light, with a silky foam of caramelized marshmellow floating lightly on top.  A gentle swirl leaves some nice lacing streaks on the sides of my snifter glass and is enough to keep the chocolate island atop alive and healthy.  To be honest, my meditations on the appearance of this brew were distracted by a sneak preview of the aroma, which immediately blew me away, making me feel all giddy while at the same time forgetting completely about the appearance of the beer.  For one who diligently tries to capture the art of every beer consumed by photograph, this was quite a feat, although sadly, I wish I had a picture now to remember this experience by.  Onward.  Thick, intoxicatingly rich bouquet thats brimming over with bourbon soaked prunes that have been flambeed with a decadent caramel crust. Some softer fruits linger as well, almost like banana (although not the phenolic kind) crusted with some flaked coconut and sticky wildflower honey.  Some very mild vanilla bean and gentle chocolate fudge rounds out the bouquet nicely.  Like with the non-barrel aged version, I find it exciting to be tasting a beer that relies mostly on the intricacies of its malt profile to form the complexity, rather than relying on the polarizing roast, char, and alpha hops characters that so many of the other highly rated beers on this site use to set themselves apart from their categorical peers.  On that same note, the barrel character seems to be playing a supporting role in this cast, rather than the lead.  Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  A massive wave of complexity confronts my taste buds as soon as palate contact is made.  It starts ot with an incredible dry chocolate base thats enhanced by the caramelly bourbon  notes without getting too hot.  There’s a smooth transition where some dark, chewy, leathery characters begin to come out, and these are accented by a touch of tartness taking the form of prune skin tannins.  The finish is a remarkable display of balance, as the toasty, oaky characters come through strong by dancing on the edge of roastiness.  The palate is exceptionally long and clean, with all alcohols clearly masked; excellent example of extracting the great barrel traits without leeching out any of the negative.  A masterpiece.  Thanks for sharing, Chris!",4.5
775,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle... This beer rocks!... Pitch black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, brown head. The nose is of rich milk chocolate and coconut with a small dose of acetaldehyde. I’m supersensitive to the stuff, so most wouldn’t even detect it. Despite the ethanal, the aroma is wonderful. The flavor offers terrific balance between sweet chocolate malt, woodsy sourmash and moderate scorched bitterness. Full-bodied with a mouthfeel of heavy cream and almost lively carbonation. Burnt, bitter, not-too-boozy, chocolate finish. World class effort!",4.4

781,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"There are moments in your beer life when you’re fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time. Recently I found myself sitting down with one of the brewers at Närke, who personally took me through his range of outstanding beers.
By far the best of a great bunch was the Stormaktsporter - a rare (unlabeled) bottle from 2005 that had been matured in a whisky cask for a couple of months.
I was told there’s only a few hundred litres of this left in the world - just as well I managed to slip a bottle into my pocket before I left!

appearance - pours as thick as engine oil. Ink black body, with a thick, creamy earthy brown head. This beer demands your respect and attention.

Aroma- soooo complex. Layer upon layer upon layer, with distinct vinous qualities, buttery chocolate, coffee, spirit-soaked fruits and oak wood.

Flavour - Exceptional. Port wine, mixed with powerful dark fruits (a hint of liquorice?), vanilla toffee, chocolate, expresso coffee and lightly burnt sugar. You could scoop the head up and dollop it straight onto vanilla ice-cream!

Palate - despite its oily colour, the mouthfeel is decadently smooth, and totally in keeping with this style of beer. Top marks.

Overall- it’s such an overwhelmingly great beer that I tried almost everything to avoid reaching the end of the glass. Twisted logic I know - but with this stuff so hard to come by I really mean it!

I’ve really going to treasure my one 250ml bottle of Kaggens Stormaktsporter. Quite simply it’s the best Swedish beer I have ever tasted.",4.9

World class beer!

Flavour is ultra-long, with a big, but delicate chocolatey bitterness. Mouthfeel is big enough, yet light on its feet(thank you Josh, for that perfect description).

Had this again now on Christmas Eve, shared a bottle with my wife just because I had the chance, did it at The Rover, Göteborg.
Excellent nice dark black color. Rich nose and taste, close to perfect!

First and second ratings.
Draught, sampled at the brewery. It’s like their """"""""Stormaktsporter"""""""" but bigger and better. More body, more taste, more powerful. Vanilla and oak in the scent and taste, as well as coffee. Pitch black look to it. Very nice, but something you might not drink too much of I guess, due to the high alcohol level.

Also tried as bottle on RBESG 2006, aged some, still great.

Third rating.
(25 cl bottle at The Rover, Göteborg)
Bought a bottle for myself, I wanted to re-rate and really enjoy this one. Screw the price!
Black look with a thick brown head. No transparency at all! Totally pitch black and gourgeous.
Sweet oily thick scent. Alcohol, some vanilla and bourbon whiskey smell as well. The vanilla and bourbon scent becomes more intense when the glass becomes emptier and the brew is warmed up and oxygenized. Smooth velvet mouthfeel. Smooth initial taste, transforming via tar and smoke towards rubber and warming alcohol. Taste is also chocolate and coffee when warmer, mostly chocolate though. Medium high bitterness. Long nice lasting aftertaste.
Extremely smooth, nice and friendly, too bad it’s fairly expensive and rare...
It’s worth it to buy a bottle to enjoy yourself though.
9/5/9/5/19=4.7

Fifth or so sample.
Shared a bottle with a friend at The Rover, Göteborg.
Pitch black color, rich brown head. Sweet rich raissin and coffee scent. Also scome alcohol, still very soft and very nice. Smell is also a touch of smoke and rubber, mixed with vanilla. I spent roughly 3 minutes looking at the beer and perhaps 10 smelling it before I even let the glass near my mouth, it’s just amazing, fantastic and all the big words together! Extremely big, large, huge, all of it, full rich palate, smooth and oily, best ever! Long chocolate and smoke aftertaste. Sweet sirupy taste, coffee and chocolate, smoke and rubber, also vanilla taste. This beer grows even better every time I drink it, and I can honestly say it’s the best beer I’ve ever had. I don’t like the use of 5.0 for a beer, what happens when you try something better? re-rate? But this one is truly worth it! A shame it’s almost gone. Luckily the new one is coming...

Last(?) rating: 
I had a bottle stored at The Rover in Göteborg, waiting for a special occasion. Then my favourite ice hockey team won gold in the Swedish Championships about 2 weeks back, so now the bottle is gone. I was quite sober though, only high on adrenalin, so it didn’t go to waste, I fully enjoyed every last drop of it.



First rating of the 2006 version
(Bottle at The Rover, Göteborg)
10%
Pitch black color, big brown head, lovely! Oak and vanilla scent, also some salt and the northern Swedish ocean/Baltic sea at fall smell. Smell is also sweet, grains and alcohol. Honey and heather in there as well, though the oak is rather dominant. Chocolate, roasted, sweet malt, melted vnilla ice-cream, coffee taste. Roasted, sweet coffee aftertaste. Thick, oily, smooth mouthfeel, medium high bitterness. Very, very nice, though I want it to age perhaps 6 months or so to mellow out and improve even more. Close to perfection!
9/5/10/5/19=4.8

Tried this the other day at the brewery, 2006 version.
Serious vanilla/oak nose to begin with, more than I have sensed before.
Nice long chocolate finish after it has warmed for a while.
I think it’s lovely just to sit down and enjoy it!


New rating, 2006 version from a pub in Göteborg

814,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Batch A. Bottle pour at Schramm’s, pours a deep dark mahogany. Aroma brings out tart raspberries, jammy cherry, a hint of currant, and treacly honey. Flavour is intensely rich, with lots of tart cherries, some currant, some raspberries, and gently treacly honey. Boozy, tart, sweet finish. As good as other Schramm’s products, but not worth of its heightened reputation or price tag. Delicious nonetheless.",4.4

832,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Sample at Schramm’s, Ferndale. Dark red/purple. Aroma is not only a pure fruit experience but is redolent of the leaves and stalks that once held it. Very bright and jammy taste that is balanced between honey sweetness and fruit tartness.

847,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Pour from a mystical 750 mL bottle that ""doesn’t really exist unless your name is Schramm."" Batch 4. Never thought I’d ever get to try this. The pour is a deep, rich blood color. Straight from the femoral. It looks like a liquid ruby. Syrupy and heavy. Damn. The aroma is like intercourse. There is the presence from the cherries, the raspberry is present and subtle, but presents a light sweetness with the honey. The currants are exceptionally deep and complex throughout this. There is a hint of booze on the back end. But it belongs. The balance and complexity of this is unbelievable. The flavor is well... Fuck me running. The cherry really pops right into your mouth. The raspberry is there for solid backup and a little sweetness to get it going. The currant offers a whole different level of complexity. This thing is constantly changing and morphing from the moment it touches your lips. There is a light booziness that wanders in and out of the spotlight, and just ties this all together. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a glorious complex sweet, fruity, booziness on the back end. This is just liquid sex. Son of a bitch.",5.0

Appearance: Beautiful deep vibrant ruby red that leaves nice legs on the glass. 



Aroma: Burst of currants and black cherries alongside honey, floral/tea presence, light cinnamon / nutmeg, jammy fruits and port character. 



Taste: Sweet, but perfectly balanced by the moderate acidity. Burst of cherries and currants alongside deep honey presence, floral notes, light nutmeg, a touch of alcohol and port notes.



Palate: Full body. Thick. Mouth coating. Syrupy. Warming finish. Lingering fruity sweetness. Fruity finish and aftertaste. Perfect! 



Overall: One of the tastiest beverage I have ever had. So rich! The fruit presence is massive, but also really well balanced by a perfectly dosed acidity and a wonderful honey depth. We had it just after KBBS and HoD completely blew away the Toppling Goliath stout. Simply amazing!",4.6
869,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"2 oz pour from bottle. Pours a beautiful opaque burgundy. Aroma is huge cherry, currants and other fieldberries. There is also an intriguing spiciness and chamomile from the honey. Taste is quite tart, certainly more than I expect. It also has a nice sweetness from the fruits (cassis and dark cherries) and a light bitterness (peel, cherry pit). Very complex and well balanced. The lingering fieldberry taste makes you wanting more. Awesome mead.",4.6

877,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Rating #2000! Batch #1 cellared for about a year. Pours a deep red, almost purple. Still. Great legs on the glass. Aroma is dark cherry skins and black currants mostly. Very rich. Don’t get any raspberry. Tastes surprisingly more like wine than mead. Not nearly as sweet as I expected. It is deep and rich though. Just like the aroma, I get more cherry skin and black currant than raspberry. Slightly tart. Slightly dry. Great mouthfeel. Smooth and just the right amount of syrupy. Overall, a great mead but there are a few mead’s from Ken that I enjoy more and cost a quarter of the price. I doubt I’ll ever purchase it again.",4.2

890,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Big thanks to dak for sharing this and a gentleman’s nod to Meadme for . . . well, being awesome and being Meadme. Cheers Greg! The tall glass bottle pours with a deep purple body that has rosy red edges and leaves behind slightly staining swirls and decent legginess. The aroma offers up thick berry notes before it heads into some dark currant goodness and a dash of honey wax. The taste smoothly flows into rich dark currant juiciness, berry richness and then a bit of tannin like tartness. The tartness seems to try and break up the rich deep berry goodness but is unable to. This starts to pick up currant berry earthiness toward the finish but the tannic tartness snuffs it out. This was surprisingly different than the batches from the B. Necktar version.",4.3
891,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Super blood red. No head. Nose is huge. A ton of fruit. Like crap loads. Taste is incredible. Just a crap load of strawberry, cranberry, raspberry and cherry.

892,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Big thanks to Adam Jackson for this bottle share. Dark ruby color, that looks like a red wine color. Aroma is lots of fruit. Black cherry, raspberry, perhaps a blueberry with hints of currents. 


Flavor is massively sweet with again, huge amounts of berry. No amount of alcohol even at this level of ABV, damn! The berry concoction of berries is crazy with a very light hint of honey in the finish. I know the price point is really high but after tasting this I understand why. Really crazy, smooth, yet sticky texture. Yeah, that doesn’t make sense. However this is really tasty and can’t imagine any other mead this flavorful.",4.3
893,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Dark purple color. Aroma of perfume, berries, honey. Flavor is sweet, tart, tannins, light vinous, drier than I remember the original HoD. Good but the B Nektar version is hands down better.",4.1
894,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"Deep, dense purpleish blue pour. The nose is port like but with more cherries and black currant. Really nice. Texture is light to medium with no carbonation, obviously. Suits the rich, sour, fruity, pungent profile. The aftertaste is really lovely but its more of the same. A pleassure to have tried. Tried this a second time and felt my rating needed a slight nudge in the positive direction. 4.0 it is then..",4.0
895,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,Taster at Schramm’s. Looks good; a semi-transparent still reddish purple. Smells good too; sweet cherry and honey with some other berry presence as well.

896,Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"The aroma is fruit - blackberry/currents. Pours a dark purple /red. The taste is sweet/bitter. The body is thin/medium, the carbonation soft and the finish long. Geez you have to go a long way to beat this - Best drink I’ve ever had so far.",4.4

The taste is rich cherry, blackcurrant, bramble liqueur, some warming alcohol, light wood, and light tartness to balance it out with a dryish, bitter-sweet finish.

933,Westvleteren 12,"BESTES QUADRUPPEL!!! UND BESTES BIER DER WELT!!!
Das Westvleteren 12 führt einige Tasting Listen an und ist auf Youtube auch unter dem Begriff ""Bestes Bier der Welt"" zu finden. Es kommt dunkelbraun mit beiger, gemischtporiger Krone ins Glas, die eine mittlere Standfestigkeit hat. Der Geruch erinnert an einen Mostkeller mit hohem erdigen Anteil. Besonders auffällig ist der Alkohol. Beim Antrunk hatte ich eine Geschmacksexplosion erwartet, die einen sofort und für immer umhaut. Nichts dergleichen. Das Quadrupel kommt dezent mit Pflaume, Likär, Beeren, Vanille, Zartbitterschokolade und leichtem Karamell rüber. Dabei ist das Bier leicht süß aber gerade noch so, dass es richtig männlich ist. Bestimmt bekomme ich für den Kommentar wieder Haßposts. Ich erahne noch weitere Aromen, möchte sie aber aus Unsicherheit nicht benennen. Zweite Verkostung nötig. Ich habe gar nicht gemerkt, dass das Bier schon fast leer ist, deshalb nun der Abgang: Der Alkohol gewinnt an Dominanz und bringt zusammen mit der Hopfung eine merkliche und sehr gut abgestimmte Bitterkeit ins Spiel. So können die vorher genannten Aromen, die immer noch da sind, in einem anderen Licht erlebt werden. Absolut phantastisch gelöst. Garantiert ist das das beste Quadrupel, das ich je getrunken habe. Zu dem besten Bier: ich glaube nicht, dass dieses Bier in Kuba am Strand bei 34 Grad das beste ist oder es einem Radler Liebhaber gefallen würde. Deshalb ist der Begriff für mich auch lächerlich und für jeden Betrachter anders. Ich finde es auch nicht nachvollziehbar für so ein Meisterwerk 3 Sterne zu vergeben, aber so sind eben die unterschiedlichen Geschmäcker.

Obviously, I'm looking forward to drinking aged examples in the coming years...
Pours a hazy dark amber to brown with a stable, foamy, tan head. Very expressive aroma of tawny port, red wine, wood, red apple slices, dried banana, pear, overripe blue plum, brown bread, baker's yeast, artisan milk chocolate, chestnut. Taste has a sweet estery mix of blue plum, red apple, dried banana & raisin in a thick brown-bready, slightly toasty, somewhat chocolatey malt body with a hint of candi sugar, but never in a cloying way, surrounded by a spicy and a dry-yeasty note, and even a sourish dark-fruity streak. The herbal & peppery hoppy finish offers more dried & candied fruits, spices and 'dry' brown bread and even a very vague hint of coffee. The whole is topped off with a noble, vinous warmth of brandy-like alcohol. Medium to full body, creamy-moussy texture, average carbonation (toning down when warming up). Evidently, it's hard to approach this beer unbiasedly, but its powerful character slowly but surely reveals itself, leaving you without a doubt that it's a masterpiece.",4.5

945,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.",4.4

Starts off with slight notes of citrus, rounding over in figs, nuts, honey, cocoa, slight coffee. This is followed by a slight bitterness before it ends in chocolaty feel. Full-bodied oily texture and very foamy. An incredible experience. The people who claim that Sint Bernardus Abt 12 is like this beer are incredulous, for lack of better word.

Invecchiata per quasi 12 anni. Schiuma praticamente assente, colore marrone scuro non torbido ma con molti lieviti sospesi anche al primo colpo. Carbonazione leggera. Al naso enorme complessità, su tutto caramello, frutta secca e di bosco, sentori erbacei. In bocca leggermente acquosa ma allo stesso tempo di buon corpo. Caramello e i tipici derivati dell'ossidazione dominano la bevuta, la frutta rimane sullo sfondo. Arriva poi uno delizioso amaro che porta diverse pennellate erbacee e floreali, accentuando anche il resto dei sentori. Finale dolce ma secco, che assume anche una nota acida e tostata quando la birra sale di temperatura, oltre a un pelo di liquirizia. La transizione tra amaro e il finale è il più grande pregio di questa birra.

968,Westvleteren 12,"Dat mensen willen beweren dat de Sint Bernardus Abt 12 vergelijkbaar is....daar ben ik het absoluut NIET mee eens, smaken verschillen gelukkig, maar dit bier blijft in tegenstelling tot de Sint Bernardus  wel na iedere slok aan de binnenkant van je wangen plakken en is qua body veel voller van smaak en geur, waardoor deze veel langer uitvloeit met de kenmerkende mout, caramel, koffie en toffeesmaken.
Het is wel de cultstatus die er mede aan bijdraagt dat dit bier door elke bierliefhebber zeker een keer gedronken moet zijn, gelul natuurlijk...mensen die niet van het type Quadruppel houden gaan dit ook niet lekker vinden omdat het Westvleteren is, en de verkrijgbaarheid is nog steeds RUK. Als het al verkrijgbaar is dan wordt het aan derden verkocht voor woekerprijzen, wat dan weer niet van de Cisterciënzers mag. Die eigenwijze monniken moeten niet  zeuren, het gewoon gaan commercialiseren, en met de winst een hoop arme mensen gelukkig maken, 2 vliegen in één klap..Zelf zou ik dit ook niet het beste bier ter wereld noemen, maar gewoon goed.

995,Westvleteren 12,"This beer was one dream for me and i try very hard to get one bottle without travel in Belgium. So before tried this unique beer i get the ""St bernardus 12"" because people said these two beers had the same recipe and are very similar. So i want to say to them :Its not the same beers. The difference are massive.
If we clear that lets go to the review.
When i open the beer one punchy full of flavors aroma fill my roam from nowhere. The aroma cover my entire room for fun. But the most shock thing wasent the aroma but the taste. When the beer touch my mouth, it bites my tongue and cover my entire mouth with insane flavors that i never had again. I had feel the same thing only once from ""Rochefort 10"" that also bites your tongue and your mouth very aggressive. But ""Westvleteren 12"" do that more aggressively. The beer has the best mouthfeel i ever get from anything in my life. 
The taste is so complex and so unique. The beer is very sweet and at the same time bitter with a lot of caramel, chocolate, fruity notes. And the finish it has 3 long directions. In the beginning it gives you one aggressive and punchy bitterness and in some secs that become sweet and again it change in some warm bitterness at the end. Really i cant described that. The feeling was mind blowing. The carboration is little high for one ""Quadrupel"" beer but it stick perfectly here.
Overall the best beer i have get/tried today. No because is the best on paper but because its the best for me. Simply the beer is a real monster. The most complex and unique beer i have tried for sure!",5.0

I can't really describe it, but the after tastes reminds me vaguely about fermantated/ too ripe banana and that spoils it for me. The banana taste is also present in Stift Engelszell Gregorius Trappistenbier, one of the most disappointing Trappist beers. Most beers in my top 10 are at least 200 years on the market and all new Trappist beers lack something. St. Berbardus Abt 12 is in my opinion a good alternative if you like the aftertaste of Westvleteren 12 and the story that the yeast was stolen could be true.

1038,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. 5/2/22 date. Appearance:  Dark murky brown with a light hint of ruby red. Minimal light khaki head. 
Aroma:  Alcohol, chocolate, toasted bread, and dark fruit, namely raisin. 
Taste:  Rich, super sweet maltiness, with strong brown sugar and toasted bread notes. Minimal bitterness is just enough to prevent the sweetness from being cloying. Raisin and tobacco notes come through on the back end. 
Mouthfeel:  Medium bodied with a biting carbonation. 
Finish:  Malt forward, but has a surprising amount of bitterness that’s sticky on the tongue. Brown sugar, molasses, and raisin all linger. 
Overall:  Rarely do beers live up to the hype, but this is truly a world class beer, even within a rich, complex style with plenty of great examples. Drinks surprisingly easy for a beer this complex and rich in maltiness. So many layers of flavor, all well rounded and smooth",4.5

Herbs, molasses, more of the dust. Medium body with a wife bouquet and just a hint of sourness. Sweet and sticky. Surprisingly better than the ones I had 2 years ago from the same batch.",4.0
1041,Westvleteren 12,"Well, the hype is real.
Trying to put away the external factors when tasting/evaluating this beer is difficult, because they are an integral part of the experience. Its relative exclusivity, the confirmation bias that comes with the huge undertaking of buying this beer at the abbey, the feel of the place, the low-key bottle (oh, how I love the unblemished trappist bottle where the cap holds all the information), the crate and last but not least, the ratings and reviews - the hype.
 
The appearance is immaculate. The color of the beer and the look and feel of the foam are just... right. In the Westvleteren glass it looks almost understated, yet oh so inviting. 
The smell is understated too, maybe a tad too much, as when I first smelled it my stomach wrenched in worry that it would not deliver as promised. 

Well, it does deliver. It really, really does. 
Trying to describe the taste in detail is a bit meaningless for me, it is too complex. It has many of the tastes you expect from a dark trappist, dark fruits, nuts and all that other nonsense which I am not good at describing, but what sets this one apart from the rest of the trappists, and other belgian triples and quadruples for that matter, is a taste I can best describe as a soft bitterness. But its not really soft either, its there, and it fits so ... again, right. It gives the beer a dimension I have not experienced in other of its kind.

Either way. I realize I could never shake off my aforementioned confirmation bias, but hopefully the description of my experience could convince you to try it, as the hype is most definitely real.",4.9

1043,Westvleteren 12,"I was expecting more of an aroma, as I feel it's not a particularly intense one. Still quite good anyway, with notes of dried fruit, marzipan, toffee, licorice and liquor. Pours dark brown with a nice, thick, light beige head. Taste is mostly sweet and fills your mouth. Slightly too carbonated in my opinion, but it's still a nice mouthfeel, neither too thick nor too watery. Aftertaste is pretty intense, boozy, with a sweetness that lingers for a while. Pairs well with dried fruit, nuts and chocolate. While I do think it's a very good beer, I also feel like it's not THAT good and it's fame is due mostly to how difficult it used to be to find a bottle (I don't think that's the case anymore). That aside and based only on the quality of the beer, the price I payed is not justified, but as a one time occasion I guess it's worth it.",4.0

The scent is delightful, dark plum, bread, toffee, brown sugar.  And now finally, ultimately, I have a drink.  It was worth the wait.  Dark raisin, fig, malt, sourdough bread.  A bit of sweetness that goes to a nice  finishing bitterness.  Dense, chewy. It warms up, it gets more flavorful. My oh my. Better than Chimay Blue which had been my top rated beer of all.

Strong malty aroma with notes of warm bread along with sweet dark fruit notes of figs and plum. Thick mouthfeel with slight effervescence on the tongue. Good lacing throughout. Complex malt delivers a rich Christmas cake base with strong fruit notes of syrupy dates, raisins, damsons, prunes with barley sugar twist. Earthy, damp note to the subtle hop content delivers a short but balanced flavour to the aftertaste. Finish is malty with Cognac booze notes not overwhelming the malt character but you know the strength is there.

1125,Westvleteren 12,"C'est bien plus qu'une simple bouteille qui se tenait devant moi que je m’apprêtais donc à décapsuler, c'est un véritable mythe...qui a pris naissance pour moi il y a un peu plus de 4 années  lorsque j'ai commencé à m'intéresser au monde de la bière et que je découvrais les différents classements et qui fut ensuite alimenté par sa rareté et le prix souvent démesuré qu'une bouteille pouvait atteindre quand j'en croisais une (tout ce qui est rare est cher...ce qui ne la met pas à la portée de toutes le bourses, et pendant longtemps, pas de la mienne). Le suspense allait donc prendre et fin, et pour moi la réponse à mes questions sur cette fameuse bière. Côté visuel, rien à redire, on est proche de la 8 avec une brun foncé limpide surmonté d'une mousse crémeuse de 1,5 cm. Le nez est de façon surprenante voire inquiétante très discret. On y trouve tout de même un alcool aux accents de cognac, du candy et des fruits avec de la prune et de la poire. Le tout étant peu intense. Heureusement la dégustation est toute autre ! Et, si l'intensité de cette Westleveren XII n'est pas la plus incroyable au monde, elle fait preuve d'un équilibre exceptionnel qui en ferait devenir saint tout diablotin (est-ce là une stratégie des moines pour évangéliser la Belgique ?). Cette bière est classieuse, avec un alcool affirmé, sur des airs de cognac, mais pas agressif et s'alliant parfaitement à l'amertume et à une base maltée ou le pruneau prend les devants sans être prédominants. Obtenir un tel équilibre est forcément le fruit de très longues années d'expériences et d'une maîtrise du brassage hors norme. Donc merci aux moines d'avoir œuvré en ce sens et d'avoir protégé un patrimoine unique. Mais revenons à la dégustation. Par rapport à la 8, ce qui change et bien entendu l'alcool, qui prend ici beaucoup plus de caractère tout en restant très bien intégré, mais également les épices, moins présente ici et avec des arômes de pruneau plus développés. La complexité est excellente dès l'attaque qui reprend les arômes développés par le nez avec en complément des notes de candy et de poivre. La seconde bouche prend davantage ses aises et sur l'arrière bouche, ce sont les épices et le pruneau qui prennent l'ascendant. Le final, très long marque un mariage de l'alcool et de l'amertume assez remarquable tout comme l'est cette bière. A savoir ensuite si c'est la meilleure bière du monde, je pense finalement que cette question n'a pas de sens. Que demande-t-on à une bière? En premier et avant tout d'être équilibrée et en second lieu de nous donner de l'émotion. Et si le premier point est factuel, le deuxième est très personnel. Chacun d'entre nous sera plus sensible à l'intensité, à l'amertume, à l'alcool ou à la complexité. Comme dans la quête de tout Graal, l'important est avant tout dans le chemin, les bières découvertes jour après jour, l'expérience acquise mais surtout dans les rencontres faites tout au long de ce chemin qui sont pour moi une source d'enrichissement inégalable. Et je remercie donc cette Westlevern XII pour tout cela. Une émotion est peu de chose si elle n'est pas partagée.",5.0

1153,Westvleteren 12,"A 330ml bottle with a cap date (bottled +3 years) of 1st September 2019. Poured into a Chimay goblet glass. After a careful pour to leave most of the yeast in the bottle, it was a clear brown colour with a copper red hue and a just over one finger off white head that had great retention, but eventually settled to a very nice self replenishing cap while leaving great lacing around the glass. Aromas of strong fruitiness, apple, plum, dates, fig, toffee with light clove and banana notes. Tastes sweet, plum, dates, fig, banana bread, toffee, yeast and a touch of spice. Creamy, medium to full bodied, with moderate carbonation. Overall, I’m not a huge fan of sweetness, and this definitely leans on the sweet side, perhaps overly so for me. I prefer both Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12 over this.

The character changes with temperature, the flowerness, perfumeness vary with temperature and transforms into more of a caramel/burnt caramel and abit more bitterness to it. 
I believe one of the secrets to success when it comes to both Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12, is that the tasting experience, aromas and flavours change with time and temperature. The nose and palett never get used to the same flavours and aromas. New unique aromas and flavours keep these beers interesting, especially the Westvleteren 12. There is always something new to discover when you put your nose in the glass of a Westvleteren 12. For being such a strong beer, there is very little alcohol aroma or flavour. It adds to the flavours and experience but it does not overwhelm the experience. The Rochefort 10 has alot more alcohol presence both in aromas and flavours, and can come across boozy. Despite there is not that big difference in alcohol 11.3 % in Rochefort 10 and 10.2% in Westvleteren 12, the difference in experience is very big. The sensation of tickling/numbness is just present in Westvleteren 12 whereas in the Rochefort 10 it is very prominent. 

The Westvletern 12 has a larger range of flavours and aromas than the Rochefort 10. It doesn´t have as long after taste and has a more refreshing, lighter quality and not just as chunky or decadent as the Rochefort 10. The Westvleteren 12 has not pointy aromas or flavours that urge you to take another sip. Everytime you put your nose in the glass, there are some new aromas to discover and where as the Rochefort can get a bit ""dull"" at the very end of the tasting experience, the Westevleteren 12 remain a refreshing feeling. One could ask for a bit longer after taste, to par with the Rochefort 10, that would have been fantastic. However, this beer is more complex, more balanced, has more aromas and flavours, is less boozy and never gets dull compared to Rochefort 10. Overall this is the very best beer I have ever had, and I line up in the choir to praise this beer from Westvleteren as the very best beer in the world. (If there is such a thing ;) )",5.0

Immdiately, the taste is a combo of light and dark malts, dark dried fruit, and cherry. It's sweet, but perfectly balanced. It's incredible. The richest malt I've ever had. Surprisingly, it delights with a high level of carbonation. The body is impossibly light-medium. Incredible beer. For months, I thought I was mistaken.

U toj ""kompleksnosti i balansu"" jedino mu je Rochefort 10 ravan ! Ali to su dva potpuno različita piva , i to je odlična spoznaja. Bilo bi bezveze da su dva najbolja Belgijska piva sličnog okusa pa da moraš odlučivati o nijansama . Westvleteren 12 je med i čokolada a voćni okus je tek na kraju , dok je Rochefort 10 prvo voće pa tamni slad i kvasac a med tek na kraju. Da saznate koji je bolji , morat će te probati oba . Ja sam im stavio iste ocjene , jer da ih imam uvijek oba na raspolaganju pio bi ih zavisno od raspoloženja.

In een Westvleteren glas is de vergelijking met een monnik in een bruine pij ook niet heel ver weg. Het heeft een hele zachte schuimkraag wat je bij je eerste slok meteen constateert. Je proeft een subtiele fruitige kruidige mix die inderdaad vrij allround en vol maar vooral hele zacht van smaak. En ondanks het hoge alcohol percentage proef ruik je hier eigenlijk niks van maar indirect de smaak van deze topper wel weet te versterkten en daarmee zo drinkbaar maakt. Hoe subtiel kan het zijn. 

Proef verder de mout proef, karamel en koffie. Als is de koffiesmaak wel veel subtieler als je bij imperial stouts gewend bent. Dit is nog een jonge vletter van nog geen jaar. Wat ik lees is dat de smaak pas echt naar 1,5 tot 2 jaar tot zijn recht komt. Een vervolg komt dan ook zeker. De enige gekmaker is, er zit geen etiket op het glas en de enige tekst staat dan ook op de dop daar kan o.a. lezen. Tenminste houdbaar tot: zie top. Aaarrrrgggghhh waar staat het dan???? Wordt vervolgt..... 4,2 9-4-8-5-19 rerate proef krenten en rozijnen in volle zoete rum. Volle zachte smaak.

Nu 6 jaar later toch weer een keer proberen.Mooie rijpe gedroogde krenten fruit smaak. Overall redelijk subtiel ondanks het alcoholpercentage. Donkerbruine te een zachte crème kleurige schuimkraag.

This is a sipping beer, to be shared with friends, and that's how I enjoyed this one. There is much going on here.

Looking forward to visiting the abbey shop in November where I can hopefully pick up samples of the other Westy brews. 


Re-rated April 2018: Left a bottle ""condition"" for another six months. A bit more fullness to the flavour. Unsure if I have matured alongside this beer, but can definitely pick apart more complex fruity, caramel style notes. Thick, airy head with the yeast resting on top stayed with me all the way to the end. Strong, typical Belgian fizzy carbonation with a massive alcoholic bite but incredibly smooth.

1336,Westvleteren 12,"Beer 2000. In an orval goblet. I had a couple of differing bottle ages today but this review is from the date on cap of .15.04.18. It's only taken a decade for me to hit 2k but I'm really not a ticker in my own defence. This isn't the best beer in the world , or even that silly place called Belgium , and I think rochefort 10 or st bernadus 12 are more enjoyable quads without the scarcity .  Pours muddy brown with a beige head that's fast receding into a fizzy pool ...putting the goblet to ny nose I reckon the aroma was the coolest feature. Grapes, chocolate brownies, spicy springtime aromatics ,pretty bready malt driven complexity ..resemblance to st bernardus is striking.   I drunk two of these one after another in less than an hour , and the flavours and general nuances in each bottle couldn't match the complex fun of the aromas.  There's some nice malty, yeasty ,boozy vibes -but somewhere no wow factor.  Will re8 one day.",4.1

Started off cold (33F) and allowed to warm up through the 50s...the nose was beautiful from the beginning with a ton of sweet, candied fruit, toffee, mild alcohol and a general richness. Flavor was candied fruit, raisin, toffee, beautiful! Palate was medium bodied, and thankfully the age didn’t seem to take much of a toll here...quite easy drinking for the ABV...a shame I only have one (and of course, couldn’t not share this with a good friend to celebrate).

W smaku jak w aromacie, bardzo podobny w smaku quadrupel do Bernardusa-quadrupla - tyle, ze ten drugi jest jakby rozwodniony. Westvleteren ma wiecej ciala. Niezle ukryty alkohol jak na tak mocne piwo. 

Moja ocena minimalnie nizsza od sredniej, pomimo, ze oceniam piwa dosc lagodnie i raczej pochlebnie, a i jestem wielkim fanem quadrupli, a Westvlteren byl od jakiegos czasu moim celem.

RE-RATE: Westvleteren XII 2011

Napiłem się sześćioletniego Westvleterena i to zmusza mnie do zmiany oceny. Niestety Ratebeer nie daje możliwości oceny poszczególnych warek. 

6-letni West miał przede wszystkim, mówiąc kolokwialnie, zajebisty aromat, bardzo złożony. Wyczułem tu rodzynki, chlebek, drożdże, owoce (śliwki, suszone jabłka), glukozową woń, cynamon, miód i jeszcze jedną nutę, której nie umiem nazwać. Mógłbym tylko wąchać to piwo przez kilka godzin.  Aromat fenomenalny. Odjąłem punkt za wygląd, bo wydawał mi się strasznie jasny, jak na quadrupla. Bardzo słodki, nie za dużo ciała, ładnie wyczuwalna wiśnia. Goryczka bardzo przyjemna, alkohol nie gryzie w przełyk. 

======================
Re-rate: Westvleteren XII 2007: 
11-letni dużo gorsza opcja niż 6-letni. Strasznie wodnisty w smaku, aromat dalej piękny ale już mniej intensywny. Slodycz przykrywa wszystko. 

Dla porównania dam moje oceny obu wersji, a ""wklikam"" uśrednione.

Well, it’s hard to ignore the hype when I traveled quite a way to get it (instead of buying 12€ bottle in Brugge) but I will try. 
Best comparison that comes to my mind is wine. It’s like a well stored bottle of red. It won’t amuse you with heights and everything, but it’s perfectly well balanced and smooth.

Aus der Flasche (bbe 29-04-2006 !!! ) 2016-11 getrunken. Als Willkommens Trunk gab es erstmal ein seit mehr als 10 Jahren abgelaufenes Westvleteren XII. Was für eine trübe, braune Brühe kam da aus der Flasche. Wow! Im Glas gab es keinen Schaum und null Kohlensäure. Das Ding war tot, aber verdammt lecker. In Nase und am Gaumen fette Waldhonignote, etwas Harz und eine schöne Malzigkeit. In der Runde kam zurecht der Vergleich mit Met auf. Schön zu wissen was in der langen Reifezeit aus diesen sensationellen Bier geworden ist. 10/4/10/5/20
Aus der Flasche (bbe 21-04-2019) 2018-04 getrunken. Diees Batch des W12 ist deutlich gehopft für ein Quadrupel. Die Balance zwischen den sonstigen typsischen Aromen so sehr harmonisch abgestimmt.

Etwas später dann leichte malzige und etwas kräuteraritge Aromen sind wahrnehmbar. Am Gaumen ist es malzig und immer noch leicht Bitter durch den Hopfeneinfluss. Aber es ist ,auch etwas leichter im Körper im Verhältnis zu dem hohen Alkoholgehalt. Mir gefallen die Westvleteren XII am besten wenn das bbe abgelaufen ist.

The head takes up about 20% of my New Belgium goblet and is an off white and is thick and billowy that I imagine myself being able to a take a bite out of it and it would be chewy. Also, there’s a few sprinkles on the top of the head from the sediment.

The smell has a realy dark fruity nose to it, raisin-prine-plum-fig, along with some chocolate, yeast, coffee, and yeah, a bit of the alcohol.

The taste on first sip has the dark fruits at center stage. Subtly sweet portions of plum, raisin, fig, some dark cherry, a touch of chocolate and cofee(and I do mean just a touch) and a slight bitterness in the form of some citrus near the tail end of the sip and it carries on right through the finish where I also get some of the alcohol that warms the throat during the swallow. This is so darn complex that I fear my words will not do it justice but hey, I’m doing the best I can. ;^)

Ok, I’m about 2/3rds of the way through my glass and the chocolate is a bit more pronounced now and that simply adds to how silky smooth the mouthfeel is. And look at all that sticky lacing on the sides of my glass!

This is the second of my bottles I’ve tasted(the last one was shortly after I received them) and I’m as impressed now as I was then....a 2 year span. 

Bottom line: Yeah, I spent a few bucks to get my bottles of Westvletern 12(and 8) and I could have bought lots of other beers for the cost but, I feel that the money was spent well. I’ve had other quadrupels before and I liked them. I’m partial to the style. Is this the best example of the style that I’ve had to date? You darn tootin. Is it because of the scarcity factor? No. It’s because my palate tells me that it is *that* damn good. Complexity in the taste? This has it. Complexity that has all the flavours working in harmony? This has it. A great looking appearance in a glass? This has it. A nose that keeps you sniffing before every sip? This has it. A mouthfeel that is both silky smooth and chewy at the same time? This comes very close. Drinkability that goes through the roof? Just about. So, would I buy some again? At current prices?(US$18 per bottle plus shipping from Belgium) Maybe, but if it was as ""easily"" available as other examples of the style, I’d buy it by the case.",4.5

I love the logoless bottle with just the cap. I thought it is a smooth beer with a sweet note to it, little yeast but not too much. Head disappeared very quickly after pouring, not too much carbonation. No alcoholic flavour at all, drinks more like a wine/port than like a beer. Nice beer to drink but not a this price point, especially if you can get Bernardus or Rochefort for 1/4th of the price!",3.3

Appearance: Heavy carbonation dissipates quickly after the pour, but it continues bubbling away in the glass for another minute or two before going flat. Looks an awful lot like coca-cola! 

Flavour: Charcoally notes of toasted brown bread and dried fruit (prunes, brandy soaked raisins and sultanas). Lingering malts. Sweet, mellow and malty all at once, and the flavour definitely develops as you drink more of it. Very balanced, and masks the alcohol content extremely well. 

Mouthfeel: Very thin, and not in the slightest bit viscous. Like a mellow red wine.",4.1

Warm and silky mouthfeel with just a hint of hops bitterness present in the lasting and complex afteraste. Funny effect after swallowing is mouthwatering effect that I got. Alcohol is very well camouflaged and not straightforward. Resembles some barley wines that I have tasted so far. Excellent beer but not the best IMHO.

The taste is sweet (probably why our American cousins like it so much) with a rich caramel flavour that imparted a smoothness to the mouthfeel.  The carbonation was well balanced to offset the richness of the beer.  I definitely got rich fruitcake in the taste of what was, overall, a very well made beer.

Its simply amazing! This beer have the complex nose of a malt whisky! Chocolate, dark fruits, honey, roasted malt, caramel, nuts, & toasted bread! Sweet aroma of many Belgium beers combined together in this beer~

The taste.. wow the taste is very complex, this maybe the most complex beer i ever had! The first sip, malt, honey, yeast, chocolate and coffee! Then the taste starts to change and turns into a totally different taste - it just taste like Christmas! Christmas cake, dried fruits and more honey. This is a 10% ABV beer and it just goes down so smooth, so very satisfying. Its like some old whisky, that have a medium body but pack with alot of flavors. 

The aftertaste is another magic from this beer. Its long, intense, fill your mouth with roasted malt and total satisfaction!

This really makes you wonder, why monks able to make the very best beer on earth? Maybe they can’t have beer in heaven~~~

The smell, I really didn’t get much of it, just a standard ale smell for me matched by a murky brown colour. The taste is also quite subtle but for some reason, totally satisfying. It feels full of flavour whole also not revealing what any individual flavour really is. It fizzes on the palate - a delight- and washes down like a mix of a fine red wine and a praline chocolate. A very delightful beer to drink, of course not worth the insane hype but one should allow it for a beer of shuffle quality.

Re-rates (6,1,7,5,15). Takes it down from 4.2 to 3.8. Aroma was wine and this time, cask barrel basement. The appearance was pretty nasty to be honest, clumpy off brown. This beer is all about the feeling however and it delivers in bags. So satisfying to drink. (16/8/17)

Re-rated, bottle from brewery. Now aged for 3 and a half years. Aroma is deep chocolate and hazelnuts. Aroma is dark malt, but with sediment. Taste is red wine and Belgian sweet dark malts. Finish is a little too fizzy for my liking this time. Praline aftertaste that resslly growson you, turning out to be more like the dark star creme brulee beer and yet you know there has been none of that stuff added.

1432,Westvleteren 12,"Westy 12 is hard to put into words. Damn hard. There’s so much mythology surrounding this beer. It’s obviously not easy to get, and as I found out, it’s not easy to keep a full glass of it. Pour is brown - mahogany glow when held to light. Malty and fruity aromas - there’s only malt sugar on the nose and not much at all in terms of alcohol sugar. Candied fig, prune, plum, raisin, date, brown sugar, molasses, caramel and dark bread bread flavors - that’s what I was able to pick out, but I’m sure there’s much more that I missed. This beer is a paradox. It’s deeply complex, yet it’s so cohesive that you could just easily drink it without giving it much thought. I’ll tell you what you don’t taste: booze. Mouthfeel is ""velvety,"" ""silky"" - pick whatever adjective you want to describe how soft it is. It seems impossibly smooth for the 10.2% ABV.

 Later I had the opportunity to enjoy the others they produce but they were very good but not this good.

Pours very dark with a thick, stable light-beige top.
Aroma is splendid! It feels like it almost fills up my entire room with christmas spices, nuts, honey, chocolate, rasins, dried fruits and yeast. Aroma has also a hint of freshly baked dark bread in it.
Taste is vey complex, the first sip felt really intense with yeast, alchol, bread, caramel and malt. Then the taste starts to build and change and turns into an explosion if different ejoyable tastes - honey, roasted bread, honey, beeswax, pepper, cardamum... It is hard to describe, one just has to taste it. It feels really smooth and velvety actually.
It is funny as I felt alcohol in the first sip but later the taste of alcohol is almost completely gone - it is really well masked, it feels almost like a light beer.
Aftertaste has almost everything nice in it, also a hint of hoppy bitterness. And I can feel very nice alcoholic warmth in the back of my throat and in my stomach.

Zetknięcie z legendą raczej na minus, piękny ciemny kolor, utrzymująca się piana ale strasznie wysokie wysycenie i cała masa osadu na dnie. Aromat piękny, owocowy, w smaku bardzo dobre, alkohol niewyczuwalny. Bardzo pijalne, ale zdecydowanie dla mnie to nie jest najlepsze piwo na świecie. 9/3/8/4/16=4.0. Edit, butelka z datą 16.06.19.
Aromat: świeże i słodkie gruszki, suszone jabłka, morele, brzoskwinie, suszona śliwka, rodzynki. Niezbyt mocny ale przyjemny, bardzo estrowy, dużo białych owoców.
Wygląd: osadu w butelce niewiele, piękna ciemnoczerwona miedź, piana wysoka, jasnokremowa, drobnopęcherzykowa, chwilę się trzyma.

Bardzo owocowe, owoce świeże i suszone, gruszki, śliwki, jabłka, rodzynki, morele, brzoskwinie, daktyle, jeżyny. Goryczy niedużo, takiej jaka jest w skórkach suszonych owoców. Bardzo dobrze ułożone i zbalansowane, niezwykle bogate. 
Odczucie: pełne, alkohol ułożony, wysycenie trochę wysokie, finisz gorzkawy, bardzo przyjemny posmak w ustach, taki od słodkich, dojrzałych owoców.
Całość: bardzo dobre, bogate piwo, kiedyś nie miało sobie równych, ale czas płynie naprzód i wypłynęła cała masa świetnych piw i to nie robi już takiego wrażenia. Tak wysoka ocena wynika też pewnie z statusu piwa kultowego i ciężkiej dostępności kiedyś.

1490,Westvleteren 12,"Tasted side by side with a st bernardus 12 and a rochefort 10. Whilst the rumours that the bernardus recipe is identical to this beer may be true, the fact is that there is definitely something different in the process. For starters, they look different. The bernardus has patchy tan head whereas the westy has pillowy white head. The bernardus has more spice on the nose whereas the westy has exactly what you expect from the westmalle yeast; caramel, dark fruits, raisins, clove and a hint of banana. This is noticeably more balanced than the bernardus. Very easy drinking. Certainly one of the best beers in the world. However, try it side by side with the rochefort 10 and there is no comparison. Rochefort has a better aroma and flavour. This is deservedly known as one of the best quads in the world, but Rochefort is noticeably better in my personal opinion.

I was eager to share this legendary beer with friends, who all enjoyed it. It poured a cloudy brown with a small tan head that lingered on top like whipped cream, which left some lacing behind.

Piwo, nieprzerwanie od całkiem dobrego kawałka czasu piastuje zaszczytne pierwsze miejsce na podium ratebeer. 

Piana tworzy się wysoka, ""sycząca"", względnie szybko opada i ładnie okleja brzegi szklanki, spodziewałbym się wysokiego wysycenia, acz okazało się, że się myliłem. 

W barwie, czarne z ciemnobrązowymi refleksami, nieprzejrzyste acz klarowne 

Zapach tworzą nuty szlachetnego alkoholu i ciemnych owoców: daktyle, ciemnie winogrona 

Smak jest wielowymiarowy i złożony, niemniej zbalansowany: daktyle, rodzynki, figi, przypieczony karmel, winogrona, nuta szlachetnego alkoholu, porto. Jest tego naprawdę dużo. Średnia wytrawność, goryczka raczej niska, alkohol (10,2% ABV) wyczuwalna tylko w przełyku, przyjemna. Wysycenie niskie (co jak na piwo Belgijskie powinno dziwić), jednak robi to dobrze temu piwu - odczucie w ustach jest silniejsze i klarowniejsze.
Czy najlepsze piwo na świecie? Ciężko powiedzieć, z pewnością jednak najlepsze piwo trapistów i jedno z lepszych belgijskich albo nawet i na świecie. Nie do końca rozumiem jak na Westvleteren można się nie poznać i nie docenić - to naprawdę świetny kawałek piwowarskiego świata.",4.7

I’m sure I can just copy and paste what I had for the Bernardus Abt 12 in here, with minor modifications that probably have to do much more with the momentum, temperature, age of bottle, than with a true difference between these beers. Perhaps the greatest difference is the more pungent aroma of alcohol in this one, while the Bernardus seemed to be mellower. This is a reasonably fresh one, maximum 6 months old. This dark amber beer has those fruits in the cellar holding the main backbone of the aroma and taste. Alcohol on the aroma to start with, stronger, with freshly tanned leather and an explosion of apples, plums, peaches and apricots, old books and wooden crates, wicker baskets and dusty curtains, dark empty wine bottles and firewood, both on the aroma and flavours. It’s all so round and timeless, with sweet malts, vanilla and yeast…roasted almonds…wine… prunes…honey, tobacco leaves … wow!

My take it on it is this: it’s a really, really, good Belgian strong ale. If you’re a serious IPA drinker, calling this the best beer in the world would be like trying to explain to a classical music aficionado why Kanye West deserved a Grammy. For me, I thought it had an amazing apple-ness to it, enough toast/bread notes to subdue the sweetness, and a bit of an alcohol edge. It’s extremely flavorful and it sticks around, laces the glass, and all those things you’d want to see in a great beer. Best I’ve ever had? Unsure. Worth hunting for the taste? Sure, why not.

1542,Westvleteren 12,"330ml bottle watching Dumb and Dumber on Christmas Day 2021. 2020 bottle. Probably the best I've tasted in years. Excellent balance of flavours with that teasing caramel sweetness creeping through. When everything is in harmony like this, this beer is just incredible. 

October 31st 2016: 330ml bottle, fresh 6 weeks old. Don’t know why I’ve not rated before. Just noticed. Pours hazy reddish brown, frothy off-white head. Aroma is dark belgian yeast, treacle sweetness, grains. Taste is smooth, surprisingly light and finishes dry. Light nuances of treacle, brown sugar, leather with smooth ripened red berry and chocolate notes emerging as it warms. Lovely beer as always but, as always, it seems to lack a certain punch, finishing dryer than desired.",4.7

It follows the aroma, but flavours are multiplied by hundred - sweetish, fermented plums, raisins, caramel, toffee, roasted grains and again cinnamon and cloves. Coffee also comes to mind. Alcoholic, but subdued presence. Full body, medium carbonation, long sweetish & spicy finish. Lives up to the hype? Absolutely!",4.4

Sweet bread, toffee, very complex taste, many layers, notes of licorice. Full bodied and goes down easy. I dig this style and this beer and also all the monk stuff. Very good beer,",4.3

AROMA: muy complejo, dulce y ligeramente licoroso, notas a caramelo, toffee, frutos oscuros como ciruela, pasas, dátiles e higos, lo condimentado de la levadura belga, algunas notas vinosas discretas, nueces y ligeramente licorosa.

SABOR: complejo al igual que el aroma, de inicio es dulce, después le da paso a muchas intensidad en el sabor con notas a caramelo, toffee, frutos oscuros muy maduros como ciruela, pasas, dátiles e higos, el especiado de la levadura belga, nueces, todo bien balanceado e integrado, no compite uno con el otro y presente por capas que se repiten una y otra vez, quiero decir, paladeas el caramelo, luego los frutos, luego la levadura y así una y otra vez, mucha permanencia de los sabores en boca; el retrogusto queda un amargor ligero, dulce sin ser empalagoso o astringente.

SENSACIÓN: cuerpo medio con mediana baja carbonatación, el alcohol no se siente, sólo algo cálido al recorrer la garganta.

The notes permeate the aftertaste and coat the palate in a very satisfying way. Not sure it lives up to the ""best beer in the world"" hype, but honestly how could it have?

Mouthfeel: Sirupy and thick. Carbonation is not dominant, which is nice. Really lovely.

Pours clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with a only a light warmth present after the finish. Overall this is an insane quadrupel style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Very similar to Abt 12; but this one had more nutty/biscuity malt complexity and a better mouthfeel. A highly amazing offering all around, as I had hoped for.",4.5

Fruit/spice on the nose. Medium to full bodied, hides alcohol quite well. Spice and fruit continue on tasting. Quite a bit of sweetness as you might expect.

To be absolutely honest here, I’ve had this beer exactly 3 times, and the last time I took notes and rated it was September of 2014... I’ve had a hell of a damn year and a half, so this seems like a lifetime ago, but hey... let’s finally enter the damn rating. 







The beer pours a hazy dark brown with a good big head and nice lacing on the glass.



The aroma is all manor of plum and brown sugar with some light spice, some booze, a good healthy nuttiness, a teensy bit of roastiness and some light pear. 



The flavor is enjoyably spicy with some well managed booziness and a bit of grape character. Yeah it’ got the cool pear on plum thing with the mild nuttiness, which is really where it’s @ with Quad. It’s got light chocolate, and a particular je ne sais quoin that even a skeptic (like myself) cannot deny. 

It is a great beer that I’ve put too much of a fuss over in the past, in fact it’s about #3 for me from the 3 beers I’ve had from this particular brewery, but yes, it’s essentially ""worth the fuss""",4.0

1674,Westvleteren 12,I really can’t understand the fuss around Westvleteren beer. It is a really good tasting beer like so many others. It doesn’t stand out compared to Sint-Bernardus or Rochefort. I think the high ratings have more to do by the fact this is a hard to get beer and the whole hype around the brand then the actual beer itself.,3.5

Pojedyńcze kropeczki pozostają gdzieniegdzie na szle.


Zapach : Cholernie rozbudowany i złożony. Jest tu praktycznie wszystko co w belgijskich piwach najpiękniejsze.

Piwo jest niesamowicie gęste. Alkohol bardzo dobrze ukryty, chciaż drażni przyjemnie przełyk, szczególnie po ogrzaniu.
Goryczka owocowa, niska do średniej. 


Wysycenie: Agresywne nagazowanie. Po otworzeniu piwo wprost chciało wyskoczyć z butelki. Minimalny gushing. 


Podsumowanie:  


Westvleteren to genialne , nieziemskie i jedyne w swoim rodzaju piwo. Nawet najbardziej znienawidzony krytyk piw belgijskich po spróbowaniu 
XII-ki - zmienia zdanie.
Piwo jest nadludzko aromatyczne, bogate w doznania od pierwszego do ostatniego łyka.
Jest tak niesamowicie złożone w smaku i zapachu, że aż niesposób wymienić jego wszystkie walory.
Postaram się wymienić chociaż z 15 nut jakie udało mi się wyłapać w smaku i zapachu: winogrona, figi, granaty, śliwki, miód, wanillia, burbon, belgijskie drożdże, karmel, toffi, rodzynki, ciemna czekolada, likier owocowy, przyprawy.

Enjoy this one without overthinking things!

10.2%ABV. Abt/Quadrupel. 

Poured out of the bottle a dark amber brown, 28ºSRM.

Nose has berries and cherries. Pleasant rich alcoholic sweetness of rum raisins. Faint yeasty aroma with formic tartness on the nose. Subtle spice like cinnamon.

Mouthfeel is alcoholic and syrupy. There is adequate carbonation which is balances out the palate very nicely. Palate is ponderous with dark roasty flavors up front: espresso, dark chocolate, almost burnt barley toast, there is just enough breadth in the palate for an umami component to suggest burnt char siew ends. The middle of the palate is nicely rounded and endowed with fruity flavors: ripe dark cherries, honey plums, dates, prunes and stewed fruit. Because of the residual from the front of the palate, you get the impression of cherry liqueur dark chocolate candies. The palate is surprisingly light riding on a whisky smoky, alcoholic palate. No cloying sweetness. All the carbs in this this have been turned to beautiful aromatic alcohol.

Finish is clean without the expected cloy. 

Overall impression. Dangerously approachable. Quickly kicks you in the ass.

1691,Westvleteren 12,"330 ml bottled 09.10.16, so if the 3 year rule is true, this was bottled Oct. 2013, two months before I bought and then cellared it. Good age for a try I guess.

Medium gusher. Dark brown body, with a big, frothy, moderately lacing, beige head.

Smooth, sweet aroma of caramel, almond, brown sugar, milk chocolate, sweet dark berries, dried fruits.

Very smooth, complex taste, with caramel, brown sugar, nuts, cocoa, almond, dried fruits, some spices, some sour fruits, subtle alcohol.

Medium, a bit creamy mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation.

Finishes smooth, medium dry, warm, medium sweet, slightly roasty-bitter, with cocoa, caramel, dark fruits, some spices.



Not my very favourite Belgian beer, or among my favourite beers in general, but definitely world class and one of the best trappists for sure. Greatly balanced, very smooth, but also pretty complex. I’m just missing the last bit I can’t appoint for such a highly rated beer.",4.2
1692,Westvleteren 12,"0,33lt bottle @ Valentin - Curious Bierkniepe, Volos, Greece
Very nice quadrupel, but the hype is more than the beer itself - maybe the difficulties to get this beer help to that a lot.
Anyway, it IS very good - complex, deep, with long aftertaste. I think though similar to the Rochefort 10, just with a fuller body, it;s more thick. The foam will last not long, the smell is like a wine, sweet malt and a bit alcohol. The taste has also the great malt as well some bitterness (had an aged one too, there you get less carbonation and more, deeper sweetness, very nice). Aftertaste is long. Better at about 15 degrees Celsius.
Bravo, the monks drink good beer...",4.6
1693,Westvleteren 12,"Best beer or not, thats debatable, but you simply cannot go around the fact that this is one of the best beers around. It is a perfectly balanced brew, or damn close to it. full body, long finish,",5.0
1694,Westvleteren 12,"Because of the standing of this beer, I was expecting something great or at least really good. But as with most top 10 or top 50 RB beers, this was simply another let down after tasting more than 4500 other beers, I know there are so many other great tasting beers out there that I’m not sure how this gets to the top of the list, perhaps the difficulty in acquiring it comes into play? I am finally beginning to realize that I must not like really good beer, go figger. From a bottle this beer poured a darker brew but not real dark, more of a lighter brown. Had a decent head that faded rapidly to a thin creamy foam which provided nice lacing. Initial taste impression was strong yet smooth and somewhat civilized and this is nothing out of the ordinary for many lower rated beers. Warming sensations as it transversed my mouth to the gullet. Some unexpected bitterness in the session, I thought it could have a few more manners. However, for 10% it did not provide an alky impact that was in yer face, tho it certainly was apparent and somewhat volatile on the olfactory -I guess that was a good thing. Flavors were simply alky laced old country trappest beer, nothing more. Decent co2, but not half the effect of a good Orval. The finish was the kind of feeling that you get when you drink a medium good trippel or even a misbehaved dubbel. So, overall, another letdown. I waited 10 years to try this and the build up to this night’s tasting was not worth it but I was finally glad to get this off my bucket list. If you want a good quad experience, Sierra Nevada Ovila Quad is much better than this brew, JMHO. Quite a letdown.

1698,Westvleteren 12,"The bottle I used to drink was a little bit shaken so the beer was full of CO2. 
Although the beer was quite cold the aroma was amazing in every breath I took I felt sweet fruits and other nice things, I almost did not feel yeast aroma which I dislike in belgian beers. 
As the beer was warmer the aroma was better. I must say that the colour of this beer was amazing, but the head was frothy but not very sustainable. 
The taste is also an amazing thing a variety of tastes that I can not name in English, but it’s sweet, fruity and well-balanced.
I would prefer to drink it a later and the alcohol would be more balanced but it was really good :)",4.4
1699,Westvleteren 12,"Uno al afrontar esta cerveza, debe dejar atrás todas las expectativas que trae. Que sea calificada como muchos como la mejor cerveza del mundo juega en su contra, y puede que en la de quien la pruebe, aguándole un poco la experiencia. Es una cerveza que basa su mito en la poca disponibilidad y en su precio derivado de ello, acompañado de la calidad y delicadeza y complejidad de una Trappense. ¿Si es la mejor Trappense? es muy posible, para gustos colores. Para mi la Westmalle dubbel sería la Trappense que le recomendaría a un amigo por la relación calidad precio.
En definitiva, la Westvleteren XII se diferencia poco en calidad a sus hermanas Trappenses (como Rochefort o Westmalle), aunque seguramente se trate de la mejor de ellas, según mi opinión personal, pero el mayor esfuerzo para adquirirla, no compensará al bebedor normal.
En cuanto a sus notas de cata, sorprende su gran equilibrio de sabores, no destacando ninguna por encima de las demás. Su característico dulzor, en ningún momento llega a empalagar, y pese a su alta graduación no se nota ningún regusto alcohólico.",4.3

Dark brown colour with some particles inside, beige head. Aroma is very rich, full, dried fruits, cheries, chocolate, spicy, tobaco, wood. Very promissing. Taste is also much of dried fruits, cheries in chocolate, wood, casks, some noble alcohol - bourbon like. Accurate carbonation, high drinkability for 10% alc.vol.  This is a great beer. Very good.

Pours a very murky, dirty brown color. Head is tan and 1/4th of an inch. Sediment is very evident throughout tasting. Head retention and lacing were above average. 

Smell is big on dried and candied fruits, dates, figs, even some apricot. Belgian rock candy is also very present. Slight soy sauce is there, hops are not, and alcohol is definitely there.

Taste is heavy on caramelized sugar, dates, and figs. Burnt malt is also apparent, with belgian yeast/ witch hazel also present. Hops arent present but alcohol flavor is high. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Head retention added slightly to the substance of the beer.

1711,Westvleteren 12,"1000th RATING!!! Have aged this for 3+ years, waiting for this momentous opportunity. It took me just shy of seven years here on RateBeer to get to 1000 ratings, so why not make it what is still rated as the best beer in the world? Bottle from the ""brick"" that Westvleteren made available by the monks on 12.12.12, purchased at Holiday Wine Cellar where Mark graciously held one of the bricks for me while I was out of town on business ($84.99 for six-pack ""brick"" with two glasses). My firstborn child was born on 10.28.2012 and I assume that this was packaged around the same time as his birth...will save and age a couple of the bottles for sharing with him on his 18th or 21st birthday (previously drank two bottles so I still have three left). POURS a deep brown hue with red/purple/garnet highlights and two fingers of loud fizzy beige foam that reduced to one finger but holds. AROMA is quite complex with various notes of raisins and other dried/candied fruit (cherries, figs, dates), tawny port, buttery caramel, honey, Belgian yeast, and mild Christmas spicing. FLAVOR is equally complex with notes of port wine, dark grapes, thick toffee, molasses, overripe dark fruit, sweet dark berries, nutty malts, dry oak, and hints of chocolate and dry spice. Flavor definitely becomes richer as it warms...each sip reveals a different nuance than the previous one. Odd that such a high ABV beer has such big carbonation, but it adds to the mouthfeel and perception of flavor. The high alcohol is utterly concealed and it is not too heavy on the palate, making this a very easy quaff. Amazing that this much flavor and complexity can be coaxed from the basic beer ingredients (plus candi sugar) alone without barrel aging...though I think my own three years of cellar aging has helped. An absolutely amazing beer, and I am looking forward to more years on RateBeer as well as sharing this with my son in another 1.5 decades down the line. (3501, 1000)",4.7

1729,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a dark brown color, with some red undertone on the light. Fairly big and quite lasting tan colored head. Right after opening a strong honey aroma. Following are some sourish cellar notes with a mix of spices joinig in. They have a peppery feel somehow. Dry fruits in the back with biscuity/caramel presence. Starts sweet, honey presence again, malty, biscuity with some woody feel to it. A bit spicy with quite noticeable alcohol warmth. Full, thick and creamy body. Complex as hell, both aroma and taste. Not a fan of the style in general, but this one really is special.",4.0

1733,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from Ed (HighWine) -- my first bottle traded on RateBeer. Cheers! Tasted side-by-side with an St.Bernadus Abt. 12 and did a blind tasting with 5 people. I expected that we’d really struggle to identify which was which, but all 5 of us (3 real beer drinkers and 2 total newbies) picked out the Westy immediately. It is that good. Extremely nuanced and complex flavors of stone fruit, raisins, candy, and bread are all subtly present, and the yeast flavor is distinctly Belgian but never dominates. Worth the hunt.",4.6
1734,Westvleteren 12,"Im Glas zeigt sich das Trappistenbier dunkelbraun, trüb mit sahnigem hellem sehr beständigem Schaum. Das Quadrupel hat einen tollen süßen Malzkörper mit Aromen von angebranntem Karamell, getrockneten Früchten, Pflaumen, Rosinen, etwas Kräuterprinten und Nüssen. Dabei hat es ein sehr weiches Mundgefühl. Sehr runde Sache und von mir eine klare Empfehlung!",4.4
1735,Westvleteren 12,"Scadenza sul tappo giallo al dicembre 2014.
Si presenta marrone tonaca di frate, quasi mogano, scura. Schiuma beige-biancastra, frizzantina e di minima persistenza. Al naso spezie, dark fruits, fico, uvetta e una generale alcolicità, per una buona complessità. Al palato migliora, eccezionale. Molto presente l’alcol e la bevuta è sostenuta da una frizzantezza marcata ma, stranamente, che accompagna molto bene. Ingresso dolce di caramello, ancora spezie e dark fruits per una buona intensità e una certa vinosità. Il corpo è deciso e pieno, consistenza liscia e non molto oleosa. Finale non molto lungo e piuttosto pulito, che bilancia bene la generale dolcezza. Una birra di grandissimo spessore, ma che non ritengo superiore nel complesso ad altri baluardi come rochefort 10 o pannepot ecc, di sicuro non vale più del doppio del prezzo nonostante le sue indubbie qualità",4.5

1737,Westvleteren 12,"From notes on 9/12/15. Drinking across the street from the monastery at In De Vredes. This is very similar to Abt 12. Possibly more aroma and flavor. Seems to be on the bitter end. 

Anyways, poured from a bottle. Nice dark caramel body. Big fluffy head. Tastes is huge dark roast with tons of sweet prunes.",4.8

1739,Westvleteren 12,"Complex, smooth, flavorsom and well balanced. I though people were exaggerating its qualities given the rareness and the price, but my god they arnt. It something to admire and allow to roll round your mouth to reveal its texture and complex taste. But even by simply sipping it you can tell that this is a special beer.

Drank from the bottle at North Bar, Leeds.",4.7
1740,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle (BB 01.10.18). So it’s finally time to taste the #1 beer here. I’m really excited! The current average score is a phenomenal 4.44, but will it live up to the massive hype? Let’s see. Pours a dark brown body with a medium tall beige head. Aroma has some fresh dark bread, Belgian yeast, ripe grapes, prunes. Hoppiness is dry and earthy. Taste is very smooth, there’s caramel, prunes, a bready note here and there. Grapey notes emerge occasionally. Finish adds something mildly nutty. The alcohol is generally smooth and presents itself as a warm afterglow. In comparison to other Trappist beers, I think taste-wise it’s actually closest to an aged bottle of Rochefort 8. I don’t see too big similarities with St. Bernardus Abt 12, which is the beer that gets compared to this one the most. The only thing in common seems to be the nutty aftertaste. In comparison to Rochefort 10, it’s smoother and more easily drinkable but the level of complexity is not quite up there. So my favourite Trappist after Orval remains Rochefort 10. This one deserves a solid ""4"" but not much more. It is a great beer but certainly not the best beer in the world and not even the best Trappist.",4.0

1743,Westvleteren 12,"2007 bottle. Pours an opaque brown with a quickly dissipating beige bubbly head. Aroma of sherry, dried fruit, fig, currants, raisins, molasses, spice.

1744,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle 33cl. Deep black with a fluffy off white head. Rich aroma of wood, sweetness, bitterness and malts. The taste starts mildly bittersweet. Then it develops into a rich bouquet of sweetness, a metallic bitterness combined with a warm glow of alcohol. It’s too rich to describe really, never tasted anything like it.",4.7
1745,Westvleteren 12,"Pours murky red brown with thin line of head. Aroma; Dried dark and red fruits, toffee, plumes, caramel, dades and some alcohol notes.

1761,Westvleteren 12,Caramelly plum and date aroma with Christmas spice. Complex flavor of dried fruits mostly plum and spice with firm bitterness in the end. Dry finish. Extraordinary.,4.6
1762,Westvleteren 12,"Supposedly the best beer in the world...and I managed to get my hands on a bottle. Don’t ask how. Pours brown with a decent light brown head. Nose is the expected fruits and caramel notes of a well-made quad and is absolutely delicious. Flavor is rich and probably the smoothest of any belgian I’ve ever had...there’s nothing surprising here, just an incredibly high quality quad. Finish is a little sticky and long. Damn good stuff indeed.",4.8
1763,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle best before 16 September 2018. Pours a dark brown colour with a reddish hue and with a foamy head which laces well. The aroma is quite strong with sweet malt, sugar and fruit, maybe cocoa. The taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter with a slight sourness and a lasting dry and spicy finish. The beer is viscous with a smooth mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this beer.",4.5
1764,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle pour, split with Andrewje41, thanks for finding this one and splitting it with me, amazing beer to try, and one we have wanted to for a long time. Bottled on September 30th, rich amber pour with a thin soft white head, lot of carb, more then I expected, little sweet, raisin, almost a oak bourbon flavor, hides the ABV very well. This beer is very easy to sip and grows on me more and more, really like this beer, more than I expected.",4.5
1765,Westvleteren 12,"Yet another classic milestone type beer on a not so milestone event. I’m very okay with this type of living. I’m not sure what was more difficult. Obtaining a bottle of this, or mastering the pronunciation of the brewery. I really wanted to save this for my 1838th rating (matching the year the historic brewery first opened), but that’s a tough waiting game to play, and I can’t hold a backlog for more than a few days. I wish I could have tried this in a blind situation, to know for sure if this is as incredible as it seems. One thing that is for certain, upon pouring this, my first thought was ""this is a beautiful beer."" Best by 9/30/2018, so according to my researched math, this is pretty damn fresh. Shipped to me with prompt and precision by Beer of Belgium. Thanks guys! I’ll contact you guys again for sure. Pours a dark, ruby, dusty brown color with a swirl of tan active fizz head. It’s hard to put a hyped beer like this into words, when I’ve been dying with curiosity on the subject for as long as I’ve enjoyed beer. Tried my best to pour this at the proper cellar temp. I feel like I got it as close as its gonna get. Sweet plum like aroma. Flavor is very complex with raisin, smooth semi sweet. Rum like hints throughout. Oakey. Has a very nice warming palate that gets better and better. By far the smoothest, finest drinking quad I’ve ever had. In a style that is always a rough go for me, this is a masterpiece for sure. I would very much enjoy an opportunity to open one of these on random special occasions. This beer is not perfect to me, but damn is it good. I wonder what’s next.",4.5
1766,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at Sin & Redemption in Toronto. The bottle was CAD 22, which makes € 15.2 - for comparison, at Get Well they said it was CAD 40! No info about bottling date or BB. (Edit: ah, that was on the cap... didn’t get to see that!)



Poured carefully into a Duvel chalice. Dark, murky, coppery brownish colour with a thin layer of light beigeish head that seems to be thickening as the bubbles rise in the middle. Looks really funny and entertaining. It really is increasing rather than decreasing - WTF? How is this possible?! .... Massive amounts of bits n pieces floating around. The head retains until the very end. The aroma strikes at first as brandy-like, but not at all overly so (it’s rather cold at the moment), it’s malty and plummy, nutty. Estery fruitiness, a bit of old basement dust and rotten apples. As it warms, I even get some chocolate. The first sip leaves a lip-shaped hole in the foam. It’s really sweet, caramelly, jammy, it fills the mouth the moment you touch it with your tongue. No alcohol felt, but I love how it maintains its brandy- or cognac-like character I got in the aroma. The carbonation is active, body full. Really nice soothing warmth in the throat, nearing heat really. The alcohol stays out of sight, only appearing as this increasing warmth in the throat. It’s got that same problem I have with strong, caramel-forward beers - even if they’re excellent at first, they later (half-way through) begin to aqcuire a metallic taste and shallow mouthfeel. Maybe it’s the palate-numbing alcohol? All in all I must say, it lives up to the hype. Loved it. I really did.



The moment I arrived back home, I learned they now sell it in many places in Tallinn. Damn it. At least the bottle I had was way cheaper.



Edit: another try, a while later. Got a bottle from Uba ja Humal in Tallinn, for € 17-18. BB 11.03.2018. The head is much less as entertaining as it was when I last (first) had it. Massive bits still floating... Even though I’ve had it sit still in the fridge for months... The head retains but only as an uneven film. Lace? Somewhat. Aroma and flavour still similar to what I’ve written above. But seems boozier than before. Less as interesting. Wouldn’t rate it as high now... Damn. What the hell, was the initial 4.3 really because of the hype? Or is my palate that much numbed? (Currently my 3rd beer of the night.) Pretty harsh on the palate too - thin and very active carbonation... Hm.



I gave it 5/5 appearance last time, that must have been for the ’entertaining’ head, but now, goddamn, it doesn’t look good! Lowering from 5 to 3. Palate goes from 4 to 3... And aroma from 9 to 8. 



One more bottle in the fridge. Will see (in a year?!?) how it seems then...",4.0
1767,Westvleteren 12,"Denne Westvleteren 12 har en meget flot mørk brunlig farve og et lidt uklar som passer perfekt til øllen. Desuden har den et medium skum.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 – bottling date 02.12.2014 – Best Before 02.12.2017

Appearance: Dark brown, almost black, slightly off white head. Excellent head retention. Head is very creamy and made up of tightly packed bubbles. Some lacing that has dried out on side of glass as I am taking my time to drink this thick, sticky brew.

Aroma: Port wine and malt.

Taste: Brown bread. Long lasting sweet, malty Horlicks aftertaste. All bran with warm milk taste is quite strong. Port in the middle. What really stands out is just how long the taste lasts after swallowing. 

Mouth feel: Smooth, creamy and dry at the end.

Overall: I was extremely tired when reviewing this and unfortunately was unable to pick out the aromas as I would have liked. Will revisit. Prefer this over the Rochefort 10 that I had last night, but this is a little older and IF the Rochefort 10 is anything like the 8, it tastes much better with a little longer behind it, once the yeast has settled down.",4.8

Il primo sorso impressiona per l’intensità, per la potenza, e per il dolce: ondata di uvetta e prugna, con una nota amara finale di erbe officinali e di china. Emergono note di banana matura, di biscotto e di caramello, ma sopratutto note ossidate che la portano nel territorio di vini come Porto, Sherry o Madeira, Passito. La bevuta diventa molto interessante, con una straordinaria intensità e, soprattutto, con l’alcool (10.2%) nascosto in modo incredibile. Il dolce è stemperato - come detto - da una chiusura di china e di erbe officinali, una lieve pausa prima del sontuoso retrogusto, etilico, morbido ed appagante, fruttato e lunghissimo.",5.0
1776,Westvleteren 12,"I know this is hyped, but wow, does it live up to it. Incredibly aroma of sweet molasses and dates and deliciousness.

There is a wonderful caramel malt and a dark fruit presence that is really nice. There is just such a complexity and I love it! The flavor is really good also. Caramel, dark fruits, and figs accompany a brilliant butterscotch. There is a little bit of an apple cider finish to it, which is way too smooth.

Taste: Wow! Brown sugar, caramel malt, carmelized sugar, some dark notes of coffee and leather, dark bread, riasin, dried fruit and molasses. It?s beatiful!

Palate is loads bigger than 8, with deeply intense notes of dark fruit - figs, dates, raisinated grapes - toffee, molasses, cinnamon, clove, allspice, pecan. Middle onwards the beer dries out and spices and nuts become more prominent along with stone minerality. Bitterness in the finish from moderate roast counteracts the complex fruit flavours and harmonizes with the spicebox character. Mouthfeel is medium full, creamy soft carb, no alcohol. As expected, a lot of the same touchstones of flavour as the 8, but more intense and richer. Feels much better in the mouth.

Pours a murky reddish brown with a surprising off white head. Chunky and sedimenty. Collar of foam. Sherry and other oxidized aromas comes through first. Very fruity. The caramel malt still comes through. Tastes significantly better than the aroma. The oxidation makes it a little creamier. Lots of sherry. No booze. Buckets of dark fruit.

At fist the aroma and taste were weak. Unpleasant carbonated because I repeatedly belched. And no perfect look as it’s head was small and irregular with different sized bubbles.

My fist notes were coffee, cherries and spices. But when the beer got warmer, his real potential came more noticeable. More sweetness, more dried fruits, spicyness, chocolate and of course the alcohol. Quite complex, but not as much I remembered.

Thanks to my little brother for picking it up at John’s Grocery for me, and thanks to pepsican for packing it up and shipping it here. Pours clear dark mahogany with ruby highlights into the chipped St Bernardus chalice Eugene scored for me. Tan head lasts briefly, only as long as the pour. Aroma: deep and rich. Plums, dark fruit, toffee, bread, dough, molasses, and grape. Intoxicating. Pretty much everything I could hope for in a quad. Despite being nearly 3 years old now, it doesn’t strike me as ""old"" -- still vibrant with no perceptible cardboard (well, maybe just a bit right down at the end if I’m looking extra hard for it). Taste follows, with rich delectable molasses sweetness that is still nowhere near cloying. Alcohol is clearly present, but not harsh. Palate: full body, silky luxurious texture, soft-to-average carbonation. Overall: Most of the 6-pack is gone now -- shared with friends or given as gifts.

Much more interesting flavour than the 2 other Westvleteren. It’s more like drinking an old mature wine. Is it what I like? No. I like the fresh hops and definite not sweet beers. Don’t get me wrong. This is an ok beer, but nothing more than that. I’m trying to figure out why this is such an attractive beer, and the only reason I can come up with is that it is very difficult to get. Nothing more than that. Sorry. There are so many more interesting beers out there.",3.3
1865,Westvleteren 12,"0.33 l bottle from 'Ace Drinks', best before April 2026, bottled three years before.

Quite sweet, malty, gently bitter, rather yeasty-spicy and slightly fruity taste of marzipan, clove, overripe banana, raisins, prunes, dates, candi sugar, lovage and even light chocolate, followed by a medium long, gently bitter, slightly boozy and minimally roasty finish. Medium to full body, smooth and quite effervescent mouthfeel, average to lively carbonation. Tasty Quad, quite complex, but definitely not as mind-blowing as when I tried it for the first time.

0,33 l bottle from drankgigant.nl, bottled on 2/4/2014 (just over a year old). Clear, very dark ruby with a huge, foamy, almost stable, tan head. Lovely, fruity-malty aroma of figs, raisins, cherries, plums, nuts and red wine with a slightly alcoholic touch. Very intense, sweetish, fruity-malty aroma of prunes, raisins, ripe cherries, figs, nuts and toffee, followed by roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Pleasant, long, relatively hoppy and warming, alcoholic finish with a bit of rum. Full body, very creamy texture, lively carbonation. Finally! Stored it for almost a year and have not been disappointed. Very rich and complex with a wide range of flavours while being very intense.

In the mouth, it’s big and complex, with lots of caramel and toffee, plums, dried fruit, lots of dark sugar, and yeast. It finishes with a really spicy bite at the back, with a distinct hint of alcohol in the background. The palate is thick and rich, with quite lively carbonation.

flavor is nice and dark. mostly brown sugar and black bread, and a little bit of rum, chocolate, and hop bitterness. more bitter and has less fruity esters than other comparable trappist brews.

The alcohol is nog prominent at all, but gives this warm glowing sensation. Indeed a good beer, however overpriced.",4.1
1886,Westvleteren 12,Belgian beers aren’t often my bag. They’re usually an esthery yeastfest with no real malt to them.

1912,Westvleteren 12,"When I heard about how highly regarded this beer was, my first thought was ""bah!"". Living in Amsterdam, I decided to seek out a place that carries them, and managed to find a small local dealer selling them at €16 per 12 oz. bottle. 

Pricey, yes. But the beer is Truly an astounding one. The color appears dark-brownish at first, but when held to the light, presents a deep reddish-gold. The head was tan colored, almost brown. Aroma was alright, but the taste is where it's at.

For an 11%, the taste is incredibly smooth. For how rich of a flavor, it's surprising drinkable. If it wasn't so rare and expensive Id be buying this beer regularly! I got hints of citrus, chocolate, coffee, and even caramel. Carbonation was perfect. 

It's a funny thing drinking this beer, you really do enjoy it, but end up drinking it so fast that you are wanting another! My only regret staring into my empty glass that's coated with the savory foam, is that I didn't buy another. 

10/10. I won't say it's the best beer ever, because that's just assuming everyone ha the same preferences. But I will say that it is truly, honestly, well balanced. It's the beer that I'd love to serve at a party, because anyone drinking it would love the smooth, easy-going-yet-complex flavor out of it. Simpletons can enjoy it, and the most-dedicated beer lovers will have no quarrel with siting down with a bottle of this. 

The monks at Westvleteren know what their doing. I'm glad that they are non-profit. It makes this beer special, and drinking it reminds you that they care about quality above all. ""Quantity"" in their lexicon is simply stating ""greed"", and this rare treat for me is worth remembering. 

I would like to get drunk with those monks.",4.9

Between my brother and and I we think we can taste fig, caramel, and light vanilla, can barely taste the alcohol, light light bitter end. Creamy and well carbed.

1917,Westvleteren 12,"Uitgeschonken in Westvleteren bokaal, zalig aroma van rozijnen, vers brood, noten en chocolade. Diepe donkerbruine kleur met zachte rode gloed, met beige schuimkraag die terugzakt tot lage kring van schuim. De smaak is zeer complex, en zacht. Je proeft tonen van karamel, honing, rozijnen, vijgen, pruimen, vers brood en banket. Verder ook cacao, als in Belgische pralines, met hazelnoot, ook nog zachte specerijen als kaneel en kardemom. Deze trappist is natuurlijk zeer gewild en zeldzaam, en ook terecht in mijn optiek. Het is een buitengewoon mooi en gebalanceerd bier. Er zitten ook zoete tonen in van gedroogd fruit en karamel, droge tonen van de specerijen en een perfecte bittere finish door de gebruikte hopsoorten. Het mondgevoel geeft een mooie carbonatie door en een zacht bitter smaakpallet in de afdronk. Naarmate het bier opwarmt komt de alcohol steeds nadrukkelijker naar voren, maar de balans blijft perfect. De afdronk is lang en zacht bitter. Is het dan de beste Trappist? Naar mijn idee wel, maar de Rochefort 10 doet er weinig voor onder. Dit geldt ook voor het abdij bier Sint Bernardus Abt. 12 die ook heel dichtbij deze smaakbeleving komt. Deze ga ik zo proeven ter vergelijking. Verder zeer veel respect voor de monniken van Westvleteren, voor dit uitzonderlijk Belgisch biergenot, wat met toewijding en geduld wordt gebrouwen.

Vergelijk Westvleteren 12 en Sint Bernardus Abt 12: De bieren lijken op elkaar, maar de Westvleteren heeft een verfijnder aroma dan de Sint Bernardus, ook iets zachter van smaak en iets verfijnder en subtieler qua complexiteit en smaaklagen.Toch net iets lekkerder. De Sint Bernardus is iets scherper en kruidiger, maar komt toch heel dichtbij betreft smaak en aroma. Een goedkoper maar toch volwaardig alternatief. Beide bieren zijn uitstekende quadrupels en van een zeer hoog niveau, maar de Westvleteren heeft mijn voorkeur, door het meer verfijnde aroma en smaakpallet. De gebruikte gist is toch verschillend. Deze bieren horen beide tot de beste Belgische bieren die er zijn. Maar de Westvleteren 12 is onovertroffen.",4.8

1939,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Back to back tasting with St Bernardus (SB) 12. Dark brown, fizzy head which dissipates quickly, high carbonation. SB wins, just looks nicer. Intense and robust aroma: cherry infused with red wine, sangria/gluhwein, parsnip, cassis, old sunflower oil (deep fryer oil), hairspray lacing. SB is sweeter: chocolate, prunes, some basement funk. Westvleteren wins. On to the taste: overwhelmingly robust and intense experience. Cherry and wine combo returns, dark raisins and chocolate in the development, sour high with perfect aftertaste (sweet, hint of chocolate). Nice warm alcohol feeling in the mouth. SB: a more mellow version of the Westvleteren with hints of vanilla and a creamy lacing. Less powerful, but really close. Westvleteren wins. Overall, Westvleteren is the more robust and developed version of the two; it tastes a little better and is definitely more pronounced. Nonetheless, SB is a topnotch beer as well.",4.5
1940,Westvleteren 12,"A 3 year old aged bottle from tderoeck - Thanks! 

Pour into a taster glass showing dark brown, rust tinges and no head.

The nose shows grape must and hints of caramel with toffee. 

The palate is medium bodied, aggressively carbonated with a strong alcohol spiciness. A moderate caramel/cola-like sweetness with hints of caramel and toffee. 

Re-rating thanks Huhzubendah for sharing a 1.5 year old bottle! Poured into a tulip glass showing dark brown with rust tinges and half a finger of clean white foam. 

The nose shows sweet caramel, light raisins and dry plums with heavy Belgian yeast. 

The palate is fully carbonated and light bodied. Flavors show a perfectly balanced sweetness in caramel and dried fruit with a gently warming alcoholic spice throughout. Personally, having both an aged and a fresh bottle, this is the stage that perfectly showcases why the Westvleteren 12 holds the craft beer crown. Sweetness at the perfect balance, good body to maintain a great mouthfeel, perfect carbonation from the re-fermentation in bottle, and alcohol sufficiently calm to give a gentle rather than vigorous warmth.",4.4

all the usual Quad stuff. Yeast, spice, figs, bread, touch of licorice. Very sweet, full body, medium carbonation. Not very bitter.
No difference between this and Rochefort 10. I mean no.
I try to find something but they seem like the same drink. I look for small differences in e.g. carbonation or bitterness but no. Perhaps this is a milimeter more bitter than Rochefort, but still very close.
Off course the seven year old version is softer, more vinous. Also more complex. I like the age-thing

This one has it all: taste, density, looks, background story.

Aroma is full of dark fruits, there is plums and dates, figs, maybe some berries, light vanilla, hints of yeast.
Yeap, great taste. Sweet but not cloying, again plenty of plums and dates and figs and some raisins now, sugar, light caramel, vanilla, sweet red wine, black grapes, candy sugar, some spices even, barely notable alcohol.

This old Westvleteren is satisfyingly deep dark and sweet - without being overly so - with an aroma and taste of malt, plums, dates and raisins just starting the complex symphony.

The initial dark fruit taste mixes with a very rich bread flavor-  it reminds me of a bread pudding.  The most amazing for me is the palate-  incredibly smooth and creamy with no alcohol aftertaste whatsoever for a 10%abv.   Overall it is amazing, and as good as rochefort 10.

It actually smells silky. Coffee and caramel cake. No booze at all in the nose. Taste- loads of dark fruit- plum, raisin, prune, dates, sugary sweetness, boozy fruitcake, port, thick and bready, dark cherries- cherry brandy. The cherry becomes more prominent as it warms.

1982,Westvleteren 12,"Enfin ma première Westvleteren 12! Elle fait partie d’un style de bière qui n’est pas mon préféré, mais impossible de ne pas être excité en débouchant cette bière quasi mythique. Je la laisse reposer un peu à température pièce avant de l’ouvrir...



Elle se verse d’une manière admirable en laissant une mousse qui s’éteint assez rapidement et de façon constante. Au nez c’est très chargé! Fruits foncés et cassonade dominent la dance. Mais ce qui me marque le plus, c’est que malgré la grande et puissante complexité au niveau des odeurs, elle n’est pas ""too much"", elle arrive à demeurer dans une zone agréable et c’est un exploit avec tout ce qu’elle fait jaillir. En bouche, légèrement plus mince que je ne l’aurait souhaitée, mais je me rappelle rapidement qu’il s’agit d’une bière à 10.2%... Elle se débrouille plutôt bien finalement! L’alcool est d’ailleurs irréprochablement bien caché. Comme pour le nez, ce qui me marque le plus en bouche c’est cette intensité qui arrive toutefois à ne pas tomber sur le coeur.

1986,Westvleteren 12,"330ml bottle share with anstei. So I finally get to try this legendary beer. Dark brown color with small crisp head that disappears quickly. Aroma immediately gives candied sugar and dark fruits, forest strawberry, but also a maltiness there. The maltiness doesn’t go away, can’t be unseen now... Taste is rich, candied sugary, dark fruits, spices. Finish is heavy and sweet, with a nice hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is extremely crispy-foamy. Spices, berries maybe, sugar Liquorice and a bit boozy. More balanced than the Rochefort 10, but not as balanced as Bernardus. Interesting that these three Champions League beers of the Quadrupel style are all so different in their characteristics. A superb beer, but this maltiness in the aroma... Besides that, a fantastic brew, but really not worth the hassle to get it. A good choice for the 100th brewery I’m rating :)

UPDATE: Enjoyed a vertical with vintages 2002, 2014, 2015 shared with jonas, jfb, MoritzF, and Ritzn in June 2016. The 14 year old one has a lot of Pedro Ximenez Sherry aromas, some old rubber (but the first pours did not have as much of it - the later pours had too much dead yeast in there), and hardly any carbonation left.

2001,Westvleteren 12,"The second time I've had a 4oz sample with a couple friends. A great beer and I enjoyed even more the second time. Sweet malts with pear and apple upfront. Bread, caramel, dark dried fruits, yeast, earthy notes and hints of alcohol.

2002,Westvleteren 12,Outstanding brew. Had this a few years ago. Pours a dark and opaque muddy brown with a thin head of dense beige bubble that linger forever. The nose is sweet and fruity with nice prune and raisin notes combined with toffee and nuts. Light chocolate in the robust toffee malt. The taste is exquisite and refined with dessert like toffee and fruit notes in the middle. The finish is rich and robust with a lingering boozy warmth. An amazing experience.,4.2
2003,Westvleteren 12,"When I opened the bottle felt a generous perfume, slightly sweet, yet has a hopped that is balanced.
Your body is robust dark color which shows us a priori an extraordinary Quadrupel. Its foam is absolutely consistent and persistent with big bubbles in tasty cream.
In your body arise traces of bubbles at the edges of the striking and robust way glass.
The first sip of roasted malt mixed with chocolate and caramel notes is accompanied by very hops and dried fruit in an array which shows strength and character.
The alcohol does not appear alone, but warms and values of suggested dried fruit notes. Your sweet and does not bother Will not there any sour, no acid, no citrus, a balanced sweet gradually by roasted malt and hops.
The bitterness sue extraordinarily provocative, subtly ties the taste of preparing homogeneous way for the next sip.

2005,Westvleteren 12,"bottle from Belgian e-shop

Deep brown with red tints and small off-white head.
Sweet aroma, not too complex, malty with a little coffee, mainly highly baked bread crust, some dried fruits(blackcurrants) too and some esters from the yeast but not too prominent. Soft mouth feel, bready malty, very rich maltiness, dark caramel. Expected a bit more complexity but I’m not saying that it’s not complex.

Amazing beer, not all Belgian styles are my..style but I would drink this one anytime!

En boca, cremosa, abundante, completa.

Al paladar compleja y a la vez sencilla. Sabores bien encarados, notas ligeramente dulces pero nada agresivas. En boca nuevamente se perciben los frutos secos principalmente. La cremosidad es perfecta, dejando la sensación de un alimento completo. El final es largo pero a la vez delicioso.

A golden brown colour, very well balanced, though it’s 10,2% the alcohol level is perfect, not too high I think. A lot of caramel on the nose and mouth.

2021,Westvleteren 12,"2012 bottle imported directly from Belgium, unmarked bottle. Pours a muddy brown with a 1/2 finger white head. Floral, slight alcohol and Orval ""ish"" aroma. Can't describe the taste, because it really doesn't taste much like anything, maybe some mixture of Apple and plumb. Very slight alcohol. Light to medium mouthfeel. Very smooth. You could chug it down. Don't get the hype at all. Rochefort 10 is so much better. Maybe, I got a bad bottle or I am missing something?

2024,Westvleteren 12,"Well, here it is then, one of the world’s very best beers according to this very site. I have been familiar with it for many a year and enjoyed it many times but it wasn’t till the Flemish media made a hype out of it, following its election as best beer on this site, that every beer drinker in the country and abroad wanted to get his hands on it - prompting the monks at the Sint-Sixtus abbey to change their ways, introducing a reservation system and reducing the amount of crates per car (as the only official way to buy it, is driving to the abbey to pick it up). In other words: thanks to Ratebeer, it is even harder now for me to obtain it than it already was before (thank you, Ratebeer...). Anyway, for this rating I dug a 1,5 year old sample from the cellar and taste it at cellar temperature. It pours a deep, dark, brownish purple, clear at first but hazy with deposit, under a thin but remarkably stable, light yellowish beige, sticky, moussy head. The aroma is powerful, complexely perfumed and simply stunning: all kinds of noble sweetness and spiciness are blended into one mouth-watering bouquet I could sniff for hours; impressions of marzipan, old port wine and madera, candied orange, banana liqueur, milk chocolate, apple cake, walnuts, brown bread, vanilla, overripe pears and plums, cinnamon, sweet cherries, cognac, mint, cocoa powder, butterscotch, raisins and something vaguely earthy, only adding subtlety and complexity. In the mouth, candied and overripe fruits abound, sourish and sweetish both in a delicate and gentle way, banana, blue grapes, plums, pears, passion fruit and of course dark candi syrup, over a profound, fluffy, somewhat fatty malt sweet backbone, caramelly, nutty, chocolatey, with a delicately tingling carbonation adding a slight sourishness; towards the end, yeasty spiciness comes up retronasally, leafy and peppery hop bitterness and warming, liqueurish and brandy-like alcohol put everything into utter balance. Assessing whether this is the world’s best beer or not is irrelevant to me: I have always regarded this as the top ’abt’-style beer in Belgium, a landmark on the Belgian beer map, with a delicacy and refinement seldomly seen. I tasted this younger and much older and even at 8 years of age, it was still a heavenly experience, on a par with the world’s best wines or single malts. Keep in mind, though, that the balancing, earthy and leafy hop bitterness declines throughout the years, causing the fruity and candi-ish sweetness to become more pronounced; yet after many years of cellaring, it also maderizes beautifully. I prefer this at 1 or 2 years of age but this is pure personal taste. In all: the best of the abts to me and one of the best Belgian ales, that much is clear. The fact that it is hard to get, probably added to its sheer mythical status, but I must admit that even for me - living in Flanders - the excitement of booking a couple of crates and driving to the far-out Westvleteren monastery to get my hands on them does add to the experience. Inspiring, appetizing, satisfying, this is indeed a classic in every sense of the word.",4.7

Though I would’ve been better off buying them online and having someone swim them to Mexico for the price I paid. Rich brownish dark ruby with a creamy brown head. Intense musky earthy aroma, with strong hints of dried fruits, nuts, caramel, licorice, cereal and alcohol. Medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. Robust and heavy, with a strong bitter and alcohol character. A formidable brew, I’ve had beers with twice the ABV that seemed nowhere near as heavy nor complex as this. It’s just so rich and heavy.

Taste is sweet and spicy and rich and long. Long, slightly sour finish. Ripe apple and berries create a refined, wine-like impression. Full-bodied, extremely smooth palate with a low carbonation.

The variety and depth is mind-boggling; from cognac to plums, over cloves and burned muscavado sugar up to dried bitter orange peel and drops of fresh grape juice, to a good cigar, and much more.

To the review (expectations aside) poured fairly clean (no sludge on the bottle rim or massive floaties like in some other belgians with a touch of age on em). ruby/dark brew with some fizzy tan head. mouthfeel was pretty smooth. good body, but a little over carbonated. aroma was doughey and yeasty...sourdough bread, which was different, but not necessarily in a good way. aroma was plum, fig, fruits, yeast, more dough. smooth again, and hid the alcohol well, but this beer did nothing to stand out. All 3 Rochefort beers are better, as are the few Struisse beers I’ve had. I don’t know what the fuss is about. Maybe if I’m in Belgium one day I’ll get to have it fresh, but I’m not dropping more money on this to ship a bottle. In fact, I’m selling my second bottle (which we’d planned to drink, except that it was not worth what i can get for it). Disappointment for sure. Pannepot rocks. October 2013: From the gift pack release...much deeper, more fruit, less breadiness (which wasn’t all that impressive). If I’d rated just this batch, it would likely be a 4.3. Still not the best. but much much better. Not aure of age/transport on the first one, but that can be said about a TON of aother beers too that were better than the original 3.7. Gotta up it a little, though, overrated or not.""
Multiple good ones in a row now, and the score reflects those.  Still not #1,  but really nice.",4.3
2069,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled. Dark brown color, with small fluffy, quickly settlign tan head. Licorice nose. Aroma is sweet, fruity, licorace and alcohol.

Taste is brown sugar, dates, rum cake with earthy spiced icing and honey with the beeswax. A bit too much booze appears, along with some touches of citrus peel and mint on the finish. Medium-heavy body is too fizzy for my tastes, but it helps to keep the sweetness at bay. This really is a nice beer.

2105,Westvleteren 12,"Inutile dirlo...questa birra è veramente un capolavoro!!! Il colore è mogano scuro. La schiuma è fitta, abbondante, mediamente persistente (anche se ne rimane sempre qualche millimetro per tutta la bevuta) e dal colore marroncino chiaro un po’ dorato. Al naso si percepiscono soprattutto sentori vinosi, da vino liquoroso (quali Marsala e Porto). Ma è in bocca che esplode in tutta la sua bellezza. Caramello, maltato, frutta scura (come prugne), ciliegie (sia fresche che sotto spirito), e soprattutto un buonissimo liquoroso che ricorda, come si sentiva anche al naso, il Marsala e il Porto. Finale leggermente amarognolo. Corpo decisamente strutturato. Carbonizzazione bassa, se bevuta alla temperatura giusta, sui 12 gradi. Se più fredda, la carbonizzazione è eccessiva e non si sentono bene né tutti gli aromi né i sapori. Lasciata nel bicchiere, lascia esplodere tutti i suoi sapori. Possiamo dire che ogni sorso è una scoperta, non annoia mai con il passare delle bevute. Fama veramente meritatissima. Unica birra trappista ad essere fatta, per quanto ne sappia, unicamente dai monaci. Il loro motto è: ""facciamo birra per vivere e non viviamo per fare birra"". Il non essere attaccati al guadagno, ma alla qualità, rende questa birra un prodotto veramente eccezionale. Una parola sull’annoso confronto con la Rochefort 10, la mia birra preferita. Onestamente è veramente un testa a testa. Se proprio devo dare una preferenza, forse direi la Rochefort (ma sinceramente non ne sono tanto sicuro), in quanto più ricca di diversi sapori.",5.0

2111,Westvleteren 12,"The pour is dark brown at the top fading to chalky brown at the bottom. Some sediment is present swirling around. The head. Stays at 1 inch the whole beer and is cream colored all around with dark swirls in the top. The aroma is earth, belgian chocolate and mild belgian yeast, and wood. It has a healing effect on the palate and is warm but smooth. The foamy head tingles the lips on each sip. The flavor is predominantly darker malt with earth, mineral, coolness, and some belgian chocolate. its balanced with aa short bitterness. You can feel this one in the veins immediately. There is absolutley no aftertaste and its clean just like spring water. I believe this beer is like some kind of right of passage so its time to lay down my beer rating and start talking to people, enjoying instead the company of others rather than the quest to find new beer.",4.5
2112,Westvleteren 12,"A kezdeti benyomások egy vulkanikus erejű habkitörést követően fogalmazódhattak meg bennem, melyek közül elsőként mennyeien krémes, tejszínes aromáját említeném egy lágyan pirított, mogyorós-diós-mandulás vonallal. Páratlanul sima és visszafogott, mégis összetéveszthetetlenül egyedi. És amikor krémességet említek, azt szó szerint kell érteni. Ha valaki csak könyvekben találkozott volna még e fogalommal, tökéletesebb szemléltetés egy korty Westvleterennél nem is létezik. Szétolvad a szánkban, lágyan elterül, szinte betapasztja a szájüreg minden egyes négyzetmilliméterét. Egy rakás alkotóelem jelenlétét véljük felfedezni, a szokásos trappista összetevők mindegyikét: diófélék, datolya, szilva, mézes harapnivalók és krémlikőr éreztetik hatásukat, az eredmény azonban lenyűgözően egyedi. Valahogy egyik fázis során sem érzünk előretörő komponenst, kitüremkedő ízjegyeket, annyira szorosan kötődik egymáshoz minden egyes molekulája a sörnek, hogy az egyes kortyok hatása minden alkalommal szinte előélet nélkül és a halványulás érzetét mellőzve, egyből a lényegre térve tör elő, pár másodperces jelenéseket idézve elő a varázslatból. Mintha minden ital legjavát ötvözték volna egyetlen palackban, az alkohol, mint közös nevező remekül elrejtett ereje, a likőrök gyümölcsös krémessége, a maláta teltsége egyszerre lép a színre, majd még mielőtt megfejthetnénk, megfoghatatlan összetettségbe burkolózik. Ezen ismertető után felesleges lenne tagadni az iránta kialakult csodálatomat, melyet nem elsősorban újszerű, soha nem tapasztalt ízek parádés felvonultatása, semmint inkább a nagybetűs harmónia titokzatos létrejötte eredményez.",4.6

2116,Westvleteren 12,"Managed to try two separate bottles, one from a promotional six pack but close to use by date, the other probably brewed this year. There were of course massive difference, the older one having lost its carbonation massively and while much sweeter at first, didn’t have the pleasant aftertaste of the fresher bottle, which my ratings are based on. Having done the Belgium 6 abbey trip, this was of course a big must try, since the others I had all had before. Given it’s lofty rating on this site, I was at first a little disappointed, with the initial flavour quite mild compared to Rochefort 10 or Chimay blue, but it does maintain the flavour in your mouth and the sweetness comes through slowly. Like most Belgians strong caramel flavour with nice balance of light bitterness. Still, prefer the Rochefort and the Chimay triples but that’s just my preference. A very good beer.",3.9

Aroma is of caramel and a little citric although showing strong evidence of its 10.2% alcohol content.

2163,Westvleteren 12,"Re-rating after some more bottles sampled over the years and a first direct comparison with St. Bernardus and Rochefort yesterday. I am now totally converted and convinced that all the hype is fully deserved. Original rating below:

Bottle bought in a brussels Sunday market from a lady selling cheese... Coffee colour and beige head typical of Abt beers. Aroma combines ripe fruits with malts. Taste coffee, chocolate, cinamon, palate all that and turning a bit malty again. Very nice and complex overall, but probably a bit overrated thanks to the mystery surrounding it. Still glad to have tried finally, even though 8 euros was a rather steep price. In this category, I would probably keep a slight preference for St. Bernardus.

2164,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle 6 years old.
Westvleter is difficult to obtain in the Netherlands, and the price of € 12.50 is very expensive.
Color: Dark brown with a beige head.
Taste: plums, raisins, caramel, vanilla, alcohol, well balanced sweetness, spicy.",3.6
2165,Westvleteren 12,"Third time drinking, first time reviewed. Won in an online competition (RRP AU$80). No date printed on the cap (?!). Poured in a Westmalle chalice. Had been in the fridge 15 minutes. 

Pours with a big, fat uneven head that hangs around for a couple of minutes. Typical dirty quad look. 

Smells of plums and brandy, brown sugar, Trappist yeast. All the classics. The typical quad smell. Most similar to Rochefort's red wine barrel qualities, but you can definitely smell the St Bernardus relationship. 

Starting to warm up as I sip it... Wow. My mouth is so full I feel like I'm almost having an allergic reaction. This is without a doubt the most complex beer I have ever had. The first time I ever tried it, I picked up on the fact that it had not just Rochefort's dark fruits, but also it's own sweet berry fruits too - baked together in a dry, yeasty brown sugar cocoa and raisin cake. ...and the flavour develops every few minutes as it warms. A third of the way in and I'm getting sweet, bitey Lambrusco at the front of my mouth and a wave of brown sugar raisins coming backwards over the tongue. I think it's still a little young though, hard to tell without a date. 

The mouthfeel is huge. Beautiful carbonation and alcohol warmth that carries the sweetness without St Bernardus' drier, doughier feel. 

Don't ever let anyone tell you St Bernardus is 'the same' (I've been to both the St Bernardus brewery and In de Vrede twice!). If anything, it's closer to Rochefort 10. At the end of the day though, it's just a beer and your glass will eventually be empty. Definitely the best quad, but Pannepot and Rochefort are essentials too. St Bernardus comes after this (in spite of the similarities - it still uses St Sixtus yeast, but Westvletern moved to Westmalle yeast in 1992 when the contract arrangement ended - somehow it makes a world of difference). Save up your money and go to Belgium. If you can't make it to In de Vrede it would be well worth paying €10-15 for on the grey market.

Smells first quality malts, toffee, belgian yeasts, honey, dark fruit, spices, cake... you can smell so much things in there: deep and complex. Outstanding aroma. Deep malty taste, with yeast, cocoa, dried fruits and chestnut flavours, which almost turns to a very particular bitter finish, extremly long and persistent (touch of alcohol), but perfectly smooth(!). Full bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation (which is nice on this level of abv%). The bittersweet proportion, and an incredible overall balance are this beer real qualities. Almost tastes like an upgraded, more balanced and less sweet Rochefort 10 (I quite like Rochefort), and take this as a compliment. The fact that you can’t almost identify its real flavour lets you understand the quality of this beer. So complicated and with many taste notes but at the same time very well blended. In its dark belgian strong ale segment, it’s probably without doubt the best",4.4

2189,Westvleteren 12,"11.2 oz bottle. From notes taken at the St. Sixtus Abdij, June 7, 2007. This was a truly overwhelming experience, to have this beer (as well as the 8 and Blond) at the source. It ranks as one of the more memorable moments of my life, and I would encourage any and all to experience it for themselves.

This beer was poured for me at the restaurant In de Vrede, in the shadow of the Abdij itself. The beer is a dark opaque brown with a lasting pillowy off-white head that left ample lacing. The aroma is simple but complex: malt and dark, sweet fruits. The flavor is truly something to behold, and words are difficult to come by to describe the perfection. Notes of caramel, malt, spice, slight chocolate all combine to form the perfect beer. As the beer warms, each sip is a new revelation. As often as I have tried to rate this beer, the right words do not avail themselves.

Admittedly this is not my favourite style, but even with that concession I must say that this beer was excellent, but not anywhere near top-10 for me.

Il caramello domina su tutti gli altri sapori che si uniscono per una birra di carattere: pompelmo, chiodi di garofano su tutti. Nonostante l’elevato grado alcolico il bilanciamento in bocca è magistrale. Non vedo l’ora di berne un’altra.",4.7
2232,Westvleteren 12,From bottle kept in a dark cool place. Great color even better taste. Bottle came straight from the Abdij itself.,4.7
2233,Westvleteren 12,Westvleteren 12 is brewed by god himself... This is heaven in a bottle... Best beer in the universe!,5.0
2234,Westvleteren 12,"I spent a day there recently and was lucky enough to bring home a case of the number eight.
It was worth the hauling to have a touch of this magic in my beer locker.
The cafe’ serves all of their beers, but to buy a case (one every 2 mos. limit) you need to write in 2 months prior to arrival. You will then get whatever they are handing out that day and it will be $100 a case. Well worth it.",4.9
2235,Westvleteren 12,Bottle acquired by my wife with great resourcefulness. Dark brown with small but long lasting lacy tan head. Sweet malty aroma with strong fermented dried fruit. Mouth coating flavors of malt and dried fruits. Fine bubbly carbonation which complete the sweet flavors. Not boozy. Great subtle yeast flavors and aroma. I this was broadly available I would buy a bottle or two egret so often. A treat!,4.6
2236,Westvleteren 12,"One year old Westvleteren. More sweet and spicy than a new one. Caramel, prunes and raisins, slightly bitter finnish Wondeful beer, although I still prefer the Rochefort 10.",4.0
2237,Westvleteren 12,"Three years in bottle has changed this one quite a bit. Colour is still basic brown. But aroma has lost some banana notes as yeast has eaten its way through the sugars. Aroma is now sweetish and sugary with some peanuts. Too spicy and even some hints of vinegar. Flavour has smooth cyrup, some honey, With added yeast remains the aroma loses vinegar and blends. Palate is well balanced, medium carbonated. Surprisingly enough my conclusion is that this beer was better when drinked fresh, not after few years in cellar.",4.0
2238,Westvleteren 12,@bottle at home.. delecius beer eventhoug the aroma dosen’t live up to the rest of the beer . Dark brown color.. the alcohol is well balanced.. the taste has hints of caramel but still a slight bitterness. soft carbonated overall an amazing beer!,4.3
2239,Westvleteren 12,"0.33 bottle. Very dark brown color and a small, brownish head which leaves the thickest, best lacing I have seen so far. Aroma of malts, fermented fruits, some alcohol, simple but good. Taste is malty and fruity as well with some spices, yeasts, and a touch of alcohol. Medium body, creamy texture, and soft carbonation. Finish is sweet and fruity, even more so than the rest; again the same flavors but this time blended in an unimaginable way so as to create perfect harmony. Overall the beer is truly amazing, never had something as good in my life; its only blemish is the aroma which does not live up to the standard of the rest of the beer.",4.7
2240,Westvleteren 12,"wonderful taste of caramel and fruits
a nice dark brown/amber colour and a rich complex flavour.It’s a nice sweet artinasel beer to drink with a good taste
a very good belgium product",4.4
2241,Westvleteren 12,"330mL bottle.  Pours hazy reddish walnut brown with a dense off-white head. Aromas of red wine, grapes, apples, dried fruit, candied malts, sweetness, spices, phenolics and alcohol. Flavours of dark and dried fruit, red wine, malt, acid, very sweet with a decent whack of alcohol. Full bodied, average carbonation, slightly syrupy with a long, sweet, slightly acidic and warming alcoholic finish.",4.0
2242,Westvleteren 12,"Quite weak aroma of raisins and caramel. The taste is much better. Raisins, plums, figs, fruity and some warming alcohol. A little bitter finish. The best beer in the world? No, but maybe the best belgian quadrupel.",4.0
2243,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Pours a deep red color with a lot of yeast floating around. A short lived beige head too. Aroma of malt, fruits, nuts, sugar and alcohol. Taste is of malt, caramel, nuts, fruits, spices, rye, pepper, vanilla, toffee, yeast and alcohol. A bit sweet but after few seconds it becomes tart and spicy (not in a bad way, though). Full bodied and above medium carbonated. Rich and complex flavor that lingers in your mouth for quite a while after every sip of it. Well, ratingwise it’s a hard one. There’s absolutely /something/ here that makes it really good - even better than the St. Bernardus abt 12 (imho), but as with Westvleteren 8 I can’t - in good conscience - give it full marks because I feel it’s so damn overrated. But there is no doubt that it IS a REALLY good beer. But then I do love quadrupels. All in all I would like to have it more often than I’m ready to pay for. Very delicious and highly recommended.",4.5
2244,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled at local store. Pours hazy with almost no head. Spicy, dark aroma. Sweet wirginii not much bitterness to speak of. More like a dar? wine, but in a positive sense.",4.5

2246,Westvleteren 12,"Trade from Rando7. pours a dark brown/amber and has an immediate burst of a dark fruit aroma. the taste brings more of the same dark fruits with blueberry and cherry shining through from me, and then a nice balanced malt background sneaks in. overall this is a very tasty beer and worth at least 1 try despite its typically lofty price",4.8
2247,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a deep amber with a very thick buff head that likes to hang around. Aroma has strong notes of pear, apple and sweet malt. Rich flavor has a fruity core that seems to be a ""tutti fruiti"" of apple, cherry, pear and banana plus something else. Malt sneaks through wit. A bit of almost honey sweetness. Firm, smooth texture has some good fizz. Like nothing I have tried. One more beer off my bucket list!",4.6
2248,Westvleteren 12,"I was lucky enough to be stationed overseas and got an opportunity to try it. It is rich,complex in flavour, the champion of Trappist beers.",5.0
2249,Westvleteren 12,Nothing to say. I like it and I understand why is worldwide ranked as the best beer in the world. You find in it everything you want. Don’t taste but enjoy it when you have the fortune and pleasure to drink it.,5.0

El aroma es penetrante e intenso a la par que complejo, una gama oscilante de matices maltosos que se entremezclan a la perfección con notas dulces, frutos secos y leve tono a chocolate negro con sutil punto alcohólico que invita de nuevo a repetir el proceso para captar toda la gama que nos ofrece la espumosa.
sabor al igual que su aroma es intenso y complejo: de primeras, nos deleita con unas notas malteadas que van de la mano junto a frutos secos, pasando por el chocolate negro, un ligero toque especiado que se entremezcla a la perfección con un tono dulce acaramelado y finalizando con un punto de retrogusto alcohólico dando muestra de sus 10,2% pero que te dice ""bebe mas"" al estar muy bien integrados",5.0
2251,Westvleteren 12,33cl bottle served in a Trappist glass. Pours a dark brown colour with a small off white head. Hugely complex with a perfect balance of sweet and bitter. Maybe a little over-hyped but a fantastically balanced beer and much superior to the St. Bernardus ABT which it is often compared to. Wonderful beer and the best of its style - just not my favourite style.,4.3
2252,Westvleteren 12,"Ins Glas ergießt sich ein dunkel rötlichbraunes Bier mit schöner Schaumkrone. Geruch röstmalzig, sehr fruchtig, reife Früchte, alkoholisch. Geschmack stark fruchtig, dunkle überreife Früchte, leicht röstmalzig, alkoholisch.",4.2
2253,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma is a very sweet and pleasant fruitiness. Hints of raison, fig, and a variety of dark fruits. Taste is exceptionally smooth for a 10% beer. Full mouth sweet notes that have a very smooth warm alcohol character. Some slight bitterness that perfectly compliments the sweet fruit and malt notes.",4.5
2254,Westvleteren 12,I was able to find this beer when I visited Bruges at the Bierbrasserie Cambrinus. Sweet tasting beer but very nice to drink.,4.6
2255,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle @In de vrede. Aroma is alcohol, sweet, sugar. Taste is alcohol but in a balanced not dominant way, chocolate, little bitterness. Aftertaste soft chocolate.",4.2
2256,Westvleteren 12,"Gollem Proeflokaal, Amsterdam... bottle that still had a few years before it was to ""expire"": Anyway, I got one of those bottles without the overwhelming head that you hear about. Pours a murky opaque body. Aroma is raisins, Belgian yeast of wonderous quality, and even some distinctly flavored hops. Taste is sweet and fruity at first and is then followed by a veritable bitterness. Somewhat fizzy carbonation gives this an interesting mouthfeel. Finally, I would say that this is one of the very few beers with an alco-burn.",4.4
2257,Westvleteren 12,"Vanilla, caramel, alcohol, sweet finish. Much better aged. Great by itself or even paired with Trappist cheese.",4.7
2258,Westvleteren 12,"Is en blijft het beste bier in de wereld. Zacht aroma, perfecte kleur en balans van de smaak. Moeilijk aan te geraken en niet zo goedkoop, maar het is zijn geld volledig waard. Zelfs bij warme temperaturen.",5.0
2259,Westvleteren 12,"Brune, cuivrée. Mousse blanche abondante et stable. Nez gourmand, complexe et fruité (figues, pruneaux, groseilles), acidulé. L’attaque est profonde, ronde, crémeuse, le palais évoque chocolat noir, raisin, caramel/sucre, prunes. L’alcool est bien présent en finale, la levure est discrète, le tout est très équilibré. Très bon mais certainement pas la meilleure bière du monde !",4.9

2262,Westvleteren 12,"Finally the quest is over! C/O of Jimsal27 ~ again thank you so much Jim! (2013 September - production)

Aroma - the aroma is just as potent and complex as the taste - the aroma is comprised of alcohol, fig, raisins, anise, vanilla, and honey
Appearance - body color is a dark puce; the liquid is almost totally opaque with constant nucleation; the head starts about 1"" and beige, it does eventually settle but bubbles continue to set up from the nucleation there also remains a foam on the top of the body. Very impressive looking.
Taste - Wow that is very complex; it’s on the sweet spectrum - flavors include dark fruits - figs, plum, raisins, caramelized sugar, honey, spices to include vanilla and a few more. There is also the alcohol quality
Palate - body is medium; texture is slick; the carbonation is very lively; the finish has a lingering effect of alcohol and caramelized sugar bitterness, the length is long, and quite pleasant.

Is it the best beer I’ve had? Well, it’s pretty damn impressive! I am glad I’ve had it. I’ve had other beers that have had huge hype. It lives up to the hype. I rated it as fair as I could. It’s really good. Will it change your life, no. Are other beers better? I think that’s really up to you, and what your into. I judged it on it’s merits. I meets all the criteria. I will also say, that some beers can meet the rating criteria, but aren’t enjoyable, that isn’t the case here. It measures up and is excessively enjoyable. It is a classic.",4.7
2263,Westvleteren 12,"Dit was de tweede keer dat ik de Westvleteren 12 heb gedronken. De eerste keer dateerde nog van een tijd dat ik nog niet zo kritisch bezig was met het proeven van bieren. Dat dit bier internationaal vermaard is, eigenlijk alleen positieve beoordelingen krijgt mede met het exclusieve karakter maakte dat de verwachtingen hoog gespannen waren. Wat ik me uit de eerdere degustatie herinner is dat het me toen meer dan gemiddeld was bevallen.Het aroma is zacht en herbergt toetsen van kandij, noten en mokka. Het is een subtiel aroma, maar zeer uitnodigend.Het uiterlijk is diep donker met een gezonde glans. Het koolzuur komt maar beperkt vrij en kleeft niet tegen het glas. Toch vormt het bier en mooie volle en dichte schuimkraag met een mokka kleur.De smaak vult de verwachtingen op basis van het uitzicht en het aroma volledig in. Het bier smaakt zacht bitterzoet met toetsen van chocolade en mokka. Het mondgevoel is veruit het beste aan dit bier, licht sprankelend, toch verfrissend maar met een ongelofelijke afdronk die je doet verlangen naar de volgende slok.Algemeen is dit bier dus en absolute winner MAAR wat mij betreft zijn er waarschijnlijk couranter verkrijgbare bieren die vooral qua smaak en aroma zeker een evenwaardig alternatief kunnen bieden. Maar hey, is het nu net niet dat waarom elke bierliefhebber de bieren van de Sint Sixtus abdij ooit moet geproefd hebben?",4.0

Great taste, quite complex with a creamy/root beer taste .. overall a great beer though very expensive and hard to find (luckily I have 6 newer ones stashed). Updated 09/13/14 - tried on tap at Westvertlen ... great beer. Very easy drinking with some root beer notes ... even better on tap than it was in the bottle",4.6

Murky brown with a small off white head.

Medium body, high carbonation.
Warming after taste, again with marzipan.

Good, sure but the best beer in the world? Nah.",3.2
2267,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle pours a sparkling plum color. Small head that stays as a ring around the glass. Aromas of dark fruits, bread, spices and hints of alcohol. Mostly sweet fruit on the nose. The taste is so balanced. Nothing really jumps out at you, yet the flavors are distinct. Plums, raisin, grapes give a slight vinous accent initially, but it settles into some yeast/malt flavors. Spice, dough...some fig perhaps. Leathers. The finish does have a bold alcohol presence, but nothing off-putting. It’s one of those beers that you can’t quite put your finger on what makes it so great, except that everything is very much in unison here. Just a well-done beer. Hard to argue against it.",4.4
2268,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, 12C. Appreciated the manner this was brought in, thanks Chris. Thought about gushing. Dark brown with a pale beige head that fades to a lasting coat. Aroma of dried and stewed dark fruits, chocolate, dough, some leather vanilla. Moderate carbonation. Full but not really syrupy texture. Powerful, boozy with explosive fruit flavours - plum as well as prune, raisins. Sticky bread crusts and vanillaish dough - wife says challah dough. Very yeasty. Spices creep up. Complex but not subtle, just fun to drink. Power and harmony.",4.6

2282,Westvleteren 12,"Er is al heel veel gezegd en geschreven over de Westvleteren 12. Het zou hemels, goddelijk, magistraal zijn. En bovenal, het zou het beste bier in de wereld zijn. Klopt dit ? Ja en neen. Is moeilijk te zeggen aangezien er zoveel soorten verschillende bieren zijn. Je hebt de blonde bieren (tripels), de amberkleurige bieren, zoete bieren, zure bieren, bieren die gerijpt zijn op eiken vaten e.d. dat het moeilijk is om slechts één bier als beste van de wereld te beschouwen. Laat ik vooropstellen dat de Westvleteren 12 inderdaad een goddelijk brouwsel is, het is alsof een engeltje op je tong plast. De smaak is rijk, vol van smaak, je proeft o.a.toffee, kandijsuiker, donker brood, peperkoek en dit bier heeft een heerlijke zachte afdronk, ondanks het hoge alcoholpercentage. Maar als je geen liefhebber bent van donkere bieren, zal je dit bier nooit het lekkerste van de wereld vinden, wat de mensen ook mogen zeggen of schrijven. En ik denk ook dat dit bier als beste wordt beschouwd door zijn exclusiviteit. De hype wordt een beetje gecreëerd in die mate dat je jezelf als bevoorrecht gaat beschouwen als je er één mag drinken. En dat je het bier wel MOET lekker vinden. Uiteraard is het een lekker bier, héél erg lekker zelfs, maar het lekkerste....tja daar twijfel ik over, daarvoor zijn er nu eenmaal té veel bieren over heel de wereld...",5.0
2283,Westvleteren 12,"You are so freaking hungry and you want to eat somthing. You had a long day and on your way back home in a traffic jam and you want a quick dinner that fills you! Your first thought might me McDonalds! And that is the same reaction I have when drinking one of these beers, I have o clue why, I am still investagiating, but not with pleasure I can tell you that!

Whenever eating at McDonalds, I stuff my belly with fries, a quarterpounder and some ""healthy"" beverage. After doing that I feel the same after drinking one or more Westvleteren. Ofcourse the balance of this beer is almost, almost beyond anything. But not beyond everything!
Eating McDonalds will stuff you instantly, and that is what Westvleteren 12 does for me. The taste is just too much, too impressive to enjoy, My favourite is, and always will be a different beer, and I have tasted them just as much I can tell you. Saturisation is what I think of when I drink a Westvleteren, freedom is what I think of when drinking a Rochefort, or an aged Orval. The aroma is too freaking much, just like drinking a Maggi bottle in comparisment.
Drinking one now, I have never left beers unfinnished, but I think the Westvleteren are champions at my home. I just brought back a crate, half of them are left with a quarter of a bottle. Got back two crates, again, but what a freaking hoax. The blond is okay, but I know better ones, the eight is doable, but not something to kill an elf for. The twelve is the same, so much better then the Abt from Watou, but when I drink it, it is like a Big Mac for me. I would not kill a unicorn for this beer for sure.

2289,Westvleteren 12,"My first ever rating. Will try to make a habit out of it, so I can keep track of my journey throughout the big world of beers. Great beer to start with. I have tried a bottle with expiry date 2012 before, which was really phenomenal. The bottle I am rating right now is a whole lot younger: about 6 months. Can use some more aging, however, taste has already nicely developed. 

Beer is dark brown with a long lasting head. Aroma is not that special, but the first sip immediately hits the spot. Perfectly balanced flavours of chocolate, bread, raisins and dark fruits with a full body. Pretty sweet and rather thick. Intensity increases as the beer gets warmer. The carbonation is average and is perfect for this beer.

I seem to always enjoy this beer, it never disappoints. Worth the enormous hype? Maybe not, but just sit back and enjoy this great trappist beer.",4.1

Lots of stuff going on here. And it opens up a bit more as it warms up and more sweetness starts to come out and balances the bitterness. Really good but maybe a tad over hyped.

Extremely long aftertaste, starts sweet and gets more bitter at the end. Port , caramel and dark chocolate in the aftertaste. One of the longest aftertastes I’ve had with beer.

Compared to the Rochefort 10 the Westvleteren is a bit better in balance, has a longer aftertaste and bit licorice.

A brilliant beer, hard to get and expensive. Very interesting to taste and in my opinion a bit better then Rochefort 10.

Appearance is opaque dark mahogany colored with a thick medium sized tan head with good retention, that when reduced left some lacing. Aroma of caramel, prunes, raisins and spices. Flavour of caramel, prunes, raisins, dates, toffee, spices, honey. Taste is light-medium sweet and medium bitter. Palate is full bodied, somewhat oily texture, average carbonation and long finish. Westvleteren XII is an interesting beer with very complex flavours. But a surprisingly noticeable warming bite from the alcohol, therefore unlike most other Trappist Quadrupels like Chimay Blue and Rochefort 10 that pairs well with certain meat dishes and cheese, Westvleteren XII is best enjoyed just on it’s own.",4.6
2315,Westvleteren 12,"(Drinking date: 24 January 2014) Dark brown, hazy colour with a thin layer of foam. It looks good. Dark brown with a thin layer of beige/white foam. Aromas of ripe dark fruits, chocolate and a bit of alcohol. The taste is really special. It has a really soft taste, it has a really complex taste. Chocolate, a bit of alcohol, and a taste that reminds me of Dr. Pepper soft drink. Also a taste which reminds me of mint, but I?m not sure. The beer is sweet, with a bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. It is really good and delicious! The mouthfeel is good, with good carbonation which is not too heavy and not too flat. The beer has a full body. It leaves an enjoyable warm feeling in your mouth and throath. But if I am fair, this is not the best beer I?ve ever tasted. For me, it is not the best beer in the world. It is not worth the ?9.50 that I paid for this bottle. You pay more for the hype. But still, this beer is really good.

Full body, medium texture, good carbonation, sweet spicy lasting finish. Overall, a great beer : temperature tasting definitely matters. Complex fruity, roasty aroma. Deeper taste/palate.

There is earth, toffee, dark chocolate and a cutting form of sweet fine and faily intense custard cream richness. There’s a deep thick oakiness there too especially with the body.

Flavor of huge bread crust, dried stale bread, slight hot higher alcohol on the exhale. Figs and slightly sweet bit of raisin. Hints of old hay/grass. Less sweet and caramelly than St Bernardus and Rochefort (did a side-by-side with s.b. 12) Shares Rochefort’s breadcrust without the dates/caramel. A very clean flavor - must have good water... Hint of caramelized banana comes out as it warms, still very light compared wtih other trappists, especially considering this is brewed with the same yeast as Westmalle and Achel at a higher temp!

Really full complex taste, lovely warmth and body with great mouth feel. Fruits, nuts, caramel even some berries at the finish. Quite perfect indeed.

2362,Westvleteren 12,"Rated on Boxing Day, 26/12/13 as ""Christmas 2013 Belgian Quads Parallel Tasting"" - Part 3 of 3



330 ml bottle (bottling date: 27/01/12). Thank you, Monna!



Preparation: bottle maintained at ambient temperature of 10°C - 12°C overnight; Popped at 13.1°C (within recommended temperature range) onto the Chimay chalice.



Looks: Cloudy hazy dark mahogany colour with chunks of dirt-like yeast sediments; Three finger head and beautiful, lasting light beige foam with a thin head that refuses to go away! Excellent sticky lacing with bubbly small carbonation.



Aroma: Fragrant light alcohol, sugar and vanilla, with nicely-woven light plum, raisin, wood, musty cellar, Port wine, red wine, Bel yeast and malt. New aromas continue to evolve as beer warms. Amazing!



Taste: A great combination of flavours, started out with light but nice alcohol and sugar, then followed by freshy plum, raisins, light roastiness and nuts, wood, caramel, rum, light banana, light toffee, light cream, herbs, faint liquorices, shades of lime and faint grass. Yum!



Body: Medium. Slick and pretty creamy palate.



Mouth Feel: a subtle combination of tastes - intense and fleshy dark fruits, winey cellar (lovely!), nutty roastyness close to fresh toast, wood barrel, caramel, banana and cream. All in fairly light touch but together they works so well, very seductive to mind!



Booze and Sweetness: The 10.2% abv is its strongest suit - strong but absolutely not screaming at all. It stays silent for a good 20 minutes or so, the standard sign of a good brew. Subtle winey aroma with nice soft rum taste. How pleasing. :) Sweetness is also very restrained, just the right amount to complement the booze and give the beer some nice support. Very good!



Hoppiness: Not all that complex. Faint grassy nose; Herbs, thin liquorices and grass for taste. Some faint bitterness in the background but at this level, in reality it’s the lasting, tasty woody cellar-like sweet booze finish to round things up.



After Taste: Wet, Nicely sweet boozy and creamy to mouth.



Comments: Finally! I am fortunate enough to obtain the legend, AND choose the perfect moment to enjoy it and pit with the closest rivals, Sint Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10. 



As a Trappist beer, this is low-key and unassuming on the outside, but full of subtlety within. Its Darwinian aroma completely won my heart, and the taste, through in light touch and not the “blow my mind to the 4th dimension” type, is extremely well-presented to back up the beautiful aromas. Impressive in a very subtle way. This is seduction at its best! ;)



THE TRIUMVIRATE VERDICT:



These three Quads evolved in quite different paths so the judgment is surely subjective. Anyway, this is my two cents:


Westvletreten XII:

- Subtlety is the key.

- Fantastic Darwinian aroma of cellar and wine.

- Excellent rum booze and sweetness.

- amazing taste variety for a Quad, all in right amount to impress.

In Short: the best of all three.




Sint Bernardus 12:

- Nice extension of strong Belgian Dark and more!

- Fragrant aroma and rich taste varieties. Richer than Westvelteren XII but with lesser romance. “Big and hearty”.

- Strong booze and nice sweetness, especially the bourbon!

In short: a close second to Westvleteren XII, slightly less subtle but undeniably nice!




Rochefort Trappist 10:

- “Hard hitting whiskey and brandy” is the key. 

- Head is flat, taste variety is rather limited of the three Quads.

In short: My least favorite. A hard liquor disguises as Trappist beer.",5.0

A: Pours a dark mahogany ale with decent clarity. Single finger of fine and dense burnt latte head falls over the course of several minutes to a quilt of the same. Spotty lacing.

S: Butter, grahams, toffee, caramel, cream, hints of muscat grapes. Some dark fruits. 

T: See above, then specifically highlight figs, prunes, fired sugarcane. Good.

M: Medium to heavy with lower carb. Slicks on the finish.

O: This beer is good. Obviously well crafted. Multilayered and complex. Unfortunately, I disagree it stands up to Rochefort 10, oddly, given the last review I did of that beer. I will have to review it again, as I tasted tonight side by side this beer and found it in the forefront.

Aroma is nutty, dried fruits , caramel, more pronounced flavors as it warms up. Taste is a sweet nutty alcohol, also improving as it warms. Light to medium in body with the flavor lingering long into the finish. Warming feeling in the throat and stomach. Tasty beer, but certainly not my number 1.",4.1
2374,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma: Vinegar, red wine, cognac, dark dried fruit, caramel Appearance: Brown, red glow, off white beige head, big bubble foam, light lacing Taste: Very soft, dried dark fruit, red wine, booze (cognac), fruity lingering aftertaste",4.3
2375,Westvleteren 12,"Alcohol in the aroma, and something that comes close to a combination soy sauce and blossom. Beer is brown and unclear. The alcohol is predominant in the taste and that makes it a little sweet. Also a taste of licorice. Overall the beer is overvalued the way I see it.",3.6

Cor escura, com ótima e persistente formação de espuma, com aroma de frutas secas que persiste durante toda a garrafa. Na boca, bom corpo, algo licoroso, com importantes notas de frutas secas, ameixas e cerejas maduras, com álcool bem inserido. Baixo amargor, excelente equilíbrio. Final longo e aquecido.

2381,Westvleteren 12,"10 year old bottle. Dark brown with a thin, disappearing, tan, non lacy head. Smells of raisins, figs and nuts, liquorish, caramel, and deep complex malt. Fruity and malty. Medium to full oily body. Initial sweet taste of malt and caramel with a chewy centre filled with yeast, fruit, spices, toffee, and a soft citrus. Some of the most complex malt I’ve sampled. Smooth and keeps bringing me back for more. I’ve never had a young bottle, which needs to be tried. Delicious. However, it isn’t the greatest thing I’ve ever had. It shouldn’t be as expensive as it is nor as hyped. Still it’s very nice.",4.5
2382,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma is raisin, sweet malt, grape. Appearance is hazy off brown wit small off white head that dissipates quickly. Taste is raisin, grape, plum, cherry... all backed by sweet malt. Palate is medium full. Sweet full fruity malt lingers but crisp. Overall an excellent beer. I prefer St Bernardus though.",3.9
2383,Westvleteren 12,"Pours cloudy, thick and red/brown with a thin, effervescent head (unexpected) and plenty of flocculation. Aroma is big and sweet, dandelion, smoky, vanilla, and somewhat astringent, like bourbon. Flavor is toffee, raisins, tobacco, floral hops, peppercorn, and grass. Much less sweet than I would expect from a beer of this size. Dry and rich, this drinks nicely on a snowy, wintry day. Thanks Tony (Duffman) for this kind offering!",4.4
2384,Westvleteren 12,"14/12/13 - Pours an almost pitch black colour with a creamy beige head. Nose is a bit sweet, mainly malts. Taste has coffee, chocolate, dried fruits, gingerbread, caramel, malts and just a pinch of bitterness: very round, subtle and balanced. Velvet soft mouthfeel, low carbonated. Special drink, definitely the most balanced of trappists although I prefer the 8 by Westvleteren. 
Re-rate: aged bottle. Complex vinous character has developed, fruity and malty sweet, quite alcoholic. Very nice!
Re-rate: 2 year old bottle, nicely dried fruity and bread, grainy malt forward quadrupel. Good body, medium carbonation. Don't prefer the 8 no more.",4.3

Aroma - very unique, comething like chocolate cake (not so much chocolate as it is), chocolate-malty but not chocolate, deep malty, a bit raisins. WoW yeasty! Taste is sweetish, with no sour touch, light hoppy bitter. Well rounded palete, thick smooth and mouthfeel, indeed huge brew, unique flavor. Like liquid cake, also in aftertaste.",4.3

2388,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle (of course). Purchased December 2012. I drank one then and drank one about a year later - does show a bit more character from aging. Pours a very dark brown with a sizable foamy head. Smells of cherries, plums, brown sugar. The aforementioned flavors hit the tongue first before it transforms into something a bit more yeasty and biscuity and spicy. Lots of stuff going on. Thought it’d be a little thicker in texture based on how it looked. Worth seeking out, I suppose, though I had a St Bernardus ABT 12 the next day (though it was on tap) and I liked that better.",4.1
2389,Westvleteren 12,"Finally got my hands on a bottle. Great nose, yeasty and sweet, a little smokiness. The taste is a little sweet, a hint of alcohol bite but pleasantly so. Starts a little spicy but overall very smooth, sweet, caramelly.",4.6

The nose is sweet Belgian malts with dark fruits (plums, grapes, insert other dark fruit here), typical Belgian yeast character. Has a winey/corkey aftertaste. I have to say, this is very comparable to the St. Bernardus (spelling?) Abt 12 but not as dry and a little fruitier. Being that the Abt 12 is one of my favorite, I have to give this a high rating. Personally, I think Permanent Funeral and Brandy Barrel Vanilla Bean Aged Dark Lord are better, but to each there own.",4.5
2394,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz bottle shared by AndyReynolds the Gracious - pours the way it did for the previous 2800+ raters. Nose is dark fruit, brown sugar, and ether. Earthy aromas I’d expect from an abt/quad. Keep thinking of saint Bernardus 12. Wine cork aftertaste in a good way. Goes down easy for 12% ABV. Damn good but not my favorite beer in the world.",4.2

Aroma is rich christmas pudding, figs, dates, touch of booze. Flavour is rum, raisin, dates, touch of caramel oxidation in this bottle. flavour is very well rounded and full. Finish is oak, alcohol bite and a touch of oxidation. Maybe not the best example, but still dam tasty. I still would have a rrochefort 10 any day of the week.",4.3
2397,Westvleteren 12,"Look: Pours with off-white head, even, equal bubbles. Good retention. Deep amber, brown with golden tone. Hazy with some floating yeast.




Smell: Dark and dry fruits, figs, raisins, light banana and floral honey, honeycomb. Deep medium sweetness, caramel, burnt sugar, grain. There is some very subtle smokey, roast notes, hint of coffee (more like cappuccino). There is also very light sour and bitter tone. Good balance, yet subtle.




Taste: Dark and dry fruits again, mostly figs, raisins, small spike of higher alcohols. Smooth, creamy, caramel, toffee and cappuccino medium sweetness. Light brandy notes but not overwhelming. There is also some very subtle cellar funk. Ends with a good mix of light sour and malty aftertaste. 




Mouthfeel: Starts a little spicy then very smooth, full. Light warming do to the high alcohol but goes away after a few sips. Alcohol well hidden. Surprisingly good and lively carbonation. Leaves a nice creamy feeling. 




Overall: Was skeptical with all the hype, but it delivered. Balanced, subtle and interesting enough.",4.1
2398,Westvleteren 12,"So this is the annoying thing about this website. A decade ago I went to the monastery and bought a load of these which slowly disappeared. And then I had none left to rate. So now I’m back with a single Westie 12, in Au Bon Vieux Temps, desperately trying to warm the damn thing up before I drink it. Age unknown but I’d guess young. Darker than I remembered. Thin, lasting foam, lots of sediment. Yeah it’s still good, malty, spicy, fruity, raisins, prunes, a little yeasty. Just bitter enough, great balance. Need to do some blind tasting, this against some other great Belgians...

Re-rate, October 2014. I bought a whole case of these bad boys, aiming to consume every three months to see how they age. 2014 batch, so thjs is pretty young. Still deep brown colour, high carbonation, very impressive long lasting head. Slightly boozy, see if this mellows out over time. Lovely soft fruity spicy, some sweet orange marmelade in there, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice.",4.4

Något trist mahognyfärgad brygd med ett välstrukturerat och kvardröjande skum. 
Mycket fruktig och söt smak. Karamell, malt, värmande kryddor, honung, dadlar och en viss fatton. Hela den belgiska smakpaletten är där vilken ger en fantastisk komplexitet i smakbilden. Enastående bra, kort sagt.

Taste is wonderful toasted bread, caramel malt, candied grapes, figs, dates, sweet red licorice, light booze, sweet honey, earthy & fruity esters, mild clove, warming spices, Belgian yeast, faint Candi sugar...

C’est moins écoeurant, peut-être un peu plus long en finale.

Pours a dark brown color out of the bottle. Lots of carbonation. The smell is great, and the taste measures up. This is a very complex beer. I believe the balance and complexity make this unique. At first you think it's just another quad, but as you drink it and it warms up, you start to realize there are nuances there that aren't in other beers. Of course it has a similar taste profile to the other Trappist belguims: the dark fruit, Belgium sugar with a malty caramel taste, etc. but the balance is perfect: not too much sugar; not too much malt; not too much hops; not too much alcohol; everything works together, and it takes a moment to realize how well it pulls this off.

Taste is chocolate malt with sultanas. Mouthfeel initially rough - but in a nice way - and lively with some fizz. Leaves the tongue tingling for several minutes afterwards. There’s no denying this is a very good beer - hence my 4 rating - but I think its reputation as the best beer in the world (which it isn’t) is built on rarity.",4.0

2452,Westvleteren 12,"Semi mild aroma with original flavors not like any beer I’ve tasted. Sweetness with raisin and vanilla. Orange, red, gold appearance and light, intensive, white head. Lots of yeast etc. flowing in glass. Perfectly balanced, smooth, still original taste with edge. Raisin is dominant with floral flavors and vanilla. Alcohol comes trough a bit, but it dissolves by other flavors decently. Malts come on aftertaste, which is a bit too short. Another thing I’m missing, is earthy or chalchy flavors: for a Trappist, this floral flavor dampens them too much. Rich, thick palate with medium carbonation.",4.6
2453,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from abbey in April opened in October. Distinctive malt and yeast character are the focus of this quad but it is more delicate after six months than I expected. There was a bit of mushroom funk and much yeast floating. Even though flavor seemed to be fading some, the character of bread remains.",4.3
2454,Westvleteren 12,"Strong, powerful flavours. Grains, wood, caramel. Take your time when drinking. Takes a while for all flavours to come through. As close to perfection as beer can get. However, save it for special occasions. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone",4.8
2455,Westvleteren 12,"Bad ass gift from a friend who was in Netherlands over the summer. Pour is dark brown with a medium off white head. Tons of yeast floating all throw the beer. Aroma is lite with sweet noise and yeast notes. Very balanced beer with a very defined beginning ,middle and end. Starts out with a alcohol forward beginning then you get caramel and a big fizzy carbonation and the finsh is smooth,fruity and clean.",4.1
2456,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a dense golden color with a cotton candy head. Excellent lacing. Well-balanced flowery scent, and I also get some sherry and raisin. Sexy yeasty palate, punctuated with tartness and orange. Hearty yet effervescent mouthfeel and bone dry finish.",4.8

2459,Westvleteren 12,"The beer pours out nice with lots of carbonation. It looks dark brown. The first thing I noticed when drinking is how much alchohol warmth you feel in your troath when swallowing.When you breath in really deeply you can smell basement aromas and chocolate, nice aroma.

The bitter and alcohol is a bit too dominant for me, but still a very fine beer.",4.1

Westvleteren, Belgium

Appearance: Dark chocolate brown, hazy, beautiful white head with generous lacing.

Aroma: Fruit - almost like wine, chocolate, alcohol, really nicely balanced. 

Taste: Slightly caramel-y sweet, a hint of bitter, very warming. 

Palate: Medium to full body, rich and fully texture, enough carbonation but not too much. Long finish.

Overall:  I cant say its the best beer ever, but for the style its hard to imagine something better.I agree with a lot of the other comments out there about St Bernardus being a good replacement.",4.4
2463,Westvleteren 12,"Appearance : see through dark reddish brown/caramel, 3cm white head, low carbonation. Aroma : grain alcohol. Taste : what a triple should be, classic vibe but excelent excellent, nice strong bitterness. Palate : mid to thick bodied, very silky, easy to drink.",4.2
2464,Westvleteren 12,"Vintage 2010. Gift from a friend. Pours murky dark brown with a fast dissipating beige/light brown head. Aroma is nutty, red fruits, raisin, floral, herbs and yeast. Hard to write down all the aroma’s, a lot going on. Brown sugar and toast aswell. Maybe even molasses. Taste is medium sweet and medium bitter. Well balanced. It’s a great beer of course, but not my favourite style. Deep, rich, complex flavours which linger for a long time, but I still prefer a good DIPA or Imperial Stout to this one.",3.8
2465,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a murky brown with an eggshell off-white head that eventually thins out in a nice thin layer.

Smell is yeast with some raisin and plum.

Initial taste is very forward with brown sugar some fig, nut, vanilla and fresh baked bread also make an appearance. Finishes with a little nutty bready sweetness with some bitterness.

Very creamy and smooth. Excellent.

Finally got to try one of these top rated beers and it doesn’t disappoint. The velvety smooth mouthfeel is probably the highlight, but the taste is very balanced and complex.",4.5
2466,Westvleteren 12,"To begin with: I expected a explosion in taste and aroma, so I was a little bit (""bit"" like 1%) dissappointed of it. It pours out really nice of this anonymous bottle in a deep black colour, steady and very slow dissapearing head and medium to very smooth body. Aroma was first very weak and low but got better with the more air the beer got: Malt, nuts and caramel. Nice and solid taste of malt, barley wine, nuts, sweet torf, warm bittersweet chocolate and light coffee. Hints of raisins, plums, prunes and honey. Very nice beer indeed and I enjoyed it a lot - but -after all the hype that’s around it- I expected it way better. But at the end of the day it is good to know that a beer is just a beer and not swimming gold.",3.6
2467,Westvleteren 12,"Draught at White Spot (jk). Pours Very Dark Brown with small tan head. Nose of plum, coffee, toffee, licorice, very little alcohol. Flavour is a very nice mixture of plum, roasted nuts, and coffee with some alcohol and vanilla in the background. Very smooth, surprisingly soft. Excellent abt, the flavour is incredibly well balanced, though not my #1 this did certainly not disappoint.",4.4
2468,Westvleteren 12,"Erstmal danke an johan - gute Arbeit Mr Hangover. Und um es gleich vorwegzunehmen: Tap 5 von Schneider ist besser als das beste Bier der Welt. Dennoch haben wir hier einen schön schweren Klassiker mit viel Liebe zum Detail. Süffig, dick und voller Beeren. Unfassbar richtig mit viel Brom- und Blaubeere. Ein hervorragendes Piwo, das nur so von Klasse strotzt. Hocharomatisch und hochklassig - ein B-Probe wäre wundervoll.",3.9
2469,Westvleteren 12,"a)  bottle bought directly at the monastery in May, so now about 5 month old. Cap-date is 23.5.16 - so a very fresh beer. 
The head in the glass is full, brown-beige. The beer itself is cloudy-brown. Nice aroma of dark malt and molasses smellable.
The beer itself starts quite fresh-hoppy. Brown sugar, molasses, dark dry fruit. The hop-bitterness and even a bit of freshness is noticeable through all parts of the beer. Even a bit tangy. Lots of bubbles. 
The aftertaste is long, deep, brown sugar, not too sweet. Plums, dark cherries. Even a bit roasted (but I think this is due to the sharp hops).

 b) MHD 16.06.2013  
Flasche vor 1½ Jahren direkt am Kloster gekauft, seit dem kühl im Keller gelagert. 
Direkter ""Gegentest"" mit dem Rochefort 10. 

Der Antrunk ist recht herb mit süßlich-malziger Note, leichte Anklänge an dunkles Obst. 
Im Hauptteil setzt sich dieses dunkle Obst fort, allerdings dabei schon fast klebrig süß, der Grundton einer herben Malzigkeit prägt sich weiter aus. 

Der Nachgeschmack dieses Bieres ist lang anhaltend, durch eine deutlich Süße geprägt, der Alkohol ist nicht zu schmecken - faszinierend bei 10,2%. 
Allerdings finden sich kaum Aromen - die dunklen Früchte treten hinter der süß-herben Note zurück, die stark an Oettinger Malzbier in etwas gehaltvoller erinnert. 


--> Ein durchaus leckeres Bier, von dem ich allerdings total enttäuscht bin. Das Rochefort 10 (überall in Belgien ohne Probleme für 1,50€ - 2€ zu bekommen) ist um Längen besser und wesentlich aromatischer!!! 

--> Westvleteren 12 ist für mich absolut überbewertet - wenn ich nochmal an der Belgischen Küste Urlaub mache, bringe ich mir wieder eine Kiste mit - aber mehr Aufwand lohnt bei diesem Bier m.E. nicht!

2470,Westvleteren 12,"12-oz. bottle. Dark copper pour with a good deal of suspended yeast globs and a pillowy, latte-colored head. Aroma of brown sugar, dates, dark stone fruit, banana bread, and subtle Belgian esters. Incredibly rich flavor with heavy bready malt (almost like a märzen) being the dominant tone early, along with some raisin, a touch of brown sugar, and a surprising bit of almost spicy, boozy heat. As it warms, the breadiness takes a back seat to a sweeter Belgian yeast/candi sugar note. It’s not as complex as past bottles, but still quite layered. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with a tangy, lingering finish. A delightful beer, but it doesn’t quite live up to its extremely lofty hype.",4.2
2471,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a hazy brown with light tan head. Nose is of sweet plums, toffee, some figs. Taste is similar as nose but sweet and earthy. Very smooth. Best Quad I’ve ever had for sure, but not the best beer.",4.2
2472,Westvleteren 12,A very good beer but I don’t really think that this is the #1 beer in the world.,4.1
2473,Westvleteren 12,"Rated from beer log during 2009 Belgium trip... Rated blind against the westvletern 12 at cambrinus restaurant in Bruges... Sweet almost fruity aroma, a little more tannish head on the Westvletern, almost prune like aroma, definitely can appreciate a little more candi sugar and maple syrup on the westvletern... St bernardus is a little more subtle in its nose, not as aromatic, yet still slightly sweet... Both colors are nearly identical, deep brown caramel... Alcohol content is more apparent in the Westvletern, not outrageously sweet as I expected, but pleasant, not overpowering... Leaves a nice slightly yeasty finish on the palate, very nice and well balanced... St Bernardus is slightly sweeter which conceals the ABV better and slightly less bitter and yeasty on finish, however the Westvletern may be more complex... Both amazing beers

2475,Westvleteren 12,"Called the brewery about 250 times to get 48 bottles of this.

Appearance: Pours a very dark brown with a with some ruby shining when held into light.

Aroma: Very complex but so balanced. Best smell there is to me. Mild coffee, sligghtly roasty, herbs, woody.

Taste: Nice balanced dark flavour right ahead with coffee along with a balanced roasty bitterness. Licorice pretty dominant in the long term, very long sustaining. Still activates my salivary glands a lot! :)

Palate: medium body with a perfect texture for dark beers. Nice carbonation so it keeps on living for a long time and the beer is enjoyable for that amount of time, which let you drink this beer for ages.

Best beer in the world? I don’t believe there is one now. The aroma is already enough so you don’t even have to drink this beer. In matter of taste it is so intensely balanced and a great experience but the licorice in the aftertaste just has a slight upper hand. So definately worth the effort to call and go to Westvleteren and get this awesome and beautiful beer. Definately one of my favourites, but doesn’t really dissociate from a couple of other great beers in the market.",4.4

2477,Westvleteren 12,"Pours dark, chocolate brown with minimal head. Aroma of dark fruit, prune, chocolate, molasses. Taste was much the same but balanced and not overly sweet.

2486,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. A really beatiful beer. Deep amber with a fantastic looking slightly tanned head. It looks like the head is comming from a under-beer volcano in the middle of the glass. 
Aroma is almost vinous but not in a bad way. Sugar, brown sugar, dark fruits, doughy, some hay, some sweeter fruits too like banana perhaps. 
The taste is really, really nice. Follows the nose well, with a nice bite in it. Probably the best mouthfeel on a Belgian in my short career :) Medium with a perfect(!) carbonation. Lingers nicely in the aftertaste. Extremely clean and natural in the all flavors. Not the best beer I’ve ever had, but so glad to finally try this. Worth the hype? I don’t know, but nevertheless, I like it - a lot!",4.5
2487,Westvleteren 12,Awesome beer. Just picked up two cases. Living in Europe has its advantages. I believe the other Trappists are on par with this one but it is really great to taste this rare beer. Also picked p some TW8s which are also awesome. The blonde was great too!,4.7
2488,Westvleteren 12,"11.2 oz bottle. Was thrilled to finally cross this beer off my bucket list because it wasn’t easy! friend brought some back from France. insane appearance, persistent mountainous head that wouldn’t recede. incredibly soft, yet distinctive layers of complexity. No profound coffee or chocolate like I hoped there wouldn’t be. The high alcohol is perfectly tucked in. This beer is clearly a titan. Think St Bernardus ABT 12, but with an extra layer of complexity, and a cleaner finish.

Pours a amber/red/maroon color with thin off white head. Aromas of dried fruits and yeast. Flavors of sweet figs, some yeast, and candied fruits. I have to say, I was a little let down by this beer.

First sniff from the bottle and this is surprisingly beery and malt grainy. Not the overpowering hit of alcoholic complexity I was expecting. Pours dark reddish brown, with some nice reddish clarity in the glass. Thin off white bubbly head. First full on aroma is very malty. Caramel, ripe fruit, particularly a banana estery aroma, dark rye bread. Lots of banana and caramel, ripe plums. Taste is tangy and estery, but surprisingly quaffable and drinkable. It’s caramel, banana estery, some light dark fruit, plums and a bit of brandy or cognac alcoholic kick on the finish, with some of that black rye bread. Texture is medium, not heavy really, and it’s quite sticky and sweet. It’s less complex and heavy than Rochefort 10, but way more drinkable IMHO. I really like it. Could knock one of these back every day. 17.01.14 - comparison with St. Bernardus Abt 12. The Westy is definitely maltier and dryer compared to the fruit of the St. B. and the Westy 12 has a beautiful malty banana nose, which out-rates the St B.

Flavor of bread, yeast, vanilla, dark fruit, caramel, alcohol, raisins, and wood. So very complex. Seems to hit every single taste bud on my tongue with every sip.

2531,Westvleteren 12,"(Rating #500) - On ne devient pas la meilleure bière au monde par auto-proclamation, juste parce qu’on le décide. On obtient ce statut par l’approbation générale. Carlsberg se targue d’être «probablement la meilleure bière au monde», mais qu’en est-il dans les faits? Budweiser, «King of beers»... dans quel putain de royaume? La Westvleteren 12 est la meilleure bière au monde parce que des gens l’ont bue et qu’ils l’ont vraiment aimée. Il y a peut-être l’effet de rareté qui ajoute à l’aura mythique de cette bière, mais son couronnement n’aurait jamais eu lieu si le produit n’était pas exceptionnel. Et justement, il est exceptionnel — that’s it! Pourquoi? Comment? Je ne sais pas. Chose sûre, je me ferai un devoir de vous décrire du mieux que je peux chacune des gorgées de la bouteille que je viens d’ouvrir. 1) Sentiment envoûtant de sécheresse; c’est à la fois sucré et amer. 2) Un peu de mélasse par-ci, un peu d’alcool par là. Le bal est ouvert! 3) Une autre lampée – plus copieuse – pour goûter le grain franc qui donne un corps de déesse à cette bière. 4) Et on recommence avec des saveurs légèrement boisées, peut-être un peu vineuse sur les flancs quand on s’y attarde. 5) Oui, du porto! Il y a définitivement des airs de famille entre un bon porto et cette Trappiste. 6) Sans commentaire... J’ai pris cette sixième gorgée sans réfléchir, ne serait-ce que pour prendre le temps d’en profiter un peu. 7) Mes papilles sont saturées par l’alcool et les sensations volatiles. Ma langue est engourdie par l’élan émotif des saveurs à fleur de peau. 8-9) Une gorgée double pour tenter de goûter davantage, plus égoïstement, ce qui pourrait difficilement être plus intense. En bouche, des impressions de sirop d’érable me titillent. 10) Je renifle mon verre avant d’attaquer cette dixième. Des effluves d’alcool contre-attaquent, comme pour me dire «calme tes nerfs buddy! Tu ne peux pas boire pas Westvleteren 12 en 10 minutes sous prétexte que t’as envie d’écrire un texte de merde et aller te coucher par la suite. Tu vas la laisser se réchauffer un peu et prendre le temps de la laisser mûrir sur ton bureau». Et puisque j’écoute la bière quand elle me parle (ça n’arrive pas souvent), je vais fermer ma gueule sur cette gorgée sensationnelle (oui, sensationnelle!). 11) J’ai pris la onzième gorgée en écrivant sans même prêter attention. Je devrais consulter! 12) Je viens d’offrir une lampée à ma douce en lui disant «tiens, goûte à la meilleure bière au monde». Puisqu’elle venait de bouffer de la pâte à biscuits, elle a trouvé que c’était boisé et alcoolisé, mais très peu sucré. La leçon du jour : ne vous empiffrez pas de pâte à biscuits avant de décapsuler une Westy; vous passeriez alors à côté de sa merveilleuse rondeur sucrée qui nous rend complètement fou. 13) Puisque le chiffre 13 porte malheur, j’ai versé cette gorgée dans la gamelle du chat. Depuis ce temps, son ronron est beaucoup moins grinçant. 14) Mon palais retrouve sa forme, je dénote une certaine acidité et des notes plus torréfiées. 15) Je fais tourner le doux liquide dans ma bouche et il caresse mes joues, ma langue, mon palais, mes gencives. Mon dentiste m’a dit de ne pas trop laisser les liquides longtemps dans ma bouche, que ce n’était pas bon pour mes dents. O.K. mec, mais je bois une Westvleteren 12! Je ne vais quand même pas l’avaler tout rond sans la laisser m’agacer les capteurs. No way! S’il insiste, je téléphone à l’Association Dentaire Canadienne pour lui coller un grief! 16) Ce que je notais comme des saveurs de mélasse lors des premiers contacts se sont transformées en caramel, avec un peu de chocolat en périphérie. C’est magique! 17) L’alcool (10.2%) prend tout de même beaucoup de place dans cette bière. Ce n’est pas un point négatif; juste un constat. Ici, l’alcool ne semble pas amplifier ou porter les saveurs, il trouve sa place dans les méandres vacants. On goûte le sucre, puis l’alcool, dans une alternance effrénée, comme une danse avec un tempo imposé par l’urgence de finir le verre. 18) Je constate pour la première fois que la bière est pétillante. Pas énormément, mais tout de même un peu. Comme si les bulles étaient enfouies sous le lot des saveurs et qu’elles resurgissaient à la dernière minute pour nous donner un «kick». 19) Le fond du verre est visible. J’en suis presque nerveux. 20) Ça y’est, le verre est vide! J’ai pris ma dernière gorgée avec un biscuit que ma tendre moitié vient de cuisiner (les mêmes biscuits desquels elle avait tiré la pâte qu’elle avait en bouche lors de la douzième gorgée). C’est vrai que le côté sucré s’efface, mais l’amertume est mise en relief pour la première fois et ça donne une nouvelle dimension au produit. Je suis très heureux d’avoir tenté le coup. Et plus encore d’avoir bu une autre Westvleteren 12. Je ne sais pas s’il s’agit réellement de la meilleure bière au monde (qui suis-je, anyway, pour dire qu’une bière est la meilleure sur la planète?), mais je suis prêt à affirmer qu’elle est excellente. D’ailleurs, j’espère ne jamais m’arrêter à dire qu’une bière est la meilleure... LA MEILLEURE E-V-E-R! Si ce jour arrive, j’aurai l’impression d’avoir atteint la fin de ma quête. J’aurai le feeling d’avoir plafonné. Que mes prochaines dégustations seront vaines. Il y a tellement de découvertes à faire et le terrain me semble infini. Jusqu’à maintenant, c’est cet horizon qui s’étend à perte de vue qui me plaît, qui me garde en haleine. Je viens de boire une Westvleteren 12 et j’ai passé une belle soirée... Il s’agissait de mon 500e commentaire sur RateBeer et c’est tout ce que j’ai à dire pour l’instant...",4.6

Pours a dark red with a creamy head. Big aromas of cherry, fig, honey, Belgian sugars, dark fruit and bread. Flavors of dark fruits, cherry, Belgian sugars, slight alcohol (and in the nose), honey, and bread. Medium to high sweet. Leaves almost no aftertaste, very clean. Perhaps a tad bit over rated, but deserving a high rating for what goes into it. For the 40$ price tag per bottle, it was only worth for my wedding, otherwise, I’d say it is worth 10$ per bottle.

About the beer; managed to get a bottle on the black market on holiday in Brugge. Also got the 8 and the blond, the 8 was great. The 12 was quite fizzy. The high alcohol content is noticeable, but not in a good. Sharp boozy notes dominates the taste.

The initial flavor was moderately sweet, lightly acidic and slightly bitter; while the finish was heavily sweet, slightly sour and lightly bitter with a long duration. There was dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, figs, plum, prune, date, raisin, spicy and dusty yeast, hints of cocoa, candy sugar, slightly hops and something almost slightly off, cola, and vanilla.

The bottle leaves no information but the bottlecap so I had no idea of what to expect. The foam is not very stable and the CO2 is well present but not too much. Just enough actually.
Taste is deep and full with a very nice bitterness. Not sweet, just right. I couldn’t taste alcohol, that’s fine. The smell is spicy.

Alcohol is just barely noticed and I am very surprised to see how much is in here. Some brown sugar. This is so smooth and is just obviously well brewed and then some. The best beer in the world? A difficult question. But the fact that these monks have been brewing this for so long before craft beer became cool definitely has to count for something.

2587,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #2000. 330ml brown bottle - a gift from verticalbaconstrips the night of RBAG 1. I’m not really sure how old it is, or how it was acquired, I’ve had it for over a year now. The cap has a date of 24.09.13. Brown pour, orangey highlights, hazy, some sediment. Dark beige head that fades to a small tight bubbled cap, some creamy edges and ok lacing. Nose has rich plummy fruit notes, sort of winey, a bit of rich alcohol, chocolate. Taste has chocolate malts, toffee, and dark fruit (plum and black cherries, raisin), a bit of late bitterness and some alcohol. Aftertaste has light hops, rich chocolate and toffee malts, lingering dark fruit notes. A lot drier than I was expecting. Mid to full body with pretty active carbonation. Overall, the Westy expresses everything I would like to see in the abt/quad style, it certainly stands up to, but does not surpass my favourites in this style. It was/is an excellent beer, and I feel like a true rater now that I’ve had the Westy.",4.2
2588,Westvleteren 12,"As an american who has wanted to taste this beer for some time, I found myself lucky to have recent moved only a few hours drive from Westvleteren.  I recently made the trip and bought several gift packs of XII and also sampled in the cafe.  If you love this style, the XII is a real treat.  This strong has an extremely pleasing bitterness with chocolate and burnt sugar flavors -  it is complex, and, depending on the day, i would also say marzipan, caramel and citrus as well overtones as well.  I think that the key to enjoying this beer is to drink it at the right temperature.  I store at approx. 50-60 degrees and put in the fridge for 20 min. before drinking to settle the yeast.  If you drink immediately after opening, the taste is much more sharp.  I like to leave it to sit for 20-25 minutes, at which time I do believe this is a very close to perfect brew!  Highly recommended if you like the style.  On a side note, I also love the Rochefort 10 and put it on par w/ the Westvleteren, absolutely.  They are equally amazing.",4.6

Dark aroma of malt and caramel with very subtle notes of dried fruit and alcohol. Sweet flavour of caramel malt, spreading all over the palate and lingering for a long time. Warming alcohol presence, notably in the finish. Notes of coffee and nuts in the aftertaste. Great! I know some might say it is snobbery, but it does deserve a 5!

2592,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, BBE 2015-04-20. Clear deep ruby brown beer with blonde head. Aroma is red vinous, cream toffeey sweet, dark fruity, anisey/licoricy spicy and herbal. Flavor is malty, spicy, herbal, dark fruity, toffeey sweet and Belgian yeasty. Palate is full and foamy. Finish has a quite heavy bite of bitterness, blending with heat of alcohol. Aftertastes of dark fruits, herbs, sweet toffee and peary Belgian yeast with some salt. Decent stuff but not the best quad I’ve had.

Proven perfect match with truffle from Norcia (Italy) and with pastry cream and chocolate. Beer mystical and winter, immense. Addictive.",5.0

2605,Westvleteren 12,"Undoubtedly is a great beer. But I think it has a little myth behind, certainly well earned.
Before rate this beer, I have to say that I’ve drunk this beer in a bar (aux vieux temps) and I think that is better if you keep in cellar for at least a year before drink. If not, it has too much alcoholic flavor.

Aroma: Great, not too caramel, some nice esters, a little alcoholic.
Appearance: The best. Dark but not black. Deep brown.
Taste: Similar to aroma. Too much alcoholic.
Palate: Greate
Overall: The myth is grater than a beer, but steel being a great beer.",4.2

There was a small tan head that lasted for quite a while but slowly dissipated leaving little to no lacing.  Aroma was fantastic, strong and much more evident than Roch/St.B.

2611,Westvleteren 12,"This beer is clearly overrated. Of course, it is excellent, but there are several Trappist beers that I would rank better, and a handful of other traditional breweries that most certainly rank higher. The beer is very sweet, due to the extracts and syrups that they have started to use over the last few years. It looks beautiful (reddish brown), is wonderfully carbonated, and tastes very nice with a clean finish, but is not as mind-blowing as I would have expected. I would take De Struise’s ostveletren 12 or Achel over this one. That being said, this brew is still excellent.",3.6
2612,Westvleteren 12,"A lovely reddish brown burgundy color with a compact off-white head. Nose is caramel, raisins, vanilla, cherries, dried fruit.

So, I must preface this review by saying that I’m not very inclined towards abts in general, but I passed a glass of this guy around last night when friends were over. Pretty good, but there are definitely beers in this style that I prefer. Pours a very dark cloudy brown, lots of particulate. Aroma is amazing, sweet, candi sugar, malt, prunes, vanilla, dried fruit, cherries. The body is lively enough, and the finish hits very boozy, with subtle almond notes. A good beer but I wasn’t gobsmacked.",4.1

The aroma is boozy, fruity, bready, spicy. The appearance is hazy yet slightly translucent red/brown, fluffy off-white head.  The flavor is nice, yeasty, spicy, fruit, bread, caramel. The finish is peppery, yeasty.  Medium in body.  Waited a long time to try this.  Very nicely crafted beer, but hardly up to its hype, imho.

I really love everything about this beer--it locks into all of my personal favourite attributes of a strong beer. It’s malty but with a complex aroma and taste; dark fruits, malt, and belgian yeast dominate but there’s so much more--and different from one bottle to the next (though, I suppose this could mean the potential for quality control issues but the two times I have had this beer I was never disappointed).

First taste notion is sweet, then a warm, slightly alcoholic explosion of taste in the mouth that calms down after some time and leaves a longing trace with some dryness in the finish.

None of the ingredients is dominant, everything is in a heavenly balanced state. To me it definitely lives up to the hype. The only downside is of course the availability.

2668,Westvleteren 12,"Date 14.11.15 in the bottle top. A dark brown beer with a big, dense and beige head. Aroma of dark fruits, raisins, prune, also interesting sourness of green apples, lots of earthyness, hint of chocolate. Taste is full of rich dark fruits, some roastiness, power of alcohol without taste, sourness and dry herbs. Overally, the taste is surprisingly dry. Full bodied, lots of smooth carbonation. Powerfull, dark and dry fruits with sourness and herbs. This bottle is too young and raw, smoothness, sophistication and harmony are currently missing with this bottle, but the potential is there. New tasting 10.1.2015, bottle with bbe 19.3.16, as almost two years old. More balanced now, one point more to taste and overall, 39 -> 41.",4.1
2669,Westvleteren 12,"Dark brown/ruby colored with big light brown head. Smells yeasty, sweet, some dark fruits, cherries. Kind of like a dark lager.

2670,Westvleteren 12,"0.33l bottle. Dark brown/ruby body, light brown head, huge pieces of sediment. Musty, caramely and candy sugary aroma. Flavor is musty with lots of caramel, candi sugar, champagne-like yeast, cherry and floral hops. Very intense and complex. An amazing quad.",4.9
2671,Westvleteren 12,"I have two crates with 24 bottles of this at home. Picked it up at the monks and drunk two botles of WV12 ""In de Vrede"". Excellent beer but not better then the Rochefort 10. According to me this beer is overrated because it is hard to obtain.",4.4
2672,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at Gästrike-Hälsinglands nation. Pours reddish brown with a moderately high, pale head. Scents of rich dark fruits; plums and rasins. Taste is a lot more malty than expected, ending up with a really balanced taste dates, plums and hints of chocolate. 

Clearly the best trappist I have ever tried. If you get the chance - try it!",4.6
2673,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at home in London with Lyoli. Vintage 2002, drank in 2013. Got this in a trade with Ian - thanks, mate! Pours lightly murky brown with a slight, tan foam head that quickly fizzes away into a few filmy bubbles before receding into nothing. The aroma holds all kinds of aged fruits, brown sugar, caramel, dates, figs, raisins, plums, suggestions of oxidation, rich bread, fruit cake. Flavor is big and sweet, lots of syrupy fruits, hints of tang to the dark berries, lots of brown sugar, plums, golden raisins, dates. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Lightly warming finish with lots of sticky sugars, overripe fruits, candied sugars, hefty caramel and dates, lots of sweet bread. Immensely complex and nuanced, and quite drinkable given the ABV. Additionally, the beer has aged gracefully. Absolutely world-class. Wonderful beer.",4.5
2674,Westvleteren 12,"From bottle (best before April 20 2015). Pours brown with a ruby haze. Visible yeast sediment. Truly complex aroma of caramelized sugar and raisin?. First impression is it is a great quad, but is it worth the hype? Slowly a sweet fruity balance arrives. Wet but not over oily finish with a pleasant alcohol stare. Bubbly sweet brown quad, truly something you have to experience. Ye of little faith, believe, for it truly is THAT good.",4.6
2675,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, best before date January 2016. Opaque dark brown with a thick, bubbly good lacing beige head. Aroma is slightly herbal and has all the dark fruit notes; plums, prunes, dates etc. Brown sugar, nuts, oak, apricot, over ripe fruit, light dark chocolate. Taste is medium/heavy sweet and medium bitter. Starts off soft and sweet, but then has some bitterness that lasts into the finish. Seems a bit more rough than the Extra 8. Medium/full body, thick oily texture, medium carbonation. Finishes light dry and bitter with fruit notes and light alcohol.",4.5
2676,Westvleteren 12,"From bottle. Pours ruby brown with not as much head as I was expecting. Smells earthy, fig, peppery, spice with some alcohol burn even on the nose. No hop aroma noticeable. Amazingly Smooth mouthfeel with a very pleasant coating of the palette and only a slight alcohol burn going down. Have to reiterate the smoothness here. Only traces of bitterness, dark soda bread, leather, and then a earthy umami finish. This is not as mindblowing tasty as I thought it would be but I will say that is the most complex without being so aggressive beer I have tried to date. Thanks to Greg & Mara S. for sharing!!!

Well it’s a masterpiece of craftmanship. So well balanced in all it’s complexity. The aroma is earthy, woody, deep and nutty. So is the taste where you can find more flavours in every sip. Caramel, chocolate, nuts, resin, herbs, earthy, raisin... You got it all. And you just have to add the mystique to the experience. Maybe that’s where the XII makes the leap from the great to the heavenly.",4.4
2681,Westvleteren 12,So i am finally rating the might Westy. I drank this for no particular occasion i just decided i had hoarded it long enough. BBE 17/11/13. The best thing about this beer is the balance. I don’t think it can be beaten. However (and this might sound blasphemus) i expected more from the taste. Similar to the Westy 8 its got that musty earthy taste but more sweetness and richness. Like Abt 12 but this is better. All being said though i would drink a Rochefort 10 ahead of this any day for it’s taste and at a fraction of the price.,4.4
2682,Westvleteren 12,"March 2013 - Bottle, 2012 vintage, as Trappist Westvleteren 12, 10.2%.  Beer #400 on RB.  Expectations high... More carbonated than I was expecting.  Couple of centimeters of head which endures.  Smell - old ale, sweet and inviting.  Taste starts slightly sharp, there are stages in the flavour which intensifies.  Brandy/whisky notes.  Rounded flavour.  Alcohol is well hidden.  Spice, mustiness and spirits.  Nice beer.  (3.7)


Oct 2014 - Bottle, over 2 years old.  Dark red, quite clear, sparkling, big foamy off-white head endures, leaves sparse lacing.  Aroma is very malty, lots of green apple, some cherry, christmas pudding.  Body is medium, touch of carbonation, pretty foamy, tingly on the tongue.  Taste has lots of strong malt, soft apple, some butter, touch of spicy alcohol but pretty smooth drinking. (3.8)


Jan 2015 - Bottle, Dec 2013 vintage.  Very dark red brown, very big foamy beige head.  Aroma is biscuity and sweet.  Body is medium, foamy, low carb.  Taste is sweet pungent toffee malt, lots of spice, tangy rhubarb, gluey. Bigger flavour than the last couple of bottles. (3.6)


Feb 2016 - Vintage Oct 2012.  Taste is raisins, cherry cola, peppery spice, some dry booze, wood, aged malts, some tawny port.  I mean, this is a good and interesting beer.  But I really can’t say it’s one of the best in the world. (3.7)  


October 2017 - Bottle share at Magic Dave's Leaving Tea Party.  Side-by-side of St Bernardus 12 (2013), Westvleteren 12 (2012) and Rochefort 10 (2013).  Spicy, nutty, robust.  Little harsh.  Lacks the drinkability of Bernardus and the complexity of Rochefort. (7-4-6-4-15=3.6)",3.8
2683,Westvleteren 12,"12 ounce bottle by way of the American distribution series in 2012.  Moderately foggy brown with white foam on top, heavy bubble action that pops the top off the bottle. Aroma is hot and boozy, cinnamon, brown sugar, woodsy. Taste is primarily dry fruit, raisins, prunes, more of that liquor warmth, spice, sweet like a hot toddy.  Light side of medium in body, carbonation sizzle is striking.  Overall, this was a very good beer and a shining example of old, European brewing traditions. Once the printing press gave those monks some freetime, they did a knockup job with beverage technologies! It still compares to the best beers out there, all while tasting like an old world, medieval recipe. It’s subdued and relaxing. However, it did not knock my socks off.  In a blind tasting, I’d probably give it an A-. Part of the fun with any beer, though, is the story behind it and Westie XII’s history is beer folklore.",3.8
2684,Westvleteren 12,"Uploading old ratings that were missing comments. Nothing could possibly live up to the hype but this is really great. Palate is really the standout. Rich and full with just the right amount of carb. Justifiably the gold standard for the style.

2693,Westvleteren 12,Finally having a bottle! Won it in a raffle at Monks. 2012 vintage. Opaque brown pour with a huge frothy tan head. Big and malty yet remarkably silky and smooth. Dark chocolate caramel raisins. Deep layered. Unexpectedly creamy. Not pitch black like a stout but very rich and deeply complex. Just the perfect amount of floral bitterness to offset the sweet dark malt. Way too easy to drink for 10% ABV. Knew that many people consider this one of the best beers in the world. Also knew that many times old vintages get passed around that have not been stored properly and go thin. This bottle is fresh and perfect. The foamy head lasts. Body is perfection.

It pours a red/bronze-ish with a small offwhite head. The aroma is about as sweet as it gets, alot of candysugar in there. Heavy on the sweet side, with a alot of grains/malts.

Originally rated on 20090721, same vintage (10-4-10-4-17).

Pours dark murky copper-brown color with a small head. Not as lively as the more fresh bottles. Aroma is very complex with lots of ripe fruits like plums, dates, some raisins, lots of caramel and even licorice notes, mild toffee with a subtle spicy twist, yeast and earthy notes too.

Flavor is also nothing short of complex, caramel, spicy toffee, plums and raisins. Faint lingering licorice on the background. Finishes with caramelly and yeasty malts. Medium carbonation, sourish fruity palate with a sweet finish. Excellent stuff.

I would like to re-visit this brew when it is aged.,4.0
2725,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz Bottle. The pour was a medium/dark murky brown with a small (less than 1 finger) light brown fizzy head that reduced down to a thin film and small collar, which lasted throughout and had excellent sheeting of lacing.

The aroma was of a sweet dark bread malt and a bold doughy Belgian yeast with notes of toffee, chocolate, coffee, banana, dark fruit (plums, figs and dates) and a light alcohol presence.

The taste was a smooth malty sweet with just a touch of toffee and chocolate along with a nice mild roastiness early on, and then progressed with a somewhat intense yeast presence building up to a bold fruitiness and a mild alcohol ending. The flavor lasted an average duration following the swallow, and had a yeasty fruity alcohol taste that was left behind to settle in on the taste buds and lingered for a while longer.

Mouthfeel was just under medium in body with a texture that was smooth and creamy yet dry and slightly oily along with a carbonation that was tad prickly.

Overall this is a beer that comes with quite a hype, now I can say it most definitely lives up to it. It has a superb balance of flavors that I have yet to experience in any other beer. Yes, by far this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Thank God I was able to get my hands on some, for the monastery has said it will not be available again here in the US for at least 25 years (2037)...

Taste is sweet malts, lots of dark fruits (juice like) with a smooth warming boozy aftertaste. Has a medium to thick mouthfeel, with a nice carbonation. Incredibly smooth given the ABV. Fantastic beer. Is this the best beer in the world?? Perhaps. While the answer is totally subjective, I will say that this is the best beer that I have ever tried. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone",4.6
2739,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma of dates, caramel,  just mega thick malty raisin, stewed fruits and a little alcohol. Taste is as great as most people on here probably know. Beautifully balanced between the fruity, sugary flavours from the malts, a slight hop bitterness and the hiding of almost any trace of alcohol. But, after all the hype due its availability, and the fact it is awesome beer, there’s an element of ""it is what it is""",4.3
2740,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Moderate to heavy malt aromas of roasted, caramel and milk chocolate, moderate herbs and orange for the hops, light dough and broth for the yeast, with date, wood, brown sugar and bourbon in the background. Head is average size, frothy, light tan with fair yet slippery lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is hazy yet sparkling mahogany. Flavors are moderately sweet and lightly acidic to start, then finishes lightly sweet and acidic and lightly to moderately bitter. Palate is medium to full, creamy, with a fizzy carbonation and a chalky, moderately alcoholic, and sticky on the lips finish. Mmmmm! Yum......make me burp.",4.8
2741,Westvleteren 12,"I have had the luxury of having tasted several of varying ages and it is by far the most ""alive"" beer I have tasted.

When me and a couple of friends went to the abbey to collect our cases of XII we drank one in the pub across the street. It was full of various fruity flavors, a bit citrussy, raisins and plums, with a distinct bitterness which immediately reminded me of ""poperings hommelbier"" which comes from the same region and uses local westflanders hops. I rated it a personal top 5 beer straight away. But more striking was the feeling that this was a young beer that could get even better over time.

The second time I have had a taste was at a friends place who had a bottles which he had laying around in his cellar for 9 years, and a bottle which he had for 5 years. The oldest bottle was bad, it was unpleasantly acidic, it had no other flavors and we didn’t even finish it. The 5 year old bottle was more interesting. It was already starting to get a bit acidic, but not disturbingly, the fruity flavors where much less strong and the palate was definitely much less. Like an aged film-diva. But at this age it still beats much of what is out there 

A few weeks ago I opened my last bottle of the case I got two years ago. And in my opinion the beer was at its best. All the promises the young beer had made came true. The fruity flavors where even more deep and complex, the bitterness had become more subtle, as had the sweetness. At this maturity level this truly is the best beer in the world.

There are only two beers that can compare to this beer: the Rochefort 10 and the Chimay Bleu. The Rochefort is an incredible beer (personal top5) but it is a bit les dynamic in aging. The Chimay is a personal favorite as well, with a promise of aging well, but I still have to try one that has matured. So far, this is the absolute best!",4.8

The great thing is this flavor transitions to the backend very smoothly with a long lasting end flavor. Mouthfell is silky and the carbonation is medium-above average. This is an awesome beer.

2755,Westvleteren 12,"I could easily have passed through life without ever tasting this magnificent beer, but fortune let some come to me.

This beer is one of mankind’s great achievements. It should be drunk in a deconsecrated cathedral, with the organ playing and sunlight streaming through the stained glass. 

Is it better than Trappist Rochefort 10? I’m not sure. Is Bach better than Beethoven? If anyone wants to send me a bottle of each I’ll be glad to run another comparison.

2019 update: I had the privilege of visiting them in Belgium. Had one at the store and bought a six-pack to share with brother-in-law.

2774,Westvleteren 12,"So this is it. Arguably the best beer in the ratebeer world, if not the world. This was a treat and consumed with my best man a few days after my wedding. I was wondering if this was the product of hype or something genuinely good; an internet sensation but an olfactory anomaly? I opened, I sniffed, I swirled I enjoyed and I was wowed. It has been the most remarkable couple of days.
The colour was a deep ruby, close to mahogany. It had an enduring cream coloured head that left a spiderweb of lace down the glass. I was impressed by the evident carbonation and how it was clear, not opaque.  I sniffed and then snorted. It was nearly ten minutes before I realised I had not tasted. I smelled currants, rhubarb, licorice, allpsice, candisugar, glace fruits, oranges, grapefruit, banana, guava, cinnamon, cardamon, dates, marshmallow, cassia, fruitbread, plums, damson jam, choclate dust, molasses and treacle. It evolved. It wasn’t just one smell, it was a changing amorphous cloud of thousands of aromas.
I took a draught and was immediately wowed by the mouthfeel of a creamy, bubbly sweet and desserty body that was powdery as well. It had flavours that were vinous - red and desserty with nods to port, marsala and madeira. It had all the aromas evident in the flavour and all the changes that the aroma underwent, It was sweet and then sour and then dry. There was no immediate clash of flavours but it wasn’t restrained: it was full of intrigue.
I had to ask myself, is this my favourite beer, or is it my most remarkable beer? I found that while this is my most remarkable beer, my favourites make up a long list that include this. The number one may change due to time, place and circumstance, and this will always be on that list. This will always be the most remarkable.",4.9

The flavor is very sweet, but tempered well with mild hop bitterness. There is a little citrusy tartness. Medium body, velvety feel on the tongue, and a little sticky. Overall, this is a great, flavorful, and well made beer. The palate is wonderfully light and effervescent. This is a great beer. [Re-edit, from a 2012 bottle shared by Hamp at Ale Alpharetta] The extra time has been friendly, adding some dark cherries and cognac notes. Mellowed out considerablly, with a much rounder, more blended character. The hop bitterness has all but disappeared.

Taste is a little bready upfront. Masks the 10.2% ABV fairly well but alcohol taste is still notable. Overripe fruits come through (some blackberry, raisin, or plum perhaps).

Misc.: Bottle cap and part on bottle  said best by Jan. 8, 2015; The only time this beer has been in the U.S. and supposedly the only time it will be.

Poured a mahogany color with about a finger of off-white head that stayed forever on the top of the beer. Great thick and milky lacing on the sides. Great retention all the way down.

Smelled sour fruit up, followed by a sweet tarty flavor. Got green apple and kiwi. Also some malt backbone to it, mainly toasty caramel and toffee. Some light chocolate, too? Got better as I sat and smelled it.

Tasted similar to the nose. Just so damn smooth. Definitely could taste the alcohol up front. Some cloves, which I didn’t get in the smell. Got the green apple and tartness. Also light hints of caramel, honey

Medium body. Thin texture. Soft (below average) carbonation. Long, smooth finish.

Slightly sweet with sour finish. Aroma starts to wake up after a few sips as it gets more sour elements. Very well balanced.",4.2
2803,Westvleteren 12,"Just amazing. Totally lives up to the hype. Worth lining up at 6:00 in the cold for it.  A beautiful beer, and definitely superior to others of the same style (Abt. 12, Rochefort 10.)",5.0

2806,Westvleteren 12,"12oz bottle shared. Poured brownish amber color with off whit head. Of course this is in the appropriate westy stemmed goblet.No lacing to speak of. The aroma of dark fruits and malt blended together for an exquisite aroma. The flavor, well the flavors of malt, dark fruit of figs,cherries, dates and some bread mixed with the tingling sensation of the carbonation is extraordinary. I can now truly understand why this beer is in such demand and given one of the highest ratings in the world. There is a mild alcohol burn on the back end that just lingers in a good way. A big thanks to my friend for sharing this experience with me.",4.4
2807,Westvleteren 12,"Tasted from the bottle, on 26/12/2012.
Pours of muddy, dirty dark brown with a proper beige head.
Aroma is excellent, quite intense, with huge fruity character, mostly plums and those kinds of fruits.
Taste is epic, super rich and fruity - raisins, plums, pears, apricots and much more! Could feel candy sugar and syrup notes as well  
Aftertaste has a huge alcohol wave, which is a bit disappointing.

2809,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a copper-brown with a dense creamy ivory head.  Malty sweet aroma with fruity esters, candy sugar, toast, cherry, caramel, raisin, and alcohol notes.  Flavor is wonderfully rich and sweet with a fruity spiciness.  Flavor notes are similar to the aromas.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a slight alcohol warm.  The carbonation level is high and the finish is semi-dry.  This is an awesome beer... Heaven in a glass!  Hats off to Shelton Brothers for bringing this limited release to the US and to Crown Liquors for bringing it to Indianapolis.",5.0
2810,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz bottled Feb 10, 2012.  XII version from the US gift set.  Served at cellar temperature.  Enjoyed on Christmas Day 2012.



Pours clear dark brown with red highlights and an active one finger light tan head that recedes to a small cap, but doesn’t leave much lacing.  (not much room for lacing in the tiny Westy XII glass included with the set).



Aroma is dark fruits, cherries, alcohol, belgian yeast, bread, brown sugar, red wine characteristics.  Good to very good strength.  This glass isn’t very good for capturing aromas...will try second half pour in a snifter or tulip.



Flavor is big overripe dark fruits, cherries, figs, plums, belgian yeast, rich bread, toward the finish some chocolate notes come up and more really dark fruits such as raisins, dates and figs, brown sugar.  Some alcohol burn in the middle and finish, but not too bad.  Moderate sweetness.  Extremely complex.



Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sharp, fizzy carbonation, somewhat sticky.  As it warms to room temp the mouthfeel completely changes, much more full bodied, super creamy, soft carbonation, wonderful.



My Christmas treat!  This has always been way high on my wants, but never had much chance to try this...heard about the gift sets coming to the US and even then it was dicey whether I could procure one...lucked out and so glad I did!  Truly enjoyable beer, worth the price...gonna cellar one bottle and spread the rest out to some friends.",4.4

2812,Westvleteren 12,"Mahogany beer with white light head. Aroma is really nutty, rich and fruity. The beer itself is delicious; chestnuts, raisins, wheat, and a delightfully smooth rich body. Ending with a warming estery, alcohol that spreads across the palate. A joy to drink, and while I’m sure this isn’t the most ’exciting’ beer I ever had it’s actually flawless.",4.1
2813,Westvleteren 12,"Still can’t believe I got my hands on some of this.  Thanks again, toffsbury.  Pours hazy brown with a 1/4-inch head.  Aroma is candy sweet, with caramel, some spice, and some alcohol.  Taste is great - very well balanced.  Sweet but not too sweet, caramel, spice, alcohol, slight notes of dark fruits and chocolate.  Very smooth and easy drinking.  Dry finish.  Great body with nice light carbonation.  I can’t say it’s my favourite beer, but I can say it did not disappoint.",4.4

2815,Westvleteren 12,"Caramel colored with a fizzy cocoa-dusted head. Very sweet aroma of burnt sugar and toffee apple, along with roasted malts, pears and grapes. Too much carbonation in my opinion (it was fizzing as soon as I cracked it open). Smells somewhat like champagne but stronger, richer, and complex. Alcohol trickles in smoothly in the taste. Medium bodied with a mild bitter finish.

Most I’ve ever spent on a beer, a bit overhyped (and definitely overpriced), but without a doubt an excellent beer.",4.8

2819,Westvleteren 12,"Quads are one of my favorite styles, so IPA fans may not rate this as highly.  Pours transparent brown with small bubbles leaving a very fine lace that does not last long.  Good tasty, malty Quad flavor with a bit of mustiness, prunes and a dry finish.  Drank this alongside St Bernardus ABT 12 and Rochefort 10;  honestly all are great beers and there’s only tiny differences between them, so if you can’t her Westvleteren, don’t worry too much about it.",4.7

2823,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz bottle, generously shared by Alden. Thanks a ton man. Hazy brown-red color. Very  nice thin khaki head, with good retention. Nice lace. Dark fruit, raisins, chocolate, spice in the nose. Nice light mild bitter taste, light spice. Sort of a light body, very smooth and easy to drink, no viscosity, no bite, just a nice comforting warmth. Some people say ""just get a St. Bernardus 12 and it’s basically the same thing"". No, absolutely not. This is way, way better. Texture and complexity has no comparison. Not my favorite beer ever, but most likely my favorite quad so far, and indisputably great stuff.",4.3
2824,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from 12-12-12 distribution. Pours a ruby-brown color with a fair amount of light brown, frothy head. Aroma is dried fruits: cherry, raisin, date, and maybe some fresh fruit like apple and pear. Also get some mild spiciness and yeast. Taste is a rush of sweet, sour and bitter simultaneously. In the mouth, the aroma is more complex-- I’m getting rich dark malt, the fruitiness again, buttery caramel, vanilla, wood, citrus, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected-- I am used to a characteristic syrupy feel with Belgian strong ales. Carbonation is lively, also a feature I’m not used to with this style. Finish is short, with just a hint of bitterness.

Comparing this to other beers of the same style and caliber, Westy 12 is exceptionally smooth. The flavors seem more complex and better balanced than the St Bernardus and Rochefort quadruples I’ve had. Not sure if these qualities are enough to garner the title of ""best beer in the world"", but it’s damn good, and I’m glad I secretly slipped out of work on 12-12-12 to pick up a brick at Binny’s. :)",4.4
2825,Westvleteren 12,"A bottle from the gift pack served in the Westy glass.  Westvleteren XII has a moderate tab head that never really disappears and leaves great lacing rings.  The nose is foremost fruitiness, ripe red grape skins, peaches, with even more ---  figs, raisins, dates, cherry, chocolate and molasses.

The body is very full, and the mouthfeel very smooth and at the same time lively with many tiny bubbles. The flavor is extraordinarily complex with everything you get in the aroma, with the addition of nuts like hazelnut, walnut, and pecan. and ripe fruits like plums and cherry.  The finish shows spices such as cloves, cinnamon and pepper. The alcohol is present but unlike many high alcohol beers adds to the character.

Saint Bernardus Abt 12 and Chimay have been my favorite Belgian beers for years, but I can say without hesitation that Westvleteren XII tops them both.  Is it the best beer in the world?   I can sure see why it gets that reputation.  It is truly sublime.

But I still have four more bottles left, and just put a big new lock on the door to the beer cellar.",4.7
2826,Westvleteren 12,"24.11.12. Bottle. Some light brown foam, quite compact. Very dark, cloudy brown beer. Aroma is crazy; different, sugar/candy. Great all around.

2827,Westvleteren 12,"Muddy brown colour. Off white head. Aroma is surprisingly weak. Taste is light sweet light bitter. Plums and salty licorice taste at the end. Finish is short. Moderate carbonation. Very drinkable body. Recovering from a flu might affect the rating.

Aroma very complex with lots of grapes, fruits, candy, and some sweet cream.  The taste is also complex with creamy fruit flavors.  The alcohol is hidden well and the palate is not syrupy like other quads.  Overall I’m surprised at how light and creamy it is.  Very good overall, and definitely one of the best beers I’ve had, but I don’t know if I’d  call it the best beer in the world.",4.4

Rich flavor has a mild alcohol presence with flavors of plum, vanilla, figs and a creamy/spicy toffee mouthfeel in the dry bitter finish. Very flavorful and delicious for 7+ years.

2837,Westvleteren 12,"Picked up two 6 packs from a super secret source.  Never had a beer with as much mystic or build up before.  I planned on ageing most of it for a few years and checking back how it developes, but I needed a point of reference so I was forced to crack one open.

Aroma: Winey dark fruits with a touch of vanilla.
Appearance: Deep ruby amber color with slight off white head.  Lacing is minimal but the foam lasts for some time.
Taste: Two flavors hit straight away, port and booze.  The sugary coating on the lips indicates that the with out the high alcohol to cleanse the palate this would be nothing more than a sugar bomb.
Overall: Truly a world class beer that pure attention to detail.  These Trappist monks have shown me they are in a league all their own.

2838,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle in cafe ’In De Vrede’ across the road from the abbey. Had to let it warm up a bit since it is served straight from the fridge. Aroma is banana, toffee apple and bubblegum, but a touch of alcohol vapour comes off unpleasantly too. Appearance is a deep brown colour, nice tan head, with a touch of lace. Taste is where it’s at with this beer. Toffee and toffee apple, grapes, caramel but slightly alcoholic in the mouth which taints what would otherwise have been perfect! Palate is pleasant, slightly thick with toffee, but again, tainted by an alcoholic feel, especially in back of mouth. Overall a great beer, but could be better as the alcolhic attributes ruined what would be much nicer otherwise. A touch too raw at this age I think, could always do with 6 months or so in a cellar. A lot of hype for a beer that is only a tiny bit better than most of the other trappist beers.",4.3

Mouthfeel is medium, and one gets a tingle on the tongue from the bitterness. Westvleteren 12 finishes very dry, crisp, and highly drinkable. Overall, it really is a perfect beer! I beg you to try it! RJT",4.8
2842,Westvleteren 12,"Pours dark and yeasty into the undersized signature Westvleteren XII chalice. Smell is a bit more subtle than expected, but raisins, toffee, apples, pears, and any number of dark fruits come through along with a slight earthiness. Head clings around briefly. Taste is a magnificent balance of malt, fruit, and a hint of hops with a long and powerful finish. Body is right on target: enough to give an initially sweet impression but an overall dry finish. Has the classic warming character of a well crafted strong Belgian ale. Overall this beer tastes like a blend of Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12, and it is easy to see why it’s considered a classic example of the style.",4.1

Oh oh - what am I getting myself into?  Aroma is, well wonderful. Notes of dried fruit, toffee, raisin, fig, light spice and red wine all intertwine. Flavor is even more complex and nuanced, with all of the above plus strong notes of a good port wine. Medium sweet and no real bitterness. Very low carbonation, but that does not detract from the rich, creamy mouthfeel. ABV very well masked, coming through at the end as a bit of warming in the throat. Worth the hype on this one.

2860,Westvleteren 12,"Been drinking this since 1999, before the hype. Since then tasting old and new batches, preferably the aged ones. Not going to talk about pour, colour or on sight characteristics, but will concentrate on aroma and taste. This beer evolves in a unique way and is always an olfactory discovery.

Capsule date 03.09.11 - batch from 3 september 2008. Aroma is an intense round and full bodied melasse experience. Pours flakey yeast that settles to the bottom quickly. Olfactory bliss : Over ripe dates and figs, the distinct sugar cane aroma most WV’s have comes out intensely! Dark bastard sugar, boozy (rum; in analogy with the sugar cane), slight malt and minimal oxidation : iron. Taste is viscose sugar cane, raisin bread, chocolate, caramel and again the dates and melasse.

Other tastings : bottled in 1978, 1985-87-89, 1993-94; 1996, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009 and recently last week in 2012 + fresh batches.

2002 : About the older batches ; one of the smoothest brown beers around, when left untouched for months or years. Extremely well developed aromas. 

Chestnut brown. Aroma shows alcohol, wood, hint of smoke. Flavour notes highlight raisin bread, deep fruitiness (apricot). Long, sweet, silky malts in the finish, with dates and light bready notes.

Fresh batch june 2014 : pours a dark brown with beautiful head and lacing. Almsot like a matured 8 month viscose. Hops are balanced, need to settle but already promisingly soft and potent. Malt, candi sugar, hidden hop spice in the background... mostly don’t notice this hint in other brews...  Visual : no visible yeast flakes in the residue pour. Tastes like a very promising batch.",4.5
2861,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle split into tasting glasses. Murky brown with a generous fizzy head. Aroma is lighter than I had envisioned. Fruity and bread dough.

2863,Westvleteren 12,"Tasted side-by-side with St. Bernardus ABT 12, which is supposedly a near-clone.  Purchased on eBay, shipped direct from Brussels from the limited release gift pack with glasses.  Extremely expensive, but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Enjoyed on December 25, 2011.  Color is dark brown, slight reddish tinge, almost opaque.  Half a finger of head retreated quickly to leave minimal ring of lacing.  Nose is incredible - chocolate, espresso, roasted hazelnuts, spice - maybe even cinnamon??  First taste was surprising.  Lots of carbonation, dried fruit, raisins and dark cherries.  Many hop notes - piney ,a bit earthy.  Strange, nearly sweet flavor presents at the end of each swallow.  Almost a smokey, charcoal with a hint of maple syrup!?  Molasses!  Alcohol nearly missing escept in the after taste, where a pleasant warm burn is felt.

Compared to the St. Bernardus, I found it to be more yeasty and complex, with more carbonation and a more robust mouthfeel too.



UPDATE July 28, 2013.  I’ve been saving these bottles and slowly drinking one at a time since December 25, 2011.  Cracked open the fourth from this batch today, and it has aged extremely well.  Poured with less head than the first bottle two years ago, but the mouthfeel is still extremely carbonated.  All of the original flavors are still here in full force, with a nice added smokiness.  Still a phenomenal beer.",4.8
2864,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz bottle from richdorchak, thanks for each of the vintages Rich! 15.06.14 stamped on the cap (bottled on June 15, 2011). Pours a rich and glowing, dark brown-amber colored body with an inch thick, dense, frothy and creamy, beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is incredible. Plums, raisins, rich caramels, bread, chocolate, dried prunes, alcohol, peppery yeast, and a few licorice notes. Flavor is similar. Bready plums and raisins, deep caramels, chocolate overtones, peppery yeast, light alcohol notes, and licorice. Finishes smooth, lightly bitter and spicy, lightly sweetened, and lightly warmed by alcohol. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium-full body and a soft, moderately lively carbonation. Overall, I went into this with high expectations and it certainly did not let me down. An absolutely outstanding beer. The aroma is sensational; so rich, fruity, spicy, and complex. The flavor is perfectly balanced for the size and complexity and each nuance seems to change with every sip. My favorite of the vintages was this one aged for about a year and a half. 


15.12.12 stamped on the cap (bottled on December 15, 2009). Less fruity throughout, but more tart plums. The malts have definitely smoothed out and there is a bit more of a chocolate essence with a slightly richer and deeper caramel. A few more banana notes, less yeasty and spicy, but still clearly present and nicely balanced. Alcohol notes are still there, but much less so than the newer bottle. Finishes more smooth with a lightly bitter and spicy, somewhat tart plum that leaves a lengthy aftertaste with some yeast sticking out nicely. Overall, I like the smoothed out version of this, but I like the fresher bottle better. The malts are really nice on this and the spices aren’t as intense. Not as fruity, but more tart. Still excellent and my second favorite of the three vintages we tried. 


21.04.12 stamped on the cap (bottled on April 21, 2009). A bit more chocolate on this version with much deeper and richer caramels. The spices seem to come out a bit more than the second bottle we tried with more yeast and a few tobacco notes. Less tart and fruity, but really nice raisins, prunes, and deep plums. No hints of alcohol and still phenomenal. My third favorite of the three we tried.",4.5

First thing that comes to mind after the first sip is the super balance and the mouthfeel are just mindblowing. Flavour are dark fruits, chocolate, licorice, oak, spruce, caramel and yeast.

2888,Westvleteren 12,"The Westy 12 is defined as the Holy Grail for gourmets and lovers of beer, often referred to by the acronym Abt. 12 (which in Dutch means Abate) shows
appearance:
a beautiful dark mahogany color, deep brown, a rich and creamy foam, color slightly caramelized. In the glass, good effervescence, fine and persistent perlage is, spirals lens coils of very fine bubbles.

odor:
There are many notes that blend together in a complex smell where they condense aromatic fragrance and spicy, ripe fruit, plums, figs, raisins, lightly toasted malt, sugar candy, nuts, alcohol present but not intrusive, and a final cocoa and licorice.

taste:
Full flavored, rich, with a surprisingly soft and slender body, despite the strong alcohol. The mixture of flavors is at the top: the yeast, the bitterness of hops pale, slightly astringent red fruit. The lingering finish flows on velvet, a carpet of softness and delicacy, with a sensation of heat and light malt sweetness of toffee and chocolate. Simply a masterpiece.

2890,Westvleteren 12,"Purchased at de Biertempel in Brussels, Belgium, enjoyed at my hotel room in Eppingen, Germany after driving about 5 hours to have the ability to purchase this beer (amongst other things to do in the great city of Brussels).  Very very happy to have found this, I grabbed it and couldn’t believe I found it since the packaging is pretty minimalist.  Appearance is decadent, a very very dark coffee brown with a rather thick consistency and a very abundant, frothy off white head that doesn’t want to go anywhere.  Aroma is something I haven’t experienced before, it almost has a dough-like smell with notes of pepper, dark fruit notes, raisins, an amalgamation of multiple complex ingredients.  Taste is unbelievable.  There is not a bad thing about this beer.  It starts off with a sweet plum / raisin flavor, and finishes with a lively burn that gives an eye-opening sensation.  The mouthfeel is pretty thick and oily, the alcohol blends in nicely but lets itself known.  The only drawback I’d say about this is that I can’t get it readily.  A+++ brew, there was hype and I feel that it strongly met it.  This is the best Belgian beer in the world.",5.0

Colpa forse della temperatura di servizio un pò fredda o del mia mediocre passione per le trappiste ma francamente non mi sento di giudicarla la migliore al mondo: gusto imponente e sontuoso persistente per diverso tempo nel palato dopo anche un solo sorso, caramello misto unicum all’inizio con un buon caffè cacaoso alla fine, corpo deciso seppure morbido e prolungato. Da bere come rituale, ma spendendo molto meno",3.7

It’s got a similar breadiness to the #8 with notes of plum and red grape. That’s a nice combination, but it doesn’t pack much punch here. On the tongue it’s all about malty yeastiness with a fine flavour profile of currants, cherries and spiced orange peel. Palate-wise I can’t argue: it’s more or less spot-on. I can’t help feeling disappointed though. It has all the qualities I’ve come to expect from Westvleteren’s other two beers but falls well short of living up to the hype.

The look is perfect, solid black body, the head that lasts all the way down. The taste is malty, fruity, so complex I was regretting not scribbling it all down. The mouthfeel is oily, solid, all very robust. The boozy kick at the end capped it off. Excellent. The only thing is, I have a cold so can hardly smell... so the 10/10 for the aroma is from the wife.

Seems like each bottle tasted a little different. The first one I opened (same day as pick-up) had massive amounts of liquorice but most of them did not not. Aroma and taste of dark fruit, prunes, dates, figs. Lovely mouth feel. Alcohol scarily hidden. Tried side by side with St Bernardus ABT12 a few times and they’re similar but you can taste the difference. St Bernardus slightly sweeter, less complex. This is truly a great beer but the best? Jury is still out for me.",4.3

Very dark brown pour with a thick, pillowy, off-white head that lingers a very long time.  Aroma is definitely more faint than I expected.  I smell thick bread and dark fruit mostly with hints of some spices and Belgian yeast.  Taste is incredibly smooth.  Taste mostly figs, dates, dark bread, and spices with just hint of Belgian yeast which is nice.  Thick full bodied beer, chewy mouthfeel.  Very smooth finish like drinking a milk shake.  I really enjoyed this beer but it’s not one of my favorites.  I’ll be perfectly happy drinking Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus 12 which are both readily available and I enjoyed more.",4.1
2901,Westvleteren 12,"Dated 14.12.14 so if my Westy math is correct this a 2011 vintage. Shared by me at the Star Wars tasting. Served in a Dechutes tulip.

A: Pours a cloudy, dark amber color. Almost brown in color. A frothy white head forms on the pour and leaves nice, sticky sheets of lace.

S: Big yeasty notes up front, some fruity esters and minimal dark fruit. Bready malts are also heavy on the nose.

T: Dark fruits, figs and dates, are up front neck and neck with the big sweet yeast notes. Bready malts with some light caramelization. Pale malts and some fruity esters.

M: Slightly prickly carbonation with a nice and smooth medium body. There is some slight chew to it as well. Sweet and doughy on the finish.

O: While this was good I’d rather spring for a Rochefort 10 anyday. It didn’t have enough burnt sugar and caramelization for me.

The taste between the two was identical with plums, brown sugar, and citrus all being the most prevelant. I ended up choosing glass 2 (revealed as Westvleteren) to be the winner due to how much more intense all the flavors and smells were.

When still quite cold, flavours are subdued and shy, only faint notes overpowered by the alcohol, but as it warmed up every sip became different.  Dates and raisins and spices, vanilla and biscuit all matured and became much more pronounced by the end when the beer had very nearly reached room temperature, all of it warmed pleasantly by the alcohol.  Long, enjoyable finish that made my slow, hour-long sampling of the bottle very much worth it.  A very good beer, but I feel it is outclassed by my favourites Gulden Draak and Unibroue’s ’La Fin du Monde’.

L’aroma è favoloso: predomina il malto, con sentori floreali, di caramello, malto tostato mentre il luppolo ha una rilevanza minore se non assente. l’unica pecca è che la birra è troppo carbonata,ma basta versarla in un determinato modo ed ""abituarsi"" come al solito,che questo problema è bello che evitato. Il primo sorso mi ha colpito, come tutte le trappiste mi lascia perplesso: frizzante,molto potente, poco gustoso. Come già detto basta aspettare qualche sorsata che la birra si rivela a se per quello che è effettivamente: una bomba! il gusto rispecchia l’aroma, molto dolce e piacevole la componente maltata, con un tripudio di sapori che insieme la rendono davvero unica. finale lungo, dolce con un finale leggermente luppolato. che dire...unica..! grazie a gaetano per l’assaggio!

riassaggiata un versione ""tutta per me"".. conservata gelosamente per una settimana nel frigo e gustata lentamente..bruna/scura con schiuma a grana fine non molto spessa ma che persiste (ovviamente), molto nolto torbida con tanti lieviti in sospensione..aroma sicuramente alcolico,di lieviti e di frutta matura sotto spirito,cacao,uovo,caramello..gusto SPETTACOLARE!!!! tutte le componenti aromatiche elevate all’ennesima potenza! carbonazione media,scende giù con una facilità disarmante..l’alcool si sente anche nel gusto ma è avvolto dagli altri aromi a formare un qualcosa di sensazionale..estremamente corposa e palato molto persistente! il luppolo?non pervenuto! ma va bene,benissimo così..da questo stile sicuramente mi aspettavo un qualcosa di simile alle altre trappiste e bene o male ci va vicina..ma ha una marcia in più, a partire dalla potenza di tutte le componenti degustative,passando per il gusto particolare (differente dalle TOP trappiste rochefort,chimay) e finendo per la rarità, elemento sicuramente responsabile del rilascio di serotonina che sta avvenendo dentro il mio corpo :) cheers!",4.8
2933,Westvleteren 12,"At In De Vrede in April 2008. Yes, it’s a very good beer but I’ve never been really that blown away. Red brown colour. Intensely fruity throughout. Some licorice and herbal notes too. Massively rich but rather sweet for my taste and the alcohol can feel a little hot. I generally prefer the Westvleteren 8 to be honest. To be fair, I’m not sure I’ve ever had a bottle with significant age on it and I probably should to get the full picture. Flagged for re-rate.",3.8
2934,Westvleteren 12,"Tasting 2012 bottle in 2018. Still tons of raisin and brown bread.
Not lots of change.


2012 bottle 4 yrs down. Wow so good. Raisin fig. So drinkable.

2012 bottle tasting in 2015... Tons of raisin, brown bread. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. So smooth. Some rum Flavours. Bottle from 2005 (10 years old): so smooth. Nose very syrupy. Flavours of dark fruit very prominent and brown bread lots of bourbon. Tastes med/big sweet light bitter. Very creamy smooth body alcohol well hidden now. Amazing. Bottle from march 2012 Aromas are much more balanced on this one. Nose is molasses and aromas are molasses, spices and dark fruit. Still quite boozy, but not as overrpowering. Massive carbonation. Like it a lot better this time. Bottle from dec 2011. Pours brown with an initial huge foamy head that lasts a long time. Massive lacing. Aromas are dark fruit, roasted malt, maybe leather and ashes. Lots of bourbon notes. Tastes are medium sweet with big bitter finish. Medium creamy in mouth. Very hot and boozy. This bottle is maybe too young, Iâ€™ll revisit my ratings after its sisters go to sleep for a long while. For now, out of the bottle, this is not worth the fuss.",4.5

2936,Westvleteren 12,"330ml bottle. Pours a deep almost opaque mahogany colour with tan head that doesn’t last that long. Leaves a little ring of lace. Spice is the first thing that hits me on the nose. There’s a cola nut aroma as well as stewed fruit.  I keep thinking fig for some reason as well. **NOTE** I immediately came back to up the score after I let this warm up to near room temperature which really lets the nose come out. Reminds me a lot of bourbon and coke with some added spice and fruit in the mouth. Mild sweetness on the palate that’s tempered by the alcohol. Finishes a little warm. Definitely good, but not what I expected.
Personally, I still deem De Struise’s Pannepot the best beer I’ve ever had.",3.7

2943,Westvleteren 12,"Alright, this is my first Quad i have tried... and prob not a good one to start with, but here goes nothing. Bought in a gift set at Calgary co-op liquor (comes with a nice glass). Pours a dark chocolate brown, thick head which lasts, than turns into a nice thin head which retains throughout the drinking experience. Aroma is faint at first, but grows as the beer is warmed. The beer smells of rich chocolate malts and earthy yeast with a heavy alcohol odour. Taste is sweet with a lot of alcohol, which develops into a chocolate after-taste. The beer changes flavours depending on where it is on the tongue, close to the tip it gives grape esters and a touch of fruitiness. Toward the back of the mouth you get more of a rich chocolate taste. This beer has a good complexity but was not quite as good as the hype. I fear that some of the flavours may have been dulled on the trip across the pond, or this special edition box set release to raise money for the monasteries  is not quite up to par. But i can only judge this beer... which is good but not incredible. Cheers.",3.8

2945,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from Downtown Bar & Grill Brooklyn.  Best before date of 08.02.15 so brewed Feb 2012 I think.  Served in a tulip glass after chilling on ice for about 10 minutes. Pours a sedimented medium brown that re-radiates light faintly.  A tight soapy tan head starts large, diminishes but stays with almost no lace.  The aroma is spectacular--complex and dynamic.  It starts a bit tight and hot but opens up on top of a deep fairly fresh sweet raisin bread and yeast backbone.  Aromas of vanilla, pepper, apples and orchard fruit esters unfold. There are hints or burnt caramel, burnt orange and hot pepper dark chocolate.  The flavor is very sweet but balanced by a surprisingly amount of spice and bitterness that lasts.  The mouthfeel starts super soft, velvety, lively; tends a bit yeasty and oak tight on the sides; then ends with a tickle on the back of my tongue and throat.  Sugars on the tongue and lips along with the yeast sediment continue to work and work.  Best beer in the world...arguable.  It is certainly in a rarefied league.  Initially I’m slightly disappointed by what it is and the price.  But as I sit reflecting and writing about it I’m more and more seduced.",4.7
2946,Westvleteren 12,2005 vintage bottle. Pours a dark translucent brown with just a cloud of foam floating in the middle of the beer. The aroma is very muted. Can’t get much of anything.

It really open up if you let it hang out in the glass for awhile. Aromas of banana, cloying sweetness and bubblegum. I thought I smelled some warm spice too. Nutmeg? Really awesome coconut too. Thinner palate than rochefort and la trappe. But I like the lingering warmth it leaves you with. Plus it leaves your mouth feeling like you just ate a slice of raisin bread. Taste is raisins, bananas, musty, and alcohol. Alcohol is quite strong. Warmth on the way down. What a great beer. Not the best I’ve ever had....but maybe it will be after I open another bottle in a year or 2. I feel very privileged that I got to try this.",4.4

Tastes rich and complex, burnt sugars,  spice, dark fruity flavours . . . you would not think you are drinking a 10%+ beer,

2970,Westvleteren 12,"Beer bought at In de Vrede café by the brewery. Pours dirty brown with a thick head that settles into a nice lasting layer for the reminder of the session. It’s not a looker, this beer, but the dirty brown color lives up to the rustic feeling of this legendary beer, and the nice beige layer of foam pulls up the appearance average.  The aroma is burnt and dried fruit, discrete at first but as the temp goes up it delivers more lovely scents. The taste is as rustic as the looks, caramel, chocolate, bitterness, fruit and alcohol. Long aftertaste. Compared to the other trappist beers, this one is the least accessible. Having brewed myself, it is impressive how a beer this high in alcohol can remain dry and sweet at the same time, though. The balance in the mouth is perfect, so is the carbonation.  It’s a rustic but quite perfect beer of it’s kind. Hyped up, perhaps, but for a reason too I believe.

Update: Same batch, two years later. Aroma has faded into more of an unpleasant vegetable smell. Taste is still rustic and powerful. The bitterness is surprisingly still just as strong. Proof: the beer can be stored for years.",4.1

2972,Westvleteren 12,"500th review, and the last time I make a big deal about it. Done in a blind tasting with Rochefort 10, St Bernardus 12, and Achel Bruin.

Poured into a Duvel tulip, hazy brown with a small off white head. Smell is tart fruit, cherry, plum, pretty strong flavors. Taste is rich fig, smoke, oak/nut, a bit of alcohol heat. Medium body and mouthfeel. It is bold up front, pretty balanced, but the attraction is mostly in the smell. 

It gets better as it warms, almost a marshmallow taste, Belgian Candi Sugar, prune and red fruit comes out. Very rich and complex, but it still has that alcohol bite and doesn’t go down as smooth as some of the others.

Overall a great beer, but my friend rated it as the lowest (a step below the 2/3) and I put it as third (4th being Rochefort). Different tastes for different people, but I say there is a lot of hype to this one.

Small off- white head hugs the tulip which leaves retention.  Pleasing nose. Belgian yeast, spice and grape nuances. The flavor mirrors the aroma. Malty. Sweet but not overly sweet. Plum notes. Balanced to perfection. 
 For me, it is kind of like a beer / wine Hybrid. The grape flavor is like a finely smashed grape. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, silky and full, without being chewy. Finish lingers, like a warm, red wine. Full without being offensive or giving you a heavy feeling.  The Abv, isn’t real noticeable, except for the mild warming feelings after the sip. I took my time drinking this, trying to really savor it. That in itself was hard to do, since the ABV was hidden with the best of them. Drinks like a standard 5 or 6%.  I don’t drink many Quads, so it’s hard to compare vs. any that I have sampled.  However, I now understand why so much hype is generated over this beer.

T - Had a weird off-tasting spice and lots of caramel. nice bitter finish.

M - Very sharp uncomfortable carbonation. Lots of booze. Slick and oily.

O - not very drinkable but tied for #3 out of the 10 best quads. Would do MUCH better with some age.",4.1
3000,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, obtained through The Festival in Worcester, MA.  Pours an opaque caramel, with a head that dissipates quickly.  Sweet, fairly muted aroma of caramel, fruit, and yeast.  The flavor has similar characteristics, but is much more intense.  Caramel, toffee, raisins, figs, cherries, banana, and vanilla all come through.  The mouthfeel is rich, with a lot of carbonation.  Very reminiscent of the Rochefort 10, although possibly a tad better.  I don’t think I’d rank it as the best beer in the world, but I can certainly understand its acclaim.",4.3
3001,Westvleteren 12,"A huge thanks to Brad for sharing several of these with me over the last few years.

Westvleteren 12 pours a somewhat thin looking brown hue with a nice sized head and decent lacing. Ooo...there’s some abbey floaties in my glass...straight from God. Amen. Sweet malt with raisins, figs, and seductive Belgian yeast fill the senses throughout the smell and taste. What deliciousness! The beer is a bit thin in the feel, but on a positive note, this makes it silky smooth and easy to drink. The aftertaste is great and lingers for a considerable time between sips. This is remarkable beer.",5.0

A nice, creamy head with so many complex flavours it’s difficult to know where to start - or to add anything which hasn’t already been said so I won’t. Not quite as full bodied as when it was 11.2% and certainly not worth the ridiculous prices asked in the US but still up there as one of my favourite all time beers.

First sip reveals what the hype is all about... If you’ve had one then you know what I’m talking about.  Date on the cap says 2015, and this beer is drinking amazing right now.

Nous sommes au sommet des sommets, sur l’Himalaya de la bière...
Ceci ne peut être décrit avec des mots ordinaires, on est confus devant
tant de beautés et de profondeurs.
Nous devons d’abord présenter notre révérence devant le jugement de Dieu.
Cette bière a été élue, non pas par des belges, mais par des juges de la
planète entière, comme meilleure bière du monde, et ceci à plusieurs reprises.
Ceci impressionne, même pour un belge, habitué, il faut le dire, à de belles
dégustations... Et pourtant, en ce qui me concerne, j’avais coté cette bière
au top des bières belges, bien avant ses accessits et la reconnaissance 
qu’elle a eue à l’échelle internationale....
Il faut dire que l’abbaye elle-même a aidé à la considérer comme une bière
d’exception, tout simplement en réduisant la production et la distribution,
comme les vins rares qui réduisent fortement la production de la vigne...
et sont produits à échelle quasi confidentielle.
Donc produit rare, difficile à obtenir, un rien mystérieux, ou très mystérieux,
si vous préférez, et vous obtenez la bonne recette pour faire une bière de 
grand mérite, au moins au début de la dégustation...
Arômes superbes de porto, pruneaux et noix du Périgord.
Première bouche unique d’ampleur et de profondeur........
La suite relève de la symphonie, et je dirais bien plus, de la symphonie 
enchantée. Les sens ne peuvent même pas suivre ce qui est livré par ce
liquide divin. On utilise des mots qui remplirait un dictionnaire...
Mais les mots sont même pauvres par rapport aux impressions.
Donc on est dans l’indicible. Nous sommes au sommet de l’art, à
la perfection du genre, au bonheur absolu, comme dans l’Himalaya avec
la lumière, le soleil et les dieux. On est à vrai dire dans la plénitude...
Et pour conclure, nous relèverons ce mot unique du bon moine de
Westvleteren, à qui on parlait du titre de meilleure bière du monde,
qui entre nous ferait du plus petit brasseur un Napoléon maître du 
monde...  mais pour notre moine, a seulement provoqué la réponse
suivante : « N’oublions pas que ce n’est quand même que de la bière »....
On en tombe sur le cul... pour les siècles des siècles. Amen.

3033,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle bought at de Bier Tempel in Brugge and drank in the bath in the Hotel Navarra. I should add I drank it out of an entirely inappropriate glass. It was livelier than I imagined it would be, pours the darkest amber with a good, long-lasting head. The aroma is both sweet and earthy, of the forest floor. The taste is suggestive of all those delicious dark things - caramel, raisins, muscovado, coffee, nuts. There is more than a little spice. Occasionally a fleeting suggestion of brandy. The finish is dry and lasts beautifully. It’s certainly one of the best beers I’ve tasted and, for me, edges out the Rochefort 10 for depth and gravitas.",4.6
3034,Westvleteren 12,"I don’t enjoy being the contrarian, but...Pours with a big, lasting head, nice aroma of complex malt with the usual goods notes of dates, raisin, vanilla, bread. The taste is what I would expect from a Belgian quad, nicely matching the aroma in the various flavor notes. Unexpectedly, this is not as malty and intense as I would have thought. The good complex flavors are there, but they are more subtle than expected. Drier than I expected too. Prominent alcohol in the middle and in the finish, more than expected. Definitely more hop bitterness in the finish that most in this style. Overall, I do think this is more balanced than what I am used to, and that’s fine, but more different than substantially better than some of the other great beers in this style. I do not find this to be as renowned as it’s made out to be, but it’s a good one for sure. I doubt I’ll pay the premium for more, but if I bought a couple more over the years, I wouldn’t feel too bad either.",3.4

Maku täyteläisen maltainen, hedelmäinen ja loppupuoleltaan yrttisen mausteinen. Lisäksi ihan lopussa havaittavissa hienoa paahteisuutta ja jopa kahvisuutta.

3037,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle won at North Bar, Leeds. Feels like a special occasion. Pours an opaque brown, small white head. Aroma is great - spice, dark fruits, Belgian esters, blackcurrant cordial, a touch of coffee. Taste is equally brilliant: dark fruits, spice, brown sugar, caramel, Belgian esters, a touch of treacle. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Taste comes in waves/phases, keeps it interesting. Long, long finish. A really pleasant finish. I tried to disassociate myself from the hype and rate this objectively, and still come to the conclusion that this is one f*cking brilliant beer. Ya beauty. // Bottle tried again on 02/02/13. As above, but somewhat duller. It’s an older bottle, and all the subtlety is still there, but I think now I’ve got past the hype, it seems somewhat less special. I’m almost certain I prefer drinking Rochefort 10 to this. It’s not bad, far from it, it’s incredible, just not the same lavel of incredible I’d thought before.

3040,Westvleteren 12,"Serving: Bottle courtesy of Robert.  Big thanks to Robert for hooking me up with this hard to get brew.  It pours a cloudy brown with a pretty decent tan head.  The nose is a potent mix of spiced bread, vanilla, yeast, dried fruit, and brown sugar.  The flavor mirrors the nose with the yeast, dried fruit, and light brown sugar as the dominant flavors.  The spice, light wood, and bitterness add just enough balance.  What really struck me was the mouthfeel.  Light to medium bodied do in part to the combination of high alcohol and abundant carbonation, but it works well.  The finish is amazingly dry and the alcohol is all but undetectable at 10.2%.  I can certainly see why this brew is so highly rated.  My first thought after finishing it was ""I can drink this all day.""  Truly outstanding.  Tasted side by side with a Roch 10 and a St. B 12.  The St. B 12 was a distant third, but the 10 held up well in comparison.  With some age on it, I would put a Roch 10 neck and neck with this brew, but right now I have to give a slight edge to this one.",4.6

Je viens de gouter ma toute première West Vleteren 12 et c’est en comparant avec tout ce que j’ai déjà gouté en matière de bières, et j’en ai gouté croyez moi, que je lui donnes, sans hésitation, la meilleure des notes. Je dois dire que cette bière est une perle que la Belgique nous offre, c’est un chef d’oeuvre de l’art de brasser.

3068,Westvleteren 12,"Mooi dik, donker bier. Eerst flink wat schuim, maar dat zakt snel weg. Blijft een mooi crèmig laagje van over. 
Je zou een sterker aroma verwachten. Caramellig, zoet, moutig.
Smaak is complex; zoet, bitter, cacao, koffie, drop, beetje banaan. Heel goed in evenwicht. Hier is heel veel aandacht aan besteed.
Mondgevoel is opvallend. Heel veel koolzuur die prikt op de tong. 
Espresso-met-suiker-achtige, droogbittere nasmaak.

3069,Westvleteren 12,"Re-tasted on December 27th; 33 cl bottle from Kvickly Allerød; BBD: March 7th 2017) Pours a cloudy dark amber with generous amounts of tan head that seems to last forever. Beautiful lace. Aroma has notes of rye bread and dark fruits. Creamy texture, soft carbonation, medium body and a balanced finish. Flavour reveals notes of marzipane as well as a balancing bitterness. Much better than the last one I blind-tasted.

3074,Westvleteren 12,"13 Oct 2011: Finaly got round to opening a bottle of this stuff (had 5 bottles for a number of years), lets see what all the fuss is about.

Poured into a Westvleteren chalice, it looked fairly limp compared to it’s 8% brother, wispy head on top of a moody looking dark browny/red body. I tried not to let any sediment out the bottle, but a little managed to leap past me into the chalice, I’ll drink the remainder of the bottle (a fifth) with most of the sediment at the end of the review. I am reviewing live as I drink this evening.

The nose is rich red fruits, dried on a bed of dark chocolate and aged with fine English Oak, this is a smell not to mess with.

The taste is fantastic, add some carbonisation and a heap of alcohol to the aforementioned aromas and you’re half way there: I found a gargantuan amount of flavours and I now see why beery people clamour for this brew so much. Sweeter than I thought it would be (shared half a glass at the brewery bar when I bought the beer, don’t remember the sweetness), but that doesn’t detract from the tasting I’m currently having, which I’m really enjoying.

The 10.2% only become evident as the mouth dries, so well is the body and mouthfeel, a truely great beer, certainly now in my top 10, only the appearance letting it down.",4.3

3077,Westvleteren 12,"I’m in a crazy lit bar (all beers look red), my palate has already got some serious beating by imperial stouts and pale ales and I’m starting to feel a bit tired, hungry and dizzy. In other words, this is not the ideal time to lose my Westvleteren-virginity. Still, there it is in front of me, a modest looking bottle next to a Rochefort chalice (I’d hoped for a Westvleteren one when paying 289 NOK (€38, $50) for a single bottle). In the glass it looks cloudy dark brown with a small but long-lasting tan head. The aroma is sweet and sugary, fruity, dark dried fruits and vanilla. Very sweet taste and a slight bitterness in the finish. Complex and extremely well balanced flavours with all the components from the aroma, and in addition I get some Amaretto-like almond/marzipan notes. The alcohol is much better integrated in this brew than it is in e.g. the Rochefort 10. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. A wonderful beer, but is it the best in the world? I’m not quite sure about that, but I guess the only way to find out is to shell out for another bottle.

3078,Westvleteren 12,Bought whilst wandering around lovely Bruges in September 2011 and drunk on Christmas day 2011.Dark brown and full bodied with a creamy maltiness. Supped very gently so as to extend the pleasure. Very nice bit i didn’t quite reach the extremes of adoration that some people feel about this beer. Perhaps its rarity creates a unique flavour. An enjoyable experience but I have tasted better.,4.1
3079,Westvleteren 12,"I bought an online beer parcel from Beer Planet in Belgium (beerplanet.eu) which came with a free, yes free Westvleteren of my choice. Poured into a Rochefort glass - then well it has all been said before, I have never had a better beer.",5.0
3080,Westvleteren 12,"Bevuta presso La Pecora e il Luppolo (TE): birra scura con schiuma color nocciola. L’aroma è caratterizzato da note di frutti scuri e dalla dolcezza del malto.  In bocca risulta avere un bel corpo con sentori di caramello, prugna e luppolo nel finale.Buonissima",4.8
3081,Westvleteren 12,"A friend sent me a 6-pack of these in the new ""USA Distributed Brick Packaging"" I’m going to get another 24 of them while in Belgium next month but couldn’t help but try one of these the day it arrived via mail. Best by 03.08.14. Taken out of my cellar at 59 Degrees F and poured into a Chimay Chalice. 



A - Poured a cloudy dark brown into the glass. Produced a 2-finger coffee colored head that subsided to a half finger almost immediately and was gone after 2 minutes. There’s still some head lacing around the edges and center of the glass. In the glass, the beer is a nice deep dark brown like cedar wood color with a lot of cloudiness to it. Very complex in appearances but standard to most Belgian Quads like Chimay Blue or St. Bernardus 12.



S - This is the standard Belgian Quad scent you’d expect. Great bready and earthy yeast make up a great deal of the scent. Smells like a bakery. The dark fruits like figs and prunes make up the rest. There’s this different musty smell that I don’t get from other quads. Smells like an old cellar or attic full of old photos and clothing. There’s also a slight bit of sweetness from brown sugar or maybe it’s just the dark fruit sugars that I’m getting.



T - Wow. Incredibly sweet! Far more sweet than I was expecting and unlike any other Belgian quad I’ve ever had. The sweetness and malts are almost borderline very watered down whiskey. There’s a burn that starts on the roof of my mouth and goes down my chest. Not expecting that at all. I get this syrupy sweetness that you’d get from a flat pepsi and brown sugars. The standard quad bready yeast and dark fruits are there but masked by this overly sweet overly boozy feeling that really hit me in the face! Another sip and it’s still hitting me in the face. Insanely strong.



M - 90% carbonation on a single mouth swish. The booziness of this beer stays around long after you’ve swallowed. It’s so insistent that you almost want to grab a glass of water to drink it down. Very very strong. Heavy bodied beer for sure.



O - I’ve heard the arguments that Westy12 compares to Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12 in almost every way and those beers are fare more easy to find. I disagree. This beer is more sweet and more boozy than those beers in every way. I almost don’t want to rate this beer and I promise to re-rate it after I go to the St. Sixtus Abbey in May to pickup my 2 cases of beer and have a glass that was brewed fresh. I feel like this bottle was very off for being the best beer in the world. I disagree and Belgian Quads are my favorite beer-style.  This was a great quad but not #1.



UPDATE: I opened a 2006 bottle given to me by tderoeck. Best by 2011. Cellared in Belgium then shipped overseas via Belgium Post to my house. Stuck in the cellar at 62 degrees F. Poured at 4 ounces into a Duvel Tulip with friends. Appearance has gown hazy musty dark brown. Basically, looks more like bath-water than the Westy I had in April. Smell. More dark fruits, Mustier, dustier just sort of attic smell like old clothing. The taste is meh. It’s still Westy 12 but less unique, less enjoyable and a very high metallic finish. Mouthfeel is empty with some mild oxidation. Not going to change my rating but interesting how this tastes with 7 years on it,",4.0

Aroma has dark, ripe fruits, lots of stuffy grain and some toffee typical to aged Belgian ales. Actually very typical aroma to an aged, dark belgian ale with high ABV. Flavour has dark fruits, some toffee, warming alcohol and hints of artifical pear. Palate is a bit too foamy and high on CO2. What I don’t like here is the sticky feeling after some sips with overwhelming taste of grain. I have the same problem with Bernardus Abt 12.

3088,Westvleteren 12,"20130823 I’ve sampled a couple of these during August (I went to the monastery in the end of july and brought home a crate). The fresher beers was quite different from the one sampled before, and much better in my opinion. Pours deep copper, not much sediment, looks almost filtered. About 10 mm of very frizzy, light brown head. Chocolate, caramel, some yeast, banana, esters, alcohol, cherry, red fruit, plum and some wort nose. I actually like to serve this a tad cold, as it changes aroma and character as it gets warmer. Mostly sweet, with a little hint of bitterness which is just right. Warming mouth feel, but not to much. Very frizzy and stingy carbonation, which I like in quads. Medium and very drinkable body! Aromas (this list could go on for ever, very complex beer!): Candy, cherry, brown chocolate (as in not the bitter cocoa type), leather, sugar, candy sugar, caramel, crackers, some alcohol, some yeast, banana, some malt, very slight hint of wort (fresh beer, mind you), actually a hint of licorice, some dry nut flavour, bubblegum. Candy and cherry are strong aromas. I never thought I would give this score, but I can’t find anything to deduct from this beers rating. I would’ve thought this beer was hyped and overrated, but it really is perfect. 10-5-10-5-20 5.0!

20120325 1st rating. Bottle from Amundsens Bryggeri og Spiseri. Must’ve been a tad old, or on the edge of going bad? Was at least more wineous and sour than the fresher samples tasted this year:
 Poured into trappist glass. Black body, quite thin. Some bubbly head, but not much. Very wineous and a bit acidic nose, some alcohol. Raisins and red fruit.

I have to tell you I thought is would be a long time until I got to try this beer since I refuse to pay the ridiculous prices online for it.  But it showed up one night and I was very excited.  However, I was a bit dissapointed.  Still very good, but nowhere near Roch 10.  Pours a murky brown with tinges of red and a beige head.  Smell is very sweet of plum, brown sugar, dark fruits.  Taste was extremely sweet for my tastes.  Sugar plums, raisin, cola syrup, dark fruits, leather, some spice.  I was told that this was one of the worst batches this person has tried and its a crap shoot with the bottle conditioning.

Sweet bubble gum malt and fruity Belgian yeast. The esters are muted. There’s less of the peppery spice to it. It’s a totally wonderful beer that aside from the folklore, stands shoulder to shoulder.

3097,Westvleteren 12,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/18/2012.  Poured from a 33 cl botlte into a Westvleteren chalice. There is no more recognizable unmarked bottle in all the land. Best by 09.03.12.

My pour has a dark caramel brown color with a slight ruby tint, mostly opaque but transparent in the edges. Only a small off-white cap forms on the initial pour, and this fades to a few spotty islands remain, along with a fair amount of particulate, even with a gentle pour.

The aroma is full, deep, and smooth. Brown sugar, toasted bread, caramel, raisins, figs, plums, cinnamon, Belgian yeasty spice all combine to form a nuanced and complex aroma.

Especially as it warms up, the flavor is pretty fantastic. Brown sugar blends with toasted bread, caramel, and some nutmeg, cinnamon and general yeasty spice. Raisins, plums, and dark cherries come in as the body turns from medium / full to medium / light. Right at the end, just a bit of ethyl alcohol comes in, along with some red wine vinegar acidity. The carbonation starts on the light side, and it is practically flat by the time the beer is through. It is creamy and smooth, while still a bit grainy. Medium to full body.

While there was no way for this beer to live up to the ""best beer ever,"" I thoroughly enjoyed the anticipation leading up to my first experience, and the beer itself was quite good as well.",3.8

3108,Westvleteren 12,"Currently drinking while typing. As ever I am blown away by this beer and certainly so with such an incredible aroma, taste and palate! The aroma is a vast canvas of intense Belgian yeasts, sweetness, brown sugars, caramel, plum, raisin, Danish breads, malty depth, cereals and gentle hops. It is very hard to pinpoint all of the various areas of this beer because of its complex structure. I never seem to get that big creamy tan head like I have seen on many pictures of this, I usually get a relatively thin tan head which seems to soon release into a fine skimming on top of the deep brown chocolate brew. The flavour is insane, extremely complex! There are brown sugars, Belgian yeasts, leather, sweet Danish breads, caramelled cereal malts, balanced fruits like plums, raisins and apricot. Great lasting flavour of dough and malty cereals also eventually you notice a gentle warmth on the throat though without even tasting any hint of alcohol, it could be passed off as a 6% beer because it is so gentle! Supple smooth buttery texture with a full body and suitably gentle carbonation. So much to talk about in this beer, very complex but very gentle and light without sacrificing any rich flavours you would expect naturally. It’s a rare moment that I do get to enjoy one of these but when I do I remember everytime how good that moment was. Steep price and hard to get hold of but it really is worth it!",4.9

Looks very hazy, muddy, like swamp water. Slender, unchanging head with big lacing.

Smells just like Roch 10 - dark fruits, cloves... you know the smell.

Taste - this was somewhat disappointing and I feel (or hope) that this particular bottle had some issues since its export. The taste I anticipated was there but it was dominated by this sort of tobacco/dirty flare. Not sure what happened here.

Mouthfeel - again, just like the others. Big and smooth, creamy, little carbonation.

Overall I just need to try this one again. Either my standards were too high (I don’t think they were) or something went wrong here. I can definitely taste the potential but it just didn’t follow through here.

The aroma was a complex mix of choclates, vanilla, stone fruits, pepper, caramel, leather and a hint of mustiness.  The flavor was less complex, but wonderfully clean and sweet on the open with a dry vinuous quality at the end.  The best part of the beer was definitely the texture.  On the palate the bubbles created a mousse-like quality that really coated the inside of your mouth.

The four of us participating all exclaimed something when smelling the (unbeknownst to us) Westy for the first time.  Its aroma holds layers upon layers of complexity that the others simply couldn’t match.  The term ""bready"" is thrown around often, but Westy actually smells like a freshly baked loaf of bread.  Surprisingly strong caramel character too with a more tame spiciness than the others.  As stated, we all agreed that this was the best aroma of the bunch.

Extremely complex flavor without an over-reliance on the style’s traditional spice characteristics.  Tons of caramel (again) atop a really interesting flavor profile.  Bready.  Significantly more interesting than the others.  Finishes slightly sweet with lingering caramel amidst the boozy warmth.

Westy 12 sports a fuller body than any of its peers.  Noticeably more luscious and creamy than the others.

The monks at Westvleteren deserve the hype they’ve earned over the years.  This is the best Belgian Quad in the world, hands down.",4.0
3123,Westvleteren 12,Amazing beer. Great flavor great palate great pour. Did I say great lol this beer is amazing,4.3
3124,Westvleteren 12,"Very dark brown, tan head. Nose is complex, sweet, dried plums, chocolate, pungent alcohol, malt, berries and caramel. Oily, stick palate, almost cloying, but not quite. Thick, chewy body. Taste is, again, complex. The elements of the nose blend together into a layered harmony with added liquorice notes, roastiness and some bitterness in the finish, complimented by the warming alcohol. Excellent and intriguing.",4.7
3125,Westvleteren 12,"After hours of nonstop calling I managed to make an appointment at the St. Sixtus Abdij for 2x 24 bottles of TW12. I have tried a few bottles, the others ones are now lied away in the basement for over several years. 

It looks very dark with a white, little tanned and steady head, almost simular to Irish Coffee. The aroma has some sweet and fruitish elements. It’s flavor is a complex combination of sweet fruits and a bitter aftertaste which has hints of grapefruit. The alcohol, which is present with large numbers, isn’t noticable at all.

I haven’t had any better beers (yet). It lives up to the hype. But the scarcity and the ordering process (together: the whole story) sure do their part as well.

The carbonation is absolutely perfect, it’s soft although medium. Taste is maybe slightly too sweet for me, and still with a low bitterness. Everything’s in the aroma: spices, wood, fruits, herbs, toast, alcohol and maybe also cheese. As it is my first quadrupel, I’m still getting used to it and I wouldn’t give a score of 5, because the alcohol aroma is to high for me.",4.8

3134,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at Amundsen Bryggeri & Spiseri, Oslo. Served in a Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Deep amber colour. Small light beige head that turns into stable foam islands. It’s probably hard to rate this beer in an ’unbiased’ way, considering the status and ’hype’ surrounding it. First impressions are not overwhelming - to me this is not an ’OMG, fantastic’ brew. It has a complex, quite alcoholic nose, but also rather restrained. With the first sip, however, I start to realize the greatness. It probably has all aroma elements that I have ever tasted in beers (except smoke and barnyard). There’s caramel, herbs, dried figs, raisins, fruits of all kinds (grapefruit, orange, banana, pear), resin, licorice. And its all in perfect balance, so perfect and complex that its hard to discern individual aroma elements. It starts off quite sweet, then a wave of herbal bitterness, and finally a mildly bittersweet finish. The alcohol is noticeable, but blends in like in a fine sherry. The body is full, yet the mouthfeel is surprisingly fluffy, making it easily drinkable without being ’light’ or watery whatsoever. A remarkable brew for those contemplative moments.",4.9
3135,Westvleteren 12,"This beer is incredible. Intense green apples, clove, lemon zest, and a good dose of heat on the nose, which totally disappears on the palate, where it’s a wild, roasty ride from malty vanilla and caramel notes to an earthy ginger finish.",4.8

3137,Westvleteren 12,"Tried this together with Extra 8. Having tasted Extra 8 first my hopes for 12 were high. The hype of this notorious bastard is quite high isn’t it?
It pours brown with a low frizzy head which is a bit thicker head than Extra 8. Aromas very fine tuned hints of belgian yeast, oranges and some chocolate.
Palate is a bit sticky, some alcohol, creamy but stil very fine tuned. Tastes of oranges, some pepper, belgian yeast. Stickier than I thought it would be but still very interesting.
This is one of the best I’ve had but not the best. I had higher hopes but the stickyness does not match my taste in order for it to be on top",4.3
3138,Westvleteren 12,"Finally tried it!!!  I have 6 bottles I brought back from Belgium last year.  I was stoked to break down and open one.  I have had their Westie 8&10. So this was magical.  I know this beer really is hyped up, but other than the appearance it is flawless to me.  The color is brownish/amber in the light and no real head to speak of from my bottle, a little foam on top.  Taste is alcohol ester, bread, cereal, spices, candy sugars, brandywine, amazing.  Great mouthfeel and palate isnt saturated but leaves a little to remember.  Great aroma of grain, clean carpet, fresh bread and there is a little monk sweat I detected! YUM!  Anyway fantastic beer, it really is a privelage to enjoy this beer.  I almost feel bad about drinking bud light anymore, this is what beer is and we should all get a bottle drink it and then immediately whip up a batch of yeast starter with the leftover, find out the grain bill and brew it tomorrow! Love it",4.9
3139,Westvleteren 12,"4/27/09 - Updating due to a recent tasting. My gf got me a bottle for my bday (yes, I’m lucky I know) and we shared it last night. It was even better than I remembered it.

---

Poured into a Rochefort Trappist chalice

A: Initially this pours a murky, sediment filled brown color but after drinking 1/2 of it, you can see ruby highlights throughout. thick creamy off white almond colored head. Unfortunately this didn’t leave very much lacing at all.

UPDATE: There was barely any sediment in this bottle. It poured a beautiful, clear (until the very last ounce) brown/ruby color. The last little bit was a bit muddy but to be expected, I think. Head formation was decent and lacing was pretty much non-existent. Rating bumped to 4.5.

S: soon as the cap was popped off the scent of strong sweet fruit filled the air. There’s a medium heavy malting, brown sugar, deep dark fruits, cherries mostly and it’s slightly alcoholic. Smells like a combo of berry pie and caramel.

UPDATE: This smelled amazing and as described above. I bumped my rating to 5.0.

T&M: very smooth taste, medium bodied beer which is perfect for the style. sweet and malted, lots of fruits on the palate but so much complexity that it’s hard to pinpoint what flavors I’m experiencing. Non noticeable bitterness or hop flavor. Needless to say this feels and tastes great! The only thing I’m not too keen on is the ""bits"" of sediment that get stuck between your teeth as you’re nearing the end of the bottle. I could do without that.

UPDATE: Similar to above minus the ""bits"" of sediment. This was clearly a higher quality beer, one that was most likely not aged for as long or aged under better environmental conditions. Taste rating bumped to a solid 5.0! Def worth it! Can’t really find a flaw in the mouthfeel either - 5.0 too.

D: Pretty high ABV that’s masked almost completely. Great sweet, fruity taste, if it weren’t for the carbonation I’d think I was drinking some kind of concentrated berry juice.

Overall impressions: This is one of the most sought after, legendary beers. Given it’s availability, it makes it that much more precious and highly coveted. While it is a great beer, and a fine example of the style, dare I say that I think it’s slightly overrated and that there are better examples of the style available closer to home, namely Rochefort 10 and St Bernadus Abt 12.

Big thanks to zaf88 for this trade. I feel blessed to have tried this truly unique brew.",4.7

Dark brown body, nice texture, small lacy caramel head as expected from a beer this strength.

3143,Westvleteren 12,"At the start - smells bready/yeasty, with fruit and alcohol -- very good. As the extreme head diminishes, the smell improves as the aforementioned bread smell vanishes completely -- 9/10 on smell. Unprecedented head and great color. Ultra smooth for 10.2%. The taste.. It is THAT good - nearly perfection. The hype is real. If I have any knock against it, it’s that it is a slight touch on the sweet side... but it’s taste is so complex, that characteristic is forgivable. Truly outstanding - I leave it at a 19/20 overall, only in the hopes that I ever consume something from another planet that completely blows my mind and transfers me onto an alternate plane of existence where I yield omnipotent, omnipresent abilities.",5.0
3144,Westvleteren 12,"Dark dark brown body, almost black with a garnet hue, aroma is of caramel and grapes.  Beautiful bright white almost crystal looking head.  Taste is long and rich, toasted caramel and dark roasted malt, wonderfully balanced and complex.  Not as smooth as the Westvleteren 8 but only due to the darker roast taste, which it coupled with the deeper caramel sweetness gives the 12 more complexity.  The sweet, roasty caramel taste lingers long after the sip.  A truly excellent beer, worthy of being considered the best in the world.",4.9
3145,Westvleteren 12,"To celebrate my #100 rating, i cracked open this bottle at home, in my new apartment. 
Pour opaque deep and dark, with a very nice big, foamy off-white head. 
Aroma is very complex of dark fruits, molasses, toffee, and ofc some belgian yeast. Some vanilla is comming through at the end. Very nice. 
The taste is quite sweet, but still well balanced. 
This hides the alcohol very well, with only a slight warming feeling in the mouth. 
Medium oily bodied, with a weird kinda flat and fizzy carb.

The guy in the store had it hidden in an inconspicuous location, but if you know what to look for, it’s there. I noticed that, as I was leaving, he immediarely replaced the single bottle that was ""on display,"" and that I took, with another. Pours purple-caramel with a whitish coarse head. Aroma is very sweet of raising, caramel and nuts -- quite amazing. Flavor is deep with hints of alcohol, raisins, and distinct hoppiness. Leaves a very lasting, warm, and hoppy finish. It’s very pleasent to drink. Definitely deserves the fame, but I would say I might have had better.",4.5
3147,Westvleteren 12,"#10
Fast schwarzes Bier mit feiner Crema. Ein leicht hefiger Grundton mit fruchtigem Aroma nach Pflaume. Schön vollmundiger Antrunk und für 10,2% Alk. sensationell unspritig. Geschmacklich startet das Westvleteren recht süßmalzig, geht dann zügig über in diese pflaumige Fruchtigkeit. Der lange Abgang ist herb und leicht nachbitternd wie ein lang gelagerter Armagnac. Ein absolut fantastatisches Bier! Die Frage, ob es nun ""das Beste"" der Welt ist, kann man getrost dahingestellt lassen, denn für höchst subjektiven Geschmack gibt es eben keine objektiven Kriterien. In meiner persönlichen Top Ten gehört dieses Westvleteren 12 auf jeden Fall und in die ganz enge Auswahl für eine einsame Insel. Was dieses Bier so gegenüber den anderen Trappisten auszeichnet ist nicht seine Aromenvielfalt oder seine Stärke, das haben die meisten anderen Trappisten auch zu bieten. Nein, hier ist es die wohl am besten gelungene Gesamtkomposition, alles ist wunderbar aufeinander abgestimmt, ausbalanciert und braucht keine Jahre der Lagerung, um schon jetzt ein tolles Bier zu sein. Absolut beeindruckend!

3149,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, Huge thanks to Russell. Enjoyed side by side with La Trappe Quad. The Westy pours darker, dark dark brown, large frothy tan head, takes forever to go down. The aroma is pretty mild, dark fruit, tobacco, raisin, molasses, wet leaves, toffee, slightly more enjoyable than the La Trappe because it’s not as dominated by the Belgian yeast. Taste is nicely balanced, sweet fruit, yeast, light roasted malt, alcohol is hidden well. Very nice, I wish I had a Rochefort 10 to add to my Quad sampling because I have a feeling I would enjoy it more than the Westy. Overall this is a great beer, but after trying it, I’m surprised it’s rated as high as it is.",4.1
3150,Westvleteren 12,"Picked up a 2008 bottle of this for the birth of my friends first child. Poured a dark brown color with a small tan head and good carbonation. The aroma is belgian yeast, raisins, candied sugar, and bread. The taste is a lot like other belgian quads I’ve had but less harsh and more complex. They hid the alcohol so well you can’t even tell it’s there. My only complaint is the large amount of yeast in the bottle. I couldn’t taste it but it wasn’t very attractive. The best quad I’ve ever had but it’s not my favorite style so it’s not my overall favorite beer. I’m glad I got to try it once.",4.3

3154,Westvleteren 12,"Woah. I don’t know what to say. I’d been holding onto this one for a bit, waiting for the ""right time"" to consume it. The start of a new year is good enough as any I’d say, so here we go. I was a bit hesitant to acquire this one, mostly because I do want to respect the monks and their wishes regarding consumption of this beverage.


Well, here goes nothing. I had this alongside a Trappistes Rochefort 10. We would have done a St. Bernardus Abt 12 if we had one on hand, but sadly not.

Anyway, this poured a medium dark brown color with virtually no head whatsoever. Aromas were a ton of dark fruits: prune, fig. A lot of residual dark brown sugars. Flavor was, surprisingly complex and stands up to the enormous hype surrounding it. I figured people were just groupthinking this beer’s reputation but yikes, this is deserved. Very complex - every part of my mouth was discovering something new on each sip. Alcohol is non-existent. Yikes!",4.5

3162,Westvleteren 12,"Best by 2013. Opening this alleged masterpiece while watching Die Hard. Good movie. As with a lot of other Belgian beers, this was a gusher. Luckily I was quick with the glass and only lost a bit of the beer. Because the yeast was unsettled with the gushing, the pour is murky and flakey, and the head was soapy and dissipating. The aroma is in yo face with yeast and esters. Notes of chocolate, tobacco, dark fruits, dark sugar, toasted nuts. As it is swirled notes of toffy and caramel occur. Also a rather strong oxidized impression which is off, and notes of alcohol. The aroma is actually very nice, is has some nice subtle elegances. The taste starts off with heavy yeasty and estery sweetness, figs, dates, port like in the sweetness, chocolate and cocoa. At first the carbonation was almost excessive, and that combined with the high esters made a very harsh mouthfeel. As it warms and the carbonation dissipates, it gets more pleasant - but nothing like what I expected from reading other reviews.

A - Great dark brown body that allows a bit of light to pass through. There is a little bit of sediment that settled at the bottom of the glass. Fantastic off white/light khaki head that sticks around forever. Really creamy and tight bubbling with some moderate lacing and retention. 

S - Loads of dark candied/caramelized fruits. Figs, prunes, plums, raisins etc. This is followed by a great spice note and some light yeast and alcohol. Extremely well balanced.

T - Follows the nose. Candied dark fruits, caramel, and then the spices. The aftertaste is of Belgian yeast. The flavor is so well balanced and delicious. I could down pint after pint of this stuff. The alcohol is not noticeable at all.

M - Creamy, medium mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation. It coats your mouth but doesn’t stick around for too long. Fantastic.

O - I actually wanted to not like this beer as much as I did. I know it has a great deal of hype and I figured since I invested $0 on the bottle I would be going into it unbiased. It blew me away though. This is an excellent quadrupel and its worthy of its high ranking.

There’s not really much lace left on the glass here.  The aroma is nice, consisting of rich dark fruit and yeast with caramel, nuts, and perhaps light clove.  The first thing I noticed while drinking this, is it’s incredibly smooth going down.  There is no trace of the 10.2% abv whatsoever.  This beer is quite good.  The body is perfect; it’s very rich but with soft flavors.  Vanilla is added here with soft dark fruit and Belgian yeast, creamy caramel, raisin, and bread pudding.  This is obviously worth it’s high praise and is a high abv beer you can drink and wonder where the glass went.  With that said, I’m not completely convinced it’s any better than Rochefort 10 or even St. Bernardus.  I don’t know, it’s definitely not worse though.  Distribution is a factor.

It’s an amazing taste - sour, sweet, and bitter all in the same sip at different intervals.  There’s a world of taste too complex for me to judge properly after one try.  The real problem is, where do you go from here?  Once you’ve tasted the best beer in the world, will reality begin to dull?

I have had this one several times, though it has been a while since I had my last one.
I see that this highly recommended and overall high rated beer has more than 2000 rates/reviews, so there will be one of mine there too... but not like:""Smells like... Taste likes...""
It is a good beer, really good beer and worth it’s hype, but to be honest I have tasted several other beers that I think have a more refined taste, mouthfeel, smell and aftertaste than this one. Still this one is good!
Though the Rochefort 10 is another damn good beer, maybe even better in my opinion.
Well I enjoyed drinking this and back then, many years ago, when I drank my first one, and there was a hype about this beer already, I know I could die happy, having tasted them all.
-----
Had this beer some times again, which didn’t taste as remarkable as it did in the beginning. And had it during a blind tasting it became 3rd.
So I have to shave the number a bit thinner.
Combining all moments I drank this beer it’ll become a 4 I guess... Decent...

3186,Westvleteren 12,Thanks to Wyatt for this gem!!!!  poured from a 12 oz glass into a tulip glass.  pours a brownlish murky red color with a thin head that leaves qucikly. The smell is of yeasty fresh bread and a slight booziness too.  The taste is bitter on the front end but that leaves quick and your mouth is filled with a fruity sweetness that coats your whole mouth.  The sweetness stays but you still get that bitterness.  It is well balanced and not boozy at all like the smell leads.  I can see why this one is rated so high.  while I do agree with it having a high rating I have to admit I’d take a russian imp stout over this any day.  Still a great beer and I’m glad I got to try it!!!  thanks Wyatt!!!!!,4.5

Sip : Smooth body with a decent carbonation.Starts with sweet caramel then follows with a cognac like alcohol feeling which is really royal.Licorice. It changes while the bitterness mysteriously appear. It’s a really interesting bitterness, not like a burned malt but more of a bitter hops ? Maybe a mix of both.

Spicy, yeasty aroma with tons of vinous dark fruits, peppers and earthy hops. Very complex, medium sweet taste with lots of plums, grapes, raisins, figs, dates and dark cherries. This is supplemented by nice, roasted malts with notes of chocolate and caramel and subtle pines. This beers aroma and taste is exceptional. Full bodied with a perfect balance of sweet, vinous dark fruits, yeasts, spices, earthy hops, roasted malts and sweet notes of alcohol. Soft carbonation. Lots of peppers and coriander that lingers throughout over the complex body into a sweet, yet dry finish. This is quickly followed by a delicious dark fruit presence with hints of plums, grapes, dark cherries, figs and raisins. Fuller bodied than other beers in the style with a slightly roasted character with hints of chocolate, toffee and caramel. In addition to all of these flavors, there is a subtle, earthy hop presence that adds more depth, balance and complexity to the beer. The high alcohol content is excellently masked with little to no warmth in the never ending finish. Overall, this beer incredibly complex, delicious and extremely drinkable.

3196,Westvleteren 12,"I just posted some comments on Reddit, this is what I wrote:Saturday night at my brother?s house, we start with a Pliny the Elder, kill some time talking, and then to the main event.He brings out a Westvleteren 12 with no sticker, plain brown bottle, some letters stand out from the neck of the bottle and only the cap informs that this indeed is the famous beer; unopened, we let it rest for 10 minutes, to let it raise its temperature slightly.My control beer, from memory, is a St. Bernardus Abt 12 which in my opinion is the best beer I have tried: complex, sweet, fruity, toasty, aromatic, just wonderful!I pour, slowly into Chimay chalices, and see how a perfect brown sugar colored foam develops on top, crowning a dark molasses colored liquid. The aromas, are muted, the taste is amazing, crazy good, similar to the St. Bernardus, but slightly more controlled, I feel it has no edges, it is more composed. But, weren?t they supposed to be like twins? Same recipe, yeast, water!To me, it tasted restrained, perhaps I could not appreciate the highest ranked of beers, I felt guilty: In my mind, the St. B was better, tasted courageous, like tradition, like a great beer: what Aragorn toasts and drinks with when in the company of great men!W 12 is great, but perhaps the hype led me to expect something far better in orders of magnitude that what I had in my hand? Is it really 20 or 30 times much better than a New Belgium Abbey Ale or a Malheur 10? Is it that the beer cognoscenti tout it as The Pinnacle of Greatness, knowing that this beer is almost impossible to obtain for an ordinary citizen, and thus will remain as a barrier of entry into their beer tasting club? Or maybe it is like the story about the tulips in the Netherlands.I feel disappointed, just have to figure out if with the hype or myself.",4.6

Leaves a small but very creamy beige head. Oily lacing trickles down th glass. Lighter in colour than I was expecting. My nose is completely saturated in aromas of plum and grapes with and an underriding sweetness behind it all. Reminds me of a sweet, freshly cut piece of christmas fruit cake - lots of dark fruits and a sweet vanilla tone. The mass amounts of fruit come through in the taste. Lots of plum, raisins and grapes. Reminds me a little bit of this sparkling grape juice I used to have when I was younger. Grape undertones are very prominant. Quite a heavy, vanilla escence-like sweetness throughout the brew. Mouth feel is medium with soft carbonation. The sweetness lingered on forever. I did think the mouth feel could have been a little more full but at 12% it drank closer to a 5% beer.

The aromas consisted of a lot of yeast, bananas, cloves, freshly baked bread, and it had a sweet and dry malty finish.

3200,Westvleteren 12,"2005 from Bottle

Wow, this beer lives up to the hype for me. I don’t think Ive ever had a beer this complex. Those Belgians are onto something here and very well might have a future in brewing.

The appearance is typical for most quads Ive had. Maybe a bit lighter but nice and almost clear. The thin white heads fades fairly quickly. Very little lacing.

The nose is outstanding. A little sweet but more than anything plums and grapes. Really surprised how much fruit I’m getting on the noise. Maybe some faint vanilla and bitter orange. 

For being two years old its still fairly warm but not overbearing. I know its a high ABV by the taste but its doesn’t knock me over either.Actually the warmness doesn’t come into play until the finish. The taste is self is a nice and balanced sweetness in combination with some plums and vanilla. 

The mouth feel is great. The carbonation is low to medium and doesn’t not put off any of the sharpness some over carbonated beers tends to do. 

Really enjoyed this one cant wait to get the next.",4.4
3201,Westvleteren 12,"2006. Smells so delicious and has some heat. Raisons, oak, fig.

The taste is to me a bit rough regardless of what everyone else says. It’s full bodied though and packed with flavours similar to the ones in the aroma. Very rich and flavourful.",4.1
3204,Westvleteren 12,"Had this once before, when I was only starting to like proper beer. Dark beer, not entirely opaque, hint of copper in the colour, nice off white head. Aroma is certainly the best in all of Belgium, dryer and less alcohol/raisins than some of its peers (for instance St. Bernardus 12, which some say is pretty much the same beer - it isn’t). Especially the roasted, nutty flavour is something I have not found this much in other Abts. Also has a hint of licorice, unusual for Belgian dark beers. The dried fruit is very subtle. Actualy, the whole beer is much more subtle than I remembered it to be, and it is certainly a fantastic beer. 

What I don’t like: it has too much carbonation, which just ruins the palate for me, which I remembered to be much fuller and oilier. Maybe I had a better bottle last time.

Anyway, certainly something special, but you don’t miss much if you go for the (almost) equally fantastic Chimay Bleu or Choufe N’Ice, which are much, much easier to get.",4.3

You have to actively look for the alcohol to find it. It is balanced and exquisite, far more so, in my opinion, than the considerably sweeter, boozier, and darker Rochefort 10. I prefer the Extra 8 nose, however, because it is slightly grainier, citrusier, and less sweet. The taste is fantastic as well, with the same notes from the nose, making for a mostly sweet impression, with some bitter from the hops and some sour as well. The elegant hops are more obvious here than in the aroma. There’s also a slightly bitter alcohol note, more perceivable on the tongue than on the nose, but it actually complements it, as opposed to spoiling it. The palate feel is full and exquisite, very creamy, even a bit sticky, and elegantly carbonated.",4.2
3209,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #1500. Bottle 33cl from Altonbrownd thanks very much. A dark beer with huge head and good retention. Nose is hopy and on burnt caramel. Aroma is intense on caramel and burnt candy sugar, alcoholic, peppery hops. Body is on dry fruits, like grapes apricot even some fig with sweet notes. Nice beer but I expected something more smooth, strange sharp peppery hops notes. Initial Rating Date: 9/18/2011, initial rate 3.9.

Re-rated. Nose is similar to the fisrt time, intense burnt caramel notes, coriander and over-riped fruits. Body is very creamy with spices, biscuit, ginger bread, bitter chocolate notes, intense notes on red over-riped fruits. Good, just this sharp burnt notes do not fit with me.",4.1
3210,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz bottle into chalice @ Pub Italia in Ottawa, ON.

This gem pours a murky, swampy brown with slight reddish and purple edge accents. Head was bubbly beige and held for quite a while.

The smell is a buffet of ripe purple fruits: plums, currants, raisins and black cherries. Distinct Belgian yeastiness adds that desired bread nose.

Taste is very complex...really the epitome of quad brew flavour profile, dark fruits, cherries, some pepper and amazing cloves. That bready yeast profile is nicely integrated and somewhat subdued. Wonderful experience - even if expensive.

The mouthfeel is absurdly smooth, I didn’t notice an strong alcohol in the taste but that first sip did warm me up.

I was a bit skeptical going in as this is quite the highly hyped, idolized, ""epic"" beer. However, the beer speaks for itself and completely crushes any of the perceived ’hype’ surrounding. Delicious, and that’s all.",4.6

3227,Westvleteren 12,"So, my initial rating of this beer is below. It came out to a 4.3 total. I have since tried this beer around 10 times, and never thought that it stood up to that original rating. It has ranged from thinner in body with more light cola flavor to sweeter, almost syrupy. At the end of the day, this beer is inconsistent, and that is a quality that does not deserve a 4.3 rating, so the numbers have been updated to reflect my more recent experiences with this beer.




Tasted on 8/22/11 from a 330mL bottle obtained in a trade. Pours hazy dark brown with orange and red tints, a very thin and a bubbly tan head that recedes rather quickly to nothing.  The nose is super complex with tons of lightly burnt brown sugar and caramel malt, a whole bunch of fruity fig, raisin, date, and molasses, with just hints of bitterness and some alcoholic heat. The flavor is lightly sweet with all of the same caramel, burnt brown sugar, fig, raisin, date, toffee, and molasses detected on the nose with an added lightly green hops note.  The body is full and oily with light carbonation and long fruity caramel, toffee, and lightly bitter burnt finish.",3.7
3228,Westvleteren 12,"Wow, I almost feel like a heretic... How do you rate a legend? It’s almost impossible, isn’t it? Let’s deal with the basics first: dark brown pour with a medium - smaller than I would have expected - tan head. Aroma is unlike anything else I’ve had. Not even like a typical Abt. There’s a lot of sugar of course, and dark fruit, but the yeast is present in a way I haven’t experienced elsewhere. This also carries through to the taste, which has the same balanced yeasty sweetness. The complexity lies here: plums, raisins, dark fruits, roasty and bready malts and of course brown sugar. The alcohol comes through a bit as the beer warms up but as with any good belgian beer, never becomes too much in your face. Body is surprisingly light, as is the carbonation, but the lingering aftertaste is LONG and one of the best I’ve ever had. That’s a memory that will stay with me for a very, very long time. This might not fully match the hype for me, but overall it’s still among the best I’ve ever had and the second best Belgian after Rochefort 10.",4.4
3229,Westvleteren 12,"Ah, one of the belgian beer world’s great achievements. Pours a fairly dark brown with a moderate off-white head. Nose isn’t terribly potent but enormously rich, with lots of sugar, bread, belgian yeast, and lighter hints of raisins and alcohol. Flavor blossoms complexly and in a perfectly balanaced manner, with all of the brown sugars, fruits, yeast, and grains you’d expect to flow through a good Abt. Alcohol is in the flavor but does not detract. Sticky, sweet, and lovely finish. One of the best ales I’ve ever had and worth every penny of the $45 I had to pay to try it.",4.6
3230,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a beautiful dark brown with a white head on it. A little fizzy actually. The nose is gorgeous wheat bread, yeast, malts, and toasted sugars. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but it is a little over-carbonated and has a fizzy feel on your tongue that irritates me when I’m letting it sit to get the flavor. The flavor is very complex, so much going on. You get the initial hit of dark malts, and then flavors of wood, caramel, wheat bread, dried fruits, and then finishes with a nice touch of raw sugar. Brilliant effort. The taste hangs around and it sticks to your mouth for a while. I am tasting this one for days. Holy cow. This one had a lot of hype, and it certainly didn’t disappoint. It was well worth the $40, but I’ll probably end up getting my second highest rated beer for $6 a bottle on a more regular basis! :) Such a pleasure to try this one.",4.7

3235,Westvleteren 12,Bottle purchased in the Netherlands. Waited two years to buy a bottle and it lives up to it’s reputation. Poured a very nice amber with a decent brown lace head.

3237,Westvleteren 12,"THE beer. Finally got another one in a recent trade. I decided to open it with a friend of mine and tonight just happened to be that night. Bottle poured into a chalice.




A - Pours murky brown with a start white one and a half finger head leaving small wisps of lacing down the glass.




S - Smells of dark fruits; like figs, prunes, and raisins; mixes with the sweet malt, chewy belgian yeast, and some damp earth. The alcohol creeps in as it comes to room temperature. 




T - Starts off with a sweet mix of dark fruits and candied sugar slowly giving way a mix of bready malts, spicy belgian yeast, caramel, toffee, molasses, and some chocolatey sweetness. The alcohol begins to rear its head as the ale comes to room temperature, drying the pallet. The finish is a mix of sugary sweetness and light heat from the alcohol. Amazingly balanced overall. 




M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. So damn smooth with a little bit of chewiness. The alcohol does become a bit tiresome over the course of the glass.




O - This is still one of my favorite beers of all time. From the dark, complex, flavors to the soft, velvety, feel you would be hard pressed to find a better quad. I can’t wait for my next encounter with this amazing beer.",4.5

3259,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle into a Westmalle chalice...



Aroma: Dried fruits, alcohol, toffee, coffee, dough, yeast, dark chocolate, fresh pastries and wine!? Yeah, wine. The aroma overall is very floral. St. Bernardus has the basics down but this is a little different.
 


Appearance: Black as the LA midnight sky, like Rochefort 10. OK, maybe not, but it is a dark red with a cream colored head that’s very dense with fine bubbles. I can guarantee it’s plenty hazy with all the crap that poured out of the bottle at the end! 5/5 cause of the crap that came out which would put most people off. 



Taste: Taste is similar to the aroma. Get a ’bad’ one and you might think it’s just average. Get a good one and you will be blown away. Crapshoot! Price you pay for not buying it at the abbey....?



Palate: Thick, oily, very creamy. The carbonation is intense but also very fine, and what I mean by that is that it’s like fine grit sandpaper in comparison, to say, a cola which would be much more coarse. Balanced well, alcohol is well hidden.



Overall: If you want to know what I think about the hype...read the W8 review. It’s fantastic but, BUT, keep in mind it’s not magic in a bottle....only beer! 



Dec. 2/14, another rate but of the XII gift bottle with a BB date of 27.03.15......

Aroma is very vinous, lots of sour, almost rotten fruit which doesn’t sound all that appealing but it’s backed by sweet aromas as well as some coffee and chocolate. Fresh baked brownies/cake as well. I swear this beer has one of the best aromas out there, it constantly confuses and humbles me and it’s what I strive for in my homebrews. 

Appearance at this point is a transparent dark red with a small off white foam that gradually diminishes. I’m sure I can make it plenty cloudy if I poured with more vigor. 

Taste...quite sweet and savory backed with a bit of sour. Quite like eating a really good christmas cake with some chocolate. It certainly doesn’t taste like a beer. Lots of vinous notes. Kinda has an old book/dusty taste. Sounds greasy but it really makes this beer that much more. 

Palate is phenomenal, I want to guzzle this glass down but it’s my last bottle...the mouthfeel is quite good, carbonation isn’t as high as most Belgian beers but the beer is very smooth at this point. Super drinkable. 

Overall...the bottle I had before this wasn’t very good and I was led to believe this bottle I’m having now wasn’t worth keeping. Oops. I’m somewhat angry I can’t get this as easily as Trappistes Rochefort but what can you do? If one of the monks from Westvleteren is reading this, I’d be very grateful to get your beer, even if it was limited. 

An ideal world is a cellar constantly stocked with Westvleteren and Trappistes Rochefort along with a cute chick to serve me a bottle whenever I wanted and then leave me alone to enjoy the beer. 

Or she can get shitfaced with me. Either or. 

Hey, a man can dream. And drink.",5.0
3260,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at Craigs, thank you! The beer pours a copper colour with lots of blackcurrants , raisons and belgian candy sugar on the nose.

3261,Westvleteren 12,"Got this gem from Trappistlover as an extra! Huge thanks Dave.

A: Big fluffy off white head accompanied by some sediment. An exceptional brown with a ruby hue. Lots of ""floaties."" Heads

S: Strong port wine, not sure if my nose is off but that is what I am getting. Bready with lots of dark fruits. I think that is where the port wine is coming from...

T: Oh my word! This is far more than I expected. Big bread and fruit just like the smell. There are definitely some spices, not sure what it is though? Not getting much alcohol but this bottle has a little age on it. More robust flavors of bread and plum arise as it warms. Fantastic.

Rich dried fruits, chocolate again, soft spices, amazingly rich caramel malts, deep dark blackcurrant, raisins, hints of vanilla maybe. Soft sweet finish with just a touch of peppery hops.

The taste is wonderful as anticipated. Something is happening and I feel my training in beer has only begun. Despite this being my 3rd bottle in my lifetime it is still too complex for me. But I love the challenge. It tastes somewhat consistent with the smells, strong, sweet, malty and I feel like there is such a beautiful balance that the beer is a prime example of complexity being a good thing.

Not thick -- feels very light, like floating on air. Taste is quite elevating -- some brown sugar, alcohol (which gives rise to a very noticeable warming sensation), yeast, malt, dark fruits, caramel, and some maple syrup. Also some spice, though not much. There is a slight bitter note that comes out in some layers, which is usually complemented by brown sugar, but there is one layer in which the bitter is slightly overpowering for a brief time.

3291,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from 2005.  An excellent brew that lives up to the hype.  Very much like its slightly lower gravity cousin, the extra 8, but obviously just a hair bigger.  I’m not sure, but it tastes like the same recipe, just a little more of everything.  I actually found the 8 to be just a hair better, as the hops were a little more perceptible and cut the sweetness just a bit which I liked.

This beer comes in which an instant rush of fruit and spice.  Cloves, coriander and cardamom with bubblegum and bananas.  Hint of smoky, roasted nuts.  Slight tannic quality.

Little to no head.  Probably from the extended aging.  What little there was left a remarkable lace.  The yeast formed about an inch thick cake on the bottom, and the pour was quite clear as a result.  I drank half, then poured some of the yeast into the next half, because I like the associated change in taste.  Of course, after adding the yeast the clear brown became completely opaque.  The yeast lent a breadiness to the beer that I found quite favorable.

Very drinkable for such a big beer.  With all the malt sweetness, it has no perceptible alcohol.  Mouthfeel is rich, thick, almost viscous.  

Overall an excellent beer, this and the 8 are the number 1 and 1B beers in the world, in my opinion, and definitely one should not miss out on any chance to try this.",4.6

3295,Westvleteren 12,"2008 vintage courtesy of belgian beergal, thanks again Amy!  its a classic, no doubt. tastes bready and fruity and lightly floral, overall sweet but well balanced. nice full mouth, beautiful yeast profile and flavor, adds a good bit of spice. excellent brew. i think i prefer it a lil bit fresher actually, but its very nice at any age.",4.8
3296,Westvleteren 12,"Lives up to the hype.  Extremely complex.  Dark fruits, caramel, amazing palate.  Has a taste all of  it’s own that’s hard to describe or compare to anything else.  Very floral.  However, as amazing as it is, it’s still not quite worth the current market price.  I was lucky to grab a few bottles before the prices got too out of control, but doubt i’ll seek it out unless I can get lucky.  There are beers almost as good for much less.",5.0
3297,Westvleteren 12,"Really amazing. I used think this beer was more of a gimmick than a really great beer because of the difficulty in getting. But it really does live up to its reputation.

It’s complex, sublime and worthy of it’s reputation.",4.6

3310,Westvleteren 12,"(19/03/2011) bottle@Kulminator: very rich & complex taste, creamy, raisins, figs & prunes, earthly malt, brown sugar, some milk chocolate, spices, warming alcohol, very good indeed, the crazy is still a bit too much, I still think that whether you prefer Rochefort 10 or this is more a matter of personal taste than anything else ///// decided to try this again at Bruges Beer Festival 2012 -  33 cl. bottle sample – boozy dark fruits, sweet with touch caramel, plenty of sweet malts, hint spices, slight liquorish quality to it, touch chocolate, slightly messy & not exactly fully tuned, plenty of elements in common with the 8 as well as the 6 I have tried, 6 was a slightly different from standard version apparently, this is a good beer but there is a lot out there that equals this as well as surpasses it with some similar tributes, fine-tuned versions & imitations in Belgium being vastly superior to this that get a lesser amount of raves but the hype will never end and seems to be getting only worse ….  ///// tried a 2011 Vintage of this – bit under 2 years old. Tasted blind alongside St. Bernardus 12 & Rochefort. Despite not having had Westy in over a year & not drinking the others too often, took me about 20 sec. to tell which is which, surprisingly easy. Rochefort is crazily richer than Westy 12 – 12 is mellower, improved with age, quite good actually but the hype killing my buzz a bit, very interesting almost spice-like notes going on here, nice caramel, toffee & sugar etc. quite lovely but the hype makes it impossible for me to truly love this beer. Plus Rochefort 10 has much more going on & is sold @ the supermarket. Yes the hype is a bit too much with far too many people over the years having told me either “that this is the greatest thing ever or talking to me about how this was voted best beer in the world, etc.” or going on about how it tastes exactly like Leffe, the assumption that I simply have to love this is just a bit too much for me blah blah… I have been hearing this crap since I was 15 years old. Maybe should up score from 4.6 to 4.7 but I will leave this one for now. //// Tried a 10 year bottle of this one again, pretty nice subtleties here, not incredible but incredible shape for a 10 yr old beer, liked it quite a bit, not the elixir of gold that people keep telling me that this is //////////// 2010 Vintage. 33 cl. bottle @ home. Re-rate. Copper, reddish dark brown with a creamy, small, beige, off-white head. Nose simple, mellow oxidation, heavy on candy sugar, brown sugar, syrup, light liquorish, spices, faint molasses, smell is mellow & not in your face. Taste is slightly oxidized, heavy on candy sugar, pancake sugar & brown sugar, dominate all, chestnuts, spices, light liquorish, leaves, touch spices, lots of nuts, hint lavender, oily, warming,… Very nicely warming but not boozy like a fresh one. Very BE profile, dominant with sugar, its okay but lots of Belgians pack so much more than this. Oily, light oxidized body, slick. Good brew but there is better, similar in Belgium, overrated due to the perfect mix of rare but obtainable. Changing the score from 4.6 to 4.6 & that is overrating it but I have to keep the prev. scores in mind. I suppose my disappointment has something has something to do with it being #1 in the world. I suppose it is never going to happen that everyone will agree all at once about something. /////////////////// Tried another one, now idea of age, tasted a bit like a superior Westmalle Dubbel which sort of makes sense I suppose. Much fuller & richer. Very solid but costly, this was one of the label-less brewery bottles. Keeping the old score. //////////////// Also don’t see any notes for the 1979 St. Bernardus brewed version which I tried. For that one, too much oxidation, the 1979 “8” tasted really good but this one was too far gone for me. Definitely not as bad as it could have been, not very impressive either. ////////////////// 17.12.2008 Vintage, my last one remaining from the brick. Dark mahogany, touch ruby, small beige head. Smells like metallic syrup, sherry, coca-cola, vinous oxidation. Taste is liquorish, vinous & sherry oxidation, syrupy, vinous notes are quite interesting, thick leaves, herbs, touch coca-cola, caramelized cherry, faint bark. Fuller, slightly oxidising body. This is quite an interesting oxidation profile, I wouldn’t really call it top or anything, this is past prime most likely. I would be more exited about this if it weren’t for the hype that this beer has. This is quite an interesting oxidation profile even if it doesn’t feel prime anymore. Intriguing beer, I have attributed its popularity always partially to its ability to age well.",4.5
3311,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from trade.  Finally got to taste THE world’s best beer. This is simply a pure treat meant to savor. It pours a ruby-ish brown with a light bubbly head. Surprisingly, very carbonated. The aroma is earthy, malty, sweet. The taste, while delicious, is very complex.  It takes a second or two, to wrap your head around all (or some) of the flavors. I taste the sweeter caramel, plum, chocolate, wood, candi-sugar. Great interesting Trappist beer.",4.4
3312,Westvleteren 12,"2009 bottle from Cracked Kettle. It pours mahogany to deep ruby in colour with a thin foamy beige head. The nose is wood, ginger, raisin, fig, date, orange-zest, leather and dark chocolate. The taste unbelievably complex: wood, caramel, toffee, plum, cherry, date, prune, fig, stewed pear, red grape, banana, vanilla, leather, smoke, charcoal, milk and dark chocolate, rich-roast coffee, liquorice, nice alcohol warmth....the list could go on. The underlying sweetness balances the more savoury flavours. It has fine carbonation, a full body, layers of complexity, surprising smoothness and one of the longest finishes around. Awesome.",4.6
3313,Westvleteren 12,"As a gift from my boss during a working lunch.  Awesome.  I wish I had more time to truly savor this one, but alas, it was damn good while it lasted.  Semi murky chestnut brown pour with wonderful creamy khaki head.  The aroma is great, especially as it warms - bready, cakey, rum raisin, plum, fig, and smooth alcohol warmth.  The flavor takes a very dark and earthy character, with more dark fruits and surpisingly, not very much sweetness.  Creamy medium body is very nice on the palate. Very mellow and complex.",4.1
3314,Westvleteren 12,"Poured into a Kasteel goblet. Thanks to onedropsoup for this. I think this might be from 2009 due to the dateless cap.

The first (and only other) time I tried this beer I was at a tasting and had several brews before getting to this one. Boy was that a mistake. I couldn’t smell or taste much of anything. Anyway, this time I get to fully enjoy it.

4.0 A: Pours a ruddy dark brown color. Initially, it poured fairly clear, but toward the end of the bottle, clumpy sediment started accompanying the liquid. Two fingers of mainly frothy beige head with slightly better than average retention and a formitable ring of lacing.

4.5 S: This is quite a complex brew! Surprisingly nutty, this is by far the nuttiest quad I’ve ever stumbled upon. Dry as well (I suppose that’s expected from the candi sugar). Earthy and musty, and toasty like there is lots of brown malt. Only moderately spicy and nothing really stands out in this regard (maybe white pepper). Fig, tobacco, and pear brandy fruitiness. Ovaltine-like chocolate and just a touch of booze. This is very nice, but I’d prefer if it had some more power.

4.5 T: Not as complex as the nose, but much stronger flavors. Foremost there is brown sugar, caramel, tobacco, and molasses. Booze soaked figs, raisins, and prunes. Raw cacoa powder, nutty, and toasty. Peppery and to a lesser extent, clove, spiciness. Again, earthy and musty. Pretty damn good here too.

4.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Carbonation is in perfect amounts with a good spritzy quality to it. Good amount of creaminess and super smooth with a touch of warmth on the finish.

4.5 D: I suppose this does live up to the hype. It’s an excellent brew, but I’m not so sure that it’s that much better that easier to get examples. Still, quite a brew!

Creamy, smooth, mellow and highly carbonated on the palate, sweet from the fruits, fresh at first and the complexity just keeps on building throughout the finish. Need to do a side by side with Rochefort 10 but pretty sure its my favourite trappist. Ages beautifully - becomes more mellow, the alcohol is muted, and the fruit and yeast shines.",4.8

Smooth, marked sweet taste resemblieng caramel and very well balanced with some bitterness. The high level of alcohol is not perceptible in the taste but appears a little bit on the palate.

3322,Westvleteren 12,"24.09.11 stamped on the cap. I think that means bottled in 08 but I’m not sure.

Pours a very dark chestnut brown/plum color with slight murky cooper brown edges and a one finger frothy beige head that slowly fades into a thin lasting cap. Sporadic spots of lace left behind.

Spicy, estery aroma with lots of vinous dark fruit, zesty pepper and earthy hops. Very complex nose with lots of plum, grape, raisin, fig, date and dark cherry. This is complimented by a nice roasted malt presence with hints of chocolate and caramel and subtle earthy pine. Peppery with coriander and cardamom as well as hints of yeast/bread, phenol and licorice. This beer smells exceptional.

Medium bodied with a perfect balance of sweet, vinous dark fruit, eatery yeast, zesty spice, earthy hops, roasted malt and sweet alcohol. Soft carbonation up front with a heavy spice profile. Lots of zesty pepper and coriander that lingers throughout over the complex body into a sweet yet dry finish. This is quickly countered by a delicious dark fruit presence with hints of plum, grape, dark cherry, fig and raisin. The sweetness from the yeast is complimented perfectly by a prominent malt character. Fuller bodied than other beers in the style with a slightly roasted character giving off hints of chocolate, toffee and caramel. In addition to all of these flavors, there is a subtle earthy hop presence that adds more depth, balance and complexity. It’s not overpowering, providing just enough bitterness to balance things out a bit. Toward the end of the swallow there is some sweet alcohol phenols and subtle heat but the ABV is excellently masked with little to no warmth in the finish. This beer is dangerously drinkable at 10.2%.

Overall, this beer incredibly complex, delicious and extremely quaffable. The best example of the style that I’ve tried and one of the best beers I’ve ever drank.",4.8

The taste.. It is THAT good - nearly perfection.  The hype is real.  If I have any knock against it, it’s that it is a slight touch on the sweet side... but it’s taste is so complex, that characteristic is forgivable.

Aroma started to emanate out of the bottle as soon as the seal was broken on the cap. Aroma is very complex with a strong estery nose composed of a mild banana presence, a mild toasted malt and caramel sweetness, lots of Belgian candy sugar sweetness, very low liquorish and raisin with an almost cookie like finish to the nose. Flavor is fantastic! Strong candy sweetness up front with a mild smooth toasted malt in the middle. Light notes of banana and a complex estery flavor are also in there. Smooth brown sugar, light raisin with a very long lasting combo of caramel and sugar finish. Body is pretty heavy and holds a lot of residual sugar feeling. Carbonation is very high and keeps the brew pretty lively. Overall - first and foremost I have to say thanks to JMerritt for this brew. I did have some reservations in trying this beer as it comes with such lofty expectations that I thought it would be difficult for the beer to meet what I have read and heard. It definitely did not disappoint. The quality and attention to details form Westvleteren shows. Aromas don’t overpower but do give the brew a very intense quality not seen in too many beers. The flavor is complex, well balanced and provides a full range of tastes throughout th drink. Just an awesome  beer and one I will look forward to having again at some point this lifetime.

Rich malts, light but rich, caramel toffee and cream, whisper of sherry underneath. Dates and mild prunes and other ripe fruits. Modest marmalade and a little berry fruits on the back end.

3348,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma of sweet perfume, rose water, prunes, plums and raisins. The beer has some nice lacing on the glass over a translucent amber body. The flavor has a very slight alcoholic bite, lots of chewy caramel, carbonations, and malt. Very balanced, warming, and surprisingly thin (viscosity wise). The palate was most surprising, this is probably the thinnest quadrupel I have ever had, but it still had all of the flavor, maybe more, of it’s contenders. Bottle from a trade with Daknole. Daknole- Thanks for my #1000!",4.1
3349,Westvleteren 12,"On draught at In De Verde. Pours a dark brown with a wonderous pillow like head that is tan in colour. Smells of breads, dried fruits such as raisin and prunes. Tastes spicy and slightly of alcohol. Also of raisin and caramel. The complex taste just doesn’t stop. I really cannot say enough about this beer, there is a reason why it is constantly rated best in the world. I have a bottle that is aging as I write this and I can’t wait to try this lovely brew again. Just a treat.",5.0

nice dark brown color with minimal head. Thick oily texture which makes this beer so awesome. The pouring was very gentle, so there was no head, however, the carbonation created one as the beer began breathing in my glass. Very nice 30th birthday present, too expensive though (35$). Happy to have finally tried it without having to travel to Belgium.",4.8

Yeasty nose with notes of molasses and prunes and a malty sweetness reminiscent of canned apricots.  Warming, syrupy mouth-feel that hides the alcohol well.  Sweet, fruity body with a lingering complex finish.  Surprisingly unassuming and very drinkable.",4.5

A nice brew to have, still, remarkably similar in taste to the Rochefort Trappistes 10 (which is cheaper and  easier to obtain)",4.3

As expected, this is one hell of a beer. Pour is a dark brown with a quickly disappating off white head. The aroma was extremely complex, with dark fruit present. Apples also, figs and molasses. The taste was equally complex. Not overly boozy, considering. Great beer, definitely worth a try, but I think I’d rather have 3 rochefort 10s for the price.",4.5

3360,Westvleteren 12,"BB date on cap 03-13.  The pour is fantastic with a huge, beige, super creamy which is mostly lasting and leaves Belgian lace all over; the body is a murky, rusty, deep crimson.  Very nice nose with pound cake, lots of plum, light molasses, blackberry, light tea leaf notes, nutmeg and mace, dark chocolate, fig, and sweet caramel; similar to the Rochefort 10.  Interesting flavor with so much malt richness and some fruitiness to match but a distinct bitterness far in the background; very fig- and plum-like, chocolate brownie, blackberry, spicy nutmeg and mace, still the molasses, tea leaves and faint twig bring just enough deceptive bitterness, and just a faint Colombian coffee hint in there.  The palate is nearly full, lightly chewy, round and velvety, drying, and soft to lively.  The finish is still mostly sweet with chocolate, some plum left, spicy nutmeg still, and the tea leaf bitterness lingering.  It really was worth the wait, received this complimentary from Beer Planet in Belgium for ordering 25 beers online.  Started very similar to the Roch 10 but the subtle bitter notes were amazing addition to a very rich and fruity style.  The dryness seemed to thin the palate just a hair and the complexity was amazing but not unparalleled.  Other than aging this one for a few years, I don’t know how much better a Belgian beer can get.  I might be lucky enough to try this another time in my life, but if not, I will at least have the memory of an epic beer.",4.8

Flavor starts off fruity and sweet and ends with an alcohol semi dry finish. This is an incredibly well balanced beer that is like non other. Heard about this beer months ago and have been dieing to try ever since. After finaly tasing this beer i feel my life is a littlemore complete, have my wonderful girlfriend Alexis to thank for this. Anyone who hears about this beer you better damn try it!",4.7
3368,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a dark hazy brown with a moderate head that dissipates relatively quickly. Not a lot of lace going on here. 

The aroma hits the nostrils with rich figs and cake that evolve into something more precise. Raisins, fig newtons, dough and other dark fruits emit through the massively sweet scent. Some sour cherries come through quite subtly. A light aroma, but quite complex.

Taste is sweet and quite figgy with lots of bread, dark raisins, and cherries bombarding the ate. I can’t get fig newtons out of my head since it is quite prominent on the palate as well. 

The beer finishes quite chewy with waves of flavor revisiting the tongue after the swallow. First few waves are fruity, then caramel, then biscuit and dough, then cake, and finally peaking this masterwork with the slightest earthy hop.",4.7

3373,Westvleteren 12,"Received as a wedding gift from my best man--by far the best gift we received. He got us a six pack, and my wife and I are planning on having the next five each anniversary up until our fifth.

A: Poured into a Mikasa chalice. Pours a large mocha head atop a very dark brown body. Plenty of yeast. The lacing is extremely long-lasting.

S: Lots going on here, especially as it warms up. The trademark yeast is by far the most prominent smell, accompanied by some dark malts and fruits, along with a bit of alcohol.

T: Much the same as the nose, and probably the most complex beer I’ve ever tasted. Plenty of dark fruits, dark malt, alcohol, fruit and yeast spice, caramel, and molasses. 

M: Very full and heavy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Luscious.

D: Quite complex and takes a while to drink, and only gets better as it warms up. Very nice to savor for a long period of time while continuing to find new things going on.

3379,Westvleteren 12,"Transcription of an old BA review from 03-24-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate...someday.

The review comprises notes from separate tastings of two different vintages. Scores are for vintage 2008.

Vintage ’08:
The review is based on notes taken in fall/winter 2009.
Yellow capped ascetic bottle with best before date 03.12.2011. Considering that Westveleteren 12 beers are bottled 3 years prior to expiration date the beer is vintage 2008. The pour into St. Bernardus goblet gives muddy rusty - mahogany brown nectar with light tan bubbly head fading into an island of agglomerated bubbles. Aromas of sour cherries, berries, figs & raisins, touch of cocoa, breeze of red wine. The flavor profile is nutty-cocoaish with over-ripened figs, rummy with sweet malt base balanced by mild hoppy bitterness prolonged into lingering subtle bitter aftertaste. Silky smooth and creamy with alcohol unbelievably well hidden the roughly one year old beer is fruitier, with more expressed vinousness and less hoppy character than fresh one. 10 4 10 5 19 = 4.8

Vintage ’89
I was told the bottle is ’89 vintage therefore 21 yrs old although this cannot be verified as Westvleteren bottles didn’t always have BBE date on their crowns. However, the 11% ABV imprinted on the cap indicates this was a pre-1999 bottling. Between 1999 and 2002 the alcohol content of Westvleteren 12 has been gradually reduced from 11% to the current level of 10,2%. Diminishing of ABV was necessary to facilitate the brewing process as high levels of alcohol are more likely to kill the yeast. To the beer.
Into Westvleteren chalice. Clear coppery-mahogany brown body lacking any head apart from short lived bubbly island floating on the surface. In over two decades of aging the beer has undergone a complete transformation from quad to fortified wine or even liqueur: at this stage is highly viscous, alcoholic, sweet and abounds in fruity esters.
Palpable aromas of strongly fortified, port-like wine, intense sugary sweetness, plums, dried fruits represented by prunes, sour cherries , figs and rum soaked raisins. Clear presence of alcohol which is well incorporated into the whole. Each aroma listed reincarnates itself in the flavor department that perfectly matches the nose.The mouthfeel of warming and liqueurish brew is syrupy but not in a sickly manner, with zero carbonation. I’m pouring the beer carefully to keep the black slush at the bottom. Even so the last pour is hazy due to the raised yeasty sediment which adds some spiciness and in contrary with beliefs does not ruin the beer. Fully mature Westvleteren 12 is great, although does not have much in common with what I see as a beer.  10 2 10 5 18 = 4,5",4.8
3380,Westvleteren 12,"11.2 oz. bottle 500th ranking- $42.99 a bottle- This was part of a Trappist vertical, in order I drank Chimay blue first followed by Rochefort Trappistes 8 and 10 then followed by St. Bernardus abt. 12 and now this. To explain further The Chimay was the biggest disappointment, it was obviously good, but the worst of the first four, the Rochefort beers were just as good as the first time I tried them, but was expecting that the St. Bernardus would be better, it wasn’t, both Rochefort’s are a prime example of what a Trappist beer should taste like, so the big question, is the Westvleteren the king kong of the Trappist world.- Westvleteren 12- Pours a ruby murky red with a nice bone white head that recedes to a collar, lacework is good, aroma is stifled cherries and Belgian yeast . The flavor is less tart than the St. Bernardus and smoother than the Chimay, and less alcoholic than the Rochefort 10 and Chimay. The taste is mellow, creamy, flavorful, alcohol well hidden, it is hard to find anything wrong with this beer. Is this the best beer I’ve ever had, probably not, but it comes close, very close, I would say it is in my top five, maybe even top three. In closing, Every beer in my vertical tonight had a flaw in it except this one, I do believe that it lives up to the hype. But it is not worth $42.99 a bottle.",4.7
3381,Westvleteren 12,"Ölen är ganska stärk i doften, alkoholprocenten är välrepresenterad, men inte på ett negativt sätt.
Det doftar fantastisk gott av kola, jäst och lite söta mörka frukter.

Smaken är stor av söta plommon, lite russin och choklad. Tycker även jag hittar toner av vanilj.
Eftersmaken är mycket rund och välbalanserad, och ligger i länge, länge.

Ja, god är den verkligen, men är den värdens bästa? Nja, inte i min värden.
Faktisk så är det så att jag tyckte den nästa ölen vi provade var bättre… faktisk mycket bättre, så Westvleteren 12 får bara en fyra av mig, men en god fyra",4.3
3382,Westvleteren 12,"Many, MANY thanks to Ben for sharing one of these with me.  If you like beer you will like this, it’s awesome.  SOOOOOOOO many flavors and high abv, yet so dirnkable.  Fruit, malt, a little hop, chocolate, alcohol, it’s all in there.  And it really tastes great.  If you ever liked a beer, you will like this.

I think the yeast must be a lot of what makes it unique.  It’s got the most bizarre carbonation, and it’s fantastic.  Every time you take a sip it bubbles up and almost tickles you, then as soon as that’s over you set the glass down and it looks like champagne.  Weird and awesome.

Get one if you can, I was lucky I didn’t have to go all the way to the monastery!",4.7
3383,Westvleteren 12,"To finish a great day and evening of few nice beers after sauna, why not crack one of these, too. Pours murky mahogany brown into my Trappist glass with some sediment. Nice brown small bubbly head. Aroma is very nice with alcohol, malts, fidges, raisins, dades and sweet caramel but not as full bodied as I had expected. Flavor then. Wow, aroma was a bit ""low"" but the taste! Full bodied fruity and sweet, not too much though but just enough and a little bit more. Very lean mouth feel, you feel the alcohol but as a complementary part of the flavor and round enjoyable maltyness. Fantastic good! Palate feel is perfect blend of acidyness and sweetness, truly full bodied and creamy. Finish is amazingl; first alcohol and sweet fruityness turning into great bitter bite which lasts so long.",4.8
3384,Westvleteren 12,"For my 500th ranking, I chose the one and only Westvleteren 12. This is also beer #2 in my Trappist tasting tonight. Will it live up to the hype? That’s why I’m drinking Rochefort 10 right beside it and will be drinking three more Trappist beers afterward. Then I’ll be able to decide if it truly is the greatest beer in the world. 33 cl botle poured into Trappist glass. Pours a murky brownish orange with a nice bone-white head that retains itself for a long time; when it collapses, it leaves a fine blanket of foam and some nice lace. Not nearly as much sediment as the Rochefort. Better looking than the other beer. Aroma is spicy, bananas, ripe plums, earth, cooked black beans, some funk. Equal in the aroma department to the Rochefort, but they are very different. Taste is sweet with no bitterness (towards the end of the bottle a little bitterness shows up in the finish); almost Eisbock sweet. Some apple pie in the flavor. Crisper than the Rochefort; meaty. Body is full; carbonation is soft; mouthfeel is creamy. Overall, better than the Rochefort. Although a fine beer, I’ve had way better. I think it is hyped up a bit.",4.3
3385,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma:Malt and grapes. Nice sweet aroma.

Appearance:Brown in color, nice head that’s ecru in color.

Taste:Caramel and Malt, wine notes. The aftertaste leaves some leather, earthy notes.

Palate:Medium to thick in body. Hot alcohol, a little astringency, great carbonation.

Overall:It’s a really easily drinkable, flavorful, complex, and smooth beer.",4.5
3386,Westvleteren 12,"FINALLY!
Only took 800...or so...beers to get my filthy mits on a bottle of this. Was fortunate enough to share it with a mate, whose parents got a gift pack with 2 glasses and a bottle from a shop near the monastry itself. Needless to say, it’s been long anticipated!
I’m presented with a hazy mahogany brown beer. The inch or so of head is very dense, slightly beige, clinging on tightly to the glass on its descent.
The nose is quite intense and complex; dried apricots, raisin, fig, brown sugar, grain husk, undertones of chocolate, clove and peppery spice.
Relatively low carbonation for a Belgian. Very creamy on the palate, excellent weight; not too heavy, well balanced, certainly not much indication of that abv.
Deeply complex, and i’d say, unique flavour; rich dried fruits prominant with dates, figs, apricots, sultanas, prunes. There also seems to be a fair bit of hop flavour to it with some floral notes, and earthy spice and vanilla. Malts play their hand in amongst the lengthy palate with chocolate, bread and burnt caramels lingering. Bitterness higher than I was expecting, certainly enough to balance out the sweetness.

Well worth the wait; definately one of those beers the more you look, the more you see; an experience for the tastebuds. I think my only objection is it is not nearly as smooth and luscious, and wickedly rich, as its Rochefort counterpart, which will remain my favourite, for now. Amazing beer, regardless.",4.4
3387,Westvleteren 12,"My 1000th rate. Bottle via trade with phaleslu, thanks again Peter!!! Pours murky brown with a 1-2 finger, creamy light tan head that has excellent retention and leaves awesome lacing. Aroma is dark fruit, candi sugar, earth, mild chocolate, woody vinous notes, dark caramel, nutty notes and a touch of roast. Flavor is dark fruit, chocolate, earth, candi sugar, woody vinous notes a touch of maple, husky grain, rich caramel syrup, toasted grain, and... I ran out of beer to keep up, delicious and ridiculously complex. Palate is medium to heavy bodied, creamy throughout and has a strong, yet soft carbonation. This is an extremely, ridiculously amazing beer.",4.8
3388,Westvleteren 12,"A bottle I received from the generous Bert in a beer trade. When opening the box of goodies the last one I pulled out was the Westy 12 and I was completely floored. I enjoyed this one with company for a special occasion. It poured a dark hazy brown with a medium tan head that simmered down to a thin film. The aroma was sweet, dark malt fruit shine. I think raisins was the only flavor I could pick out, though it was much thinner than I expected. Fine perfect bitterness in the finish. There is nothing wrong here that I can see. It is not my favorite style of beer but I’m hard pressed to find anything wrong with it at all. Bert you are the man!!! Thank you! (months later)",4.2
3389,Westvleteren 12,"Rare & Famous beer from the monk of St. Sixtus!

Let down? That didn’t happen.
A: Medium dark brown with decent head. 
S: From the moment the bottle was cracked open...the aroma was so strong, it filled the room and made my mouth start watering. Very strong Belgian strong dark ale/quad smell. Lots of dark sweet malts and fruits. A slight wine smell on the backside.
T: Just like the smell. Very complex. Tons of dark overripe fruits, sugars, slight booze, smooth.

3393,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from bierkoning, thanks man. Pours a dark reddish brown, a thin offwhite head fades fairly quickly. I served this pretty cold, so at first the aroma was kind of mellow. Vineous, grapes, some bready yeast, dark fruits like figs and pruns. Some vanilla and wood. The problem was that when it heated up close to room temp, it still didn’t go all boom with aroma or flavour. What happened was that the alcohol started to show way more, and it was a bit sharp in the finish. As most strong belgians, this is overcarbonated in my opinion. Still, this is a good beer. Would like to try more times to see if my bottle was a bit off.",4.1

En bouche, elle est riche, épaisse et légèrement sucrée en offrant des saveurs de caramel, de noisettes, de biscuits au beurre, de chocolat et ce, sans trace du 10.2% d’alcool.

Delicious. Full bodied with a very nice oily texture and soft carbonation. Dry, warming and bitter finish. Top 10. 9-5-9-4-18 4.5



330 ml bottle.

After tasting numerous bottles of St. Bernardus Abt 12 and Rochefort 10, I must say W12 is really not that different. It’s very similar as these two, but it’s harder to get and it costs more.  Rochefort 10 is available everywhere and it’s just as good as W12. This W12 bottle I had wasn’t worth 4.5. St Bernardus Abt 12 is better anyway. 8-4-9-4-17",4.2
3400,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from a great BA digita7693. Cap 16.2.13
bottle share with a good friend that is a home brewer and great BA as well.

Pours like a carbonation bomb. I hate waiting 5 minutes and pouring 5 times in order to try a beer. But oh well, looks good otherwise. Pours a dark burnt amber color (once it settles and I can actually see color) 
Smells of figs and Belgian Yeast, slight flowery aroma, and also a bit wine-like. 

Taste, well this is where it gets interesting. I didnt get much out of it when it was cold so I let it sit a while. The warmer it got the more figs came out of it. The alcohol is VERY well hidden. can’t detect much alcohol at all. The flavors do dance around on the palate, and is very complex as well. not sure if they blend all that well, or that this is really worth the hype, but it is a good beer. Still way too carbonated for me, and the entire time I was drinking this I was swirling it out. mouthfeel is diminished because of that, but again, as I got down to the end, and it was warmer and less carbonated it got much better. I am not a huge fan of working my beer as I drink it, but so be it.
Not AWESOME, but it was good. i wouldnt go out of my way to try it again, but am glad I did drink into the hype machine at least once, and have another in the cellar to age and review again. But as many have said, St. B 12 isn’t that too far off if not better.",3.8
3401,Westvleteren 12,"Certain products and certain pieces of art have a reputation for such amazing feats of greatness that their reputation is hegemonic. I could write an entire dissertation analyzing whether such reputations are due to authentic reaction and therefore deserved, or due to word-of-mouth hyperbole (especially in the era of the internet). I could also make the argument that the title of ""the best beer ever"" is an impossibility since that title implies some kind of measurable output and a place in a factual hierarchy of quality. But the method used to judge how ""good"" a beer is is based on personal taste, not any kind of mathematical, observable performance output. If beer could be judged using a scientific process, we could simply devise a formula and plug in the numbers - in essence discounting personal taste and the notion of a beer critic would be arbitrary.

So while I scoff at the notion of the ""best"" beer or the existence of a hierarchy of beer quality as a matter of fact (rather than as a matter of opinion), I still want to try beers with good reputations to experience and judge them for myself. And what better beer to do this with than Westvleteren 12 - a Trappist beer brewed by monks and sold exclusively at the monastery in Belgium. It’s roundly regarded as ""The Greatest Beer in the World"" among the craft beer enthusiast community. Now that I’ve had the opportunity to try it myself I can understand why some would give it that title. And while I do think it’s an excellent beer, it’s not the greatest beer I’ve ever had.

APPEARANCE AND AROMA

I drank this beer twice - the first time I split an 11.2oz bottle with two friends. The second time I poured a bottle into a Trappist chalice. The beer looks more like red wine with a dark brown, extremely hazy body with a slightly ruby red hue. It forms a surprisingly large, frothy, beige head which never completely dissipates and leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is also wine-like, although many Belgian ""strong dark ales"" or ""quadruples"" tend to have this scent. It’s mostly dark fruit with red grape, plum, and cherry dominating the nose with some ribbon candy notes too. There’s a perfume aroma of lavender and flowers with an underlying presence of strong alcohol.

TASTE

I’ve often found that the more highly-acclaimed a beer is, the more complex its palate. Belgian beers, especially Trappist brews, are known for being so complex that each sip is different than the one before it. Perhaps the best way to describe the taste of Westvleteren 12 would be to simply list adjectives: red wine; oak; Macintosh apple; cherry; vanilla; caramel; dark chocolate; fig; plum; bread, and alcohol.

While I would say this beer is indeed very tasty and appealing, it’s not to the point of being absolutely delicious. The palate is not quite as intense as you’d expect. The flavors begin to light up your palate as soon as they touch it with the aforementioned dark fruit flavors. The middle is noticeably dry with a slight chalky taste of malts and a touch of sourness. The finish is a surprise, though, with rich caramel and dark chocolate sweetness followed by a bitter aftertaste that lingers shortly.

Westvleteren 12 is definitely tasty and complex, but as impressive as it may be, this is still not the most delectable palate I’ve ever encountered. The intensity seems a little lower than it should be, with the alcohol taking some attention away from the palate. 

DRINKABILITY

One of the reasons I’ve been slow to warm up to Belgian beers is due to their spastic mouthfeel. I was pleasantly surprised by the gentleness by which Westvleteren 12 crossed my palate. There was no peppery sensation, so the beer was quite smooth going down. However, there is a definite presence of alcohol to cause for some heat in the throat and a dry aftertaste. This is a beer you’ll drink in sips anyway, since you’ll want to savor the experience.

At 10.2% ABV, this beer should be handled with kid gloves. The monks did an outstanding job of making such a weighty beer so palatable, but after one full serving I could tell I had drank a potent beer. 

FINAL THOUGHTS

It’s nice to have finally experienced Westvleteren 12 for myself, even if it did cost quite a bit to acquire. And while I enjoyed it a lot, I don’t quite understand how it got the reputation of being the best of the best. If this beer were as common as other Trappist beers like Chimay, Orval, Westmalle, Rochefort, etc. it would simply be regarded as ""another excellent Belgian beer"" - which it what it is.

3402,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a  raisin color that is surprisingly not overly dark, and it has an inviting, creamy head on top. The aroma is an intriguing combination of fresh, juicy grapes along with raisins, prunes, and yeast. The flavor is likewise interesting and complex, albeit restrained, with a subtle combination of plums, raisins, brown sugar, and a muddled assortment of other flavors that together create a delicate, dry, fruity sweetness. The super-fine carbonation tries to cover the alcohol, but the booze still shines through a little more than I expected.",4.3
3403,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Date on the cap of 08.01.11, so bottled in 2008 I believe. Pours a hazed deep mahagony reddish brown color with a slighlty off white head. Some sediment evident in the glass. A solid mix of aromas in the nose including fruit like raisins, spice, and alcohol. Also get plums in the nose. Medium mouthfeel with some carbonation that dances across the tongue. Dark fruits and subtle sweetness dominate the flavor. Some evidence of the alcohol in the taste. Pretty smooth and exceptional tasting. Other flavors that I can pick out include molasses and caramel. Nice sweetness left in the mouth after your drink.
So, how does the ""#1"" beer in the world rate? It’s hard to imagine how any such beer can be #1 for me. This is a great, very smooth drinking, well made beer for sure. The fact that you can only get it from the monastery has to come into effect in where it is on the list. 
Overall, I really like this beer. Its really tasty but I couldn’t drink it all the time. Give it up to the monks for making this one.",4.4
3404,Westvleteren 12,"Finally, Westy 12. Poured from a bottle into a Chimay glass (its the only Trappist glass that I own). Beer was brown, mostly clear until the mud at the bottom of the glass came out, this was avoidable, i know how to pour. The head was diffuse but present and the carbonation was slow but steady, continuously replenishing the thin head. The smell was amazing. Beautiful yeasty and sweet smell. The taste and mouthfeel were out of this world. It was smooth, I could have drank the whole thing in a few minutes but I savored it for as long as possible. Taste was sweet and pleasant. More yeast, no aftertaste. A perfect beer. I wish I could have ti year round.",4.9
3405,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Large thick foamy offwhite head over a red-brown body. Excellent lacing on the glass. Aroma-taste of spices (cinammon, coriander etc), milk chocolate, slightly swet, with a lasting milk chocolate type finish. Medium bodied, with some carbonic acidity/biteon the tongue. Delicious, very drinkable.",4.2
3406,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle pours deep brown with a nice khaki head.  Where do you even begin to describe a beer like this?  Aroma is sweet and full of fruit, malt, and yeasty goodness.  Notes of plum, cassis, cherry, caramel, chocolate, oak, vanilla, and the list continues.  Flavor shows the same with marvelous integration. Overall body is moderate to full, with moderate to heavy sweetness, and a lightly bitter finish. Even though this is not MY perfect 5, I can definately see why it has gotten such high praise. Rightfully so.",4.6
3407,Westvleteren 12,"A: The pour is a dark brown color with a sizable tan head and plenty of carbonation.

S: An intense sweetness that comes in the forms of caramel, candi sugar, molasses, and a whole lot of dark fruits. I get some cherries, plums, figs, and dates.

T: The flavor is pretty much more of the same, and that’s not a bad thing. A lot of sugary sweetness along with some caramel, molasses, and toffee. There is a strong flavor of dates and figs with some raisins and prunes, too.

M: The body is quite full with that fine carbonation that it seems only the Belgians can pull off.

D: A very, very good beer. Maybe a bit too sweet to drink a lot of at a time, but such a good flavor that you might make a bit of an exception.",4.1
3408,Westvleteren 12,"There’s not much to say about this beer that hasn’t already been said. My personal experience is that this is the beer that opened my mind to abts, tripels, quads, imperial stouts and so on. I’d never been too fond of stronger beers or darker beers or stronger darker beers until I drank this. A special beer.",4.6
3409,Westvleteren 12,From the time I opened the bottle the aroma was of herbs and carmel.  The appearance was dark brown and a little cloudy with a nice minimal head.

Definate fruit up front with sweet molasses with a little sour on the finish.  i must say, this is an excellent beer, but #1 in the world???  if readily available here, i would buy it quite often.",4.2

Sticks down the side of the glass. Aroma of grapes, honey, cinnamon, graham cracker crust, fresh baked doughy bread, pure fresh yeast, raisins, vanilla bean, and some lovely, subtle traces of candied Belgian sugars. Fuller bodied with a suave, silky, sweet finish. Seriously fantastic quad.",4.8
3413,Westvleteren 12,"Big thanks to TheFerm for sharing this one. Has a very sexy pour with a medium size foam head that was off white. The head retention was just about perfect, as was the carbonation. The aroma was fruity. Dried fruits, such as raisins, dates, and maybe a little bit of apricots in there as well. It had a lighter body then I was expecting, but the flavors danced on the tongue very well, the flavors did the polka actually. Can’t wait to try it again.",4.6
3414,Westvleteren 12,Consumed with Travlr and Jason on 21 Aug 10. Strong caramel overtones over a mildly spicy beer - in a good way. Mild carbonation with a med weight on the tongue. Smooth after taste.,4.5
3415,Westvleteren 12,"An excellent beer, though sort of a letdown considering the monstrous hype.  Without a doubt, no beer is hyped more than Westy 12.  I’ll eventually try a whole bottle and revisit this rating, but splitting one with a few others was enough for now.  Pours dark brown with ruby highlights with a great, creamy, beige head.  Great looking beer.  Aroma is weaker than expected, but it could have been the relatively small pour.  Very fruity with some bready malt notes, a bit of Belgian earth and a hint of booze.  I usually prefer earthier Belgians and was surprised by the fruitiness, but it’s still quite good, probably one of the best fruity malt notes I’ve had, particularly in the taste.  The beer’s taste is intensely likable.  It’s of balanced sweetness with lots of fruity Belgian yeast notes.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth.  Overall, Westy 12 is an excellent beer and I can see why its consensus rating is so high.  However, I wonder how many people would really call it their all-time favorite, particularly with similar and nearly as good beers easily available.",4.3
3416,Westvleteren 12,"October 23rd, 2015 - Beer in perfection. This takes everything that makes the Belgian Ale and tunes to perfection. Every taste, every flavor, everything in impeccably synchronization and balanced to make this an exceptional beer. Take your Rochefort or your Bernardus, and imagine it in its highest form. For a premium, that will be the Westy 12.

Westy 12 Review


The Westvletren 12 is my 500th beer.  And it marks my passage from beer drinker to beer appreciator.  I am thirsty for more.

I chose the Westy to mark a half-thousand beers consumed not only because it is an excellent and well-regarded beer.  It is symbolic.  More than a sample of a precise chemical craft, or brewing, the Westy represents the origins of my beer hobby, and the evolution of my palate and my interest in the field of beer.  Above all, this particular bottle was a gift from the very person who introduced me to beer.  It is a gesture that I took his invitation to heart, and have faithfully pursued the hobby well after we parted to different parts of the globe.  And it is a mark of my respect for his patience in enduring my initial skepticism, callousness and thick-headedness when it came to drinking beer and taking notes.  I owe him a great debt, and I honor that debt by drinking his beer.

I took great care and attached great ceremony to reviewing the Westvleteren.  Ambient noise and smells were minimized.  Paper and pen were placed nearby, ready to receive observations and hastily scrawled epiphanies.  I cleared my head of distractions (there are many) and focused exclusively on this laughably humble bottle and its innards.  I girded myself for my Westvleteren 12.

The pour is pretty standard, even mundane.  It kicks up a light brown head, little to no lacing, and aside from a few flecks of yeast in the last droplets to fall from the bottle’s mouth, I have no physical evidence that this beer will be a milestone in my beer drinking career.  That evidence appears in the aroma.  I am stricken with childhood memories of happy Colorado Christmases, as an intoxicating blend of vanilla, oak, ribeye steaks, fig, and a touch of chocolate fill my nose.  It is incredible, and it is here that I first get a taste of what all the praise, writing and hype is about.  The Westy isn’t hype at all.  It is credibly amazing, and deservedly loved.  And the taste fits the Quad. style I’ve come to love so much.  It is big and rich, barreling onto the tongue with the same aromatic flavors that caused me to reel in my chair.  A few seconds later this boldness attenuates, exposing an undercurrent of fig and a deep, sweet red wine flavor.  And then again, moments later this layer of flavor recedes to expose a tertiary layer of molasses, oak, smoked wood and a parmesan cheese like umami.  To be short, there are three distinct layers of flavors, each of them characteristically delicious, and each a little quieter than the last.  That final touch of umami savoriness is practically a whisper, but you can still make out the words.

With all these flavors in a single beer there is a very real threat that the flavors may become crowded and muddled.  This is not the case.  The Westvleteren 12 delivers these flavors in stages, and on a perfect palate.  The beer is thick, but not syrupy, and it textures the flavors without warping them.  It is a crowd of luminaries, each in perfect concordance with the others, a kind of harmony of brilliance without egos to interfere.

By the very end of the beer I am questioning whether this is actually a Quadrupel.  It has all the basic qualities of a Belgian Strong Ale according to my taste buds, and possibly according to a rigid style guide.  But I think the Belgian Strong Ale tag might be slightly too tight on a beer like this.  The Westvletren is an expression of a style, and a permutation so fantastically brewed that it almost breaks from tradition.  These breaks are sometimes called revolutions, which would be the highest form of irony for the Westy’s brewers who are steeped in tradition themselves.  But they are also steeped in this beer, and they must know that what they do, they do very well.  This level of brewing is intentional, and it shows.  One need only look at the lines of avid drinkers banging on the monastery’s doors to understand that there must be some authentic draw to this beer.  And now I finally realize it through a few intense sips. I’ve extended a dimension of my understanding of beer and the craft beer world with one bottle of a highly-esteemed brew.  This really is a fantastic hobby.

Cheers Stéphane!",4.8
3417,Westvleteren 12,"Enough said here. Saved this for our Honeymoon in Belgium. You might think people were exaggerating the quality, taste and “experience” drinking this. It’s well worth the reputation. Clean, complex. Low carbonation, multiple levels of Angels dancing on your tongue. There are many others who come close, but nothing has the level of complexity that a Westy 12 does. Have pictures of our first taste in our living room.. it’s a great experience worth savoring.",4.8

3423,Westvleteren 12,"Best by 4/29/13, from The Porter Beer Bar in Atlanta. This is somewhat cliche, however the beer was like a fine wine.  The complexity unfolded throughout drinking the beer.

Maintains phenomenal lacing throughout.  The aroma is comprised of fruit, bread, alcohol, and malt.  The flavor is of malt, bananas, alcohol, biscuits, citrus, and bread.  It is medium on the palate with high carbonation.  Overall this brew is excellent in all aspects.  The complexity of this one is truly INSANE.  The appearance is awesome as well.

3428,Westvleteren 12,"Courtesy of a trade with digita7693 
I had this ""young"" with a 2013 ""best by"" date. 12-oz bottle poured into a chalice. Poured a ruddy-red tinged, dark brown. A moderately aggressive pour yielded a huge three-finger white head. It settled to 1/2’ which lasted throughout. I sipped this beer and there was that fluffy head at the very last sip. The nose was coffee, caramel, plums, lemon, clove, and chocolate. The taste? My goodness...dark, sweet fruit (plums, grapes) with some chocolate at the start and some spices. Belgian (bready) yeasts were evident. The finish moved to dry and even a little bitter, providing a wonderful, complex and balanced evolution. Mouthfeel was thick without being syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high, but seemed to fit. It’s hard not to gush but this is just an amazing beer. I wanted to find fault with it but could not. Nothing in this review does it justice because it is the subtleties that make it special, and most of them defy description. It is NOT over-rated. You MUST have this.",4.9
3429,Westvleteren 12,"I paid $150 for six bottles of it on eBay, which I’ll admit makes a me a little biased, but I’ll try to be as unbiased as possible... That being said, I believe this beer was worth every penny I paid for it.  I’m only giving it a 19 overall because I figure that even perfection can be made even better.  If anyone can do it, though, I’d suspect it would be these monks.  I poured 2 bottles of this--one for myself and another for a friend of mine--and let them sit on the counter for several minutes until the head was almost settled and they were each about 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit.  

Pours dark reddish brown with a light colored head that doesn’t match the rest of the beer.  Aroma of raisins, brown sugar, and plums with a hint of caramel.  Thick, malty mouthfeel with just the right amount of natural carbonation.  WOW!!  Flavor explosion.  Dark cherries, plums, and raisins dominate, followed by a faint hit of banana nut bread and a mellow, fruity finish.

In summary, wow.",4.9

3431,Westvleteren 12,"A: Dark, reddish-brown body. Lighter along the edges. Large, frothy egg-shell head. Good retention. Dense coating of lacing.

S: Raisin, caramel, brown sugar, grape skins, figs. Complex and pungent, yet remarkably subtle.

T: Much like the nose, there are lots of subtle undercurrents of various dark fruits. Figs, raisins and cherries are prominent. Somewhat less sugar and caramel than is represented in the nose. The grape skin quality has trickled off and been replaced with a more boozier flavor. As the beer warms the flavors really pop out.

M: Somewhat thinner than expected for a quad. Perhaps its the booze thinning it out? Regardless, there is a nice lively carbonation up front and a good, clean finish.

O: Incredible. I tried to savor this guy, but I couldn’t put the glass down for long. All in all, it lived up to the hype.

Now, the question is: when do I drink my two remaining bottles???",4.3

3436,Westvleteren 12,"Appearance: Dark brown, slightly translucent around the edges. Pours with a 2-inch head that eventually settles to a quarter-inch. Very good head retention, a trait I’ve noticed amongst most Trappist beers. 

Aroma: Dark dried fruits, figs, candi sugar, slight alcohol. Very aromatic. 

Taste & texture: Very fruity initially, though not overly sweet. Takes on a rum cake quality toward the middle. The finish leans more on the dry, herbal and hoppy side, though it retains a trace of sweetness. 

Notes: I compared this side-by-side with St. Bernardus Abt 12, and while quite similar, I slightly prefer this. I found it more aromatic and slightly more balanced. In contrast, St. Bernardus is a bit more dry and bitter in finish, though both beers are excellent. While I approached this with as much cynicism as I could muster, it really is great, and largely worthy of the praise it receives. Hard to call it the best beer ever, but I’m not sure I could say that about any beer. Nonetheless, it’s well worth trying.",4.2
3437,Westvleteren 12,"In De Vrede. Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus.  June 2010.  I drank this beer at the cafe at the abbey itself in Belgium.  No doubt that the surroundings influenced my impression of the beer.  If you are planning a trip to Belgium, be warned that this place is TOUGH to get to without a car.  There are no buses or trains that go directly to the abbey, and a 10 km walk from Poperinge almost thwarted my efforts... but I made it, tired and thirsty, to the cafe In De Vrede!

A. The beer came to me poured, although still from a bottle (unlike some other Trappist ales, that can be found on tap).  It maintained a head, light tan, and darker than that of the 8.  Small bits of sediment could be seen bouncing off the bottom of the glass as it bubbled (which it did with fervor).  The beer was served with the only real label-the cap.  (the picture on ratebeer.com is a post-sale label, not from the abbey)

S. The nose of this beer is strong, but not over-powering.  More depth than the 8, with more intense, not really even hints, of prunes, raisins, fermented fruits and brandy.  Underneath the formidable scents of fruit, there is a musty, woody, base.  All of this clears out of the nose and leaves hints of grassy smells, likely from the hops, used almost exclusively for preservation.

T. The initial sip instantly reveals sweetness and dark fruit flavors uncommon even among Belgian beers.  It is big, simply put.  Overwhelming flavors of syrup and brown sugar, balanced by fermented cherries and bourbon.  There is definitely heat from the alcohol, but the taste and smell are not invaded by this characteristic too much.  More subtle flavors come through after the initial shock wears off.  Wood, a little spice (grains of paradise? nutmeg?), and a clean dryness finish the flavor off.

M.  Bubbles all over my tongue swept the thickness of the beer away well.  I was plagued with the ""scrubbing bubbles"" image as i tried to sift through the carbonation to pin the taste and viscosity of the beer down.  It was difficult to do, but the beer has a syrupy consistency that is still not as thick as the flavor would suggest.  Fun, tough to grasp, and playful, the mouth feel may have been the best part!

D.  Surprisingly refreshing and fleeting, this beer was great, even on a hot and sunny Belgian afternoon.  The alcohol is 10.2%, but it did not feel anything like that (until i stood up).  It was easy to drink and doesn’t want to quit, which must make it especially difficult for the monks to drink only one!  

I finished it with a dish of chocolate ice cream made at the abbey, and they paired wonderfully.  The dryness on the back end really stood out against the hedonistic sugar and cream in the dessert.  It would be perfectly at home with anything from beef stew, to grilled and saucy meat, to sweet desserts of chocolate or fruit.  A versatile and edgy beer, given the mystery surrounding it and the age of the brewing tradition from whence it comes.

Not my favorite beer, but worth a trip to its home.  Definitely in my top 10!",4.8
3438,Westvleteren 12,"Pours brown/red with a tan head. Aroma is unremarkable. Mainly candi sugar, some dark fruits and a bit of mustiness.

Flavour is more remarkable however, rich and complex malt and yeast characters mingle flawlessly. Dark fruits and a lingering bitterness on the finish top off a hedonistic mouthful. Musty aged character is there too, works well.

A very nice quadrupel, probably the best I’ve had. But not the best beer I’ve ever had...",4.1
3439,Westvleteren 12,"Murkey brown hue. Not much head. Milk chocolate, brown sugar, some autolysis. Bready yeast. Overall a very well rounded palate. Very nice.

Wow, that is delicious! I was expecting it to be rather average, but I’m wrong. Lots of alcohol, spice, chocolate flavours. Some cinnamon. Lots of candy sugar, but it’s really mellow.

3443,Westvleteren 12,(bottle - 330 ml) Dark brown pour with a creamy looking tan head. Very sweet and malty aroma. Lots of fruit notes including prunes and raisins mix with hints of caramel and toffee. No alcohol detectable. Flavor is fruity and sweet and malty all at the same time with tons of different malt notes. The caramel comes up near the finish and really mixes well with the plum and raisin notes. Alcohol shows up a little bit at the finish. Incredibly smooth and chewy body with a lingering fruit and malt aftertaste. I was wondering if this would live up to the hype and it definitely didn’t disappoint. Amazing. Rating #2400.,4.8
3444,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle @ Gollem, Amsterdam. Pours a thick off white head which quickly thins. Dark brown body. Aromas of spice and rose wine, toffee and treacle. Long dry bittersweet finish. Warming. Bitter and sweet notes throughout. As the beer warms up, dark cherries start to come through strongly on the nose. Also coming from this mysterious and complex brew are notes of malt, alcohol, nuts, vanilla and finally milk chocolate. The beer has a bready backbone. Also notes of yeast and biscuit. Weak spruce hoppy undertone and finally blossom.",4.9
3445,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from my amazing wife. I had this as part of a Belgian quad taste-off with St. Bernardus 12, Rochefort 10, and even more. It’s hard to say I was blown away since my expectations were understandably excessively high. That said, I did love this beer and it stood up very well against tough competition, and it may have been the best smelling Belgian ale I’ve come across with tons of fruit and wine-like characteristics. Its delicious flavors were not as sweet as the aroma indicated and only improved as it warmed and flattened out. My only knock on this beer was how hot it finished. With all the hype, I was expecting it to be far smoother than it was as the alcohol was very evident, even prominent. My assumption is that this would be improved with age, but since this was likely the only bottle I’ll have and it was very fresh, I have to knock it down a bit on that note.",4.5

3447,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle.

A - Dark chestnut with garnet red hues and an above average sized, creamy, smooth, tight foamy head. Good retention that finally rests into a nice, creamy, smooth layer of lace.

S - Wonderful mix of dark fruit (raisin, date, a bit of cherry, and lots of other dark fruit). Strong amount of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, allspice, coriander, etc.) paired with some warming alcohol. Also a good amount of dark caramel malt.

T - Similar to the nose. Well balanced and complex, and hard to fully describe so I’ll just say wow. Strong amount of spice (similar to the nose) along with a touch of warming alcohol that compliments the spice. Dark fruit mixes in well with raisin being the strongest, but others making a showing. Has a good amount of candi sugar, Belgian sweetness along with the dark fruit. Also has a good amount of dark, sweet, caramel, and slightly bready malt. Wonderful mix of sweet, spice, fruit, etc.

M - Medium body with a perfect amount of carbonation. Wasn’t quite as thick as I was expecting, but it works well with the taste. Incredibly smooth and creamy.

D - So easy to drink with the smooth and creaminess and the well balanced flavors. Would gladly drink another.

Notes: Best before 24/03/13. Wonderful beer that lived up to the hype for me. Well balanced and complex. Really an enjoyable beer that I would gladly drink again. A touch lighter than what I was expecting, but it worked well. Very tasty beer, with all the hype I can see how it might fall short for a number of people, but all in all I think most people would gladly drink another.",5.0
3448,Westvleteren 12,"Received this in a trade with TheBeerSommelier (thank you SO MUCH!) and decided to crack one open in honor of the US v England world cup match today (figured the good vibes this beer will generate in me will travel down to down South Africa to help out our boys in blue!)

Pours an absolutely gorgeous hazy deep amber with beautiful thick foamy head that lingers... and lingers... and lingers leavinng sticky lacing on whatever bit of glass it comes in contact with.  

It seems to be PERFECTLY carbonated as the head just sticks around throughout the entire session, each time I take a sip the little finger of foam comes right back as bubbles continually flutter up from the bottom of the glass - truly a sight to behold.

Aromas of dark fruit and malt with a flavor that is similar but with MORE of everything.  Beautifully balanced - no one flavor taking precedence over another.  This is a truly GREAT beer and one that I will drink again ANY chance I get.  I could go on... and on... and on... but I’ve got to get back to drinking this!!!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!",4.7
3449,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from a shady dealer in Belgium. Kept in storage for the past 2 years. Drank on my 40th birthday. Dark brown pour with a beige head. Aromas of chocolate, plum pudding, dried fruit, caramel, quite vinous. Very complex nose. Flavours of caramel, hops, dates, baked apple, toffee, chocolate. Complex fruit notes. Good alcohol burn. Has aged beautifully. A classic.",4.4
3450,Westvleteren 12,"Notes from a tasting in 10/08

Bottle ordered and consumed at In De Vrede, the abbey cafe.

Poured in to a Westvleteren goblet, opaque brown with a frothy tan head that left fine lace on the glass. Lots of dark fruit in the nose, ripe currant, dark cherries, run-soaked raisins...yes, it smells boozy. Some breadiness too.

In the mouth, the first thing you notice is the alcohol. Having this beer fresh, at the source, has its advantages and its drawbacks and the heat of this beer when so young is one of the drawbacks. But once you get past the alcohol up front, there is a wonder of flavors. A rich maltiness, velvety smooth and all the dark fruit comes through. Raisin, currant, plum and dark cherry, underpinned with sweet spice, a breadiness and sweet finish that is promptly made clean by the strong alcohol. A velvety mouthfeel though. It’s pretty damn good.

A beer that lives up to the hype. The only drwaback was drinking it so young; I would imagine that having this with 6-18 more months of age on it would make it heavenly. As it is, the heat of the alcohol is the only flaw.",4.7
3451,Westvleteren 12,"The beer poured brown with a nice foamy head that dissipated pretty quickly.  The aroma was sweet and malty with caramel notes and little to no hoppiness.  The flavor was fruity, vinous at first then changed to sweetness as the beer warmed and there was a substantial caramel as well.  The beer started out dry and ended up sweet, there was a good carbonation but not overwhelming.  Overall an excellent beer!  Where can I get a case of this?",4.2
3452,Westvleteren 12,"33 cl bottle, Brussels, Belgium. Deep tawny port colour, a balanced freshness mingled with raisins, clove and a certain amount of dirt. Sweet with celery in the background, builds to a mellow alcohol infused finish.",4.5
3453,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from 2009. Pours deep brown with a lot of sediment and a thin frothy white head. The brew has a slight amount of carbonation and leaves very good lacing when the head disappears. The aroma is extremely complex and quite sweet. Included in it is notes of plums, raisins, white wine, and a little bit of hops/spice. The taste is magical - dark fruits, light fruits, sweet malts, and a slight hoppy backbone. No trace of alcohol at all. It may be part hype, it may be part mystery, but there’s no escaping the fact that this is by far the best Belgian Quadruple I’ve ever had... and that is saying a LOT.",4.5
3454,Westvleteren 12,"2004 bottle at Kulminator. Dark brown with almost no head. There is a saffron like spiciness that reminds me of Swedish christmas saffron buns. Interesting! It has a smooth, mellow fruitiness in it’s rather complex aroma. but there is also a hint of cough medicine (that I also found in an aged Rochefort 10, though much stronger in that one) that I find a little bit disturbing. Very smooth, silky mouthfeel. A very good beer for sure, but I don’t think it lives up to the hype, at least this aged bottle didn’t.",3.9
3455,Westvleteren 12,"Finally.  Got it for Leafs93’s graduation from law school. Pours a deep amber brown with a generous caramel colored head.   Has an aroma of dark fruit, caramel and malts.  Some breadiness.  The taste was worth the wait.  This beer is not overrated.  Sweet up front, then dark fruit taste.  Chocolate notes show up.  The carbonation hits at the perfect spot.  Nice dry clean bitter finish with a subtle tart aftertaste.",4.9
3456,Westvleteren 12,Pours a deep amber with sediment clouding the glass.  Aroma is dark fruits and breadyness.  Taste is sweet with a tart like aftertaste.

3457,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at Peter’s 2nd annual spring gathering.  No idea why it’s taken me so long to actually rate this, since I’ve had it a couple times previous, just never felt like taking proper notes.  Pours a hazy murky brown with a medium sized beige head.  Plums and caramel, smooth chocolate and toffee.  Very rich aromas.  Thick and malty, sort of like a chocolate malted.  Smooth and sweet, very subtle dark fruits throughout.  Caramel and lingering dark fruit and plums.  Lovely stuff.",4.1
3458,Westvleteren 12,"Finally! 2007 bottle. Pours a ruddy, chesnut color with small beige head. Aroma is full of raison, banana, nutmeg, maple syrup and alcohol. I love the subtle rotting plum element to the nose as well. Maybe a touch prunish due to this. Huge flavor to accompany the beautiful nose. Surprised by the slight booze off the get-go. Black cherry drenched in an oaky, boozy bitter piece of dark chocolate. Finishes of pure raison and burnt toast.  Soapy, coating mouthfeel that almost seems spongy. This is great stuff.",4.2
3459,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled sample consumed at my B&B in Bruges. Dark brown in colour with fairly strong carbonation. Aromas are of rich and lightly toasted malts, honey, and herbs. Remarkable that a beer with such substantial malt flavors can still keep all of the more delicate honey, fruit, herb, and toasted notes in play at the same time. Very gentle on the palate. A classic.",4.1
3460,Westvleteren 12,"Definitely lived up to the hype.  2005 bottle.  Deep brown/mahogany pour with an off white, frothy, lacing head.  Aroma is complex, with molasses, brown sugar, toffee and dark fruit.  Similar tastes as the aroma with lots of sweet molasses and dark fruit in the finish.  Excellent, a delicious sipper.",4.7
3461,Westvleteren 12,"This much hyped beer actually lives up to the hype. Pours a dark brown/mahogany with a big bready head. Aroma of malts, sugars, raisins and slight caramel. Tastes the same with a slight indication of the alcohol that is in it. Not a session beer, but if you have enough you may be tempted. Elusive but well worth getting stationed over here to get it every chance I can, and when I can get a reservation.",4.8
3462,Westvleteren 12,"Complements and thanks the Keltis for hooking me up w/ two bottles.  Bottled spring of 2006, pours darkish.  Aroma of fruit, figs, plum and raisins.  Flavor is more subtle on the Belgian yeast charter than I expected.  Flavor is rich and full almost reminds me of chocolate milk in beer form.  No aroma hops barely any hops detectable.  Drinkability is good for a beer of 10.2%.  Finishes off dry but with a lingering finish.  Not over carbonated like most Belgian strong ales. Solid but decided not to pay the $380 for a case from A-Dam though after trying this beer.  I would like to try this fresh.",4.1
3463,Westvleteren 12,"Amazing beer. Nose and tastes of raisins, sweet caramel, malts, toffee and other subtle complexities. I haven’t had this beer since, but my palate is a bit more refined now than it was eight years ago, so I’d likely give it a higher rating today. Rated 1/23/02",4.0

First impression, a ton of grape pot-sickle in taste and flavor. Aroma also comes with big caramel, almost smells sticky, with a bouquet of fruit (if they come in bouquets) and raisins and apricot, and sugary candy. Flavor is light spice creamy, so smooth, and surprisingly not very boozy feeling. Creamy malts with sharp bitterness that is intense for only a second and then lingers. Really lives up to the hype! Flavors are also molasses...but I still can’t get away from the grape pop-sickle. Goes down dangerously easy but light boozy burn in deep aftertaste!",4.4

Dark, deep coppery brown color and poured with a long-staying slightly tan head.

Toffee; flavor that reminds me of a melted/reduced cane sugar; pruney and raisiny and deeply maltly. Medium MF, with a nice bubbly carbonation presence. Really coats the entirity of the mouth. Pretty insane drinkability for a quad, though it is definitely a sipper. The intriquing flavors and sweetness definitely piqued my interest and was curious to see how the brew changed as it warmed. Overall, again very glad to have tried this brew and it is indeed wonderful stuff. The flavors and warming touch of booze really provided a pleasant experience.

3474,Westvleteren 12,"500th rating. Bottle cap date-15.12.12. Consumed March 2010. A murky brown beer with an amazing looking head that very slowly dissipates. I mean this head has the longest retention that I have ever seen. It took about 10 minutes for it to settle down to drink it, but the whole time it was in the glass it kept a 1 inch layer of foam. Perfection? Maybe. The aroma was like baked crusty bread, dark fruits, nuts, dash of chocolate and was quite hoppy. The taste was peppery, more baked bread, lots of nuts, raisins, other dark fruits, yeast, wood, banana and the 10% ABV is absolutely hidden. What I find so great about this beer is the fact that it is so big and has a lot of layers of flavors yet it is extremely drinkable. I hear others mention that Rochefort 10 and Bernardus 12 are just as good. But the difference between Westy and those beers is this is so much more drinkable. This has all those flavors that those beers have and more but goes down way smoother than those other fine beers. I was surprised at how hoppy it was also. I had another bottle of Westy with a different date stamped on it that was not quite as complex as this so that’s what is stopping me from giving it a perfect score. I will revisit the other bottles that I have and if they age for the better then perfect 5.",4.9
3475,Westvleteren 12,"Review #500. Received from Raznug for as a BA Secret Santa Gift! Thought it would be appropriate to review the #1 rated beer in the world with this landmark review. Poured into my Chimay Chalice.

A- Body is a very hazy dark brown color. Pours with a minimally creamy off white head. Head subsides to a thick half-moon collar with no collar around half of it and an eggshell creamy remnants of the head in the center. When held up to the light one can see the thick, dynamic cloudiness of this brew.

S- The overall impression of the nose is slightly sweet. Raisins, figs, root beer, cola, grapes, plums are mostly upfront and have a background of slightly spicy Belgian yeast and a very subtle, sneaky alcohol background.

T-The initial flavors are exquisite and balanced. A perfect bland of spicy Belgian yeast, fig, malt, and and dark fruits such as sweet raisins and slightly tart plum mix perfectly and give off a root beer and cola-like flavor. The spicy yeast comes through a little more for the finish as well as a slight bitter alcohol bite. The flavor then turns around and ends with a sweet fruity note. A slight essence of spicy Belgian yeast lingers. Flavor is wonderful and complex.

P-Medium carbonation and wonderfully smooth and creamy body. Yeasty and smooth but with a touch of alcohol astringency.

O-This is a wonderful quadruple and it was truly and honor to try it. As far as pure drinkability is concerned; it is definitely a slow sipper. This, and other good examples of the style, IMO,are meant to be slipped slowly as you contemplate the complexity of what was produced. The ABV is quite noticeable and if you don’t take your time with this brew you surely won’t get a chance to appreciate it. Due to its $ and availability, its a beer that was definitely worth it for the first try/review but I will reserve obtaining it again for a VERY special occasion. A bit overrated (Its hard to be a perfect beer across the board)-but still an excellent, stand-out, well put together brew.

I know I’m not giving any characteristics, but imagine everything good from any beer you’ve ever tasted.  It’s dark, sweet but not too sweet, the perfect amount of carbonation, the perfect amount of hops, the alcohol is there but not overpowering.  It’s sad to know no beer will ever taste this good again.
Upon further tasting, it’s still the best beer I’ve ever had.

Smells heavily of deep fruits like prunes and raisins, deep, dark, sweet malt and caramel with some chocolate and a bit of a rum character. In the mouth is initially malt leading into deep, sweet fruit and some chocolate with sweet caramel on the back end and some alcohol on the swallow. After adding the yeast sediment the fruit character is more pronounced with a bit more sweetness. The yeast gives an earthy character in the back of the mouth throughout. Medium mouthfeel, quite carbonated. This bottle was about four months old, and was not as harsh or sweet as previous tastings from the same batch. I will definitely have to keep some to age....

Would have been more clean if the overactive head hadn’t required multiple start/stops to the pour, stiring up the very dark sediment. The remnant head is beyond lacing. Great blond clumps of foam cling to the glass sides with streaks of caramel. Aroma is mostly alcohol, some caramel, and hints of a barn’s hay loft. Taste is spicy and a little bit sweet.

3485,Westvleteren 12,"First tasted 2009-06-06 at In de Vrede at St. Sixtus’ Abbey, but this rating is based on a bottle I picked up at Bier Tempel in Brussels. 330 mL bottle, expiry 2011-01-22, served in a branded Trappist glass. Pours clear red-brown with a moderate, frothy tan head and large clumps of sediment. Head has good retention and great lace. Aromas of honey, yeast, chocolate, tobacco, plum, raisin, pepper and spice. Flavour is honey sweet toasted malts throughout. Against this background, flavours of pepper and spice evolve and develop. The finish is long and lingering, spicy with a hint of nut. The 10.2% ABV is well-concealed, but it peeks through in the finish. As the glass warms, alcohol becomes more prominent and the aromas become more vinous. Medium in body, with an ultra-smooth, creamy texture that is ever so slightly sticky. Carbonation is average. So, does this beer match its hype? Westvleteren 12 is clearly incredibly well made. It is complex and subtle, and perfect for moments of deep introspection. For me, the real question is how it stacks up against its younger brother, Westvleteren 8. The 12 is sweeter, smoother and more alcoholic, but also lighter in body. Both are complex and malty, with the 8 more nutty and the 12 more vinous. Both are excellent brews, but I prefer the 8 by the slightest of margins. 2010-04-07",4.2

It’s still a very good beer, but the magic seems to have evaporated.

Shared this w/ SkyCop32.  Pours a deep dark reddish brown color. Aromas of dark fruit, caramel, and some spice. Flavors are dark cherries, plums, and some spice. Alcohol is really hidden in the deep flavors.  I prefer the 8 myself.",4.4
3491,Westvleteren 12,"33cl bottle, bottled in august 2009
Brown color with a red shine and a creamy beige froth.
Creamy nose of fruits. Flavor starts sweet with a gentle alcohol tingle, hints of caramel and a fruity finish. Silky mouthfeel and superb drinkabality. 
Complex and yet so gentle, magnificent!",4.3
3492,Westvleteren 12,"HUGE, HUGE thanks to DA for giving up this bottle to me after I missed a Portland Quad Tasting.  I shared the bottle with Tweety during our home brewing session.  Poured deep, dark amber with a white head.  Wine-like tart fruit esters, cloves, a little alcohol warmth.  A tad sour-tanginess with a murky, sulfur-like quality.  A smooth, dark fruit tone which hinted to cherries and sweet dark malts, and other spices.",4.0
3493,Westvleteren 12,A lot of people has already praised this beer for its many qualities. However I find it a bit too sweet. An excellent strong ale.,3.7

3496,Westvleteren 12,"Review #600. Bottle brought back from Belgium by my wife - thanks Bryna! Served in a Westvleteren goblet. Best before February 10th, 2011, so roughly two years old.

A - Thank god! After the flat bottle I had in Toronto I was worried. The cap comes off with a hiss and a touch of gunsmoke. Pours with a voluminous two fingers of dark tan foam (impressive for a goblet!), that dissipates quite slowly and leaves glass-coating lacing and a thick cap. The body is a nearly opaque dark plum color.

S - The smell literally explodes out of the glass, with an initial wave of dark fruits and berries. Plums, prunes, raisins, black cherries - they’re all here. There’s some vinous red wine notes that emerge, along with a touch of sweet tobacco, apples, and nuts. There’s a caramel malt backbone that ties things together, but stays in the periphery. As it warms a touch of booze peeks through to remind you that this is for sipping.

T - The taste is very grape-forward, with notes of port, red wine, dark fruits, rum-cake, and caramel. It’s not as saccharine as Rochefort 10, as it’s balanced by a dryish and slightly woody finish. While the taste isn’t quite as complex as the nose, the alcohol is better hidden.

M - The body is chewy and viscous, without becoming heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is present, but soft. Finishes surprisingly dry with only mild residual stickiness. Not much in the way of alcohol heat at all. It’s everything I’d want in a quad, and maybe even a bit more.

D - So, is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but it’s a superb one nonetheless. It’s shockingly drinkable for a 10.2% quad, and I could actually have more than one of these without feeling diabetic too. There’s been a lot written about this beer, and I’m not sure there’s much I can add - it’s excellent, highly recommended, and worthy of the acclaim that has been heaped upon it.",4.6
3497,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a dark brown red color with some yeast floating,  with a nice long lasting beige head, lots of perfect looking pearl like bubbles.  Aroma of roasted malts, caramel, brown sugars, dark fruits plums and raisins, and spices.  Flavors are pwerfull, of roasted malts, chocolates, brown sugars, liquorices, plums and raisins, yeasts, cloves and spices.
Good carbonation, good sweetness and bitterness, well balanced, smooth and creamy. Long lasting wonderfull flavors in mouth, with some hints of rhum finish.  A perfect beer.",4.8
3498,Westvleteren 12,"aged 2 years:  compared side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus 12.  brownish red with froathy white head.  Amazing complex nose with fig, yeasty esters, and dark raison.  slight bitterness before an amazingly deep flavor of esters with a little sourness.  perfectly dry finish.  remarkable beer that shockingly met all expectations, superb.  dominated the other belgian dark strongs",4.7
3499,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, aged 2004 in Antwerpen. Dark brown colour, small to medium head, dense. Aroma of candy, chocolate, malts and dark spices. Taste is complex, raisins, figs, some chocolate, caramel. Very smooth. No alcohol feeling at all. Very nice, long finish.",4.6
3500,Westvleteren 12,"Enjoyed from an 11.2 oz bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a deep brown color, with a small but long-lasting off-white head.  Carbonation is high at the pour, but levels off to a far lower level during the beer’s consumption.  The nose brings really rich characters of raisons, prunes, figs, and Munich/Special ""B"" malt richness.  Absent are the grainy and tropical fruit notes present in so many versions of the style.  Absolutely wonderful.  The palate is full without being thick, and brings a complexity that make competitors like Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt. 12 seem one-sided in comparison.  Similar notes as found in the nose, with the addition of a few that are hard to place a finger on, as well as just the right note of depth-adding alcohol.  The finish is slightly sweet, but lingers beautifully (and, given the flavors, thankfully) on the tongue.  Overall, one of the great drinking experiences of my life.",4.4
3501,Westvleteren 12,"It was e bit dissapointed. I tested it a few years ago and it was better. Now it sweet, even to.
bitternes is OK but it goes away with the sweetnes",2.9
3502,Westvleteren 12,"I found that it’s better to let this one warm up a bit to bring out the locked properties. This one has a unique and complex aroma with recognizable coffee, chocolate, spices, a bit of smoke. Pours with 
thick foamy head and dark brown color. A sense of light bitterness that lingers around a bit in the aftertaste, but is  well balanced with a bit of sweetness from fruits. An exciting beer indeed.",4.3
3503,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Shared with the lads at work. Pours a deep mahogancy. Slightly hazy with plenty of yeast sediment. Smallish tan coloured head. Plenty of lacing. Amazing aromas of dark fruits, toffee and yeast. Super complex. Flavours show plenty of malt sweetness, toffee, dark sugar and drak fruits. Amazing beer.",4.5
3504,Westvleteren 12,"First off I have to say thank you Keith for bonusing this in our trade.  Pours a really deep, dark brown opaque color.  Aroma is very complex and intriguing.  Dark fruits, malts, spices, caramel, earthy, soy sauce, and stinky feet (yes I know that sounds weird but it honestly does).  Flavors include spices, plum, raisins, grain, resin, cloves, and yeast.  This is amazingly smooth and lives up to all the hype.  I feel privileged to have tried this.  Well done!",4.5
3505,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at home, from a box retrieved at the abbey last weekend after the pre-ZBF. Was very interested in this one since I first knew RateBeer. Now I finally got to try it. Pours a hazy dark brown with a very thick foamy off-white head with some lacing. Aroma is delicate at first but needs some time to bloom. Vero complex with bread, licorice, spices, grass, wood, some smoke and sugar. Amazing flavor that is a roller coaster from bitter to sweet back to bitter with all the aromas bouncing happily around. Extremely pleasant mouthfeel with lively carbonation and a very creamy texture. Well worth its first place on here.",4.3
3506,Westvleteren 12,"Wow... this blew me away. Made the trip during a week in Paris, learned stick, drove over. Tried the Blonde and 8 first (expecting the 8 to be my favorite of all three) and was a little disappointed. This, though... this is something else entirely. Almost tastes marshmallow-y. Don’t eat this with something overwhelming - something bready would be perfect (I had a sandwich at In de Vrede). It’s not like the other top-rated beers, in that none of the tastes are overpowering. But it’s a beautiful, beautiful thing. If you can, make the trip - respect beer.",4.8
3507,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle (2 actually) @ home, with the proper glass, commemorating an awesome beer weekend. (Pre ZBF, local belgian beershop, St. Sixtus abbey, ZBF) Deep brownish black pour, faint red glow. Thick creamy/soapy tanned head, leaving lot’s of lacing. Intense and complex aroma with fruity yeast, sweet liquorice, caramel and spices being most noticeable. Deep bitter flavour of sweet liquorice, salt liquorice, smoke and spices followed by sweetness from caramel, fruit and raisin. Flavour lingers on for ages.

Truly an awesome beer, but it’s not my number one. Close though.",4.0
3508,Westvleteren 12,"great, dark brown and very rich, deserves all the praise that it earns,, the taste was even richer and smoother and the Abt 12 from St Bernardus
, the only regret about this beer is how hard and expensive it was to get",4.4
3509,Westvleteren 12,"Sampled at Auberge Douceurs Belges in Quebec City. Poured a dark brown colour with a small creamy head. The lace was also creamy. There was also a thin white coat over the brew with patches of spices. Mild spicy nose with some nuts and alcohol in the background. The taste was very nutty with some bitterness in the back. The alcohol is always present, but dissapears slowly. Some dark fruit and notes of coffee in the aftertaste. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. After finally finding this one and being so well-rated, I was dissapointed... just like the Rochefort 10. Well brewed, not much to get me off. Lacking in the aroma department.",3.6
3510,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, 8 years ago from an offie in Slough, and more recently - BIG thanks to Mes. Well it wouldn’t be Number 1 on RB if it didn’t seriously kick ass, and this undoubtedly does that - in abundance.  Dense vivid dark brown colour with a liberal tan cuff. The nose makes you sit up and take notice from the off, and it kicks in that you have something pretty special sitting in your glass. Forest pine, dark fruit, marzipan, booze, malt, spices. Breath deeeeeply and inhale its a 10 - no dizzle. Slides down wonderfully well - warming with a gently prickly alco-burn that soothes like a warm blanket on a cold night.  Lord (and the monks) only knows how they have sculpted this concoction of spices, fruits, malt and yeast so seamlessly. Worthy of all the plaudits. Sublime beer.",4.6
3511,Westvleteren 12,"There’s not much to say about this. It is the perfect beer for its style and it really can’t get much better. It is deserving of the high accolades. If you can find it, try it.",5.0
3512,Westvleteren 12,"Sampled from the bottle at the 2010 February Circle City Tasting. Poured a near clear dark gold with an off-white head. Aroma had notes dark grains, alcohol, a bit of dark fruit and a bit of clove. Amazingly well balanced.",4.2
3513,Westvleteren 12,"I think I may reserve my judgement until I have a second... this was much different than expected.  For now, the number one rated beer is far from number one in my heart. :-(",4.2
3514,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle in de Vrede, Westvleteren. Greyish brown body with long lasting brown head. Hazy. Very strong malty aroma, sweet, quite like cola. Flavour really complex, some sweetness but somehow sour. Fruity and hoppy with good balance. Plum. Some chocolade and hops on aftertaste. Not an alcoholic flavor at all. Even though I was really sceptic towards this all time best hype, it turned out to be one of the best beers ever.",4.4
3515,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Murky red/brown body with very small off-white head. Flavour is malt, sweet and dark fruits.",3.5
3516,Westvleteren 12,"Best before 2012.  Pours deep brown with a large head.  Lots of  carbonation, very fizzy.  Aroma is spicy and yeasty.  Flavor of alcohol figures in strong, also lots very complex spice profile, along with some fig.  Fantastic once it warmed up a bit and lost some of the carbonation.",4.4
3517,Westvleteren 12,"Big creamy beige head, deep copper/red/brown colour.
Aroma of yeast, sugar, jam, dried fruits, alcohol, honey and faint hops.
Flavour is rich, alcohol, sugar, yeast, dried fruits, honey, very sweet and yeasty, notes of corn. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and less carbonated than all other quadrupels i’ve had to date. 
In short: very good, best beer in the world? No it is not.",4.2
3518,Westvleteren 12,"The aroma hints of grapes and some dark fruits as well.  The flavor is grapes and dark fruits mixed with wonderful Belgian yeast characteristics - and no hotness whatsoever. This is delicious, well balanced, and very smooth.  The mouthfeel is amazingly soft and effervescent like real Champagne.",4.8
3519,Westvleteren 12,Was lucky enough to get to try some of this from a friend that picked it up in Belgium...bottle had been opened about 4 hours.  The aromas were cola and caramel along with the terrific distinctive Belgian yeast.  Terrific balance and banana and baking spices.,4.7
3520,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a clear brown with a big fluffy off white head. This beer changed flavor about four times throughout the tasting.   Initially a little to cold. Aroma was earthy, yeasty, malty, a little funk and not much fruit. Flavor was slightly bitter, and actually a little hot. Twenty minutes later and at least five degrees warmer and this beer was completely different. Aroma was malt, raisins, and lost most of the funk. Flavor was sweeter, more dark fruit, fig, malt, and yeast. This was a phenomenal beer.",4.6
3521,Westvleteren 12,"Deep brown with a thin, pale head.  Sweet, fruity aroma, smells earthy, of raisins, prunes, and dates.  Fantastic flavors of raisins, orange peel. It’s sweet, malty, and balanced.  Starts off soft and fruity, with a slightly bitter, malty finish.  Blew me away.",4.6
3522,Westvleteren 12,"This beer is more than ""perfect""! After many years of tracking it down in the United States, I thought it would be much more hype than reality, but I was wrong. Pours dark but clear, multitude of flavors in the first sip. What struck me was how clear the sight and taste was! So pristine, and completely diverse and balanced flavor. This beer is worth the hype!",4.7
3523,Westvleteren 12,"Rating # 300. Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown body, with a small, but forever lasting off-white head. Aroma is belgian yeast, molasses, dark fruit and notes of alcohol. Flavor is yeast, malt,, sweet dark fruit, dates, raisins and notes of alcohol. Warming finish from the alcohol. Nice lacings. Fantastic beer.",4.1
3524,Westvleteren 12,"330mL 2003 ed courtesy of glouglouburp. Thanks Dany! Pours very deep brown almost black looking in the glass with a thin tan head that leaves some nice bubbles and a faint protective layer. Really wants to lace well. Aroma is outstanding. Loads of rum raisin, malaga gelato, light cognac, dates, figs, mulled apple cider. Whoa. Taste is similar: tons of gourmet dark fruits, cognac, milk chocolate, ganache, chocolate mousse, mulled red wine. A little warming from the 10%. This is seriously good. Beautiful creamy, rich palate. Just destroys all other Trappist beers. Especially St. Bernardus 12. 2/10/2010 94/9/5/17=4.4

330mL 2007 ed thanks to Travlr. The pour is perfection: massive, thick, pillowy cinnamon tan head erupts with precision and towers out of the Westvleteren trappist chalice perfect poise rising straight out of the glass but not toppling over like a miracle. Massive retention and sheety, full lacing. Nose is rich milk chocolate, cinnamon, dates and figs. Taste is ultra rich milk chocolate, cinnamon apple butter, raspberry compote and ganache. Mild spicy calvados adds alcohol warm and sharpness. Effervescent carbonation and present hoppiness cut the sweetness. Very rich and aerated palate. Insanely easy to drink with less dark fruit character compared to St Bernardus 12 and more cinnamon, chocolate, and apple brandy. Awesome. 7/17/2011 8/5/9/5/17=4.4",4.4
3525,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #1000! Bottle from a trade with Boutip. BB date 25/08/12. Pours dark caramel color with tan head. Aromas of Belgian candy sugar, dark fruits, bread dough and molasses.

Thanks Phil for hooking me up with this world class brew.",4.8
3526,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle (best before 02/08): Hazy, lots of UFO’s visible, small stable off-white layer; gorgeous complex nose: dried fruits, bisquits and huile de noix de Dordogne; solid sweet-bitter flavour, medium to full bodied, oily; distinctive wal-nutty traces in the swet port-vinous and malty finish. No reason to get excited, just a great beer.......",4.3
3527,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle (in NZ). I never rated my first experience, as it was so underwhelming considering the hype. Unfortunately the reprieve was not deserved, as the second tasting was much of the same. Lots of caramelised sugar in the aroma, along with wet bread, and some methanol. In the mouth it is sweet, along with tart fruit, and oranges. The heat from the alcohol comes a bit later, and then a dryness in the finish. Drinks like an English Old Ale, but nothing special above that. Though it was wonderfully smooth. I feel like the only guy in the room that doesn’t get a joke....",3.8
3528,Westvleteren 12,"BIrra scura dalla schiuma bianco crema.Aroma di malto, caramello cioccolato e liquirizia.Il gusto è di cioccolato,liquirizia,caramello ,frutti scuri ,ma anche luppolo nel finale che rimane in bocca ben impresso. Unica , la migliore!!!",4.8
3529,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, 33 cl. Brown beer with a red shine, starts with a white creamy head that becomes soon a little head that lasts. Aroma of dried fruits, caramel, some chocolate and malts. Taste is a wonderful combination of dried fruits, caramel, chocolate and roasted malt with a light sweet touch and a light hoppy, bitter finish that stays a long time in your mouth. There are so many tastes in this beer, but all the credits certainly go to the fanstastic pallet which brings one taste after another to the foreground. Excellent beer, one of the best, but to my opinion not ’the best’.",4.6
3530,Westvleteren 12,"Describing all the tastes that you get when you absorbing this beer is almost not possible. There are so many tastes mixed all together to a very nice beer. Even the looks are great with foam that looks like a cloud and stays for a very long time. Maybe a bit over-sweet fruity, but good moderated spices, and some nice caramel touch makes this one very drinkeable.

Edit: blindtasted on 8 july 2010 with St. Bernardus 12 (both about 9 months old). Taste was close, something different inside, but I should give both same points. Also for the looks. But the smell of the B. was slightly better in my opinion. Westy lost that battle with the smallest difference. 

Edit: Retasted both blind after 2.5 years aging. The Westy is better, but just sligthly. A bit more sweetness and taste getting trough. It’s not that easy anymore to blindtaste wich one is wich beer.

Edit retasted at 31/1/2011 a bottle from 2004, more then 6 years old. Very soft fruits, raisins and prunes, spiced, light yeasty. Nice fruited. This beer can age even some more I think. Had to give it some better score after re-tasting multiple aged bottles for sure. Let them rest for a while! Retasted a bottle of 17 years old. Even this one is holding up very nice. More sweetness, less dryness.",4.4
3531,Westvleteren 12,"Lots of hype in the realm of this one...consumed now a few times, and I’ve got to say that this is definitely a fantastic beer!  I love how the hype around it pushes it to the top spot every year...it is REALLY excellent, but to be honest...the best beer in the world?  Not completely sure on that.  Regardless, the dark fruit notes matching the sweet Belgian malts...absolute heaven.  If you see one, snag it!!",4.1

3533,Westvleteren 12,"Oh the infamous Westvleteren 12, what to say, what to say. 
I think it goes without saying that anytime a beer geek gets a chance to try a one of these larger than life beers, it’s a momentous occasion to say the least. The fact that my awesome girlfriend bought this for me for Christmas off ebay, and i am drinking it in celebration of my 24th birthday kind of adds to just how kick @$$ this day is for me. It also helps that this beer actually lives up to it’s reputation. 
Alright, so, the beer.
Pours a dark, dirty brown with a cloudy white head. The aroma is big on black currents (wicked!), burnt sugar, raisin, licorice, red wine, cherry, and some nuttiness to round things off....amazing. The flavour totally ruins this for me, really, I can’t afford to even buy one of these, but I feel like I can never drink any other beer again. Starts out big on the black currents (wicked!!), some molasses, licorice, cherry, some roasitness, ends with more black currents (wicked!!!), and more licorice. Pretty much whats in the smell is in the taste. Truly legendary stuff. Surprisingly dry finish, lightly bitter, really works. Foamy mouthfeel. Hands down one of the best beers I’ve ever had. 
That being said, I would say if you have the spare cash to blow, it’s worth it to pay the ridiculous price on ebay to try this beer. After you’ve try’d it though, It’s not really worth the ridiculous price anymore, it would make much more sense to buy the almost as good rochefort 10, if you can.",4.6
3534,Westvleteren 12,"The aroma is of sweet candy sugar; syrupy with a subtle spiciness.  Incredible off-white head - it’s thick and pillowy (reminds me of the foam on a root beer float.  The color is deep, dirty brownish-orangish.  The taste is wonderfully complex.  It starts moderately sweet then gets very roasty/malty with an earthy hoppiness and a nice touch of alcohol and spice tones.  Very smooth.  The flavors coat the mouth and throat and just linger ""forever"".  This beer was unexpectedly (but pleasantly) complex and hoppy; just excellent.

Notes: Tasted 23 Jan 10 at In de Vrede (no bottles available to go)",4.8
3535,Westvleteren 12,"New bottle from the exported stock. Big head, chocolate, plums, dried prunes, raisins, stewed fruits, bread. Dark brown-amber with a high, fine, airy head. Big strong flavor, fruity, mostly dried and stewed, chocolate and toffee, lots of booze, hoppy finish, chocolate biscuits, rye bread wow. Very nice indeed, though still too hot, and seemingly very hoppy as well. Finish burns. Still too young, but much nicer than the last couple I have had, which had aged badly. 



Feb. 2007 bottle, drank in jan 2010: 8/4/8/5/18. Much more oxidized than I think it should have been, so it probably was not handled all that well. Glowing orange and red-tinted brown color with a quickly lacing head. Aroma of chocolate, caramel, port, dried fruit and spices. Quite oxidized. Chewy yet not heavy in the mouth. Alcohol heat noticeable. A bit too oxidized in the flavor, yet still wonderful.",4.5
3536,Westvleteren 12,"( 330ml bottle bb 8/29/10 thanks to BA bosse) Pours cloudy brown with oily bubbles on top. Nose of brown sugar, raisins. Taste of alcohol, cloves, chocolate, and dark raisins. Nice creamy finish with spices.",4.1

Aroma is pretty  much the same as 8 one. Dark fruits like Plum and berry fruits. Flavor is like aroma but some notes of roasted malt and sweetness and quite a little alcohol, but too little shown up. Mouthfeel is an eternity, balanced sweetness and roasted malt bitterness.",4.6
3539,Westvleteren 12,"(bottle, best before Feb. 2008) Hazy, yeast-flakes-laden dark amber coloured hue with a short and tanned foamy head. Sweet but not cloying toast-malty aroma with a cornucopia of flavours like (wal-)nuts, oak-honey, raisins, vanilla and a tinge of alcohol. Toasty and nutty taste with a fine malty sweetness, combined with notes of walnuts, raisins, vanilla; oily mouthfeel. Moderately sweet lasting malty finish with oily nutty notes and Port-like fruity notes. Absolutely aromatic and complex brew, which deserves all the hype. A great beer. 13.I.09",4.4

Flavor is sweet and spicy...alcohol is present but well hidden, and balanced nicely with the sweetness and bittness.

3542,Westvleteren 12,"My two brothers and I recently returned from a Beer tour in Belgium and, owing in large part to the high rating on this website as well as the enticing reviews, we made a stop at the Westvleteren Brewery the pinnacle of our journey. It did not disappoint! It is one of the few brews that falls into the category of a life-changing experience. We’ve chronicled our unique experience at the Abby, drinking in the In De Vrede cafe, and successfully navigating the complicated process of garnering a few cases to bring home on the following blog. Hopefully, it will provide a little help for any other beer-lovers out there who want to get their hands (and taste-buds) on this sacrosanct brew! Check it out at:

3543,Westvleteren 12,"Cool but not cold in a pint glass.  Pours a hazy dark brown/orange with a dense but small head.  The nose is awesome - intense chocolate, plum, cherry, roasted malt, chocolate, alcohol, and nutty tones.  The taste is intensely candy sugar sweet at first and mellows as it moves back until you get some dark bread, yeast, citrus, and floral tastes.  It finishes drier than you would predict and also has a thinner mouth feel than other quads.  Its a very nice beer but I think that the Trappistes Rochefort 10 has a better flavor (although this one has a better aroma).  I have not done a side by side and they have a lot in common - but the 10 has a better balance for me with a more refined malt character that does not overpower.",4.3

3546,Westvleteren 12,"330 ml bottle. From Westvleteren, Belgium.

Poured to Westvleteren glass. Murky reddish brown colour with small tan head. Yeast, dried dark fruits, raisins, plums, some sugar and sweet alcohol in quite moderate aroma. Sweet fruity, yeasty, winey, dark malty flavour with dried fruits, raisins, plums and bitter hops in rich and full flavour. Alcohol warmth but no taste of it. Short bitterish aftertaste that turns sweet. Pretty excellent for my RateBeer rating # 1 000.",4.5
3547,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to thirdeye11 for sharing this beer with me. This is beer No. 1,000 for me. I wanted to do something special but had no idea thirdeye11 was going to break out a bottle of this. Thanks a ton. 

Pours a medium brown with a beige head. The aroma is dark fruit along with some alcohol and caramel malt. The flavor is complex with brown sugar and dark fruit. This has a little more alcohol flavor than some quads but everything is nicely balanced. Medium mouthfeel and extremely drinkable.

Not sure if this is the best beer in the world, but there are certainly no flaws. Thanks again to thirdeye11.",4.5
3548,Westvleteren 12,Had this to end Beer Quest 2010. Amazing brew. Pours perfect brown with haze. Aroma of Raisins and Alcohol. Flavor hides alc. well. There is flavor of the raisins and malts. Delicious brew. great way to end it.,4.2
3549,Westvleteren 12,Bottle from 08. Hype? Maybe maybe not. Rich malty nice Belgian yeast and carbonation. Easy as hell to drink.  I’ve had it before an I’ll want/have it again. Yes this is pretty great.,4.5
3550,Westvleteren 12,"Opened and shared with a couple of friends. It’s a beer you have to share and talk about and we sat around the table for 20 minutes talking about the best beer in the world, what it is, subjectivity, what makes this beer the supposed number 1... for those reasons alone it’s a brilliant beer to drink, but for the flavour in my glass it isn’t the best beer in the world. And there isn’t a category for ’talkability’. Give it to me at the cafe opposite the brewery and I’ll see if it changes my mind.",3.5
3551,Westvleteren 12,"oh boy did i like this one! Don’t know where to start but i will start of, the colour is incredibly rich and dark, a little ruby like. The aroma is fantastic and can only remind you of where it came from, the craftsmanship gone in and is rich in caramel, coffee like hints and butterscotch is what i seem to find. Going on with the taste, which is very abundant and just as good as the aroma. Very smooth and still so full of spicey yet subtile dark flavours. A perfect example of appearance, taste and experience. Making an appointment at the st. sixtus abbey soon to pick up another stack!",4.9
3552,Westvleteren 12,"(New Year’s Eve tasting Flight (3 of 3 11:44p)) Westvleteren 12 - What a difference in head. While the Westy Blonde and Extra 8 poured huge heads that almost escaped the glass, this one poured a 1/4"" head of foam, which has now disappated to just a bubbly ring, visually like cola soda. Color of body is dark brown. Aroma of dark chocolate with some brown sugars. Also a smooth backbone of dark malts. No real hop aromatics at all. Very raisiny flavor. Full mouthfeel. Carbonation can also be felt in the mouth. Interestingly, of the three this one didn’t have any sediment in the bottle, while there was sludge on the bottom of the lighter beers.  Warming in the throat. Enjoyable, but not sure I would want to drink this as often as the Westy 8.",4.2
3553,Westvleteren 12,"Bright golden color with elegant rising columns of bubbles. White bread and corn syrup aromas, Leaner body and soft mouthfeel akin to a very sweet, and light bock with malt subtleties. Thank you local Ratebeerians for this taster Westy 12!",4.2
3554,Westvleteren 12,A huge Thanks to  fata for this wonderful beer.  I have been waiting for this for some time now and finally got my hands on one.   Lots of dried fruit in taste with bread and nuts.  very complex taste with good carbination.  Very earthy flovor. This is a truely a great beer.,4.3
3555,Westvleteren 12,"Dark brown pour with a full white head. Aroma is massive raisin, dates, booze, vanilla, bread, biscuit, vanilla lady lingers soaked in a rum raisin.  Flavor is on the sweet side with molasses and brown sugar comming through in spades.  A deep maltiness is ballanced with a light nuttiness and a heavy dose of booze.  Mouthfeel is creamy and wonderful.  Breathtaking.",4.7
3556,Westvleteren 12,"Another unbelievable birthday present from jblauvs; I’ve been looking for this beer since I first knew what good beer was. Pours an incredibly dark plum/brown with a super thick beige head. Aroma is out of this world- massive amounts of raisin, cherry, plum, date, almond, caramel, vanilla, and other dark fruits. Alcohol is beautifully manifested in sweet and bready concept, like a rum raisin flavor. Flavor is also extraordinary; dark fruit is abound, with lots of plum, molasses, caramel, and raisin, but there is also a beautiful note of sweet nuts, like almond paste. The alcohol mixes in and is definitely present, but doesn’t detract from the flavor in any way. The palate also conveys this complexity; the sweetness is thick on the tongue, but the booze adds a nice dry aspect as the flavor progresses into the later stages. This is the epitome of a quad; I am absolutely blown away. Top 3, maybe the best, of my beer tasting career so far. 

Second tasting 6/23/10 with sflpunk, side by side with Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12, and Konigshoeven Quad. Still amazing, but props to my fellow taster for noticing other good notes of leather and some bitterness that I missed the first time around.",4.7
3557,Westvleteren 12,"Massive thanks to jblauvs and fonefan. Pours extremely dark brown with a huge fluffy beige head. Aroma is bursting with amazing amounts and arrangements of dark fruit: Raisin, cherry, fig, date, grape, cranberry, plum, and port wine. Further malt character presents in the form of caramel, toffee, and molasses. Yeast character is bready biscuit dough. The malt character is some of the most complex and pronounced that I’ve ever smelled. Flavor explodes with sweet vinous molasses and caramel. Dates, plum, fig, and all sorts of grape... they’re delicious and I love ’em! Nearly every possible malt incarnation is covered. Booze is barely noticeable due to the gratuitous sweet malt profile, but adds another dimension of its own. Palate is amazingly rich, creamy, velvety, rich, and chewy. The finish, is warming, combining alcohol dryness with sugar smacking sweetness. I’m speechless.",4.6
3558,Westvleteren 12,Dark brown sugar; caramel and roasted malts. A very enticing drop. Poured from bottle to glass at home for Christmas. Caramel is very rich and aluring. There is a nice licerish touch and vanilla too. A fantastic ale but also a tad over-rated. I have had this fresh at the Cafe and at home aged a little. Enjoy.,4.3
3559,Westvleteren 12,"The infamous.  Thanks to a very generous friend who brought this back from Belgium (without even knowing what it was).  We were all pleasantly surprised.  Here we go.  Murky muddy brown color with a nice off-white lacing head.  Aroma and  flavor are dominated by dark fruits--plums and raisins--and candi sugar.  The alcohol is very well hidden.  Overall: a very solid beer, but certainly not MY #1.",3.9
3560,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle purchased from Bier Tempel in Bruges. Sampled following a Rochefort 10. High carbonation in bottle led to losing some beer on opening. Slight aroma of sherry, but little other noticeable aroma. Pours a murky dark brown with a thin white head. Pleasing flavour, although not as sweet as expected. Slight Acidic aftertaste, although all in all very pleasant. Possibly expecting slightly more (due to exceptionally high expectations), but overall a fine beer.",4.0
3561,Westvleteren 12,"Got two of these in a trade.  Thanks Brad!  Popped this open after my last exam of the semester.  Poured in trappist glass a murky brown with a pretty thin white head.  Immediately smacking you in the face is an aroma of dark fruits - grapes, figs, plums, and most of all, dates.  I didn’t get much malt  but there was definitely a bit of spices in there.  Taste was about the same.  Huge dark fruit explosion.  Dates were the prevailing fruit taste in the beer.  It was smooth and had a pretty dry finish.  The alcohol came through on the palate but not in a bad way.  What an awesome brew.  I wish I had a case of this.  Re-rated higher after a second tasting.",4.7
3562,Westvleteren 12,"33 cl bottle via trade with franksnbeans in August 2007 - Not sure how old this bottle is.  I can’t read the date on the cap.  Oh well, no biggie.  This has been hiding in the back of the frig for almost 2 years.  Pours a hazy brown color with a two finger thick fluffy light tan head.  A good dose of floaties too.  Shit!  I hate floaties!  Nice lacing.  Not much to the aroma.  Esters, light spice, and a hint of perfume.  Flavor is lightly sweetened fruity esters and light brown sugar.  The alcohol is notiveable in the finish.  Medium body.  What I like the about this beer is that it’s not yeasty like so many Belgian ales.  With that said, this beer is nowhere close to being a top 50 beer for me.  This beer is way over hyped.  I guess I need to try a fresh bottle.  Thanks Jacob.",3.8
3563,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle thanks Brett.  Pours cloudy brown with red hue and nice creamy lasting head.  Warm malt/alcohol aroma.  Complex spice, fruit, malt flavors.  Very nice.  Smooth dry finish.",4.6
3564,Westvleteren 12,"got a 2004 bottle of this and decided to drink it.  when first poured it poured with a purple color with no head.  smelled of grape juice, apple juice, apple vinegar and sweetness.  tastes caramel, grapes, yeast, spices, molasses,  and very good at hiding the alcohol flavor. very smooth.  first drink i didnt think it lived up to being number one but as i drank more i appreciated more and more.",4.4
3565,Westvleteren 12,"Finally got my hands on one of these.  Aroma is where its at with this beer.  Best I’ve ever smelled, or imagined smelling from a beer.  Complexity is the key with this puppy, it’s got cocoa, dark fruits like figs and dates, and carmel but none overpowers the other.  The scent of this beer will forever be ingrained in my brain.  Pours a nice dark brown with a thin head that swirls and lingers.  Taste is also extremely complex....glad I waited to get a number of beers under my belt before diving into this.  There is toffee, caramel, a bit of tobacco, a bit of dark fruits, an amazing yeast strain flavor and once again no one dominates the rest.  This is super smooth and nice to have in your mouth, an absolute pleasure to drink.  Stands on its own in the category, Roch 10 is comparable, but absolutely nothing like this at the same time.",4.6
3566,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle thanks to BelgianBeerGal - THANKS!! Aroma is dark fruit: kandi sugars, plum, figs and pluots. Definitely aroma of fig. Pours an opaque brown with moderate head that recedes.  A bit hot on the palate, which is surprising. Fairly sweet flavor, but not cloying, finishing on a dry note. I would definitely get this again.",4.6

3568,Westvleteren 12,"MY 1000TH RATING!

Location: 33 ml bottle from NickD717 via trade, 12/4/09 




Aroma: This one has quite the nose, really complex, its got lots of complex fruitiness (plum, apple, raisin), and lots of other stuff too, some caramel, chocolate, pepper, and alcohol.  I’d keep going but I think that gives the general gist.  


Appearance: The pour is a hazy brownish color with a slight red hue, just a couple of bubble around the edge of the glass (perhaps due to the bottle getting flattened)


Flavor: Taste is more then moderately sweet, a nice big flavorful beer for sure.  You can really feel all of those different components that make up the nose.


Palate: It’s hard for me to give a great judgment of the palate due to the beer being quite flat, but it does have a very nice mouthfeel and a semi-full body


Overall Impression: 
So the hype is here for sure, and I couldn’t help but save this one to be number 1000.  Thanks to Nick for hooking me up with this rare treat!  You were correct my friend, the bottle does appear to have gotten a little flat, but all the wonderful components seem to have survived.  When I opened this bottle, zero choirs began singing, my life didn’t change, and I didn’t find the meaning of life, but I did find one heck of a beer.  One of the more complex and enjoyable beverages I have ever had the privilege of enjoying.  Anyway, I’m excited this was the beer I used to mark off my 1000 rating on Ratebeer.com.",4.5
3569,Westvleteren 12,"what can i say..drank it young, drank it 1y old, 2y old, even 11y old, when its young its way too sticky sugary for me, but when age(after a year, it gets interesting) takes that away you have a very good beer. The myth due to lack of availability makes it a bit exagerated! I have to say, there are some beers that come damn close and can more easely be found..St Bernardus Abt for example..",4.7
3570,Westvleteren 12,"11.2 ounce bottle, brewed in 2009.  Pours mahogany, semi-cloudy, with a medium tan head that leaves only a little bit behind.  Awesome aroma of dark fruits (plum, date, raisin, fig), caramel, malts, spices, and faint alcohol.  The flavor lives up to the nose, with the same dark fruits, caramel, and malts, as well as mild spices, nuts, wood, and warming alcohol.  Medium bodied, really smooth, and alcohol is pretty subdued for being 10%.  It’s hard to find flaws in this one- maybe the body is thin for the style, and the color isn’t the most beautiful shade of mahogany.  But those are just tiny observations that mean virtually nothing compared to this beer as a whole.  I never thought this could live up to the hype, but it absolutely satisfied all expectations.  I can’t wait to visit the place someday and try some there.",4.4
3571,Westvleteren 12,"2004 bottle.  Thanks Jason and Julie from Brusin’ Ales!!!  Awesome aroma of sour green apple and figs.  Perfect dark amber color with a thin head that lingers and is balanced.  Nice medium mouthfeel, carbonation not overly noticiable.  Taste is awesome with a mellow apple taste and other complex flavors.  A very crisp beer for such a high abv.  In a word: awesome",4.5
3572,Westvleteren 12,"330ml Bottle:  Complex aroma of malts, nuts, slight raisins, slight dark ripe fruit, light yeast, slight wood, slight toffee, and the slightest hint of cocoa.  Poured brown in color with a tiny, tan head that lasted around the edges only.  Cloudy.  Very slightly sparkling.  Full of small and medium-sized particles throughout.  Complex flavor is lightly sweet and slightly bitter.  Tastes of malts, nuts, light toasting, wood, light yeast, slight raisin, slight cocoa, slight tobacco, and a hint of toffee.  Full body.  Viscous, coating texture is lightly dry.  Soft carbonation.  Malt, nut, wood, yeast and slight tobacco finish is lightly dry.  A real sipper.",4.1
3573,Westvleteren 12,"Deep brown body with an almond head. Strong nose, brown malt and vanilla. Complex in its own right. Malty, tones of vanilla, prunes. Sweet and delicious. Finishes as everything you’d imagine! Only mistake I made was following Imperial stouts with this so it mildly ruined the flavor for me....still a very good beer",4.0
3574,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from BelgianBeerGal - thanks Amy! So this was probably the first beer that I was almost nervous to drink. Ok, not nervous, but I was very aware that this is the holy grail of beers and I really wanted to do it justice. Because of the hype I wanted to make sure I didn’t overrate or underrate it--just drink it and give an honest opinion. Contrary to popular belief, angels didn’t sing and monks didn’t chant upon opening the bottle. I poured it into a Duvel tulip, and it formed a nice foamy tan head above a cloudy caramel brown pour. The nose was a little sharper than I expected (though it is 10.2%) with bready cherries and a bit of sharp booze. The taste, however, was fantastic, complex and lasting. It’s yeasty sweet bread on one sip, syrupy, caramel sweetness the next. Tried to pick out what I was tasting, but it was hard. Found some cinnamon, honey, faint chocolate, and some lingering yeasty breadiness after the sip was long down my throat. It’s smooth as hell, pretty chewy, and just coats the glass. There’s a touch of sharpness on the finish, but that doesn’t detract too much. While it wasn’t a religious experience, it was a fine beer that I’d love to lay down for a couple years.",4.2
3575,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled 0,33L. Bulky and incredibly creamy head, much resistant and long-lasting one. Black intense color, dense, impenetrable, solid, fraught aspect. In mouth it’s explosive. Extremely creamy and liquery with overbearing and intense alcoholic content. Much complex to describe. It introduces however optimal aromas of braced malt, wine, stum, roast caramel.",4.5
3576,Westvleteren 12,"A - Pours dark brown, a small amount of light peers through my Dogfish Head snifter. Small amount of off-white head that quickly disappears leaving a small amount of bubbles and a some around the glass. 

S - Smell is amazing...sweet candy, cherries, apples, plums, malt, burnt sugars. 

T - This beer is sweet, but not overly so. Lots of fruits, sugars, candy, all very balanced...for the taste, perfectly balanced and not overdone with a clean finish. 

M - Light (leaning towards medium) bodied, perfectly carbonated, and smooth. 

D- I am going to revisit this one as much as possible, but this beer is not something I’d consider going to a bunch. Every now and then will keep this one special.",4.2
3577,Westvleteren 12,"In de Vrede, Great looking brown beer with little foam. aroma is fantastic and rich. It is sweet, complex and hoppy.  It has taste of honey, caramel, sweet bread and hops. Fantastic beer.",4.7
3578,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a light caramel color but sits dark brown/opaque in the glass, settling into a small beige head with good lacing. 

The first thing to hit me from the aroma is spice... nutmeg, cinnamon, molasses, vanilla...then grains, a bit of a yeasty/bready note with subtle hits of raisin and cherry. Notes of leather.

In the mouth: bread, caramel, light cherry, finishing into darkchocolate/coffee, nuts. A perfect level of carbonation leaves the mouth warm and tingly. Not sweet, not bitter...excellent balance.

Finish goes on forever. The finish really sells this. It is seriously ridiculous, rivaling my favorite 99pt Sauternes.

Savor this.",4.8
3579,Westvleteren 12,"Rich looking Nectar, warm brown, with small beige head on top. Aroma is like heaven, Honey, caramel, rich sweet malts, dried raisins and soft hops.Taste is very refined with touches of milkbread, agorn sirup, soft malts, carameized bread crust, raisind and soft hops. A fantastic beer, or even better, I do agree that this one is ""The King of Beers"".",4.9
3580,Westvleteren 12,"My first beer rating! Thanks to bhops for a bottle he brought back from the original source himself. This is one of the beers that I assumed that I would not ever have a chance to try and I have chosen it deliberately for my first rating. 

The sweet maltiness of the initial nose gives way to a dry grain flavor that becomes the flavor of dates and currents (my wife identified the currents). The next taste is cherry hints and chocolate, and the finish remains dry and clean. This beer is true and complex, dynamic and a very happy experience. This is one of those food and drink experiences that make you realize what a wonderful thing human inventiveness and craft really is.

Thanks again to a Texas pug!",4.5

hope i can get some crates soon ; first buy three crates at ""the drive in"" , then head for ""de vrede"" , get wasted in a blessed fashion.
cheers god !
i hope they increase the brewing volume , so more beer fanatics can enjoy it.",5.0
3582,Westvleteren 12,"Appearance: A deep reddish brown color, nearly opaque. A nice looking beige head of about 3 cm with good retention leaves plenty of lacings.

Smell: A deep and rich smell. Plenty of fruity aromas (cherries, plums, overripe strawberries), raisins, wet wood. The malty backbone is thick and ""dark"" and is accompanied by a prominent spicy aroma. A hint of yeast. The alcohol is noticeable, but very integrated with the rest of the aromas. A great smell.

Taste: The taste is nothing but fantastic. A noble and rich malty backbone and semi-sweet cherries converge with a prominent, but not very strong, taste of alcohol. At this point, the beer is quite reminiscent of a fine liqueur. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Raisins adds another sweet component. Earthy yeast and spices balance the massive sweetness. Faint nutty aromas, and perhaps just a minimal hint of tartness. In the finish, the alcohol is very noticeable and has a sweet and warming character. But the alcohol is very well integrated and suits the beer nicely. The finish is slightly bitter with notes of spices, iron and grass.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a velvety smooth texture. The rather high level of carbonation is well suited for the overall character.

Drinkability: What to say about this legendary brew? Well, I think it’s almost as good as it’s reputation say it is. It’s just unbelievably tasty with an impressive complex character. This one comes really close to perfection.

Bottle poured into nose-able glasses, NYC studio, uber fantasy flutes raging in the background... 299 beers ago I was turned on to the art of the brew, the taste and feel, the appreciation, the hunt.  299 beers later I find myself with the most heavily hunted, highest rated in the world... and while no chorus of angels with golden harps began to play after the top was popped, I was once again reminded why we all appreciate beer... the beginning to end process of drinking great ale with friends. ""Near completely opaque, mahogany, dark syrup... nose smells of diesel, intense sugars and dark fruits.  The mouth is almost overwhelming... quickly fading carbonation... dry, weird... crude oil.  More dark fruits but with a faint brightness on the end... sticks to mouth, gums teeth!  Actually felt heat travel through my body... near empty glass: some grass.... last sip: pretty medicine like.""  The #1 beer in the world?

3584,Westvleteren 12,"Stefanje brought this gem to my house for the worlds smallest tasting.  Three guys and 4 bottles of beer.  Seriously big thank-yous for showing up with this.  Bottle code said 23.06 which we looked up and I believe it was a 2007 batch.  Cola brown with a tiny lace and tiny ring.  The nose was musty and sweet.  Sweet tea and cola or something.  Interestingly, although the head was tiny, carbonation fizzed on the side of the glass when tilted, and it was super fizzy carbonated in the mouth.  I don’t recall having that happen with any other beer.  The taste has the same effect as the nose, but with a lot more going on.  Sweet, to sharp bitter, then finally a pungent funkiness.  There was a strong taste I couldn’t quite pinpoint.  I was getting a sensory memory from my childhood or something.  Maybe mince pie?  I dunno what it was, but I liked it.",4.1
3585,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, courtesy of Garrett.  Thanks a million bud!  Drank this as a late birthday present to myself.  Color is murky mud brown, with a wispy head and average lacing.  Slightly red in the light.  Aroma is a buttery blend of raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, earth and red wine.  Mouthfeel is absolutely decadent:  smooth, creamy, lightly carbonated with a long soft finish.  Flavors slow dance across the palate, finishing with warming essence down the throat.  Lots of soft dark fruit, leather, nutty, wood and chocolate.  It is dark but comes off so smooth you think you were drinking a nectar of hazelnut-raspberry chocolate truffle.  At the same time, the flavors are balanced and earthy.  Incredible!  I can’t quite describe how well this medley is blended.  No alcohol present at all.  This is just such a mature beer.  It is, without a doubt, the purest and best example of Trappist brewing.",4.6

After 999 beers, each with a memory attached, I sat down with JRedmond and CUJO (which also hit 1,000 and 300 ratings, respectfully) to feast on this Divine ale… truly a blessed gift of the Trappist order.

Poured into delirium tremens glass.  Color is omni brown with plenty of haze, floaters, and slightly sudded off white head.  Nose is extremely musky with accents of green peppers, herbals, and fine leather.  Taste is peppery with some earth and wooded tones, coupled with both rich and dry malts, and leather.

Complex but well balanced flavour that contains all of the aromatics detected in the nose along with some coffee/mocha and hints of liquorice. The bitterness is assertive and contrapuntal to the warm alcohol and sweet molasses. Medium body, medium carbonation, sweet and slighty bitter finish.",4.0

Pours a rich mahogany with a densely packed khaki head. Nose is tons of crazy alcohol soaked dark fruits, cherry, yeast, and caramel. Flavor is just wild, with tons of yeast exuberance up front but big plum, raisin and cherry notes throughout. Caramel and toffee flavors battle. Light bitterness keeps the crazy sweetness in check. Like a fine port with its decadent intensity. This is a masterpiece of a beer but it is not the best I have had, deserving of the hype. This is truly one of the best the beer world has to offer.",4.4

Nose is complex, plums, yeastiness, a bit of spiciness and other dark candied fruit.  Palate is the brilliance for me, light, complex, different notes balanced so well.  Sometimes it feels a bit warm, nice small bubbled carbonation is understated, kind of a  tart feel on the tongue, gives way to sugary sweetness and thick cough syrupy feel.  Great, I can see why the buzz, but there are probably others as good.  (St. Bernardus)",4.6

 Unfiltered red-brown, no head.

 Malty yet complex aroma. Probably hop in the background. No alcohol in the aroma. Very pleasant.

Symphonic flavour. Really rolls through all areas of the tongue, finishing in a weak alcohol.

 Medium body, fizzy. Alcohol mouthwatering.

There was a small, thin quickly dissipating cream coloured head. It disappeared so quickly that I barely had time to note the quality of it. Sweet aroma of dark fruits, caramel, and alcohol. Flavour of black grapes, figs, raisins, cherries, plums and Sugar In The Raw. Flavour is warming and it has a thick yet smooth palate. The high alcohol content is well hidden.

3600,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #1000, 25th Current Beer God of Illinois: Nothing flashy, barrel aged, or over the top.. just a Classic. Bottle courtesy of BelgianBeerGal. Pours a very dark brown, opaque, some reddish auburn notes on the edges, but largely dark, with a fairly big tannish head that stays at a moderate level, laces pretty well. Aromas are a nice warming sweetness, caramel and toffee, a touch of toastiness, nuts, dried fruits, raisins, a touch of marmalade and candied fruit that contribute to the sweetness, Belgian yeasty spice, candy sugars, a touch of anise hidden underneath, a warming alcohol feel, biscuits, maybe a faint touch of cough syrup. Initial is lighter on the palate than expected, nothing overbearing or cloying, a nice sweetness and warming alcohol lightly dance on the back of the throat, caramel and toffee, Belgian candy sugars, raisins, prunes, cherry cough syrup, a touch of chocolate lingers underneath with a touch of anise and Nyquil. The yeasty spice is lighter than anticipated, instead taking on a more dominant fruitiness, medicinal quaiities. Warming, a touch of vanilla, this beer is more subtle as you move on, and the strength lies in the fact that there is nothing cloying about it, despite possibly being led to believe it would be so on aroma. I had a bit higher hopes for this, but it is still a top shelf beer, winning points for me for not being a cloying mess. Cheers.",3.9
3601,Westvleteren 12,"A very complex and wonderful nose of dough, plums, chocolate and alcohol. Taste is of nuts, raisins, dried fruit, yeast, sugars and marzipan. Finish is pretty alcoholic. Maybe I should have aged this a bit longer - sampled young this is a good abt, reminicent of the 8, but the alcohol and the marzipan takes over too much (much like the young quad from La Trappe). For now, I have to say that the 8 is better.",4.1
3602,Westvleteren 12,"Strong notes of biscuit, dates, prunes, and candied concord grapes ... there is also a strange spiciness that I cannot place.  Deep golden brown body with slight, eggshell head.  Nose is unveiled in the taste, but also brings fruity esters and that ephemeral phantom spiciness that is so intriguing.  Sublimely smooth and perfect for savoring.  Surely a fantastic brew, and undoubtedly one of the best quads out there.  Although the ’ghost-spice’ entices unequivocally, and in the understanding that I may induce grief amongst my brew-brethren ... I do believe I might have to prefer a St. Bernardus 12 for my ’go to’ quad.  True brew enthusiasts must try this one, it is a gem of the brewing art!",4.3

Aroma is dark fruits, dates and figs, with some very nice buttered toast and all kinds of sugars like honey, caramel, and brown sugar.  Flavor is initially buttery fresh croissants...you must be joking, right???   Also caramelized fruits and a nice slight spiciness.  Full bodied and smooth with soft carbonation, it melts in your mouth.  Didin’t think it would be as good as everybody says, I was wrong.",4.5

3611,Westvleteren 12,"Acquired this legendary beer on eBay. 
I cannot go into detail on just how great this brew is, as words do not seem to do it proper justice.

In my opinion it was simply awesome - in the original, undiluted sense of the word. It left me pondering which little details would refine a beer to this level, the myriads of processes behind its making, and its journey from the abbey to my apartment in Bergen, Norway. 

The Westvleteren 12 is so balanced and fine-tuned that a traditional dissecting analysis of its contents seems only to disenchant the entirety of the tasting experience. Thus, I can only describe it in the ways of an entity, a combination of flavor, aroma and palate so tightly interwoven that it seemed to represent a different tactile sense altogether. The only keyword that has stuck in my mind in hindsight is: honey. And I like honey a lot. Particularly when it seems to have been gathered on clouds by angelic bees, sifted with stardust and filtered through the Pearly Gates themselves.

Am I going over the top here? Indeed. But it feel sooo goood to find a beer worth doing it for. Much praise goes out to the monks of Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus; you do seem to have attained a closeness to the Divine after all.",5.0
3612,Westvleteren 12,"I am eternally indebted to Bhops for getting this one to me for my 1,000th rating!  Clouded brown pour with a SHITload of sediment. Actually some large chunks in this one. Poured this glass while watching Craig Ferguson to add to the awesomeness. Smells of the most perfect grapes. A nice thick scent that is fruity and sweet. Nice! Tastes of about the greatest Welch’s grape juice I have ever had. Not bitter but beautiful. Fair amount of raisins with a finish of satisfaction. There is not much more that can be better about this. Better than the Optimator and Bernardus 12, it’s fantastic!  Life is worth living again.",4.9
3613,Westvleteren 12,"A friend of mine gave me this beer when I visited him in France. As good as it was, I was not as enamored as most reviewers. First, the appearance was pedestrian--little head, no lace. Cloudy, brown color.

The smell is brown sugar, similar to candy. The flavor matches this except that there is notable hop. Not surprisingly, very strong warm alcohol flavor and feel. This is a thick beer with a low level of carbonation.",4.1
3614,Westvleteren 12,"(bottle) hazy deep ruby-amber colour with a frothy light-beige head. aroma of caramelized pale malts and bread dough, with some very faint notes of aged rum, fudge, milk chocolate and dried plums. flavour is mostly bread dough and sherry-soaked prunes, quite starchy, with more fudge, chocolate raisins and just a faint touch of alcohol in the semi-dry finish. full-bodied with lively carbonation.",4.3

3617,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle @ Volo, Toronto, ON: So excited to try this one - I’d planned on it being #1,000 but Volo made it much easier to obtain.  Aroma of boozy black cherry, dark chocolate, lemon, caramel. Flavour is cognac, black pepper, grass, chocolate, stone fruits, black cherries and lots of subtle hopping that comes out strong after the swallow. Mellows so nicely, and amazingly smooth to drink.  I can’t find anything wrong with it, just an exceptional beer.",4.6
3618,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, one month old, straight from the cellar. Pours a nice brown beer. Nose is not overwhelming, although nice and sweet aromas come trough. Rather small head. Taste is sweet with notes of caramel and chocolate and a nice warming after taste, yet not too overpowering.",4.4
3619,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled 5/21/200, true Westvleteren bottle with no label.  Sampled alongside the 8 and the Blonde.  Was so incredibly excited to taste the #1 beer in the world, I might have gotten my hopes up a bit.  While this is a very good beer, it’s not the best I’ve ever had -- in fact, I preferred the 8 even more!

Dark brown murky pour with light edges.  Thin cream-colored head fought hard to stay alive after a year-long journey from the brewery to the Midwest.  Lots of fruit in the nose, from bright green apples to dark plums and some fig, tons of a caramel, and a whiff of booze.  Flavor is incredibly sweet, with raw sugar overpowering the nice caramel and toffee undertones.  This sugary sweetness is absent from the 8 and made it a better beer in my eyes.",4.2
3620,Westvleteren 12,"Ok, finally I get to try this. Bottle picked up in a trade with the Beer Sommelier. Bottle doesn’t have the fancy label as the picture does. 2008 bottle. Nice fluffy head that appears to be fading away. The beer is nice and dark. Dark brown beer, that you can’t see through. Looks pretty good. Very nice dark fruit/candy aroma. Nice fruity smell. The alcohol is well hidden in the aroma. Nice pungent fruit aroma. Nice candy/fruit taste. Very smooth. The carbonation is not ridiculous; for this reason I give this beer a perfect palate score of 5. I am telling you one of the smoothest beers I have tried. Very nice dark fruit flavor. Fig taste with some yeast, and sugar sweetness. Very nice brew. I thought this beer might have been overrated, but I must say the score is quite in-line with its rating. Nice fruity beer with a DEEP flavor that just makes you go crazy. Again, very impressed, and just a powerful fruity beer.",4.3

3624,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle thanks to Vince, poured into a Trappist glass and served at cellar temperature. Cloudy brown with a tan head that fizzles away quickly to a small ring. The aroma is dried dark fruits, apple, wood and a wine like alcohol scent. The flavor is sweet with just a light bit of sourness, the alcohol is non-existent in the taste. The body is a bit lighter than I would have thought, probably medium to full. This beer is really nice on your palate, it’s soft and silky with a very mild carbonation. I am really glad I got a chance to try this and the only flaw in my mind is that the bottle is too small. Oh well, I’m sure I’ll get another chance to drink it.",4.4

Body is a little thinner than expected.  extremely smooth and drinkable for a 10% beer.  I could easily do a couple more of these.   Towards the end of the beer i pour in the sediment.  This brings forth some earthy bitterness and mineral notes.

The head is dense and tan, it sticks around the whole time.  Aroma of clean cocoa, licorice.  Initially I was a little let down with the taste, but as time went on things improved.  Tastes of deep caramel with a little mint or coriander at the end.  Nice long finish.  Tasted nest to St Bernardus Abt 12, and this was the clear winner.",4.6

3629,Westvleteren 12,"33cl bottle thanks to Jeffo and liamt07. best before 22.09.13

Appearance : Clear dark amber with big foamy off-white head. Some lacing.


Aroma : Big rich nutty notes with red fruits. Great belgian yeast. Light raisins, Light chocolate, light hops. Utterly complex and elegant. Light banana bread notes maybe.. first time I get this I think...


Palate : Carbonation is very fluffy and lively. Never agressive and gets smooth when you swallow.


Taste : Nutty and yeasty. Great fruity notes with light caramel. Finish is rather bitter with nice alcohol warmth. Finish is quite nutty with bitter hops, light chocolate, light caramel, lots of yeast. Brown sugar. Light raisins maybe. Light banana bread on finish.


Overall : Wow this is so complex and so elegant. Mouthfeel is perfect. I think head retention was slightly better on my last bottles. I really don’t think there’s another Belgian brown ale like this one. So complex, so mellow, so elegant. It’s my third bottle and I still think this is the best of the style. I really don’t think Rochefort 10 or St-Bernardus 12 is better than this. Rating stays the same... damn this is good.



Bottle from a random restaurant in Belgium and from Cafe in De Vrede. Pours deep mahogany with a creamy expresso like head. Great lacing and very long head retention. Aroma is red fruits, hints of nuts, raisins, vanilla, oak and dried prunes. Taste is a tiny bit bitter with a spicy ending. Hints of red fruits, vanilla, cherries, chocolate and some hops but really in the background only. Some nuts also. Finish is dry and sweet at the same time. Quite warm but not much considering the alcohol. The first few sips were a bit disappointing (considering its reputation) but it became really complex and delightful after. Carbonation is interesting. It is quite fuzzy with lots of small bubbles that tickles the back on the tongue. Very complex and balanced brew. Slightly better than Rochefort 10 and 8 to me.",4.7

Mouthfeel is deliciously chewy, with just the tickle of carbonation on the tongue. Finishes with the same dark fruitness, alcohol well hidden.

3646,Westvleteren 12,"OK - it’s been a bad enough night (tail end of a 17 hour day that has no end in sight) that I couldn’t resist opening my last Westy 12 to try and change the spirit of the evening. It was either given to me by JoeinUccle or purchased @ Bier Tempel Brussels  - didn’t mark them differently. Either way, Thanks, Joe. Have been lucky enough to have had a few of these since I started the RB path (lots of time in Holland and a trip to Belgium help that equation), not sure why i didn’t rate until now. 

Deep dark, dark brown with a mesmerizing tan head. Full of inviting little floaties. Aroma is really really telling that this is no ordinary beer - well accented raisns, figs, charred peaches and spices galore. 

Flavor is where the beer stands above. Mild, somehow dry (?), but with well-rounded elements of everything in the nose. Raisin and leathery fruit come to mind, and the flavor lingers on the finish. Each sip followed by a berath of air brings a little different take on the flavor spectrum, and not a bad note among them. This is just flat-out one of the most gloriously complex brews out there.

Neither bottle had any sediment in the bottom, I was surprised by that.  Deep dark brown, and a seemingly identical aroma as the 8.  Is something wrong with me?  The heavens aren’t parting.  Concord grape, cola nut, plum.  The beer’s not cold, maybe 50 degrees.  Some dark raisin, but nothing unique and nothing in the way of pinnacle.  And the sip.  Dark cherry, damp dust, raspberry syrup, and alcohol fuel.  I’ve had a few moments where a single beer has changed the way i look at beer as a whole and I was expecting this beer to do that again.  Fireworks.  It’s not fair to the monks.  But I really think that in a blind taste test I would feel the same way.  Nearly sticky, not as hot as the 8.  I’m so thrilled to finally be drinking this.  It’s a goal I didn’t know I had until I started goofing around on this great website.  Thanks to Ratebeer I’ve become aware of this beer and received a bottle from my Secret Santa.  I am forever grateful.  I want to thank Al Gore for creating the intertubes.",3.6
3649,Westvleteren 12,"Reviewed on 3/9/2009...

BBD is 12.02.11 (2/12/2011 for us Yanks). 33cl bottle into St. Bernie’s chalice. Out of fridge for about 10-15 minutes and breathing a few more minutes before pouring. I wanted to let it breathe a bit longer but I pop the cap and it’s happy to see me as it slowly froths above the top of the bottle so I pour a little bit into the chalice. The foam keeps coming so I get the rest in there.

The pour as mentioned is extremely well-carbonated and yields a slightly murky raisin brown. Active carbonation yields a 1/2-finger head in the chalice; it dissipates but leaves a wispy ginger-colored film resembling a solid Kosher rye.

Whoooaaa, camel...first impression is clove, ginger and rum raisin ice cream. The beautiful bride notices prunes and a bit of chocolate...she’s spot on. Prunes definitely abound; there’s a dark leather scent...even a bit of soapy plums. Very complex with a mild to moderate booziness that’s carrying ginger notes and aided by the solid carbonation.

I’m getting a little bit of floral soapy notes at first, followed by mild gingerbread, a little clove and then some raisins. It’s amazing what 5 more minutes of warmth does for this. The floral soap veneer thankfully burns away and we’re back in solid Quad ground. The leathery fruitcake spices, the deep dark dried plums, dates and chocolate covered cherries bring this another level of complexity. Surprisingly austere on the finish...much more dry than expected. As the BB indicated earlier, mild baking/bittersweet chocolate emerges with warmth. Prunes, too. Still, a tad of lingering floral soapiness.

For some reason I expected a big mild spice and raisin bomb. I’m really surprised at the pleasant dryness of this offering. The construction is so well-done that there’s not a lot of mess left behind. The excited carbonation may indicate that the yeast in this deal may have eaten everything they could wrap their cells around. Still, that floral soapiness still lingers.

Maybe it’s the thought of enjoying this for the very first time but this dows go down very quickly. It definitely takes a while for that one off-flavor - the floral soap - to burn off its weirdness. Note no real mention of booziness on the taste or palate profile - after the initial rum raisin ice cream scent it simply isn’t an issue. My guess is that I should probably invest in a case of this some day to evaluate over time because merely one bottle isn’t enough. With many extreme offerings the flavors and notions are in your face so that there’s no mistake. This treasure is definitely more subtle and takes a little more time to figure out. Great, complex construction.",4.4

And I must say that it is very good, but not one of the best things I have had, and definitely not worth the exorbitant prices some people are asking for it, or the #1 rating it gets in some polls. It could be that the bottle we had was a little dated, since it was from 5 years ago, but Adrian says there was nothing wrong with it.  Wonderful aroma of blossoms, plus some tang and malty sweetness.  The aroma was something special, and  the best thing about it, i.m.o.  Dark pour with a little foam.  Plain bottle.  The taste was surprisingly sweet, with a sugary, dried fruit flavor dominating, along with some cola, clove, and cinnamon.  There were some tingly hops in the finish, but this creamy, sweet ale was very much a dessert treat type of beverage.  Good, but overrated.

10.2% ABV 

This is my 400th review.  I tried this beer on June 25, 2009 at ’Cafe Volo’ in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Several Toronto beer bars have banded together to get several cases and sell it - and I grabbed the chance.  The beer poured an opaque dark brown with an off white head...not near as dark as the St. Bernardus or Rochefort quads.  The aroma knocked my socks off....fresh figs and plums, with warm yeast and sweet malt.  More than satisfying.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied, with mild carbonation - yet a bit thinner than other quads.  The flavour again was quite complex and full of flavours when compared to St. Bernardus, and didn’t have the alcohol taste and feel I get with the Rochefort.  The bitter aftertaste was even pleasant after the sweet malt and fruit tones.   On aroma and taste alone, this is the best beer I have ever had.  I’m knocking off points for appearance and mouthfeel as the beer was ’lighter’ than I was expecting.",4.8

Flavor: Sweet Belgian yeast flavor with a dried fruit.  This was very sweet in flavor.   

Palate: Dry Sweet finish, with a Good Mouthfeel.  

Overall: A Totally awesome Belgian Quad.",4.2
3658,Westvleteren 12,"It poured a dark liquid with some tones of red and brown. The foam was small and left no lacing. After a closer inspection I also noticed that there where some yeast in the liquid.

It had an aroma of chocolate and something fruity, some red berries and something else which I couldn’t distinguish. It was also spicey with some alcohol that was fairly well hidden.

The first sip was very fizzy. So fizzy in fact that I didn’t sense any flavor at all. After waiting a bit and let the fizzyness reside a bit I started to get a better grasp of the beer and it improved allot. The flavor had nuts, chocolate and red berries. It was not as intence as Westvleteren 8 a bit smoother but I actually prefered the roughness and spices in the 8.  It was all very round and well balanced with a warm alcoholic finish. 
Re-rated after a visit at the monestary",4.6
3659,Westvleteren 12,"Pours hazy brown amber with a thick off white head. Aroma is very malty with notes of bread, spices, and fruit. Very intriguing aroma. Flavor is more maltiness, with hints of chocolate and molasses. Complex with a good mouthfeel. Lives up to the hype.",4.4
3660,Westvleteren 12,"Another bottle from Ryan’s trip to Belgium, thanks.  Pours dark golden brown with a thick cream colored head.  Sweet apple aroma.  Tastes like a blend of fruit and spice.  It’s one of the best beers I’ve ever had.",4.7
3661,Westvleteren 12,"***review posted July 1, 2008***

Just found this review. Dated late June ’07.
Thx Brad for coughing up the dough for this... part of the Rochefort 10, Westy 12, St. B 12, Chimay Blue cellared blind tasting night.
In 2007 this bottle was aged apx 1.25 years in the Beerium as I had a purchace date of May 26, 2006.
Poured out a thick, cloudy dark brown with an incredible amount of fine and blobby sediment and a one finger thick tan cap. Excellent wide ropy lacing (it does disappear after awhile), retention at a thin surface cover. The aroma is awesome and never weakens throughout the tasting. A bit sweet, nice mild spice (main characteristic), slight caramel and dark fruit. Extremely well balanced but not overly complex. Touch of earth? The flavour is very well blended which has made it hard to distinguish standout tastes. Very soft yeast, absolutely no alcohol, mild mild plum, slight chocolate?, minor pepper, notable malt taste, slight peppermint / spearmint ??? I’ll correct myself as I’ve now noticed the alcohol. Man, this stuff is softer than fresh, supple kittens that have just learned to walk. A perfect amount of super soft carbonation, medium bodied. There is a back of the mouth bitterness that is very mild. The after taste is slight spice and a hint of alcohol. Excellence in a bottle.",4.6
3662,Westvleteren 12,"Small head. Wooden brown opaque beer. Creamy chocolate aroma with a fruity subtly alcoholic touch. Some hops and yeast and a creamy peachiness. Cherries too.
A bitter malty taste with subtle sweetness. Quite refreshing with a mellow, warm subtly alcoholic aftertaste. There are hints of all kinds of things in the beer, but it’s less subtle and well balanced than the Westvleteren 8",3.6
3663,Westvleteren 12,"Thx to Ralph at Volo. Didn’t take notes so this is from memory and won’t do it justice but if I don’t jot down notes when the hell will I have this one again. So here goes. Muddy brown with no head. Aroma hard to describe as it all blends so well. Raisin, toffee, honey, spicy, etc, etc. Flavour again hard to distinguish as it all goes together so well. As aroma indicates, toffee, raisin, honey, port. Sweet flavour explosion, tingles the cheeks and warms going down. Smooth as silk taste.",4.5
3664,Westvleteren 12,I love this beer...This is the perfect beer...complex and worth every bit of the hype..........................................................................................................................,5.0
3665,Westvleteren 12,"With thanks to a trade with Blutt59 for sending me this long sought after beer. Shared with HogTownHarry. Appearance: Thick dark, murky brown with a wispy brown head. Aroma: Too much going on! Caramel, spice, yeast, leather, rosehip, ginger, malt, alcohol, cinnamon yet somehow very muted and understated - like a torpedo, just tremendous. Flavour: Wow, spicy, malty, like a well worn leather jacket. Whiskey and woody, sticky & toffee. some spilled on my my fingers and they were sticking together. Just so much dark fruit, figs, xmas pudding, cherries, red wine, ginger again, tingling my tongue, long sticky finish, just tremendous! I can’t believe I’ve finally got the chance to have it. Thanks to Blutt59 and HogTownHarry for bringing me on this beer journey. Beer #1000",4.6
3666,Westvleteren 12,"Murky brown, deeply fruity ale has overlying rough & bucolic character. Very textural with surprisingly grippy palate from the assertive hop bitterness, almost grainy malts and a touch of alcohol. Underlying sweet silky deep fruit adds countering smoothness - and solid weight. LOTS of additions in this brew. So many flavors, wine fruit java-roast honey and spice. This beer is fairly big and makes itself FELT - in ways reminding me equally of barley wine and porto, but that doesn’t really say it. Acceptably tough and demanding, while also soothing - will need to enjoy more samples when I travel locally in the region. Much less smooth than St. Bernardus Abt, this (Feb 2008 bottle) Westvleteren Abt is no doubt as variable as Rochefort but experience will tell me more. A Kudos to Ralph M for my #600.",4.4
3667,Westvleteren 12,"Sampled many, many, times at the café across the street from the abbey. Drove up from Paris just to try it. I wasn’t disappointed - great aromas, great taste. Even 6 beers later I was tasting different things - coffee, chocolate...more? A complexity that’s amazing, the real disappointment is that it’s too hard to get. These guys should take a cue from Chimay and realize their lost revenue could really benefit the surrounding community.",4.8
3668,Westvleteren 12,a bottle of westvleteren doesn’t come with a label on the bottle and is normaly only sold at the brewery itself the stuff you can buy on the net there for is a lot of times fake beware of that before spending a lot of money,5.0
3669,Westvleteren 12,"Ok just finished my 1st Westy 12! Very similar to St. Bernardus 12, I know St. B. brewed Westvleteren up until 1996. Honestly the smell is what i really noticed at first and set it apart from the St. Bernadus. Very dark of course it is a quad with sediment. Flavor was fantastic cannot describe it really so many raisin, dark fruit flavors, cherry and others cannot describe in detail sorry. At first it was a bit too cold so there was a slight alcohol finish, but as it warmed no detection of any alcohol and just great feel overall while drinking. Overall a great ale id put it up against 1st in a blind taste test with a St. Bernardus 12 and i will. My recomendations drink it at a little below room temperature 70 degrees IMO.",4.7
3670,Westvleteren 12,"Was planning on ageing this for awhile but something inside just told me to drink it tonight during a nice summer thunder storm. Poured a smooth brown and settled into a darker shade of deep dark brown in the glass. The head was foamy and thick and held an almost indigo hue. As I polished off the pour, the sweet smell hit me...raisins and rum mostly. Tasting this behemoth was a stage-by-stage event that involved multiple phases and finishes. Stage 1: Lots of raisins on the taste buds, some alcohol presence felt as my whole tongue kinda tingled upon the first sips...felt really good. Finish was very rounded, slightly hoppy, and so smooth and balanced. Stage 2: As it warmed up, that alcohol became far more evident in the taste...almost canceling out all of the raisin aspects from before and introducing some kind of medicine-like feel...not unpleasant...but reminded me of vodka with it’s icy, somewhat metallic tone. At this point in time, the smell seemed sweeter and made me think of cotton candy and the finish had quite a burn to it. Stage 3; That burning sensation has tapered off a bit but still noticing mostly alcohol in the finish; although the balance remains stable. Stage 4: I’m thinking of port now, some smoke and a slightly toasted flavour that is difficult to pinpoint. Some fruity aspects coming out to me now also...apricot, apples, grapes. Stage 5: Coming near to the end of the glass now...sad to say. More of a distinct bitter sweetness coming through in the taste...brown sugar, cloves, spice, and cinnamon. But those elements are kind of attempting to cut through that thick hazy alcohol wall and not always making it. There is a sort of tar-like flavour that I am detecting along with orange peel and a burnt coffee zest. As I downed the final drop, it kind of sent a slight shiver through my body. The monks done good again. Bottom line: an interesting beer for sure, not sure how often I could truly drink these and seems like something I could enjoy more in the dead of winter...especially around Christmas/New Years Eve. Festive, complex, and comes across more like a Belgian Barleywine than anything else. So glad I could drink this. Will try and keep my patience and age the next one properly and compare.",4.3
3671,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle thanks to belguimbeergirl and daknole for telling her to send me a bottle rating # 400 and a very happy birthday to me pours  brown and hazy with meduim body,aromas are of licorice,figs.cherries and other dark friuts taste is tangy and smooth, with dark fruits a very hearty beer, is it #1 in the world only god knows",4.8
3672,Westvleteren 12,"Amazing off-white fluffy head and light brown colour.Smell is mostly toffee and the taste is coffee, alcohol and hundreds of other dark and fantastic flavours.  This is the second time I’ve had this famous beer, once In de Vrede and this time from the bottle, incredible both times.  In my opinion the only beer that comes close is Rocehfort 8.",4.7
3673,Westvleteren 12,"Yes it’s a great beer. The best in the world? Debateable. It serves as the holy grail and does its job well. Poured a magnificent auburn unfiltered ruby red. A sight to behold. Nose of raisins, alcohol, toffee etc. Taste was expressive. Lots of alcohol, port, sweet dark fruit and a little coffee. Mouthfeel was medium to full. Left a lasting impression of alcohol and cinammon in the mouth. Lots of yeasty sediment to this one. Glad to try it, now I can move on try a few more on my wishlist!",4.3
3674,Westvleteren 12,Line up the top 50 beers in the world and give me my choice and this is the one I would pick 99 times out of 100 (Rochefort 10 being the 1/100).  It just doesn’t get any better.  Too damn hard to find here at home but I spend a lot of time in the Netherlands and Belgium thankfully.   If you can find it buy it and enjoy one of the truly great luxuries of the world.,5.0
3675,Westvleteren 12,"Thank you God for this most amazing beer.  Smelled the alcohol first.  A rush of memory.  Grape?  Caramel.  Raisin.  Sufficient tingle on the tongue.

I did not drink a drop of alcohol for one year ane one day.  This wonderful beer, this gift, the Westvleteren Abt 12, was my re-entry into the world of beer.  My life, at twenty-six, is grand.

Grand!",5.0
3676,Westvleteren 12,"2008 Bottle at a tasting- Thanks Sam! - Pours a hazy dk brown with a tiny off white head...aroma is absurd, honey, dk fruit, malt, some cocoa spice...flavour is terrific as well, dense dough, spice, a nice burn...almost impossible to live up to that hype, but it was terrific!",4.2
3677,Westvleteren 12,"After a year in my fridge, after a few near misses with this rolling out of my fridge, after staring at it for hours on end it is time to crack the westy 12 that I picked up from e-bay for a ungodly price ( cue dramatic music ). Me and beercronic finally decided it was time to drink the westies, but first we put it up against the St. Bernardus Abt 12, Rochefort 10, and Chimay blue, in a blind tasting battle royal. But doing it blind made for some interesting results ( cue suspenseful music ). It turns out for me anyway that the westy came in daed last in this blind tasting, not to say it was a bad beer but compared to the rest especially the Rochefort 10 it fell short. But enough of this on the review. Beer poured a dark, dark brown and had a minimal head just a skiff floated on top, and when I got close to the bottom of the bottle feta cheese looking chunks where plopping down in to the lake of beer. Aroma was very tasty, earth, floral notes, toffee and some very noticeable alcohol, the alcohol fit in very nicely into the aroma giving it a pleasant warming quality. Taste was yummy warm and cozy, lots of dark toffee malts, nice floral notes, warm alcohol and a nice spicy presence. Banana became more aggressive in the taste the longer I drank what made the beer smoother and took some of the edge off the alc. This beer tasted way more simple then I ever imagined it would, not nearly as complex as the Rochefort 10 but still very interesting to drink. I don’t think this beer lived up to its legend that it has, don’t get me wrong this is still one of the best beers in the world but I do not believe it is the best. I’ll give that honor to Rochefort 10. On a side note to this story as me and beercronic where attempting to do this review I was cooking supper and forced into my bed room due to the insane Caribbean jerk chicken smell coming from the bbq, and then chased out of there into the hallway of my condo building when the three heads of garlic I was using to make homemade garlic bread started to melt are faces off. Aw good times had by all.",4.4
3678,Westvleteren 12,"As all Abt/Quadrupels, it should be served on cellar temperature (8-12°C / 46-54°F) to get the full taste of these beers.
Normally I only have the chance to drink this beer when I visit my homeland.
In Budapest I got the chance to drink one in the bar/ restaurant called ""Mosselen"" However the bottle came from the fridge and I asked to keep it for about 1/2 out of the fridge before serving.
For me, this beer is my all time favourite since more than 25 years.",5.0
3679,Westvleteren 12,"Poured a murky brown color with a large frothy light brown head. Large particles in the body and even some particles in the head.  Very complex beer with a wonderful mouth feel. Soft carbonation. Flavors of cinnamon, plum and brown sugar.",4.8
3680,Westvleteren 12,"Dark red colour with thin white head. Chocolate-blackcurrent aroma. Smooth well balanced mouth feel,tingly tounge,very warm.
Well deserved for being great beer.
A great wedding gift,sadly you only married once.",4.7
3681,Westvleteren 12,Bottle. Deep amber pour with a decent head. Dark fruit aroma and taste with a hint of chocolate/butterscotch. Very smooth and quite sweet. A nice one to end the day. Certainly an elegant beer but not the best beer in the world in my opinion.,4.0
3682,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Pours a deep brown, thin head with spotty lacing. Some serious solids going on here. Aromas of apple, cinnamon, raisin (Tim Hortons?), brandy and malt. Something sulphurous and vaguely unpleasant. Sour cherries, rooty-sasparilla character, hops, biscuit, seems unbalanced. Palate is sickly sweet, yeasty, apparent complexity marred by inappropriate sweetness. Dark caramel, spice, fig, pickels. Sweet sandwich pickles, the kind you get at funerals with the cheese and meat trays. Carbonation was lacking, hoped for more, Disappointing. 3.5

Re-rate with a fresher bottle. Pours clear brown with a medium off-white head, spotty lacing, skim is fairly persistent though carbonation is soft. Nose is soft and fruity, notes of rootbeer, anise, rye bread, very rich despite being simpler than I would have thought, considering the score. Flavors of burnt sugar, flat rootbeer, toffee, smoke, caramel covered raisins, soft special B, tasty and soft, but not in any way the best beer in the world. 3.9",3.7
3683,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle best by 2014.  Plenty of fruity notes in this batch as well but more emphasis on the dark malt and yeast character.  Palate is smooth, slightly chewy, quite robust but not overpowering.  Well balanced between the sweet and bitter.  I bumped up my palate and overall score.
8/4/9/5/17 [4.3/5]


Bottle at PPRBSG09.  Pours a dark murky brown with a thick white head.  Aroma is very fruity--lots of dark fruits (plum, apple, and fig) plus some honey.  Flavor is nice and fruity, with yeast notes and a rich malt base.  The palate sort of had a pulp-like quality to me.  Very nice and delicious!  I can’t wait to try this again.

3684,Westvleteren 12,"Tasted blind with savvy1982 vs Rochefort 10, Dieu du Ciel! Rigor mortis, and Chimay Blue. Big props to Savvy1982 for sharing!!! Pours dark brown almost orange. Small head that forms a ring around my trois pistols Trappist glass and then dissipates. Aroma is of sour cherries, green apple, brandy, cinnamon, and bready yeast. Tastes a little sour and very sweet. I get wood, tobacco, plums, brandy, sour cherries, yeast, white sugar and raisins. Palate leaves something to be desired, almost flat. Complex and enjoyable... But not fantastic or worthy of the high praise. When the reveal happened, I was a little sad that it was mt 3rd favorite of the tasting. Totally wanted more out of this one.",3.6
3685,Westvleteren 12,"Most complex beer I have had to date.  Flavors vary depending on temperature.  Plum, prune, brown sugar and cinnamon intermixed in the aroma and flavor.  Mild tinges of chocolate that balance the ripe fruit flavor nicely.   Lightly astringent on the flavor and a little heavy on the alcohol.  An excellent beer.",4.6
3686,Westvleteren 12,"pristine condition, cap said oct 08 as the brew or bottle date.  stunner of a nose.  best i’ve ever had.  warm it was very silky, satin, smooth ect ect.  great balance, acidity, woodsy.  super finish.  cooled down a bit more chocolate came out but the best milk chocolate you could ever imagine, with muddled fruits.  super finish.  could drink this all day every day.  lives up to the hype and the best beer i’ve ever had.",5.0
3687,Westvleteren 12,Truly awesome.  I picked up some at the abbey about 3 years ago and still break out a bottle for special occasions.,4.5
3688,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a huge tan head. The aroma is of fresh buttered bread, overripe fruits, and spices. The flavor is as complex as they come with roasted malt, brown sugar, overripe sweet fruit, spices and alchohol. Its truly amazing how cohesive this beer is considering its size and flavor profile. Its truly a masterpiece. So smooth and refined. It actually is pretty close to the 8, with a more intense flavor and a more noticeable alcohol content. I think this is why many people prefer the 8, but I don’t mind the alcohol. To be honest, I probably would have rated this a tad lower, but I already rated Rochefort 10 at 4.8, and I liked this better. Best beer I’ve ever had and truly worth the #1 spot.",4.9
3689,Westvleteren 12,"I didn’t believe the hype - I was wrong - Beautiful looking Brown beer. Mouthfeel was excellent, the heaviness matched the flavours exactly. Several different fruit flavours on show, raisins, possibly plum, something ever so slightly more tangy.",4.3
3690,Westvleteren 12,"At a tasting, thanks DSG. Small off white head with big bubbles that for a long time, clear intense dark amber colour, malty caramel aroma together with some light notes of dry fruits, flavour of caramel, demerera sugar and dark fruits, sweetness is mild and there is a touch of alcohol, big bodied but well balanced.",3.9
3691,Westvleteren 12,"Poured a nice head. Very classically styled quad in my opinion, not overdone like many american versions. Body was full, but still light enough to keep it drinkable. Right where it should be. Carbonation was medium high, also right where it should be. Taste has lots of cherry and other dark fruits, chocolate, and that nice slightly burnt raisin belgian malt character without any of that crappy brown sugar flavor. Plums? Finishes with dry chocolate. The chocolate is very nice-it’s chocolaty, but still shows its malt roots.",4.4
3692,Westvleteren 12,"A big special thanks to BeerandBlues2 for sharing this rare and wonderful brew with me.  Pours a deep dark golden brown with moderate carbonation that produced a small tight tan head.  Aroma is a fruity yeast scent with hints of caramel.  It starts with a hefty medium body that goes down with a fizzy smooth feel.  Finish is magnificent with lots of dried fruits (raisin and prune standing out), then a bit of a wine like feel and some fruity yeast on the end.  After taste has a hint of alcohol letting the wine texture come out a little more.  This is an amazing and complex brew, I understand why it is one of the top rated beer on ratebeer.",4.4
3693,Westvleteren 12,"THanks DSG for sharing this one, dark amber with nice off-white head, acidic aroma balanced by dry fruit, some nuts and some yeasty cheese, complex flavors of dry fruits and cherries, brandy alcohol spiced by clove, texture is quite silky, overall it is a very nicely balanced beer to sip but not my favorite.",4.0
3694,Westvleteren 12,"Brown with some redness pour with tan head. Dark fruit aroma and sweetness in the aroma. Tasted sweet on the lips, sherry flavor, some dryness, dark fuits(figs, raisons). Great mouthfeel. This too gets so much better as it warms up. Alcohol taste comes out a little at the end.",4.4
3695,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a brown with a creamy head. The aroma is mellow and nice with slight notes of roasted malt and a nice blend of dried fruit, caramel and a sniff of alcohol. the flavour is bready with clear notes of spec B, some vague notes of chocolate and a nice presence of fruit from the yeast. Ends a a little sweet.
Quite outstanding but not really up to the hype...",4.3
3696,Westvleteren 12,"All from memory, i think the bottle was 2+ years. Aroma was sweet, rich bread, floral alcohol with marshmallowy/floral/candy sweetness, prunes, cherries and figs; maybe faint vanilla and cocoa. The same in the flavor with more cocoa and vanilla. Palate was a dream, smooth and creamy, sweet and slightly thin. Unfortunately drinkable. Finish was lightly sticking with the sweet fruity, floral candy, bread and chocolate, and requisitly dry and alcoholic. Pretty damn awesome.",4.6
3697,Westvleteren 12,"From a bottle purchased in 2006, stored properly. Poured a nice mohagany brown with a decent sized coffee-and-cream head. Aromas typical of Quads: roasted malt, caramel, raisins. Mouthfeel was nice, with some biting alcohol notes, and some light flowery notes.",3.8
3698,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from padrefan98, thanks a million Jon for the number one rated beer on the planet. Pours a solid dark brown with lighter brown edges and some visible floaties but due to the darkness of the body they are only visible on the outer edges. Average size foamy white head that leaves a sheet of lace on the backside of my Ommegang gold rimmed chalice. Aroma is loaded with fruit notes, dark plums, banana, plum, prunes, raisins, vanilla, slight alcohol notes, dark sweet bread, and butter soaked brown sugar. Flavor is sweet with notes of fruit, especially raisin, plum, toffee, molassess, brown bread, alcohol, Flavor was close to a 10 but the alcohol on the backend was just a little to obvious. Super complex beer and very worthy of the hype. A perfect beer to celebrate the birth of my first child with so once again a big thanks to padrefan98.",4.5

The flavor is again very complex: malty, sweet, brown sugar, fruity (raisin, others), vanilla, spices, and some alcohol.

3718,Westvleteren 12,"Rating number 300 for me and 1001 one for 17thfloor, who I thank for sharing this treat with me and xnoxhatex! Pours a dark murky red brown color with a small white head. Aroma is so complex and wonderful, simply stunning. Nice spicy, fig, plums an orchard of fruits and spices all balanced by a load of rich but not overly sweet malts. Flavor starts rich with plum and sugary, but not a fake kind of sugar, high quality natural taste. Very floral and fruity and nutty. Finishes extremely smooth and refreshing with a perfect balance of sweet and slightly bitter. Very soft carbonation and a creamy mouth feel. Amazing stuff that is not overrated in the least. It’s like putting nature’s best into a bottle.",4.7
3719,Westvleteren 12,"Rating 1001, shared with xnoxhatex and funkybrewster.   This is my 4th tasting of this beer.  This beer easily has the most intoxicating aroma of any beer I’ve ever had next to Dirty Horse and Gale’s Prize Old Ale.  Deeply rich aromatic figs, dates, fatty nuts, intense plum, light brown sugar, ending a touch bitter, I could smell this beer for weeks.   Pours a slightly murky purple amber that I remember being much darker in Belgium, very fine thin white froth on top.  This beer is pretty amazing, dark and bitter yet sweet and very easy to drink.  Tastes of bitter fruit skins, sweet molasses and very nutty, vaguely burnt brown sugar, noticeable yeastiness, plums.   Medium bodied with a medium/full mouthful, much softer carbonation than the fresh bottles I had in Belgium.  Yum.  Candied figs with great bitterness.  10.4.10.4.19 4/14/09.  [rerate of beer from February 2009]  not sure how I like these with age, really seems to lose it’s distinctiveness from the other trappists.  Becomes a very rich sweet cola like beverage.  Like a liquid milk dud.",4.7
3720,Westvleteren 12,"Source:  11.2 oz bottle in a trade.
Appearance:  Poured a murky brown color with a half finger of off white head.  Spotty lacing.
Aroma:  Dark fruits(raisins, dates, figs and plums) with brown sugar and a hint of cocoa.
Flavor: Caramel and dark fruit dominant, but hints of vanilla and rum.  Very sweet overall. 
Palate:  Medium/full body with soft carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel.
Overall:  I don’t buy into the hype.  A very good beer, but better than Roch 10?  Probably not.  Glad I got to try this one.",4.6
3721,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #440 and shared with my wife on our 1st year wedding anniversary. I don’t think I could have picked a better brew to celebrate with. Pours a very dark and murky brown color with a frothy, cream colored head on top. Swirls of lacing are left behind as the foam recedes. The aroma is very enticing and shows hints of caramel soaked raisins, figs, and plums along with notes of cocoa, vanilla, and cream. The flavor follows with the caramel and dark fruits up front, but are then complimented perfectly by the raisins, vanilla, and rum flavors. The alcohol is slightly noticeable with a sweet warming on the back end. Medium to full bodied with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel that feels like heaven on the tongue. The sweet and warming finish lingers on for awhile and just begs for you to sip and savor this one. A fantastic beer that lives up to its high rating, and one we both enjoyed very much.",4.6

I kept it on my tongue and rolled it around. The mouthfeel is luscious with a perfect balance of carbonation and dryness. I haven’t felt that since say St Benardus 12.

S: I don’t know that I can describe it in words so I will keep it simple Yum! Dark fruits and Molasses with a slight burn of alcohol. I found my self sniffing the bottle as I consumed it. 

T: In one word Complex. There is so much going on here yet it seems to be so minimal. Fruit, Dark candied sugar, and earth all compete with each other to come to the forefront. None are too forward though, they are meshed together in such a perfect way. This beer is like the most wonderufl Port Wine I have ever dreamed of consuming. All of this despite the fact that you would never know this tips the charts at over 10% APV May God Bless the Monks of Westvleteren. 

M: As a quad you would expect a full bodied brew, and this lives up to that. If does not stop there though. It has a certain richness to it, creamyness, its chewy but balanced. 

D: Let’s be real. This is to be consumed one Chalice at a time. Cost and rareness of this beer make it a real treat to consume. This beer is so much about experience that you would never want to devalue that by having 2 in a row. That being said the beer is heavenly.",4.7
3728,Westvleteren 12,"3/27/09. Pours a foamy, creamy tan head.  Murky brown color w/ red tinge.  Sweet malts on the nose with notes of cherries.  Extremely rich and complex taste...so many layers.  Malt, dark fruits & caramel dominate at first and then fades to an herbal hoppiness.  Is it the best???  Certainly one of the best.  The finish was a little too astringent for my taste but all in all, an excellent Quad.  I have a second bottle that I will cellar for a while and will re-rate at a later date.

3739,Westvleteren 12,"Bought July 07 @ the Bier Tempel in Brussels. First time trying this for me too. Pours not quite clear dark mahogany brown, quite lovely foaming medium khaki head, settles to a covering layer. Aroma - dark fruits, dark malts, some earthy viney notes, muscovado and cherry too? Flavor - initial kick of strong alcohol notes. Full-bodied, dark fruits, cookie or cookie dough. Very creamy smooth palate. Final impression of bitter nuts and alcohol, yeast. This beer is not boozy or overly alcoholic, but it adds noticeably to the body.


For my notes, this tastes very very similar to st bernardus 12 maybe minus some of the cola / dr. pepper tones, so i dont see where people get off saying this is way better. This is also so smooth and straight edged that if I remember, the Rocheforts seemed more interesting at the time. But that’s impossible to say for sure without a side by side comparison.",3.9

3743,Westvleteren 12,"2/11/2009:  Virgin experience with the #1 beer...  Westvleteren 12 has a cloudy caramelized colr with a foamy biege head.  The aroma is somewhat fruity (cooked apple) and dry with a sweet, but not over-powering maltiness (not really caramel or toffee).  To be honest, the aroma leads me to believe that this bottle is slightly oxidized, but that might be okay...  Interesting.  The flavor is both dry, but sweet and both fruity (raisin, date?) and moderately malty.  Interesting sugary flavors, berry-like, and moderately malty.  There is an interesting spicy quality in the finish that is similar to that of a Pils.  Sightly dry finish.  The alcohol is there, but is not overly obvious.  The body is medium-light, with a medium to high level of carbonation.  This is good, but I think I am lacking the necessary palate to truly enjoy this beer...

In a strange reversal, I was discreetly sipping it, keeping it out of view of staff, while others around me, were openly smoking weed.
So, in those unusual surroundings, I poured myself a glass. It is dark and thick. It’s flavour is immense. Very complicated. It goes one way, then another, then another, as it slips down your throat, all good. It’s hard to describe the flavour. The closest thing I could think of was jagermeister. Although, that doesn’t do this beer justice. If you can get hold of it, I highly recommend it.",4.8

The nose is pretty damn imressive. There are some fruit notes, dates, plums and a nice chocolately character. The taste is very impressive as well. The malty chocolate notes are the first thing that takes my taste buds on a ride along with some of the deep fruit notes I got in the aroma as well. The carbonation is rather full and overall makes for a full bodied beer. I could not say for sure whether this is the best beer in the world but it is a pretty damn good beer and well worth a try if you can get it for a reasonable price.",4.7

Pours this deep beautiful mahogany- bright and translucent with a huge vanilla coloured head. Taste is amazing with a creamy, raisiny mouthfeel. Rich caramel notes. Plentiful flavours of toffee, fig and bountiful nuttiness. A truly amazing beer. The mysticism behind obviously plays a little part in the experience.

3766,Westvleteren 12,"I waited a lot of time for this and I found it in the beautiful Brugges...
Appearance: Dark brown color. Great head, beige, rocky, with good adherence at glass and very lasting.
Aroma: complex-ripe fruity aroma, several fruits in my nose like, plums, cherries, prunes, figs..... Underlying caramel notes, vinous and with reminiscences of tart and marmalade.
Flavor: vinous profile and caramel malts in the start, that vinous touch never disappear and remember me a carmenere and, perhaps, a sweet rose. The fruitiness is even more complex that in the nose with the same reminiscences as well of cassis, blackberries and semi-fermented red apples. Woody touches and a very slight hot note similar to chocolaty tobacco. A lot of secondary notes like marmalade, roasted sugar, vanilla and lightly is possible to feel the hops given even more balance.
Palate: medium to full body; semi-oily and silky texture. Low carbonation.
Remark: this is a excellent beer with a lot of attributes and complexity, but in spite of that complexity and variety of flavors is incredible its balance, in fact for me four adjectives resume the Westy12: ""noble, harmonious, very balanced and elegant"".",4.5

I drank part of the bottle side by side with a St Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10.  This was definitely the best of the three.  The St B was much lighter than the other two.

An immediate rich, bready aroma wafts from my glass as I pour this beer.  This beer is topped by a light brown head that sits atop a brown beer.  There are notes of sherry, plum, and raisin (though the raisin is definitely the most dominant aroma) in the nose.  The beer smells sweet & rich as well.  Well the taste is fairly rich & sweet; there is lots of fig and plum notes, which are joined by a woodiness that is in the taste as well.  This beer was an awesome way to finish my great dinner at the Hop Leaf.  There is an astringent complexity to this beer that just brings it to a whole other level, and there is a slightly musty character that integrates well with the rest of the flavors.  I can fully understand why many consider this a world class beer.  I really like how this beer is quite fruity in both the aroma and in the taste.  The alcohol is very well hidden here, I can’t really detect it at all.  The rich sweetness is very conducive to being an after dinner drink.  This beer is like a rich, dark, sweet traditional German bread.  What makes this beer so good is that it is extremely well integrated; absolutely world class.

A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, creamy, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated amber color that when held up to the light shows that I poured quite a bit of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle into my glass, but is also a hazy, bright cherry color.  The aroma smells of spices and fruit with a rich, caramelized maltiness to the finish.  Aromas of fig cake, brandy soaked fruit cake, some marzipan, clove, dried cherries, white pepper, candied ginger form the bright aromatic notes.  There is a nice backbone here of must and damp earth, as well as some toasted malt character that provides a biscuit malt aromatics.  Some higher alcohols provide a bit of spiciness as well as some warming character to the tail end of each draught of the nose.  This has quite a rich nose to it, both the fruit and spices accentuate the perceived sweetness of the aroma.



Up front this beer is a bit lighter than I expected, as it rolls across my tongue though it starts to pick up a viscous richness and heft, though it still maintains the drinkability that I like to have in a strong Belgian ale.  The beer has a definite sweetness (though not as much as the aroma might have suggested), but finishes with a spiciness that helps to dry the palate out.  The beer is a bit carbonated still after the vigorous pour and it provides a prickly carbonation as it rolls across the tongue.  fruit notes of prunes, musty figs and raisin are brought out by a touch of tartness as well as the sweetness in this beer.  There is a definite mustiness to this beer, it is oxidation character that it has picked up over the years, and it mixes nicely with the spiciness in the finish.  Speaking of which, the spiciness provides notes similar to white pepper, clove, a nutmeg like bite, some woody ginger and a touch of menthol in the long finish as well as some bitter cocoa.  This definitely gets more complex as it warms up from the high 40°F (~8°C) that it started out at.  The alcohol in the finish combines with the fruitiness to reminds me of Brandy.



Well I had a bug dive bomb this beer, so it must have though there was something worth drinking in my glass (one of my dogs got a tasty, Westy soaked morsel because of that).  While this beer is quite good, I am quite disappointed in some ways.  I haven’t had this in a couple years, and I am thinking I need to try a fresher version to see if it is more like my memory of having this in Belgium and at the Hop Leaf (where I had it last).",4.7

3775,Westvleteren 12,"Glad I poured this one slow, as in the middle of a slow pour I got a GIANT plop as a big plug of sediment fell in the beer, even though I was careful. I was very concerned I had ruined it as it looked ghastly with floaties everywhere, but when they setlled.....wow. Just beautiful. Aroma of overripe fruits, english toffee, and yeast. Flavor is sweet, with a nice bitter hop  profile, and one of the best finishes I’ve ever had. After the horrible pour, I was over the hype and expected disappointment, but this delivered and then some.",4.5
3776,Westvleteren 12,"14 months old bottle, balancing my rating #666 with her holiness. Almost opaque dark ruby, lasting creamy beige head. A bit restrained, sweet roasty nose with dark candi sugar, herbs, clove, little milk chocolate and earth. Superbly balanced flavor, roasted maltiness, strong sweet liquorice, cocoa, pretty intensive herbs. Sweet lingering sugary finish with some earth, more sweet chocolate, moderate balancing hops and faint alcoho. Full bodied, lush and extremely smooth palate. Amazing sweet nightcap, probably gaining loads of complexity with age, as there’s still so much sugar to burn.",4.3
3777,Westvleteren 12,"One of the best trappists around, I have a hidden stash of Westvleteren dating back from the mid seventies. I just drank a 1999 bottle and thought I died and went to heaven. This beer makes you consider celibacy.",4.7
3778,Westvleteren 12,"Best of the Trappists. World of wonder in your mouth. Requires multiple tastings to discover all that’s inside. Best beer in the world? Probably not, but very close. Picked up a batch at the brewery, looking forward to how this beer will evolve in my cellar.",4.4
3779,Westvleteren 12,"This 22-1-2008 brewn batch beer, personally retrieved from brewery, was a feast to get, to keep in stock for one year and to drink eventually. It poored a fine head with a bit of brown yeasty slur. That slur ruined my drink. It gave the head and a awful taste. I have to rely on my impressions of earlier consumed examples of this outstanding beer. It is less pronounced and sweet as the Rochefort 10. Has more bitters. Its no showof but more contemplative of nature. Tip for pouring, keep sludge absolutely out of the poured drink. Two more years of evolution are awaited with joy.",4.3
3780,Westvleteren 12,"Trappist beers are always a treat, and this is no exception. Pours dark brown with frothy beige head. Nose is citrus, vanilla, coffee, very complex. Flavor is just as complex, exquisitely balanced fruits, hops, nuts, a bit of spice. Perfection in a bottle.",5.0
3781,Westvleteren 12,"Many Thanks to HopTilUDrop for this rare treat! Deep brown and cloudy with a beige head. Aroma of pepper and pine and maybe of fresh aromatic bread with vanilla notes. Wonderful creamy/buttery mouth, very soft on the tongue while unleashing a bitter as well. Really well balanced and complex More pine and air of a mountain stream. Later slight orange with a strong element fo tea of all things. This beer never displayed ony cloying soapiness and kept my interest throughout. Well worth any effort.",4.6
3782,Westvleteren 12,"After the primarily overripe banana flavor of Rochefort, and the many comparisons I’ve heard between it and Westvleteren 12, I wasn’t sure what to expect--a distant relative, a first cousin, or a twin. After my tasting, I think only a fairly young and unrefined beer-tasting palate would judge RF10 and WV12 identical--each hit my mouth with very different flavors. Met some nice fellow Americans in Belgium at the abbey today picking up their orders around 3PM; wish we could’ve hung out. Exclusive rep of the beer didn’t mean much to me compared to the simple friendliness of the seller and overall good spirit around the Vleteren area, but I think the rep is absolutely deserved. Nose is similar to Kasteel bruin, and both beers are sweet, but the flavor of Westvleteren is oh so much riper and deeper than nearly any beer I’ve had... leather, vanilla, burnt caramel, licorice, slight butter, faint coffee, soft cinnamon spice and figs and apricot, with some smoky oak. I could swear I even taste a hint of caramelized witloof, that bizarre and wild acquired-taste vegetable which is the signature of Belgium. (Discounting brussel sprouts, which I really can’t stand.) Mouthfeel is marvelous; so velvety and rich that it’s like butterscotchy liquid angora. The dark anise aftertaste is almost not bitter at all, yet it dances a waltz with your tongue long after you’re finished. The moment my glass was empty I was dying for another. The only other beer I can think of that’s as complex as this is the far more bitter Storm King Stout, from Victory. So what is the best beer in the world? You’ll really have to try all the best-rated ones to answer the question of what suits your personal preferences the best, but Westvleteren 12 is truly marvelous, and definitely worth the test if you can get your hands on it. On further testing, I found this beer appeals even more. I can’t think of how to improve on it--I don’t know if it’s possible to ask more of a beverage.",5.0

Pours deep brown with a moderate creamy head.  Slight carbonation.  Very very smooth indeed, tastes of sweet raisins and dates and figs and muscovado sugar and sweet malt, but with a well balanced bitterness.  You don’t taste the alcohol, and unlike many strong beers, it’s not syrupy - although it’s certainly quite thick!  A very, very good beer that’s easier to drink than the ABV would suggest, and beats its rivals Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus 12 hands down.",4.3
3786,Westvleteren 12,"Holy thanks to bitbucket for this glorious beer to end our Trappist beer tasting!

Pours a very nice dark ruby brown with lasting creamy off white head and excellent lacing.  The aroma is gloriously complex, with notes of molasses, caramel, hay, straw, cereal, chocolate, wine, earth, sour dough, raisins, prunes, dates, tobacco, espresso, and jasmine.  The flavor is similar, though a bit less complex than the aroma, with many of the same complex flavors coming through.  The mouthfeel is very nice, medium thick, but creamy and warming.  Overall, this beer lives up to the hype, and is holy and beautiful, but is not my favorite style.",4.6
3787,Westvleteren 12,"Dégusté le 3 décembre 2006 avec french tickler lors de sa 100e bière sur ratebeer. Sur des chants grégoriens de CARL ORFF, ERA et EMMA SHAPPLIN nous profitions d’un moment exeptionnel de plénitude. Du vieillissement en cave de plus de 6 ans au service dans un verre trappistte de chimay et à la température d’une cave de 14 degré, tout avait été mis en oeuvre pour exploiter au maximum cette denrée rare. L’ors du décapsulage il y était inscrit meilleur avant le 07/09/04 avec un pourcentage d’alcool de 10,6%. Depuis ce moment, l’objet de convoitisent: (le yellow cap) fait parti de mon porte bonheur. Pour débuter l’apparence de cette bière est dans l’ensemble déjà impressionnante avec une séparation bien marqué de deux produits distincts: La bière de couleur brune orangé rougeâtre et d’un dépôt acqueux brun foncé ambré. Une fois les deux liquides mélangés, je n’ai pas besoin de vous dire la sensation déjà installée, elle nous promettait de l’exception! En débutant avec l’arôme nous en sommes venu à un concensus assez rapide; elle dévoillait continuellemment de nouvellent saveurs. En plus de la musique choisis pour ce moment, notre âme était ailleurs, nous ne pouvions plus se permettre d’évaluer cette bière. Nous nous sentions imputables d’entraver le respect que nous donnais cette fontaine de jouvence. De la bienséance était désormait obligatoire car nous étions certains à ce moment qu’elle était la meilleur bière au monde. Un simple regard suffit au moment de joindre à nos lèvres se divin liquide pour comprendre que le silence était requis; La seul personne autorisé à communiqué avec nous était monsieur westy........Cette boisson est beaucoup plus qu’une bière elle est l’expression d’un symbole pour tous un peuples. Comparativement au vin ou aux spiritueux, il n’est pas question de prix mais de passience et mérite.

It absolutely lived up to my expectations.  Poured a deep rich brown with beautiful light tan lacing.  Definately one of the smoothest Belg. Quads I’ve ever had.  Hardly notice the copious amounts of alcohol.  Definately worth the 10 euros/bottle I had to pay the guy for it.",4.7

Aroma of brown sugar, dark fruit, candy, perhaps chocolate. Mouthfeel initially a bit fizzy, this dissipates in later samples. Fairly soft. Nice weepy rings of lacing. Flavor of sweet dark fruit, perhaps dates, light brown sugar and chocolate. Chocolate becomes a bit more prominent as it warms. Alcohol wamth emerges towards finish and makes it slightly hot. Very similar overall to Rochefort 10. I enjoyed it but like with Rochefort I was expecting a little more.",4.2
3790,Westvleteren 12,"Blank bottle with gold Westy 12 cap. Pours a cloudy opaque brown with sediment swirling about within. Little head on this one, but that could’ve been due to my pouring technique. The foam that does exist smells wonderful, of dark fruit, molasses, brandy and more. Pretty much smells like St. Bernardus. Flavor is sharp; Smoky, woody, boozy, not at all sweet or fruity however. Did I mention boozy?: It seems to have a very agressive hard liquor-like body. Overall, this isn’t the best thing I’ve ever had. Though very good, I prefer St. Bernardus, and Rochefort for that matter, in this style.  Don’t get me wrong, this is excellent. I was just expecting more, considering the reputation. My final thought is that I don’t think this beer would have nearly as high an average rating if it weren’t for its exclusivity (and hype).",4.0

HUGE thanks to Bobby91w for including this as an extra - I couldn’t be happier. Pours a murky deep brown, with a smaller head than its SB brother, but it’s still really thick. Dark fruits abound - figs and dates - with a lot of brown sugar, caramel - even a bit of fresh (not roasted) hazelnuts. Very sweet, but my God there’s a lot to it. The palate is perfect - just enough carbonation to keep it clean, but the flavor lingers forever, and this is so delicious that I think I uttered ""wow"" after every sip. Aside from the looks (I thought it would be a bit darker), this is absolute perfection. I’m truly not sure I could enjoy a beer more.",4.7

Aromas of dark fruits, plums, dates, raisins, some yeast and slight alcohol burn.  Flavors are spicy, yeasty, dark fruits.  Rich.  Very long finish.

hazy auburn brown pour with a monstrous tan head. cinnamon cream colored yeast hits last and creates little designs in the fluff.

very vinous aroma changes every time i go back for another sniff... white wine, brown sugar, milk chocolate, malt powder and vanilla all show up. 

the palate is quite spicy and has a ton of yeasty bitterness... earthy, woody, real maple syrup, concentrated malt powder and lots of chocolate chip cookie dough flavors. pleasant perfume before the dry spicy finish. it*s only mildly sweet though dry at the same time. medium body seems a bit thin considering how much is going on, the abv% and how NOT sweet it is. creamy texture is rich in the mouth but not heavy.

i really enjoy the balance, alcohol and complexity yet the sugar level is kept low making it crazy easy to drink and enjoy. sure it smells alright and tastes ok... but it*s the whole package that makes it great! now i*m ranting and at a loss for words...

Blind tasting (alongside St. Bernardus Abt, Rochefort 8 and 10, and Chimay Blue)

Deep reddy brown, creamy beige head. Grainy aroma, not as sweet as other dark trappists. Maybe it is even dry and a little woody. Soft carbonation, velvetty in the mouth. Some warming alcohol. Almondy bent, and the bitterness appears to come from the almonds. Some graininess and almost huskiness in the body, and liquorice too. Lovely hops in the finish. Adding the yeast, the liquorice builds, and over time the lovely buddy hops come over more.

3.9, but came equal 4th (with St. Bernardus Abt) out of the 5. Yes, this is a fantastic beer, but looking at most peoples comments, their numbers are complete bull inflated purely by the rarity of the brew, and by the fact that they already know in advance what the beer is.

Rerate: 330ml bottle - shared by Kairi, a million thanks! BB 2017-09-17 (8:4:7+:4:15=3.8+)

Woh, super almondy cherry, but also porridgy aroma. Very mellow palate. Looked great obviously. Lovely sweet malty body, tons of almond, Wonderful bitter finish, love those hops. Hooray for old-world hops. Damn, this is good. Love the nuttiness. But this would really benefit from ageing.

It is a great beer, none the less, I would not give it the credit of being the end all be all of all Trappist beers. However, it does deserve a high spot on the podium of wonderfully crafted beers.
Pours dark brownish with white head.

3825,Westvleteren 12,"330 cl bottle shared with my brother, Buffalohead, and my nephew on 11/2/2008. Deep, faintly hazy ruby/brown body under a spectacular, large, creamy tan head with amazing durability, and leaving sheets and strings of sticky lace.  Aroma of dark fruits, dates, figs, and raisins. A complex vinous character with hints of spice adds even more depth. Medium to full body and medium carbonation, slightly syrupy, but rich and creamy, lingering pleasantly on the palate. Flavor reflects the vinous aroma with dark fruity sweetness dominating. A very gentle spicy bitterness arrives late in the game, but still balances well. I had been saving this for over a year to drink for #1000, and I was afraid I might be disappointed, given all the hype. This is a phenomenal beer, richly deserving of its reputation.",4.7
3826,Westvleteren 12,Bottle at home with  a like minded friend. Brown with light tan head. Complex alcoholic aroma. Multilayered flavours that keep developing as the glass empties. A bit sweet for me but I would love to try more.,3.9
3827,Westvleteren 12,My second favorite beer of all.  Very much like the Extra 8 but a little sharper.  Tastes of figs and toffee.  Dark brown color with decent light tan head.  Very smooth for a high alcohol beer.  Well worth trying to get hold of a few bottles.  I traded for mine as I understand it is not sold only at or near the brewery.,4.4
3828,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle 330ml, in Westvleteren goblet. Having looked forward to sampling the Westvs with no little anticipation, and wondering whether I had been duped at all by the superlative and overwhelming hype, with the Westvleteren12, the answer is a most definite no, and it slightly outshines the Westvleteren8. Pours a dark russet, and luscious on both the nose and the palate, with an orchestra of the most melodious notes on the nose. Relatively spicy on the palate, bursting with flavours of all manner of wonderful things. A joy.",4.8

Pours a murky, bubbling brown. Aroma has all sorts of fruits, caramels, sugars, chocolates.  I’m not sure how to describe the flavor except that is lives up to the hype, and has everything you could want in a beer. An awesome experience, and a privilege to try. Thanks Dude, this was awesome.",4.6
3831,Westvleteren 12,"Crushed with Jakebra.  Then crushed with Honkeybra.  Soon to be crushed with Dadbra.  Every opinion counts.  This brew is something huge.  Fruity nose, and by fruity I mean every fruit you might have ever come in contact with.  Body is as full as Angelina Jolie from the nape of her neck to her lipstick lips.  Finishes dry and satisfying as a orgasm.  In all ways a huge beer, and makes me appreciate beer at a whole new level.  Want to try back-to-back with Roch 10 blindfolded and figure it out for myself.",4.6
3832,Westvleteren 12,"[Bottle] that was a bonus in a trade with ygtbsm94, thanks a lot for this legendary beer. The date code on the cap is 19/03/11. Pours a foamy, bubbly, cloudy brown, with a medium sized beige head. Powerful and sweet aroma loaded with licorice, raisins, caramel, some alcohol, dates, and some vinous notes. Flavor matches the aroma. Extremely full mouthfeel with a long, sweetish finish and a touch of bitterness and tartness on the sides of the tongue. The alcohol is definitely in the flavor, but blends well with the sweetness from the yeast. This beer is extremely good and deserves every bit of its status as the #1 beer in the world. Thanks again, Brad for this awesome bonus beer!",4.4

The taste was noting like it, plums, raisins, bubblegum, prunes, dates, figs, it made love to my mouth. Not sweet or achoholic at all like the smell, this couldnt sit in my mouth long enough. mind altering. great. the heavyweight champion of all beer ive had. The monks in their quest for enlightenment of betterment must have acquired this recipie for the perfect beer by god himself and have almost made it realized. liquid gold. ive been laid by this beer.",4.8
3835,Westvleteren 12,"This beer has a sterling reputation, which I assumed was unearned.  It’s not.  Granted much of its cache is due to its scarcity, but that doesn’t change the fact that it is world-class.

Body was a dark red-brown with creamy white head with great staying power.  Aroma was earthy, raisin-y, and distinctly cereal-y, but in a good way.  The cereal-y of this and the other Westvleteren beers I tried had this underlying aroma that reminded me of the boiling mash smell that permeates the brewery when a boil is going on.  Flavor is a bit like baking bread (that same malt-mash flavor) with raisins and a touch of sweetness and a noticeable alcohol tinge.  Very balanced.  At the top of the page, my notes say ’Honestly, this is perfect.’

I can’t recommend this beer enough.  I had it at the Cafe In De Vrede, across the street from the St. Sixtus abbey that brews the beer in Westvleteren.  Awesome.",5.0
3836,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #500 for me. Big thanks to Matt Capone for hooking me up with this one! I can’t say anything that hasn’t already been said about this beer. More than lives up to the hype. Perhaps the perfect mouthfeel meets an amazing taste. Smooth, robust, fulfilling. Amazingly long  lasting head for a beer of this strength that leaves beautiful, delicate wispy lace. Why does it have to be so damn hard to get this stuff?",4.8
3837,Westvleteren 12,"Poured from a bottle brought back from Belgium. Second tasting after sampling in Brugge. Dark murky brown with a thin tan head. Deep aromas of sweet dried fruit. Smooth on the palate and rich. Complex plum, raisin, and malt. Mild hops and trace alcohol warmth. Best Belgian quad I have had. Yum!!",4.3
3838,Westvleteren 12,"With great anticipation I poured the beer from the bottle into a trappist glass.  The aroma was a highly complex blend of deep and dark fruit scents.  The most noticeable notes were those of raisin, plums, prunes, and some other figs.  There was also a hoppy component, with some citrus tones, including a touch of grapefruit, and a grainy-earthy hop part; maybe a bit of wheat, and late-emerging toffee notes.  The beer had a rich, dark brown color, with the slightest tint of dark copper.  The head was a bubbly-foamy off-white/light tan color with a very big size initially.  It lost its big head in the beginning, but leveled off to maintain a thin layer on top of the beer, with creamy edges., which remained until the end of the beer and left a lot of clingy foam on the glass.  I was worried I might be disappointed going in for the first sip, but far from it... the flavor explodes in the mouth almost immediately.  The first flavor to hit the mouth is probably the raisin-plum taste, with some sweetness, folllowed by a good bit of sour-bitterness.  As it warmed a bit, some of the grainy-earthy flavors came forward; there was also a toffee malt effect in the taste.  The beer has a hugely lively fizz feel along with the flavors, and leaves the mouth feeling full from even the smallest sip.  It has a thick, lasting effect, and the alcohol content pokes through from time to time.  The body was smooth and wet, yet still left the mouth feeling slightly dry.  Before having this beer, and even in the first moments, I was worried that it would not live up to the hype... but it did.  While the aroma and appearance were great (especially the retention of the cling and head), it was the flavor and palate feel that truly separate this beer from the pack.  I have never experienced such a burst of flavor coupled with a majestic palate feel before.  To date, this beer is the best that I have ever had, and in my opinion, deserves its status.",4.8

3840,Westvleteren 12,Pour is muddy brown with small brown head. Aroma burns your nostrils with alcohol and funk. The flavor is terrible. Alcohol and bad sour was all I tasted. This beer did not live up to the hype at all. I’d take a Rochefort 10 any day over this one.,1.0
3841,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle 33cl.
I managed to get a hold of one of these in Antwerp Belgium.
I was very surprised to see it in the first beer shop I walked into so I was very pleased.
Pours a clear red/brown colour. 
Has a great size head and good carbonation.
Smell is chocolaty and can also make out raisen and fruits, excellent balance.
Smell is very enrichning and satisfying on it’s own, just smelling this is a treat.
Taste is very complex, but perfectly balanced, the many fruits can be found again, as also some nuts and the yeast with a lovely alcohol finish.
Lies great in the mouth.
Must say this rates up there with the Rochefort 10 and I have to say that it is slightly better even so!",5.0

It contains a lot of flavour eg. raisins, bread.",4.4
3843,Westvleteren 12,Bottle. Hazy brown. No head. Sweet aroma of bread and yeast (not the typical belgian yeast aroma though).  Sweet and fruity beer with a complex flavor. Bread. Raisins. Licorice. Etc. Very smooth.,4.1
3844,Westvleteren 12,"Many thanks to my friend Troy who brought back two bottles of this from a recent trip to Belgium and was gracious enough to share.

Poured a rich, dark brown color into a chalice. However, when the light hit it just right, it had a deep ruby/garnet glow. Wasn’t a huge head, but stayed around for a while. Also, we were sharing this among several people, so pouring this bottle into multiple glasses may have affected the head size as well.

Aromas were good, but nothing really stood out. Rather fruity, like plums and brown sugar, with some sweetness as well.

The taste was excellent. Lots of dark fruits, honey, some spice, and also a bit of alcohol bitterness.

Mouthfeel was exceptiona, like drinking velvet. Just a tingle of carbonation to keep the palate fresh.

Overall, this was a great beer. Did it live up to the hype--could it live up to the hype? Hard to say. I would love to have another full glass rather than the portion I had in order to really savor and explore this beer. But I can’t say that I was dissappointed, either, because what I did get to sample was awesome.",4.5
3845,Westvleteren 12,"Had the pleasure of sharing a bottle of this wonderful beer with a group of friends the other night.  Very well balanced.  The taste is sweet and fruity with a very mild bitterness.  The taste of raisins or dates or some other kind of dried fruit is very apparent with each sip.  Very complex on the palate, but not overwhelming.  Each sip leaves your mouth wanting more.  Well worth the hype, but I wish it was more widely distributed.  Cheers!",4.7
3846,Westvleteren 12,"No beer is perfect, but this is damn close.  Perfectly balanced.  Sweet, malty, and slightly hopped.  Every time I sip it I taste a new fruit.  A complexity that keeps you drinking, and finishing the beer quicker than you’d want.  The Abbey experience is one in its own as well.  Everyone should try this beer at least once.",4.8

3849,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at Kulminator in Antwerp. It’s been a few months, but this beer stayed with me. Thought I would never find this bar, but a local took me after Holland beat France in Euro 2008. To the beer. Pours a very rich mahogany-brown with a yellow-beige head that lacks no staying power. Lacing was fantastic, but no better than the 8. Nose was of earthy fruits, figs, prune and raisins. Akin to a fine port but so much better. Flavor starts with rich fruit and spice with noticeable yeast. I paid a little extra for the 2006, so the alcohol settled a bit in the finish, but it was still there. This was my first experience with a Westy (We had the 8 too) but it met all of my expectations, and considering the setting, it has been the finest beer experience of my life to date.",5.0

Ripe fruit like prunes and raisins in aroma as well as sweet rum, dark molasses and fig. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Flavour is ripe fruit again, spices, cloves, bread, but also lots of alcohol which I didnt remember from the other Westy 12’s a had years ago. Im sure some cellaring with get that straight. Overall its fantastic. A master piece only many many years of experience can provide.",4.4
3852,Westvleteren 12,"Lots of sediment stays in suspension.  Deep still brown with a very slight off white head that disappears quickly to a ring.  Some orange hints in the light.  Dark fruity aromas, candi sugar, and a cool alcohol bite in the nostrils.  Heavy bodied smooth on the tongue and cool tingling carbonation.  Amazing dried fruits has a tart maltiness and even a pretty good hop/bitter malt bite.  This potion envelops the tongue and will linger forever.  Plums, currants, black cherries, hides the alcohol well but hints slip through to warm your throat at the very end.",4.5
3853,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma is wildly delicious - sweet figs in honey, toffee, an immediately noticeable vinous presence, rum sugars, candied dates.  A rich, fresh maple syrup is announced.  Pour is deep chestnut brown with a small, cobwebby beige head.  A highly-anticipated first sip.  This has the round, chewy malt of St. Bernardus 12, but has a richer fruit presence and is more refined.  Creamy, wonderful mouthfeel.  Just beautifully balanced and well-crafted.  As with Rochefort, an impression of overripe banana makes itself known.  This is fucking amazing.  A brilliant spicy note, like cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom swirl about the dark fruits and rich, deep alcoholic sugars.  I don’t know if I’’ve ever enjoyed a bottle of beer this much.  If my tooth wasn’t hurting I probably would have enjoyed it even more.  Thanks Brad, I owe you.",4.5
3854,Westvleteren 12,"A very dark brown pour, with a touch of ruby highlights. Surprisingly dark, moreso than I was expecting. A two finger head, pale tan / offwhite, nice and sticky, good retention. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the size of the head on here, especially considering the ABV. 

A ton of dark fruit, sweet candi sugar scents, almost caramel like, too. A smoky, and woody quality, kinda oak like. 

Sugary dark fruit... A very notable raisin, fig, and date flavour. A warm, alcohol flavour... A little sweet, a little tart, a little peppery/spicy. A nice earthiness, smokiness, leather and tobacco. A lot going on, and beautifully balanced. Certainly my favourite of the trappists, and a very fine abbey ale. 

Big, rich, and round feel. A nice, fizzle of carbonation over the tongue, swirled through the mouth, and easing to soft and smooth on the finish, leaving the warmth and rich flavour on the finish.

An excellent beer, and unfortunate to only have one bottle. It drinks incredibly smooth and soft, with an excellent sense of satisfaction after a glass. It has certainly secured a place among the best of the best, and well worth seeking out to try. Almost frighteningly drinkable, and perhaps the closest thing to perfection that I have tasted.",4.5

3859,Westvleteren 12,"The aroma is nice with fruit, malt, maple, yeast, and leaves. The appearance is the color of a fig (purple) with brown and the head is sudsy. The flavor is bitter and soapy but mostly like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall it’s disappointing.",3.0
3860,Westvleteren 12,"Sweet, full bodied and suprisingly drinkable abbot. Very sweet and complex flavour with allot of most things. I didnt find the finish to be of a bigger experience but the smooth mouthfeel and complex character of this beer is really great.",4.0
3861,Westvleteren 12,"Drinking at my home, in a Trappist Westvleteren goblet. Both the beer and goblet were purchased a De Bierkonig in Amsterdam.
Nice smell. A little bit of natural vanilla and some figs. It’s a very sweet smell. It gives you a good clue as to the sweet taste that is to come.
Not too hard hitting like some of the other stronger Belgians out there. I’m suprised this is as drinkable as it is. I could drink a few of these. 
The carbonation is nice and bubbly, but fades rather quickly. The immediate taste is of sugary figs. It leaves almost a licorice aftertaste behind, that sticks around for a couple minutes after each sip. 
It is a very complex, and very sweet, flavor without being too hard on the palate.

I’d have to say this beer was worth the money, and worth the wait. It certainly lives up to the hype.",4.5
3862,Westvleteren 12,"An eminent beer, but it’s not as good as its reputation. I bought three of these at my local dormitory beersale (it’s an excellent beersale for a dormitory), and tasted them with two friends. I’ll still say my favourite beer is Mikkeller Jackie Brown, and my friends are both still  bigger fans of Ølfabrikkens Sortøl. Yes, the aroma is very good, spicy and fruity, but I’ve smelled better beers. The appearance is beautifully dark brown-coloured, but I had expected a better head from this best-rated beer. The flavor is absolutely fine; the best Quadrupel I’ve tasted (though not so many), the hops is as obvious as it should be, and the alcohol is surprisingly well-balanced. The palate is close to perfect, but that’s exactly it! I’d expected the entire beer to be close to perfect. Not boring at all, it’s an eminent beer. But I had just expected more!!!",4.3
3863,Westvleteren 12,"Vintage 2002. It pours a dark brown beer with a small beige head. Good head retention. The nose is of walnuts, alcohol, grapes, wood, candy and seaweed accompanied by a huge amount of malt. Very strong. Faintly smoky with a light acidity. Complex taste. Slightly salty. Beautiful lacework. Woody. Full bodied. A lot of warming alcohol. Sweet syrupy. Molasses and rum. Hints of aniseed, raspberries, walnuts, seaweed, fennel and licorice accompanied by a huge amount of malt. Smooth mouthfeel. Perfectly balanced. Grapes and honey sneaking in. Medicinal. Alcohol showing up with the swallow. Smoky. Low bitterness and hop profile. More honey appearing after a few sips. Not much carbonation. The finish is oaky with alcohol, hints of aniseed, quite a lot of blueberries and licorice. Some residual sweetness lingering for quite a while with some reminiscent aniseed, heather and dates. Extremely complex, exclusive and unique. A great beer, but definitely far from being the best beer I have sampled, it clearly does not transcend all the others. I personally definitely prefer other trappist beers. Thanks a lot Bov for giving me this Westvleteren. Will rerate soon hopefully. Okay: Here we go: Honey, earthy hops and almonds in the nose. Grainy. Apples in the taste which I don’t really like. Overrated! Much to generous with my initial rating. Still staying with the bogus score. Had a lot of rerates but not one fantstic beer yet.",4.0
3864,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle very generously opened by dewbrewer at a recent tasting.  Thanks Dan & Joelle!

This relatively fresh bottle from this year pours a lovely rich muddy, thick, dark brown color with a nice beige head.  Smell is wonderful and of raisins and dark brown sugariness.  Taste is oatmeal cookies, raisin, with light hoppiness mixed in, and a slight yeasty sweetness.  Very balanced still and not too malty at all.  Very balanced and a fantastic beer.  Didn’t expect to like a beer of this style as much as I did.",4.3
3865,Westvleteren 12,"Cap dated 29-04-06: I had intended to not drink this until I found another, but that may be awhile. Besides, this is my 100th beer reviewed. 

Into the requisite tulip it goes, with some effort needed to coax a slight foam, I wouldn’t even call it head. When held to a light source, the body is a beautiful cherry amber, clear save for a small number of floaties. The nose is a luscious blend of dark, dried fruits, and some wood. 

The taste is completely blended, there are no layers of individual flavors. The initial flavor is kind of sweet up front, but quickly begins to dry out. The woody, or perhaps leathery, character appears, and then a faint bitterness, as if from hops. The mouthfeel is barely carbonated, but silky smooth, and heavy. I drank three of these the last night of Marvin’s rule over Chalkies. It is to him that I owe many thanks for this bottle. 

I think that in Europe, the second number of the date represents the year, rather than the third, as in America. And I seem to remember reading in one of the forums that Westvleteran 12 is bottled three years before the date on the cap. As good as this was, I would like to try a slightly fresher sample. And my two cents is that this is head and shoulders above all other Quads, Trappists definitely included.

The aroma is rounded out with some big, bready yeasty aromas atop a fine malty base. Truly a magnificent aroma. In flavor, sweet dates, bready yeasts, spicy hops and surprisingly had a bitter finish.

3870,Westvleteren 12,"A rich earthy brown, she pours delectably into my glass, a goblet of course. A generous body, she is a deep earthy brown leaving no room for light to peek through. Thick and luscious in my glass with a nice tight, tan head which fades into a light ring around my glass. Much yeast in the nose with fruits such as prune, fig, and raisin. Westy is thick, heavy, and meaty in my mouth. A light touch of effervescent which I find is typical or bottle fermented Belgian Ales, and I love it. The palate is sweet and yeasty and a blend of darkish fruits like the prune, fig, and raisin I got in the nose. The whole flavor profile seems to settle right on the center of my tongue, lingering with a hint of dryness. Like a good Belgian, Westy warms beautifully, bringing out even more of the tangy yeasty sour goodness. Westy 12 finishes beautifully, much to my sadness, because I really didn’t want this wonderful Belgian beer to end. A true Trappist quadrupel, bless those monks.


For a high ABV, Westy 12 is very drinkable, and I could easily put a couple of these away, maybe with some yummy gourmet cheeses n smoked salmon. I have had a few ""religious experiences"" over the last few years of my beer geekdom, and Trappist Westvleteren 12 is definitely one of those.",4.8
3871,Westvleteren 12,"For my 700th rating, I decided to crack this one open on my 40th birthday. Two good numbers coming together, I guess. Pours a deep brownish red with a thick off white head. Nicely packed carbonation bubbles stream up the side of the glass. Aroma has a strong caramel malt sweetness, candy sugar, raisin, plums, and cherries all combined together, yet no one overpowering. Reminds me of a nice cognac where you just sit and savor the complexity of the aroma. Nice creamy body. Taste is thick and malty with lots of dark fruit notes, cherry, candy sugar. An amazing balance of so many flavors. With all of that going on, it finishes very clean with only a slight hint of sweetness. Yeah, it’s worth the hype.",4.7

3873,Westvleteren 12,"Well its time to crack this one open I won this particular bottle in a LIF hosted by Life is good major Karma goes her way. I figured this was the perfect time to celebrate this brew the last weekend of summer, the working mans weekend, and all truly life is good.

Bottle served slightly chilled in my favorite chalice. The pour produced a good two fingers worth of Brown head that goes to a great lace. The body was brown to a dark red in color 

The nose has tons of Malts and dark fruits It is a little less Intense than expected But it may be just reality catching up to expectation. There was a hint of spice and alcohol as well as it warms.

Flavors of sweet dark fruits filled my mouth raisins figs and such. As it warms more of the alcohol is present in its bite but so does the spiciness in the flavor as well .Great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation for its style

For this holy grail of all brews this was a pleasure to drink, highly drinkable. The rarity of this brew aside. I do think it is close to a few of the other Belgian Quads I have tried St. Bernardus comes to mind. Don’t get me wrong this brew was better balanced in the flavor department but I think if it comes down to it St. Bernardus is a close second.

Then again, the actual beer could never match up to its rep. Even as a Belgian Quad, I’ve ended up being more excited about Delerium Tremens or Atomium. Or maybe a family gathering is a little too stressful to actually enjoy a beer. I will say: Beautiful smooth brown pour with a short head. Smell of figs, raisins and Belgian brown sugar (not too much of the latter). Taste bring out those fruits, with the added sensation of fruit leather and Belgian malts. What I realize is that this is not a great ""extreme"" beer: there is nothing going over the top for the sake of bragging rights. No, the Trappist brothers were never into that. What I have instead is a well-practiced beer that balances in almost every respect instead of overwhelming the senses. If I ever spot another bottle (got this at Cardinal Liquors in Frankfort, IL, but that was a few years ago, so I’m not adding that place here), I will re-try by myself.",4.3
3879,Westvleteren 12,"A wonderfull brew full of flavor with an well defined head. Pours smooth and is very refreshing. It has a slow linger on the palate that compliments the start and the finish is incredible.

This brew rivals the big names in Color, flavoe, finish, and overall score in my book.",4.6
3880,Westvleteren 12,"Same as with the 8, had this @ in de Vrede with a massive hangover from my trip to Bruges, so this rating needs revision someday. Great deep dark brown colour, beige head.

3881,Westvleteren 12,"[Rating 200] Bottle shared with 1_2many.  Looks better than the 8, with a larger head and much more lacing.  The aroma is also stronger, but with a similar smell of raisins, doughy bread, and yeast.  Flavor is great...caramel, raisins, rich sweet malt and a little bit of alcohol.  Not as extremely drinkable as the 8, but still very smooth.  Excellent carbonation, very present but doesn’t choke you on the way down.  I have to drink this beer again.",4.6
3882,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle thanks to Belgianbeergal.  The only thing I’ll complain about is that my glass is empty, and I want to become a monk so I can be around this beer all the time.  Aroma is amazing.  Raisins, rich caramel, figs, with a little yeast.  Very sweet fruit, caramel, bread flavor.  Alcohol is well hidden and the carbonation is very enjoyable.  Great smooth feel.  Not too heavy or light.  If I make it into heaven this beer will be there.",4.7

3884,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled. Stunning one to have for #1000 - thanks to both ygtbsm94 and Ungstrup for providing me with a bottle of this. Pours a deep reddy-brown with a thin beige head. After a careful pour, I had a sniff. Nose is strong, wow, alcohol, dark fruit, malt, almost sour plum, toffee, very complex. Mouth is very very punch-in-the-face strong, malty, slightly bitter, alcohol, spirit, grassy, almost a gin floralness, then becoming sweeter and more rounded, with some spiciness. Lots of complex dark fruit, even some espresso and chocolate in tiny quantities. Finishes quite malty and some biscuit, with some warming fruit. Saved this for my 1000th, sat at the window, looking out across a rainy Luxembourg, in perfect silence. Then a Boeing 747 soared overhead at about 700ft, and I realised why I was here, why I was drinking this beer, and why I love the Benelux. Setting: Perfect. Beer: Pretty good, too!",4.7

Then on to Invercargill, via Queenstown on the most amazing flight I’ve ever experienced, to finally share with Sam and Steve the night before we kicked off Yeastie Boys. Thank you Richard - you’re a legend. Firstly: has anyone else had bottles with sediment that is almost 1/3 of the bottle?  The beer: Ho hum, to be perfectly frank. Pleasant. There’s another bottle in the cellar, so it’ll be interesting to see if another look is any more impressive.",3.4
3886,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, 33cl. Pours a reddish-brown beer with an off-white head. The aroma is sweet with caramel, raisin and fruits. The flavor follows the nose and leaves a rich and complex mouthfeel. Overall this is one of the best beers to style.",4.5
3887,Westvleteren 12,"Poured a hazy brown color with a tiny off white head. Aroma was of a lot of dark fruits, caramel, nuts and some alcohol. Flavor was lots of caramel, and some fig and dates, and some grass with a nice alcohol warmth and thickness in the swallow. Pretty good, but I would prefer a Rochefort 10",4.1
3888,Westvleteren 12,"The beer is dark brown with a tone of red, and a huge head. Aroma of caramel, alcohol, prunes and cherries perhaps - sweet. The flavor is of dark fruit, cherries, caramel and a bit of burn from the alcohol to balance the sweetness.",4.7
3889,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #100. Sincere thanks to ajm for leaving this in my fridge.  It would have been better shared, but there’s no way I could keep staring at this one.  Poured a robust/murky brown from the bottle with a thick tan head of foam.  Notes of lemon zest, almost like a pilsner, in the nose as well as some hazlenut.  Very unsuspecting until the molasess, caramel, apple, hazenut, and smoke slam your palette.  Aggressive, yet sweet, with mild carbonation.  Plenty of sediment.  Certainly a treat, but not quite the Holy Grail of Beers, although I have to say from subsequent ratings that this only grows in cpomplexity with age.",4.4
3890,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks cmubeerman, side-by-side with Westy 8.  2+ years old.  Creamy head with a mahogany-chestnut body.  Almost minty aroma, cherries, dark fruit, anise, cloves, coriander, cardamom.  Much more complex, fruity, and boozy than the 8.  Flavor is malty, smooth, and complex.  Round, bitter, and boozy finish.",4.3
3891,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from ebay.  Dark brown with a garnet tint and no head.  Raisin, fig, and brown sugar and grain aroma.  Initial taste has some wine like character with raisin and dark fruit flavors, mild spice, brown sugar, and subtle vanilla followed by a sweet oat and cereal grain taste with some perceptible alcohol in the finish.  Quite complex, subtle and delicately balanced flavors.  It’s quite good, but it’s not an over the top aggressive beer, which is what I prefer.  Nevertheless, it probably deserves it place at the top.",4.9
3892,Westvleteren 12,"Rating 500.  First of all, a major thank you to daknole who threw this in as a bonus brew in a recent trade.  You really didn’t have to, but thank you.

Bottle (cap reading 12.02.11) poured into trappist glass- poured a murky darken caramel color, tan whisps on top of the liquid surface for a head, initial low-medium carbonation of tiny bubbles.  Aroma of figs, plums, moist raisins, and yeast- highly appealing.  Hits the mouth with well defined medium body, some sweetness like light caramel and brown sugar comes in but is very subdued, malt is detectable but could be slightly more pronounced, very mild spices in the middle, cream on the back end of the tasting, finish lasts and has very little alcohol character to it.  Very well balanced and extremely drinkable.  A real treat!",4.7
3893,Westvleteren 12,Bottle courtesy of fonefan pours black with thin tan head. Aroma is dark fruits. First taste is sweet dark fruits then the alcohol burn comes in. The carbonation is nice and the finish is dry with a little alcohol burn. The alcohol is hidden very well in this 10% beer. Not as good as the Westy 8 but still top of my list.,4.0
3894,Westvleteren 12,WAY TO EXPENSIVE IT COST ME 18$ TO GET ONE. IT WAS VERY GOOD BUT NOT WORTH THE WAIT OR MONEY.,3.7
3895,Westvleteren 12,"A special thanks to Bman1113vr for letting me drink this beer with him. Also an indirect thanks to jjpm74 for shipping it to bman!
Where to start?! The beer pours with a small light brown head that is mostly diminishing. Since i got the bottom portion of the bottle, the body particles were a small to medium size. The body hue was a medium colored brown. The aroma smelled a little like caramel mixed with some barnyard and some meat. But the most dominating smell from the beer were the dark fruits: the raisins and a sour tasting plum. The beer also had a very strong alcohol taste.
The initial flavor was moderately sweet and the finish was lightly bitter with lots of alcohol - pretty clean tasting towards the end. 
The beginning of the beer is light to the palate and ends medium to full with a syrupy texture. The carbonation is lively.
What a great beer!!!!!!!",4.4

Pours with a off-white head that goes and leaves some waves covering a murky brown body with particles. Alcohol legs on the side of the glass. Amazing aroma of figs, dark fruits, raisins, chocolate, alcohol, brandy and a slightly tart plum. Taste is sweet, lighter than expected with complex, rich and spiceyness. There is a complex savory alcohol note on the finish that is beautiful along with a long, clean and pleasant after taste.  Brandy, spicey, sweet, yeasty and fruit. There is so much in this beer. It is subtely amazing! Syrupy mouthfeel with really light bubbles. This beer quitely lives up to all expectations.",4.5

3898,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz bottle, bottled 20.04.07--thanks to henrikb for this!  My first rating in my new podunk town!  Clear ruby brown with some chunky sediment and a one finger fading beige head down to a thin ring.  Why doesn’t this look more impressive?  Figs, raisins, and sweet slightly scorched caramel lead the aroma.  Vanilla, Belgian yeast, and chocolate covered cherries come next.  Flavor has the chocolate covered cherries (with the syrup and white sugary filling) coming stronger, and the alcohol blends well with this clear into the semi-dry slightly chalky finish, with bitterness peaking around a 2 to 3.  Backing up a bit, the addition of a hint of leather makes its way into the flavor. Fairly vinous and figgy again as well.  Full body with prickly low carbonation.  For the top rated beer, I would have expected this to excel in all aspects, but it didn’t.",3.9
3899,Westvleteren 12,"draught at in de vrede near the abbey. Simply put, fantastic. Caramel sweet smell. Taste is complex, every sip is different. Flavors of dark fruit, caramel, alcohol, very balanced and drinkable. Very smooth. Best I’ve ever had.",4.7

3907,Westvleteren 12,"Mad props to Tony at Oldsmar Tap House for the Westy 8, 12, and Blonde side-by-side.  Judging by appearance alone, one would have no idea that this is the highly-regarded nectar of God Himself, as it is quite an unattractive brown liquid just sitting in a snifter.  Aroma and corresponding flavors are as complex as a Thanksgiving feast -- spicy figs, dates, brown sugar, touches of honey and molasses, rich malts, nutmeg all over top subtle warm alcohol.  Definitely a complexity of flavor that is unrivaled to date for me personally.  It’s an absolutely stunning beer that lives up to its reputation.",4.5
3908,Westvleteren 12,"Quite simply the best beer I have ever tasted. 

The initial petrol/diesel waft melts quickly into an excellent palate taste of spice and warmth.

Just edges St Bernadus for me, but only due to rarity making drinking a bottle a special occasion (as opposed to the St Bern’ which I can get in my local pub)",4.9

Pours a dark brown nondescript looking fluid with great whitish tan head with adequate lacing.  The aroma is of trappist yeast, brown sugar, maple syrup, cinnamon, and slight alcohol.  The mouthfeel is smooth but adequately carbonated.  The flavor is classic trappist with spicy cinnamon and sugar with hints of dried fruits.  All bow to the great Westy 12!",4.4

3911,Westvleteren 12,"So this is THE big one... ahem. Pours dark ruby/brown with billowy off-white head. I don’t normally mention lacing, but this leaves loads of it all over the glass, kind of like abstract art that draws in yet another sense. I’m trying to find something consistent in the nose, but there isn’t one single element: loads of raisins and raspberries, then peaches, then smoky Rodenbach-esque fruit sour refreshment, then malts that remind of bread and brown sugar, then a warm alcohol that gives it an incredible depth and weight. Moving on before it evaporates... The flavor is very similar to the nose, a little more bread and dark fruit. The alcohol is really minor but begins to emerge with warmth, as do some sticky bitterness and salt. The beer is effortless in it’s glide and soooo smooth given the weight. The Rochefort 10 is a messy sledgehammer by comparison, but it seems unfair to place Rochefort up against this giant... are they really the same style? The outstanding complexity here is matched by an incredible delicacy, something I haven’t seen in any other Abt/Quad. Yeah, this one’s worth all the hype.",4.7
3912,Westvleteren 12,Candy brown sugar molasses candy nutmeg / wormwood spice ... A very over hyped beer IMHO .. St. Bernardus abt 12 is just as good and some people will say it’s better and less money too ...,4.3

3914,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #100!  The elusive, unicorn of a beer, got it in a trade from deepsouth.  Pours a mahogany brown, with very small head, and a murky body.  Aroma is of dark fruit, brown sugar, and alcohol.  Taste not as great as the aroma would indicate.  Taste is of dark fruit, strong alcohol, and a bit of acidic/medicinal bitterness.  Unless I got a bum bottle, it’s good, but not the greatest by any means.  I put St. Bernardus Abt 12 well above it.

Update: I shared the 2nd bottle I acquired in this trade last night at Kuhnhenn Winter Solstice.  It was much better than the first bottle.  Incredible aroma, and richness of taste.  So I am upping my scores to reflect this.  Great stuff!",4.4

The best combination is with the pate’ and the bread that the monks prepare themself.",4.9
3919,Westvleteren 12,"Date on bottle says best before 11/1/09. Poured into a Rochefort chalice. 

Poured a really dark amber brown with an off white head that stayed throughout the glass and left some lacing. Smell is a little lighter than I expected, but still plenty of dark fruits and spices, with a little bit of a sour smell detected. Taste was much of the same, didn’t really detect any sourness that I found in the nose, also I couldn’t detect the alcohol. Even with my expectations of this beer being very complex, it still caught me a bit offguard, it was very nice, nearly perfect. Medium bodied, with a light to medium amount of carbonation; it was smooth with a slightly dry finish to it. Drinkability was incredible, alcohol was not to be found and it seemed to go down just as easy as a 3.2% cask ale, I had to hold myself back from drinking this too fast. The best beer in the world? Maybe. My favorite beer? No, maybe with some age though. A damn fine beer worth seeking out? Absolutely.",4.5
3920,Westvleteren 12,"It was good to finally try the beer with all the hype. For the most part it lived up to the hype. The beer was better then average and better then I thought it was going to be. It has all the smells in it like a belgium beer does fig, plum, molasses, etc. It starts smooth and warms as it goes. 
If you ever have the opportunity to try this beer do. It was worth every penny. This beer can get very pricey. But once never killed anyone. Especially for one of the best beers in the world",3.9

Inviting first impression: the beer’s 10.2% is a quite pleasant afterthought in conjunction with a rich, earthy palate. Brown bread, vanilla and ripe plums came to mind almost immediately, fading to a brief hint of spicy-floral with soft chocolate overtones. Understated yet enjoyable hops used to great success.

Impressive, long-lived aftertaste, at first reminiscent of the tannin complex in Darjeeling teas, and then receding evenly and cleanly.

Appearance:

Pours a dark brown with an active and  attractive looking tan head. 



Smell:

Aroma of molasses, dark malt, caramel and yeast.



Flavor:

 Flavor is brown sugars, malt, spices, rasins, yeasts, bread, vanilla and much more coming together very nicely.


Palate:

Despite all the flavors going on this brew is very balanced and everything comes together and gives this an excellent mouthfeel.



Overall:

 I don’t think this is the best beer i’ve ever tried, and the mystique adds a couple points to most peoples ratings, but it’s definitely world class and in my top 20.",4.2
3932,Westvleteren 12,"ok. Honestly. this was NOT my style of beer. I have had other ones similar in style to this, but did not love this one. It was incredibly sweet, with strong apple cider notes, also i picked up a strong liquor taste. It wasn’t bad, and im assuming for its style its a great beer, but just not my thing i guess. Fortunate to try i though.",3.8

I really like the feel of this beer.  Taste is very complex.  There is candi sugar, dark fruit, some sweet malt, and a small amount of hop spice.  Alcohol is hidden very well.

Aroma is candy sugar, earthy, ripe dark fruit, and malt. Flavor is much of the same with heavy notes of candy sugar, plum, ripe dark fruit, and hints of an oakiness at the very end. Lingering, sweet finish. We tasted this Westvleteren 12 with a 33cl bottle of St. Bernardus ABT 12. The St. Bernardus had a creamier mouthfeel and was somewhat lighter in color than the Westy 12. The Westvleteren 12, however, was slightly better balanced than the St. Bernardus with a fuller-bodied mouthfeel, less sugar, and well-hidden alcohol. Given the history between these two beers, it is no wonder they are very similar. Both are exceptional ales.",4.7

The head is a rocky off-white two fingers thick which lingers for quite a while and leaves minimal lacing.  Where do I start with the aroma?  Sweet bready caramel malts with huge dark fruit aromas of raisins and plums up front.  Big and complex with molasses, brown sugar, and some spices on top of that.  Just a wonderfully aromatic brew.  Just like the smell, the taste is just incredibly complex and wonderful.  There is a prevailing sweetness that pervades the entire flavor with molasses, dark fruit, caramel, and vanilla.  Spices are also present but perfectly balanced with the sweetness and malts.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but with a nice big carbonation that tickles the tongue.  I honestly don’t think you could improve the mouthfeel...exceptional.  Well, what else to add to the praise.  I’m not sure if this is the best beer I’ve ever had, but it’s pretty damn close.  It’s unbelievably complex but extremely drinkable and is certainly the best of the style I have ever tasted.",4.6

3944,Westvleteren 12,"[1173-20080302] Bottle. Mild fruity aroma has hints of malt and roast. Hazy, dark dark brown body with a long-lasting creamy light tan head.

[1312B-20080419] Bottle. Mild vine grapes aroma has boozy green leaf grains and a strange oxo cube background. Murky, dark brown red body pours a big medium-lasting creamy off-white head.

3945,Westvleteren 12,"My first Westy 12!  Dark brown with a creamy tan head that disappears into a ring.  Huge thanks to Old Style Cub fan!  Huge and beautiful aroma of cherries, brown sugar, raisins, figs.  Amazing flavor, fresh and strong, yet extremely complex.  Has a strong vineous quality.  Finish is beautifully smooth and sweet.  There’s a lot going on in this beer.  It’s worthy of its top beer titile!",4.7
3946,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #500!  It’s an honor to have the Unicorn of beers for this milestone.  Bottle courtesy of Shyam.  33cl bottle has no label, engraved in the glass is the word ""Trappist"", otherwise the only identifying mark would be the bottle cap.  Pours a deep, cloudy, nearly opaque nut brown with a head that was initially foamy and active, and settled to a healthy, creamy, tan ring with tight bubbles.  The aroma is mild, all things considered, but if you search you can sense the complexity.  There’s a deep, sugary malt presence, yeast, grain, bread dough, raisins, dried fruits, dates, figs and a touch of lemon grass.  The aroma is good, the flavor is truly remarkable: brown sugar, chewy bread dough, raisins, grapes, butterscotch, cookies, biscuits, Belgian candy, coffee with cream, cane sugar, a little bit of earthy spice and a little bit of mild milk chocolate.  Buttery and soft on the palate makes this so easy to drink with the kind of lingering sweetness that could make it a session beer.  What a session that would be.  Very well balanced and the consistency of the beer is probably a reflection of the care taken when making it.  While not THE best beer I’ve ever had, it’s one of the best and certainly worthy of being labeled the best beer in the world.  *******  Re-rate, 2004 bottle at Kulminator.  Looks the same, great mahogany color.  Flavor is sweet, a touch boozy, a little whiskey, some brown sugar, malt, light toast, yeast, caramel, dried fruits, raisins.  Nose is plums, dates, raisins, malty, a little booze, some coconut.  Finishes a touch hot.  Aging very well.  8-5-8-4-15.",4.6

3948,Westvleteren 12,"So I have nominally the best beer in the world in front of me. Always though I would be then nervous or fascinated, but at the moment I took it as a normal beer, like every other, sincerely, without any biases. Even didn’t expect too much from it, maybe of bad biometeorological situation :) Allright, let’s head to the beer! 
I got a 0.33 l bottle from belgianshop.com. It Poured just a bit hazy dark brown body with medium bigger brownish head. Strong, impressive aroma, yeasty with dark fruits (berries, plums, ) caramel. Some orange peel as well, with caramel and chocolate. Wow, can’t stand to try it now! At the first sip it seemed a bit light, bittersour caramel and some alcohol, but nice. After two or three its complexity started to show up, probably as the palate gets used to. Yeasty fruits with malty caramel produce some nice flavors, ranged from chocolate filled with blueberries to irish coffee, as alcohol is also felt a bit. Very nice, but not near perfect, somehow leaves a feeling alcohol is hidden in a bit wrong, unbalanced and I would deer to say cheapish way. Finish is very pleasant, very sweet, caramel and plum dominated. I am constantly bothered by that strange bitterness from the flavor, but otherwise would be perfect beer. Although surely one of the best beers I’ve ever had in my life, it’s not the best and I can say I’ve actually expected more.",4.7
3949,Westvleteren 12,"Tasted this beer first hand at ’De Vrede’ right next to the abbey. Can’t get any better! Rich flavor, aroma, color all that you need in a beer. I do feel a sad that it needed to take the commercialism of the western world to get to know this beer. I would suggest to every beer ’snob’ to save your money for a plane ticket rather than spending it on postage!",4.9
3950,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, HUGE thanks to Dough77 for sending this guy my way. I’ve been saving this for my college graduation, and I’m glad I let it sit for a few months before cracking it.

The aroma is so interesting - doughy, yeasty, picking up some raisin notes too. To be honest, it smelled like bread, or pizza dough (in a good way). Absolutely delicious flavor. Lots of fruit: raisin, lightly roasted coffee, some caramel, honey, and vinuous notes too. Beautiful lingering malty finish, perfect body. The alcohol is there, but just serves to warm the throat on the way down.

I was a little nervous before opening this one because I was afraid that it wouldn’t live up to the hype. Fortunately, it definitely did. It’s a unique and incredibly complex beer -- I’m glad to have finally tried it.",4.8
3951,Westvleteren 12,"Wow...  Some people think there really is no such thing as the ""perfect beer"".  I disagree.  While it is basically non-existent, this beer does achieve that status.  The holy grail of beers! Thanks to my good friend for getting me a couple of these on his trip to Belgium!  Pours a cloudy dark amber/brown with a medium tan head that dissipates very quickly.  This thing is like drinking pure nectar!  Figs, licorice, chocolate, raisins, and maybe a slight bit of coffee and that’s just the beginning.  There are so much more complex flavors to this thing!  It is ever so slightly sweet and it lingers forever...  I now understand why they call this the holy grail of beers!  The abv in this beer is very well hidden.  You could drink a few of these things without realizing how much you’ve had!  What else can I say, Everyone needs to get one at least once in their life!  Only wish I had more...  Maybe when I win the lottery I’ll head over and grab a case for myself!  Cheers!",4.9

3953,Westvleteren 12,"Almost a perfect beer. The color is nicely dark with a not too thick foam. The nose is full of dark fruit, raisins, chocolate, hop, coffee. The taste builds on it with creaminess and a good bitterness. Very long aftertaste and nice palate. A bit of bottle age (since this is the latest bottling I took at the Abbey) will only improve on its perfection.",4.9
3954,Westvleteren 12,"This is absolutely one of the best beers in the world. An almost hazy black colored beer, with a beautiful beige foamed head. It disappears slowly and leaves a nice lace on the glass. The aroma is incredibly complex. It has dark fruits, like prum, berries, raisins. very dark chocolate malt and notes of coffee. The taste is complex as well. it’s gentle, several dark fruits, some spices and the taste of pure chocolate. The after taste has a very nice bitter, which stays for a while. It gives a very warm feeling in your mouth. As I already sad one of the best. But I leave 0.1 point free, for the perfect beer, if that is possible.",4.9
3955,Westvleteren 12,"bottle courtesy of carlus12. Aroma of dried fruit, cream and malt. Pours an opaque brown beer with a beige head. Taste is malty with a fruit notes and hops. Very weekl balanced and a lovely palate with many flourishes. A great beer.",3.9

3957,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle.  1998 vintage drank in 08.  Hold up well even to the test of time.   Pours dark brown with a kacki beige head.  Aroma is dark fruit, that Trappist flavor, caramel.  Mouthfeel is a tingling sensation as the somehow remaining spicy carbonation still persists.  Flavors become more pronounced as this beer warms as with the 8.  Finishes with hardly any etoh.  Awesome. 4.3

3958,Westvleteren 12,Bottle. Light dark fruit aromas. Very dark brown with a tan head that left quickly. Hints of cola and tobacco. Full bodied; sharp but creamy carbonation. A cascade of different flavors. Malt. Possibly chocolate. Fruit is probably present bu not clearly distinguishable - perhaps raisin. To quote Marcus: It just tastes like Vestvleteren.,4.4
3959,Westvleteren 12,"The Holy Grail of Beer!!! The first seconds are sweet but the carbonation quickly takes it away and brings in the aroma. Though it is 10.2% it doesn’t taste like it, though it does warm your throat long after you swallow.",4.8
3960,Westvleteren 12,"(Bottle, BBE 27.04.11, 20110514) The beer poured dark brown and hazy. Its head was medium sized, white and quite sizzling. Aroma was very strong and it had raisin, aniseed, malts and chocolate. Palate was full bodied and warming with medium carbonation. Flavours were raisin, dried plum, chocolate, malts, aniseed and bitterness. Aftertaste was sweet and mildly bitter. Aroma was very good but the flavour was too much on the sweet side.",3.9

Sweet malt flavor up front closely followed by a balancing hit of bitterness. Rich complex malt, hop bitterness and complex fruit flavors dance in my mouth. The attack on my tastebuds is incredible. This beer has a long lingering finish that just won’t quit. There’s also a touch of alcohol warmth to the finish. I love the balance of this beer. Easily one of the best beers I’ve ever had. Delicious! I wish I had more.",4.6
3963,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a cloudy brown with a medium sized off white head.  Aroma of sweet fruit.  The thing that makes this beer so good is the balance.  Nice sweetness, good fruit flavor, and some sugar as well.  The 10.2% ABV isn’t noticeable.  Wish they had some bigger bottles :)",4.2
3964,Westvleteren 12,"Tap at in the Vrede. Wow, now I know what all the hype is about. Easily the best example of this style that I ever tasted. Pours with a fairly dark color and a nice head. Aromas of figs and plums. Wonderfully smooth, great flavors of plums, caramel and other dark fruit, nice sweetness to it, alcohol not really noticeable. Very chewy but not cloying, outstanding.
Addendum: Same day I went to the Kulminator and had a bottle of 12, with the yellow cap, from 2004. Completely different from the one described above. The aroma was totally dominated by malts, cloves and spiced fruit.  The fruitiness - mainly cherry-  was still there in the flavors but malts were more prominent. Even more chewy, almost overwhelmimg flavor profile. The rating is for the draft version by the way.",4.8

this beer appears to be a dark brown with a toffee colored head with excellent lacing. 

the smell is malty and chocolaty and toffeeish. belgian candy as well. you can smell the alcohol in there, but it’s a wonderful smell.

this beer tastes wonderful. belgian candy... taste consistant with the smell. also a hint of spice.

what a wonderful beer this is. superbly drinkable. i’m glad i have a few more of these laying around.",4.5
3967,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma:  Cookie dough and cereal grain aroma, distinctive.  Cherry aroma emerges as it warms.  Some fringes of an odd but pleasant orange-like aroma.

Appearance:  Holds thin wispy head on surface the whole time.  Dark, cherry wood color.  A little cloudy.

Flavor:  Sweetish, big malt dominates.  Bready, cracker like grain with some warming alcohol.  Deep, caramel and sherry malt flavor.  Orange-like flavor as in aroma.

Palate:  Alcohol warmth, but very drinkable.  Not harsh.  

Overall Impression:  Excellent beer, but IMO not deserving of the hype.  I brought this home from Belgium on a recent trip, paid about 7Euro for it.",3.8
3968,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to Fraker for sharing this rare treat with me.  Bottle -  Pours a fantastic dark ruby-brownish with nice tan head.  Aroma is definite dark fruits, vinous qualities, spices, yeast, and earth.  Flavor is much the same, very nice with dark fruits, Belgian candi sugar, slight hops, and breadiness - This beer is easily a little over-rated - but it’s not the flavor that makes it so fantastic.  It’s the balance in the flavor, this is easily the most complex and balanced beer I’ve ever had -That’s what makes it so good to me.  Also it’s incredibly smooth, perfect carbonation, still flavorful, and 10.2% alcohol - that alone makes it incredible.  Hugely Recommended.",4.7

Drank on the night my 3rd child was born, this fabulous beauty of a beer is about the highest I’ve rated although I’m not sure it’s the best beer in the world (how can that judgment really be made until all other beers have been tried!?).  But I digress.. appearance is perfect with nice beige, bubbly head and dark body.  Aroma is fruity, like a wine.  Flavor is complex, strong, fruity, alcoholic presence is definite but not overpowering and in the definite quadrupel style.  Palate is lively yet smooth, clean and crisp with a medium-long finish.  Overall it is a wonderfully complex brew full of taste, palate and style.  Never turn one down if you get the chance to try it, even for $20 a bottle.",4.6

3972,Westvleteren 12,"A-Pours a deep, cloudy violet color with little to no head, perhaps because the pour wasn’t very aggresive.

S- Smell is amazing. Deep dark fruits, raisins, hints of plum, with a deep yeasty earthiness that is hard to describe. boozy.

T- Taste is extremely balanced and minimal yet overflowing with complexity. Starts off just as in the nose with deep dark fruits, moves into a bit of an acidic bite which mingles with a hop bitterness joined with a spicy flavor. There is a deep breadiness all the way through and booziness at the end which tops it off perfectly.

M- Thick, low on carbonation and fairly dry. Lingers on the palate for a while.

D- I wanted to dislike this beer, I really really did. I told myself I would rate it like any other and try to play down the hype but it just didn’t work. The only way I can describe how good this one goes down is the spicy, warming sharpness of the finish of a good big red wine. Because of the price I won’t actively seek this one out again but if i’m ever in europe and I see one you can bet that’s what i’ll be drinking. I usually dislike quads but this one seemed so laid back, it was a delight.",4.2

A friend and myself enjoyed it thoroughly and have both agreed that it is a simply amazing beer overall.  In my opinion, it wasn’t too much or too little, but rather just right.  I’m not sure I can accurately describe it.  But I loved it.  I’m glad I was able to enjoy what I could, but only wish there could have been more!",4.7
3974,Westvleteren 12,"Many thanks to my friend Troy who brought back two bottles of this from a recent trip to Belgium and was gracious enough to share.

Poured a rich, dark brown color into a chalice. However, when the light hit it just right, it had a deep ruby/garnet glow. Wasn’t a huge head, but stayed around for a while. Also, we were sharing this among several people, so pouring this bottle into multiple glasses may have affected the head size as well.

Aromas were good, but nothing really stood out. Rather fruity, like plums and brown sugar, with some sweetness as well.

The taste was excellent. Lots of dark fruits, honey, some spice, and also a bit of alcohol bitterness.

Mouthfeel was exceptiona, like drinking velvet. Just a tingle of carbonation to keep the palate fresh.

Overall, this was a great beer. Did it live up to the hype--could it live up to the hype? Hard to say. I would love to have another full glass rather than the portion I had in order to really savor and explore this beer. But I can’t say that I was dissappoin",4.5

3977,Westvleteren 12,"Compliments of JerC from his trip to the happiest place on earth..
This is my first taste of Westy and was an admittedly small sample in a wee wine sample glass. There was also some question as to the authenticity of the bottle as JerC remembers some discrepancies from previous samples.

At any rate, It poured a lovely dark almost roasted coffee brown with a moderate head. There was a very malty aroma with just the finest hint of chocolate coming through at the end. I was very disappointed in the degree to which the alcohol cut through the beer though. I got a faint hint of anise floating around somewhere in the background but it almost tasted like someone had spilled cheap vodka in my beer. I can see that there is an incredible beer hiding in there and I am more than willing to chalk it up to a spurious sample and perhaps even some palate shock but I was very disappointed with m firs (and hopefully not last) meeting with Westy..",3.6

Lovely aroma of apples, raisins, cherries, some wood, a little chocolate even.  Flavor was surprisingly mild but very nice.  Some of the same fruits as the nose, but more grape and some vanilla as well.  Loved the initial taste; hit some weird yeastiness in the mid palate and the finish was surprisingly low-key and a little disappointing.  Did not linger on the palate very long.   A very nice beer overall, and I liked it the more I drank it.  Probably should have lingered more and enjoyed longer...

3990,Westvleteren 12,"Appearance: poured a dark brown with a nice fluffy, off-white head. It’s been sitting for 2 minutes and the head has shown no sign of getting smaller. it’s about 1inch from a nice slow pour.

Aroma: Spicy/fruity yeast aroma. Full and handsome. 

Flavor: Oh, good lord. I didn’t think it could really live up to the hype. i was dead wrong. As you take a sip the fluffy head coats your tongue, then the beer pours over that coating and just envelopes your mouth. Absolutely amazing flavor.. Roasted hits about halway through a sip... it’s a smoky roast flavor in a way. Very hard to describe. Bitter dark chocolate, residual sweetness, sweet dark cherries... not sensing any tart.

Holy shit this beer is amazing... the flavor is so complex. it’s really hard to describe. I’m actually getting some hop bitterness, but no flavor or aroma from the hops. 

As the beer is warming, there’s a vast array of new flavors blooming. In the front is white and red raisons. Bubblegum? ... good lord. I think I’m gonna keep all 30 beers.

Overall: It’’s absolutely amazing how the aroma and the flavor are so different, but go together so well. Head lasted the entire beer. i can’t say enough about this beer. It easily lives up to all the hype. I recommend going to http://shop.belgianshop.com and picking up some from this batch immediatly! You ahve to place a minimum of $50 order, so go ahead and grab yourself some glasses and maybe a lambic or saison while your at it.

(2/28/08) Bottle sample at PreZBF@Alvinne in Heule. Bottled in 2008 (if the assumption that BBD-3yrs=bottling date is correct). Dark brown color with a light beige-brown head. Aroma of dark malt, caramel and tons of dark fruits (lots of plums, some prunes and raisins). Malty sweet flavor with some fruits and roasted notes. Finishes dry. Medium to full body. This is really great. I got three more bottles to take home (each for about 3-4 Euros!) at the Alvinne brewery shop, so I could taste it again after a bit more cellar time.  9/5/8/4/17=4.3",3.6
3999,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle shared by aspidites. Cloudy copper color with noticeable yeast. Fruity aroma with yeasty spice as well. Dates, plums, raisins, sweet dark bread, candy sugar. Flavors are just as complex as the aroma. This is a liquid candy in a sense. Incredibly smooth and well put together. This is an amazing beer. Not the best of the day, but damn fine. Thanks again Mike!",4.4
4000,Westvleteren 12,"Courtesy of Diane and CJ (thanks guys!).  They thought this was at least 2 years old but weren’t really sure.  I found it a bit thinner than I’d anticipated, I guess a byproduct of aging.  Of particular note there was little to no head here.  But the aroma, full of grapey fruitiness, promised something special.  And indeed the rich plum, fig, raisin character was especially enjoyable.  Smooth and clean.  I think this beer does benefit from its own mythology and lack of availability, but it is quite good.  (#3358, 3/28/2008)",3.8
4001,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #100!  Cap: 20.11.10  -  I debated whether #100 was a worthy milestone for a Westy 12, but I couldn’t wait any longer damn it! I took over almost an hour and half to savor this little beauty.  

Aroma:
Nose is figs, raisins, sugary candy, toffee and a touch of cherries.

Appearance:
Pours a cloudy caramel color with some floaters.  2 finger beige head initially that fades into a constant 2 cm topper.  Lots of carbonation, though not much lacing.  The head just slides off the glass.

Flavor: 
This one is complex to say the least.  Vanilla, dried dark fruits, caramelized sugar, bready yeast, all spice.  Wow – it keeps changing like a Willy Wonka Gobstopper.  A little hoppy alcohol burn in the finish to level out the sweetness.

Palate: 
Creamy bubbly/tingly mouth feel.  Coats your entire mouth like latex paint.

Overall: 
An excellent complex Belgian. You could take a day trying to figure out the different flavors as it warms up.  A notch or two above Rochefort 10 in my opinion, but with the availability of the latter, I’ll most likely stick with it rather than mail order from Belgium again.  However, it certainly is worthy of its legendary status and a must try on your list.",4.8
4002,Westvleteren 12,"2007: This one really lives up to it’s hype. I have tasted 1, 2 and 3 year old version, and the last one (vintage 2004, sampled in 2007) just knocked me complety over. It is muddy brown with a lot of sediment, and has a fantastic aroma of berries, overripes fruits, toffee and caramel. The flavours are everything at once: sweet like caramel, fruity bitter and complex spicy. Finally the palette has a history of it’s own, being creamy and full bodied with a lively but refined carbonation and a finish that makes you wanna fill out the application form for the trappist monastary. 

2018: Five year old version from 2013: Muddy brown, low head, lively carbonation. Complex aroma: dried fruits, wood, caramel, port wine, a bit of basement. Sweet and malty flavours, oak and wood. Huge mouthfeel. Amazing.",4.5
4003,Westvleteren 12,"What an incredible beer, brewed by incredible people, in an incredible place.  We visited St. Sixtus recently and it is well worth the visit.

If this isn’t perfection in a bottle, I don’t know what is....maybe Supplication (my other perfect 5). I think I could smell this beer for hours, I don’t even need to drink it to appreciate its greatness. Smells like an amazing port with aroma of plums, fig, a light sweetness, and a bit of vanilla. Still taking in the aroma......jesus christ. Orgasm in a bottle, seriously. If I could drink this every day, I’d die a happy man. Palate is perfect, a bit creamy mouthfeel balanced well with the carbonation level.  Taste is pretty malty, nutty, fig/plum/dried fruit flavor. Lingers on the tongue heavily after each sip.

Aroma was a nice mix of sweet fruits almost like a sherry along with, subtle dried fruit notes and a moderate bread note.  Flavor was a great balance between its fruit like sweetness and a malt backbone.  I found the flavor to be really complex.  It had a nice full mouth feel, seem to coat the palate. Alcohol was warming and the carbonation was adequate.  This is truly a great beer.",4.3

To be fair, I haven’t tasted hundreds of beers, but I have tasted many of the ones that rate highly on this site and others.

The aroma of the beer was made up of caramel, wood, dark fruits, a hint of chocolate, dusty yeast, and some alcohol.

Westy 12 is really unlike most in its overall character and presence especially for such a high ABV.

4030,Westvleteren 12,"Had a mini quad tasting in April 07. Had this one after the Abt 12.

Received this bottle from rayjay (beeradvocate name) via trade. Thanks Jason

Appearance: Pours a nice and clear brown color with a 1.5 finger tan head. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the Abt12.

Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits, nice malts and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed by dark fruits, figs, roasted malts, and slight cherry. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms. Very nice. Lets see how it tastes.

Flavor: The tastes are similar to the aroma, but not as noticable. Cherry and dark fruits from the start followed by warming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors.

Palate: The dark fruit and malt flavors hang for a bit. This is pretty creamy and goes down very smooth for 10.2%. I wish I had more than one bottle of this because I could easily drink a few of these.

Overall. This finished behind the Rochefort 10 and slightly above the Abt 12 and Chimay Blue. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others). I’m not sure if it’s worth $20 if you don’t get it in Belgium due beers of similar quality being available more readily and for much cheaper. Definitely a beer you have to try though.",4.3

Pours dark brown and hazy with a large frothy head that soon fades to leave a thin band of bubbles, aroma is sweet and candy like (creme brulee) Flavour is full of dried autumnal fruits and at no time do you taste the 10% it’s just warming and utterly beautiful.",4.4

4064,Westvleteren 12,"My third bottle since I’ve brought  a few bottles back from Belgium in April 2007. One was with a tasting party and the other was the ’nth beer of the night. This is first one I’ve had to ""taste"". I had the 8 and 6 at De Vrede-those were extremely fresh beers. I think my beers have seen better days. Poured a bit cold-could be an issue. Small flat head and very dark brown-almost opaque. Nose is a bit alcoholly, chocolates, caramel.  Thick, syrupy mouth. Alcohol is present but tons of syrup, chocolate, raisins, prune. The flavors stick to the palate as the warmth creates more flavoring.  Still, I would believe this is a beer best drank fresh at the brewery (or across the street).  The 8 was almost perfect.  I didn’t have the 12 because I had a case in the trunk of my car.  Now I wish I would have had the 12 too....",4.3
4065,Westvleteren 12,No doubt this is the one. With the soft feeling in the mouth of small boubles and smooth taste this is a fantastic beer.,5.0
4066,Westvleteren 12,"A perfect pour into my Westvleteren goblet yields a 2 finger tan head atop a dark brown, murky, mystical body. Quintessential Belgian lacing coats the glass. 

Several intermingling aromas arise from this beer; yeast, cherry, grape, raisin, fig, cappucino, dark malt, spices, molasses, and so much more. To enumerate every note in this beer’s aroma would take the nose of a bloodhound and the vocabulary of a thesaurus. 

The flavor is just as complex as the smell. Plum, rum, chocolate, fresh bread, grape, pepper, vanilla, again I can’t possibly do this justice. Unrivaled. 

As one would expect this beer has a mouthfeel smoother than velvet. The carbonation is incredibly fine. Supremely drinkable.",5.0
4067,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma of prunes, cherries, notes of alcohol.   Incredible lacing of the side of the glass at first glance. Cant believe how well balenced.. expected more of a syrupy beer like many other quads.. so smooth. Not overly carbinated. I can taste the alcohol finish on my palate. I loved it, period.------------------------------


Rerate - April 2015. Bottle at Beer Temple in Amsterdam. Carmel/cola appearance. Off-white head. Nice lacing, nothing like a stout. Seltzery carbonation dissipates as this one sits - light tingling on the front of my tongue like a champaign bubble. Flavor of banana, raisins, sweet long carmel malt finish. Vanilla cherries in there? So complex. A masterpiece.",4.4
4068,Westvleteren 12,"10.2 % that is nicely hidden in this perfect beer.  There is a reason this beer is rated so high, it is because it is completely perfect.  I have drank about 10 bottles in Europe over the past couple of months and I can certainly say, ""I’ve drank enough to know.""",5.0
4069,Westvleteren 12,"Re-rate only for editing purposes, awful rate is still the original. 2004 bottle. Deep brown body with a small, light head. My final beer at the end of an intense day, and I wasn’t taking notes, but I’ll try to remember my impressions. I do remember what I thought of it in comparison to some other beers that I’ve had, so that’s largely where the rating comes from. My most memorable impression of it is it’s light body compared to other beers of the same and similar styles, yet it’s ability nonetheless to maintain it’s complexity. Definitely some molasses coffee notes, I got some honey notes as well amidst the more typical vinous dark fruit body. I’m not sure if I would say the beer is overrated, if I was just expecting too much, if it was the end-of-day placement, or if my preference for brews not afraid to be bold at every turn results in this below-average rating.",4.2

4074,Westvleteren 12,"I found this beer for sale at O’Brien’s, with a hefty price tag for a 12 oz.  Still, it was cheaper than a ticket to Belgium and I wasn’t about to pass up the top rated beer in the world.  Pours murky brown with a big tan head that stays around for a while.  Pleasantly sweet aroma of cherries, prunes, brown sugar, licorice, bread dough, oak, and  yeast.  Unbeleivably light mouthfeel.  Its like the beer hovers on your tongue.  Amazing taste.  It mimics the aroma quite well, with an intriguing combination of tastes.  I had the same problem as others: it was very, very difficult to pin down specific flavors.  It was almost as if the beer was blending and mixing while in your mouth.  Sweet, sour, spice, and fruit were in constant motion and made up a beer that is almost undescribably good.  It was well worth its price.",4.6
4075,Westvleteren 12,"Tried the Westy 8 first and was slightly dissapointed.  So I didn’t know what to expect with the 12.  Poured a dark murky brown into my St. Bernardus glass.  On first sip the beer is way to cold.  Still I pick up big dark fruit flavors, lots of prune juice soaked bread, with a finish that is lasting and perfect.  Upon warming it really opens up.  The flavors up front get bigger without losing the perfect balance and the finish lasts longer.  The balance is near perfect, with a complexity I have rarely seen in such a smooth and soft beer.

Re-rate:  Had another bottle of this last night.  I thought I might be able to rate this better without so much initial hype as the first time.  Still an awesome beer, lot to be said for the subtleties.  Also, one of the best beers I have had at room temperature.  Still, not quite as impressed on this second go.  It has great balance, and a really stellar quality about it, but the titile of best beer in the world is hard to live up to.",4.3

i think the beer is so popular because it’s not on the market. It is a very good beer ut belgium has many other beers with the same score for me.

4079,Westvleteren 12,"RERATE- bottle at In De Vrede. Has a hot, praline-nutty, cherry liqueur chocolate character, with less body, less complexity and more alcohol than I remember. Dumbed-down a notch?. Not my favourite beer in the world anymore- 848417. 


Fresh bottle bought at St. Sixtus, 29/12/07. Tasted of nothing but vague roasty/hoppy bitterness at In De Vrede owing to the flu, but back home it’s easy to see why this is currently revered as planet Earth’s no.#1 rated. Pours stouty mahogany with reddish edges against the light, and an irregular beige head. Aroma sharp, bready, yeasty and smothered with prunes, hazelnut, chocolate, dark spicy fruit and a touch of liquorice. Again, a slightly sulphurous note leaning towards living English bitter (Badger, Marston’s, Wadworth’s?). Smells alive, beery and like it’s just been drawn from a cask. Impossible to sniff without salivating. Flavour easily the sweetest of the Holy Trinity, thick with toffee, milk chocolate and burnt sugar, but also intense charred malt (or at least the impression of it), 70% cocoa bitterness and a closing sting of bitter, bitter hops. There’s also sweet nutty malt like the 8, prunes and even suggestions of glace cherry or strawberry. The deliciousness of this beer lies in an intense bittersweetness that’s uncomplicated, but difficult to pin down. Light but persuasive on the palate, with gentle coaxing alcohol and above everything, a nutty chocolate malt smoothness I don’t want to end. I’m not saying it’s the Greatest Beer in the World (I’ve sampled to date), but it’s in the top one. 949419.",4.1

Pours very dark burgundy with a small head and great lacing.  Flavor is dark fruits quickly followed by spicy yeast.  Damn that’s so flavorful and so smooth.  A nice malty finish that lingers forever.  Sip and sit as to not waste any of it.  Palate is sticky, yet very smooth especially for 10.2%.  A very complex and tasty brew that I will need to try again and again to fully appreciate.  Worth the hype.",4.5
4081,Westvleteren 12,"Very complex...mostly comprised of dark fruit (raisins, prunes, and fig)...and then the burn begins.  Aroma was sweet with a hint of alcohol.  Visually, this one is like a dingy, murky river...with just a minimal head.  The term ""foam"" would be overly aggressive.  Good beer...but doesn’t live up to it’s #1 status and it’s hefty price tag.  Buy Rochefort 10 to get your trappist fix and save some cash!!!",4.1

This beer offered a bit of everything but like most beers at this time of the night, suffered from being offered near the end of the night.  I must revisit.",4.2

Pours a dark mahogony color with a medium sized beige colored head.   Aroma is doughy, caramel, raisin, prunes, pepper.   Flavor is sweet caramel, more figs, prunes and raisins, alcohol, yeasty.   Palate is medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, finishes sweet and slightly warming.   This is definitely a great beer, though the experience is not worth the price of admission.   Again, great beer but does not even make my top 10.   Somewhat of a let down.",4.2
4086,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from tytoanderso.  Pours a rather dark brown with almost no head whatsoever.  What ""head"" is there is rather white in color.  Smell reminiscent of ""jesus juice""...aka wine.  The first thing that came to my mind when I smelled this was that I was about to indulge myself in the blood of christ.  Other than that, definite hints of raisins, molasses and yeast.  The latter more apparent in the taste.  A somewhat dry, but very solid flavor with this beer.  Easy going down with only a small trace of the alcohol taste.  Very pleased.  Goes well listening to Judas Priest.",4.4
4087,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a hazy murky red beer with a nice creamy head. Foamy lacing on the glass.
Aroma’s of raisins, prunes, figs, nutmeg, and pepper. The taste is strong and sweet dried fruits; raisin, figs, and prunes dominate touch of spices like pepper, nutmeg, and clove. Strong rock candy sugar with a kick of alc. in the end. Mouthfeel is fruity and sweet yet creamy mild on the tongue. A touch of alcohol in the aftertaste.",4.6
4088,Westvleteren 12,Lumpfest 2008 - one i didn’t think i’d have anytime soon. ’06 bottle.  very dark ruby pour with a nice off white head.  very fruity scent with some sweet malts.  very great taste of mixed fruits.  quite smooth and an even better aftertaste.,4.1
4089,Westvleteren 12,"(First off I must thank IMTheOptimator for this most generous gift.  I waited a long time to finally enjoy this bottle)  Big bready malty flavor.  Has that same fruit/candy quality that I found in the 8, but not in nearly the same intensity.  Has this been lost somewhat with age?  Cherry and dark fruits like plum and dates are all over the place.  Cinnamon is prevalent as well.  Alcohol warming is there, but the taste of alcohol is prefectly masked.  I like the westy yeast, especially compared to other belgian style strong ale yeasts.  It gives a nice floral estery profile.  The mixture of sweetness and dry maltiness is strange.  I keep thinking of rye bread.  The palate has no flaws.  Nice carbonation level aiding a dense, but somehow also light mouthfeel.  The real strength of this beer, though, is the complexity.  It doesn’t pop like the 8 does, but does manage to combine bread, fruit, spice and even cocoa, blending them all together into a beautiful boquet.",4.2
4090,Westvleteren 12,"Dark color; tan head.  Rich aroma of dark and sweet malts, sweet fruit.

Will be much better in a couple years.  A good beer but over rated now a days.",4.1
4092,Westvleteren 12,To this point one of the best beers I have ever tasted. What a perfect way to end 2007. Thanks to IlanMan for bringing it back from Denmark. Tastes unlike any other beer I have ever had. I think it is somewhat deserving of the hype behind it but I feel if were readily available it wouldn’t be the top beer in the world. That being said If this were readily available I would be homeless and happy due to buying this all the time. Started out the New Years celebration with style this year.,4.7
4093,Westvleteren 12,pours a deep dark golden with a small white head.  aroma of wine and beauty.  heavy body and burst of flavor hides the alcohol extremely well.

4094,Westvleteren 12,"Well, what better way to end the year than with the proclaimed ""best beer in the world."" Pours a very dark slightly murky brown (left some yeast in the bottle) with surprisingly small, dissipating tan head.  Very effervescent, with rich wine-like nose with hints of molasses, baker’s chocolate, and sweet fruity liqueur. On the palate, smooth but a little thin, tasting like a nice aged port with added barrel character, along with a sort of grape jelly note i remember from the 8, for which this is most definitely the more adult version.  A lovely long finish, melding through many different stages from winter spices to delicate candi sugar sweetness to a final delicate tingle of herbal hop bitterness.  Best beer in the world? That always seems a contentious claim, as taste is inevitably subjective, yet this is one particularly well crafted and lovely ale, and one that I am very happy and thankful to have tried.",4.3

To be quite frank, I was a little apprehensive about this beer. Although I respect the style, Abt/Quads are not my favorite style. Here we go... Wonderful vinous aroma. Much like a rich Cabernet. Raisins, figs,  fresh dough.  I’m quite taken with the aroma.  Pours rich, deep brown  with dark chestnut  accents. A foamy white head quickly gives way to a good amount of spotty lacing. Quite complex on the  tongue. Dry, but lighter bodied red wine (Pinot?).  Dough.  Yeast.  Dried figs and plums.  Young port.  Some cinnamon spice. Wow. I’m stuck as to  how vinous this is.  Not really what I was expecting. Silky smooth mouthfeel.  10.2%? Really? Above and beyond my expectations. Can’t  wait to  try another.",4.3
4102,Westvleteren 12,"11.2 oz humble bottle. Graciously given by Px2GrafX in BIF. Thanks so much for the opportunity to try this highly prized brew. No label, no fancy silk-screened etching. Just a plain, brown bottle with the famous yellow cap of this widely sought after beer.

Simply tremendous flavor. So rich and complex..alcohol is subdued to a point that you can hardly notice it. So many others have described it’s multitude of characteristics in near perfection, so I’ll spare you the details. Truly exceptional mouthfeel..silky smooth and delicious. As drinkable as any beer. This really leaves you wanting more..it’s a good thing this stuff isn’t widely available, because I’d be happy but poor. But then again, if you’re buying Westy 12, you’re probably not too concerned about the price. This is the quintessential treat for any beer lover.

Amazingly, it somehow lives up to the hype. Best beer in the world? I’m not sure, but it is certainly deserving of the title.",4.7

I can just say... stunning beer... a present of mother nature, heaven in you mouth. It’s incredible how you can play with elements of nature to make such a delicious liquid.
One thing that suprises me is that it’s not that different from the St-Bernardus Abt 12, which has been my favourite beer until now. I can’t say which of the two is the best... they are both just perfect brews, both better then the Rochefort 10 in my opinion. I’ll have this as much as I can!",5.0
4110,Westvleteren 12,"Today is my birthday, and my present to myself is to open a bottle of Westvleteren 12. It’s pretty green though, about 4 months old at this point based on a best buy date of 10/11/09 (converted to american format). I poured a bottle into a chimay glass. 

It pours a very dark brown. It isn’t black, but light barely penetrates. There is a nice mocha colored head that hangs around for a while and laces nicely down the glass leaving patches of foam on the surface of the beer. 

The aroma is great. It has a raisin and rich toffee aroma with a malty background. It is very sweet and there is another aroma on top of the raisins I can’t quite place that might be caramelized brown sugar.

I have heard so much about this beer that I almost though it would fall short of my expectations. Fortunately, that was not the case. This is a great beer. The first thing that hits me is the insane level of smoothness and creaminess. For a Belgian Quad, it is ridiculous. In no way can I detect any of the 10.2% alcohol in this beer. I don’t consider myself a good enough beer taster to break down all the flavors in this, but I get a pretty strong chocolate flavor and a bit of spiciness as well.

The feeling of this beer is great. It has great body, but not as heavy as a stout would be. I would consider it to be medium bodied but the complexity adds so much to the mouthfeel.

In case you couldn’t figure it out from the rest of the review, the drinkability is extremely high. I’m gonna have to start calling in all my favors from friends with belgian contacts.",4.7
4111,Westvleteren 12,"At Gollem, Amsterdam, 12-2-07.   Dark brown, beige head, lace.   Looks perfect in its own chalice, very elegant.   My first impression of the aroma is lots of yeast; very bready and doughy.   Then prunes, dates, and pure malt; not overly sweet, and very intricate.   the flavor is bready as well; plenty of spice and dried fruit, but not sugary., and surprisingly not as sweet as the other abts I’ve had.   No alcohol flavor.   The palate is very smooth and full, almost perfect.   Goes down cleanly with a finish that leaves a pleasant but not overly sweet taste in your mouth for quite a while.   I knew that they would have this when I was planning my trip to Amsterdam, but I was almost in disbelief until I actually ordered it and forked over the twelve euros.   It was served out of the cellar, like the St. Bernardus 12 that I had the nigh before, and that temperature perfectly complimented its flavors.   As the last of the top three abts to have rated, in comparison I would say that westy is by far the most drinkable and balanced.   I think that Rochefort has more complexities in the aroma, which I really like, but it can be  too rich and alcoholic.   St Bernardus  is about the same in intensity as westy, but lacks the powerful yeastiness and complexity of flavor.   Price wise, is it three times better than St Bernardus?   No way, and I know I’ll be lucky to get another one any time soon, which I guess is part of the mystique.",4.5

The beautiful tan head is billowy and thick.  The aroma is enticing.  Screaming of malts and dark fruits, mostly raisins and prunes.  Sweet brown sugar, a hint of yeasty bread round out the aroma.  If beer could talk, this would say, ""I AM BEER, DRINK ME!""  I sit and enjoy the aroma for about a minute, before I cannot stand it any longer and take the first sip.  Bliss.

4118,Westvleteren 12,"33 cL bottle. It pours a dark mahogany with big, very tight beige head. The aroma is really quite refined, with caramel apples mostly, some faint roastiness, noticeable sugar, and some slight clovey yeast notes. The flavor is incredibly harmonious. It begins with an edgy, roasty acidity with a few burnt notes. But it quickly softens and becomes more like caramel. I even detect a slightly oaty taste in there. I gets a little more tart again toward the finish, but also takes on a sort of bitter chocolate tone, with plenty of clove and maybe allspice. The aftertaste is warm but not distinctly alcoholic. Some woody chocolate notes linger for quite some time, too. I gotta say, this really is quite a good beer. Thanks to dra19 for sending this bottle my way.",4.3
4119,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to Eric for this amazing brew. From a bottle that is a few years aged. The taste was amazingly smooth. A great body and head. The overall taste is fruity, perhaps raisins or prunes with a sweeter strawberry. But the fruity taste is also combined with hops and some spices. Awesome. No need to say anything but top notch. Re-rate: Well, how do I re-rate something that is such a moment in time? Well, it’s impossible to have the same experience. Best by 29/02/08 drank January 2010, brewed in 2005. Pours a dark and cloudy brown-red color with a thick white head. A sweet aroma of fruit, strawberries. A somewhat dry full rich flavor; fruity, yeast, some metal, maybe some cardboard. The quality is very noticeable for sure. I need to try this a few more times to generate a true opinion. Very nice. 
Five years later. Man, this is one hell of a beer. A bottle that’s about 5 years old. Just a massive strawberry nose. Huge cardboard fruity berry flavor. Just lovely. Soft. Dark caramel. December 2020. Been a long time. The nose is the best part of this beer, totally intoxicating layers of yeast and fruit. Really spicy, sweet fruit and smooth as hell. Amazing.",4.5
4120,Westvleteren 12,"From Bottle: Good beer, but did not live up to its billing in my opinion.  Great head and aroma.  Good kick and aftertaste.  Thick palate.",3.9
4121,Westvleteren 12,Wonderful beer with great aroma when served at the right temperature. It’s flavors blend into each other smoothly and the nice dry aftertaste stays for a comfortable time. I also like the little kick it gives when swallowing.,5.0
4122,Westvleteren 12,"To state that this is one of the greatest beers to be found in the world, is clearly an understatement. The aroma and flavor of Westvleteren Abt. 12 are truly an incredible experience to behold.",5.0
4123,Westvleteren 12,"Clearly one of the best beers in the world. I was fortunate enough to try this at ""in de Vrede"" the abby in which it is brewed, in Belgium. It came to us in a glass and the appearance was mind blowing. It was fairly dark and super murky and the head was light tan and creamy and THICK, but thin maybe 1 inch. Frothy would not be a word I would use to describe it.  It was perfect through nearly every phase. The aroma was clean and clear and I easily detected hints of dried fruits perhaps prunes or raisins and roasted malts. I would have expected the flavor to be more sweet compared to that of the aroma, however the first sip was incredibly smooth and sophisticated with not even a note of extra sweetness. It was perfect I tell you! After 2 of them I must admit I was feeling happy. Has a wonderful mouthfeel perhaps the best, however I can not give it a perfect rating because another Trappist brew I tried, ""Orval"" wins(according to me) in flavor. Had I not tried Orval, this beer is a 5.0",4.7
4124,Westvleteren 12,"#500, and coincidentally, my six month RB anniversary.  Cap code 09.05.10.  Pours a dark, murky brown body that lets just the slightest bit of light shine through.  A large, frothy, cream colored head settles to a thin but dense blanket of foam.  Random patches of microfilm lace are strewn about the glass.  The nose is intensely aromatic, and almost indescribably inviting.  Sweet caramel meets rum soaked figs, prunes, and raisons.  Scents of root beer, maple, cocoa, heavy cream, and Tahitian vanilla beans foreshadow the decadent flavors that are surely to follow.  The flavor is just downright epic.  Its sweet up front, with caramel and maple showing strong.  It then transitions seamlessly to the complimentary flavors of figs, raisons, and vanilla.  Surprisingly bitter floral hops tickle the roof of the mouth on the back end, providing punch and balance.  The body is medium-full, with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel that ends up just a bit too sticky.  Sweet and sour dry fruits linger on the palate for ages.  This is a truly fantastic beer that lives up to the hype.  I couldn’t have chosen a better candidate for #500.",4.4
4125,Westvleteren 12,"Almost opaque but slightly more dark brown color with a nice beige head. Some fruit in the aroma, could be prunes. The aroma is very clear and raw in a way, yeasty as well. Sweet flavor: raisins, yeast and malts come out to give it a deep touch and the hops give it a nice refreshing feel, a very balanced beer. The sampled beer had been stored for a couple of years and it really was worth it: carbonation at its right level and a deeper tone in the flavor. No alcohol taste only a warm feeling! The taste just explodes in your mouth but doesn’t actually leave a huge aftertaste, although some sweet maltiness is distinguishable on the palate.",4.8
4126,Westvleteren 12,"This is the best fucking beer I have ever had in my life. There are hints of ash and caremel that really bring out the nose and the head of the beer.  Fuck, I love drinking this at the bar with my friend",5.0
4127,Westvleteren 12,"Tried at Pizza Port Carlsbad with Shaun.  Bottle from ygtbsm94.  Thanks Brad! Side by side comparison with St. Berny 12 and Rochefort 10 (11.3%).  Many similarities between the 3.  Westy is a little darker than the Berny.  Berny has a little more banana aroma.  Westy aroma gets nicer as it warms up, revealing more malty aromas. Westy a bit more cloudy.  Dark brown color.  A little more carbonation in the Berny.  Berny had a best by date of May, 3rd, 2012.  Westy had no date.  I can’t help but think the Westy is young.  It almost reminds me of a slightly aged St. Bernardus.  This is the second time I’ve had Westy 12.  The first was with Jon (WeeHeavySD) at OBrien’s Trappist Ale tasting.  I remember the Westy being spectacular, and probably much older...something like 4-6 years old.  This time it was just good, much less than my expectations.  Must rerate again someday.  I still have one in the closet to rate next year. 8,4,9,4,18: 4.3

4128,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a very dark brown. Big fluffy head that dissipates somewhat quick. Silky white lacing. Looks delicious. Too many smells to distinguish. Fig, caramel, raison, plumb, jam, malt, honey, tea, spices and mild alcohol. Flavors are abundant as well. It tastes of all that the smell indicates and it is an unreal flavor experience. The warming from the alcohol is the only indication that the ABV exists. A spicy semi dry finish. The drinkability is unreal for any beer, especially for this type and abv. Lives up to the hype through and through. A unique experience that should be on every ratebeerian’s list",4.6
4129,Westvleteren 12,"330 ml. bottle purchased on eBay.  Date on bottle cap of 09-05-14.  Like so many others on the site, this was the one beer I had been most expectant to try.  Pour is deep brown, some ruby highlights, though pretty much no light escapes through.  Head is a rocky tan - off white 1 1/2 inch head.  Very nice to look at in a chalice.  Aroma is pretty big, consisting primarily of roasted malt, dried fruit (primarily raisins), and tobacco.  Initial taste of raisins, prunes, earthiness that all come at you in layer upon layer of taste.  Finish features some yeastiness.  Flavor is very long, intense, yet somehow blended and subdued at the same time.  I certainly understand the contradiction in the remark, but the flavor really did come big (initially), yet blended and subdued at the same time (as the beer opened up).  Hard to explain.  Very much coats the mouth.  Similar to the Westy Blond, this one needs to be tasted to be understood.  Certainly a world class beer and a world class beer tasting experience.  Finally, the eBay user I purchased this beer from, I recommend highly.  Beer mail me if you would like the recommendation.",4.2

Bittersweet taste......must try it",5.0
4132,Westvleteren 12,"Not sure what I can say about this that hasn’t been said already but I’ll give it a go. Pours deep reddish brown - thick and hazy with some sediment and material floating around. Alcohol is just hinted at on the nose at 10%+ leaving you with dried fruits, anise, and a myriad of other aromas. It was served a little too cold but after sitting for a few minutes the flavor really opens up and leaves you with an impeccably balanced and intricate beer.",4.5
4133,Westvleteren 12,"Poured a murky brown colour with a small creamy tan head. Nose is sourness from the pour moving into a medicinal yeast, apple cidar and pitted fruits.  Initial taste is a sweet syrup candy like, soft and smooth, the expected sourness did not make it’s way into this one. The creaminess begins the next layer with some pitted fruits. Alcohol being very masked. The finishing palate is chocolately with a unique bitter hops. Slight head retention and lacing of the glass. Lips become candy like finished and sticky medium body.",4.1
4134,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from Ølbutikken, Copenhagen, Denmark. Pours deep hazy reddish brown with a creamy beige head. Extremely complex aroma starting off with candy-like sweet fruitiness, therafter roasted notes and dark berries, and finally some earthy hops. Excellent mouthfeel, medium bodied and very smooth. Starts off a bit sweet, but the finish is dry with moderate bitter. Almost perfect.",4.9
4135,Westvleteren 12,"The monks injected torque into this baby.
 From the tap or from a bottle Westvleteren 12 is beer done full throttle.
 It’ll make your mouth explode with delight, 
     and can be drunk in the morning, afternoon, or night.
 The abbots brewed and infused it with love,
 so the beer tastes blessed by powers above. 
 The only problem with this beer could be
its being a definite rarity. 
So savor the beer whenever you can, though seems to taste best in Westvleteren!",4.6
4136,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a murky hazel brown, small off white head.  Aroma of dark fruits, plums, raisins, candy and brown sugar, and carmalized molasses.  The aroma is reminisent of St. Bernardus Abt 12.  Chewy mouthfeel and other worldy flavors.  To my astonisment this tastes nothing like St. Bernardus.  Such a flavor is hard to describe.  Some initial heat, roasted nuts, figs. licorice and raisins.  Not nearly as sweet as I thoiught it would.  Unlike anything I’ve tried before.  Thanks to Roger from belgium!",4.3
4137,Westvleteren 12,Ugly appearance of murky brown water.  Very frothy head.  Lots of dark fruits in aroma and taste.  May be the killer I expected if aged a little.  Thanks jmichael.,4.0
4138,Westvleteren 12,"ok, Lets see what all the hype is about. Upon the pour I am not overly impressed, as it is an unattractive muddy brown with a parchment coloured head that fades completely. The aroma took me by surprise. It’s tart and sweet pitted fruit, light horse blanket (almost cider-like), malty caramel and candied sugar. Smells like their might be a bit of wild yeast in the mix. The flavour is also cider-like with added presence of figs, raisins and some port with a disappearance of the acidity I found on the nose. It begins very sweet with candied sugar and dried light fruits that ends with port-like notes and peppery spice. The booze is masked tremendously well,better than any other quad I’ve encuntered. Now I’ve getting a date and caramel backbone with herbal notes lingering. The palate is round and soft with a sticky, long finish. Overall this is a very balanced and pleasant beer, but not as intense as I’d hoped.",4.1
4139,Westvleteren 12,"This beer pours a dark chocolate brown and cloudy color woth no head and very minute laceing to it. The aroma is of pitted fruits,and tends to be on the sour side. As you drink it there is an initial tang which fades into a mild sour pitted fruit mainly figs which also dissappears just as quick. Leaving your mouth with hints of fruit and a sweet funk to it. The palate is very sweet containg a lot of pitted fruits and an earbal flavor that stays around for quite some time.",4.4
4140,Westvleteren 12,"Oct ’07. Fresh Westy 12, from Olbutikken in Copenhagen. 



What can I say that hasn’t been said? Lovely...and now I can dream about trying a bottle with some age on it. From everything I can taste in this beer now, that would be divine. 



Oct ’08. Roughly year-old bottle. Yep. It rocks. 4.3 at least. Mmmmm...mmm.



Nov ’09. Older bottle, best by 23.04.11 on the cap. Splendid, splendid beer. Mulled cider with raisins initially, later a surprising intensity of cherry juice.  This is a 4.5, not a 4.3. I’ll bump to 4.4. 


Oct ’13. 2005 bottle. Pours deep cloudy brown into my St. Bernardus chalice. Short-lived off-white head. Nose is spicy; flavor is perfection. So smooth at this age with microcarbonation, beautiful sweetness, zero sign of the alcohol. This one ages like a beauty. Compared to the St. Bernardus SE I had a few days ago, this is sweeter and smoother, overall more enjoyable. Rochefort 10 (a few weeks later) is absolutely no contest. Definitely a 4.5. Probably a 4.6. 



Nov ’14. 2009 bottle (no collar on the glass). Softer and more subtle than I remember, but not kicking you in the teeth with the first sip can be a very good thing. As I make my way through the bottle the caramels and raisin and yeasts offer everything one could want in a dessert beer. 


Nov ’15 Head to head with a 9-year-old St. Bernardus 12 SE. Spicier, very tasty, probably better one sip at a time. But it loses overall; the Bernardus SE is smoother, creamier, and more rewarding at the scale of a full glass. Splendid stuff.",4.5
4141,Westvleteren 12,"33 cl bottle, bougth at Ølkonsortiet in Aalborg - thank you! Dark brown reddish color. Small beige head. Lots of flavors; much sweetness, with caramell, fruits, dried fruits, herbs... Vinous and carbonated, but not too much. Very balanced and warming beer!

4143,Westvleteren 12,"Finally, I get to try the famous Westy 12. Sampled from the Yespr collection, shared at Cellar’s Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours a cloudy dark burgundy brown brew with a slow dissolving off-white head that has some awesome lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, roasted nuts, dark pitted fruit, a touch of licorice and some toffee.   Taste is medium to full bodied, lightly carbonated, thick, creamy with some dark berry and caramel malt flavor. Finish is semi-sweet , soft with a toffee and licorice aftertaste, plus plenty of alcohol warmth.",4.5

Dirty, cloudy, brown color with a thick initial bright tan head that turns into a very nice 1/8"" protective coating. Figs and some dark fruits on the nose. Very complex taste with a wonderful balance of malt, darkish fruits, molassas, vanilla, toffee, caramel with a very nice carbonation to give a great mouthfeel. Lenghty aftertaste. Way too hard to determine if this is ""the"" best beers in the world, but you won’t get a complaint out of me. Thanks Papsoe",4.3

Complex, malty, vinous taste with layers of ripe fruit, oak, vanilla, molassas, bittersweet chocolate and seasonal spices.  Modestly hopped, with a full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  Finish lingered, but wished it could have  lasted longer.  Just to add to all of the superlatives lavished upon this brew, here were some of the most remarkable flavors that could be associated with the word ""beer"".(purchased a few years ago at Whole Foods, Vienna Va)",4.9

4151,Westvleteren 12,"Had this in a back-alley pub in Mechelen, the night of the Belgian Grand Prix.  What a great way to top off a great weekend.  There is literally nothing at all wrong with this beer.  It pours very dark brown, but is not real thick.  the head is plentiful and tan and laces throughout the entire experience.  The aroma is so rich and full that is hard to put into words.  The flavor is unbelievable.  There’s fruit.  Raisins and plums and dates and a some berry I couldn’t pick out.  It’s got a little spice and brown sugar, and malt.  Amazing.  Just amazing.",4.9
4152,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #500.  Bottle.  Pours a dark brown, about the color of darkly stained walnut.  Head is about two fingers of frothy tan.  Lacing begins right after pour.  Aromas are of raisins, soil, wet leather, chestnuts and dates.  Flavor is incredible, but it takes a second to blossom after each sip.  At first, my thought was, this is it, but it kept developing in different directions.  Starts off with a brown sugar and malt presence, and it finishes on a very similar note.  Between these bookends, however, it heads down fruit paths that remind me of dates, plums and raisins, before going back to a brown sugar finish.  The liquid is fairly thin... I noticed it when I was pouring... but the mouthfeel is anything but.  Big body and big flavor with a nice alcoholic warmth and just a touch of a bite.",4.8

4154,Westvleteren 12,"In De Vrede cafe. Honey sweet grassy aroma, spicy evocative Yirgacheffe notes. Sweet rummy, spice flavor, lingering tingely chocolate and plums in the finish with just a little vapory warmth. A very special beer, and fun to try it fresh at the source. 8/5/8/4 16

Previous Rating: 9/15/2007 Bottle, from Aarhus. Deep brown, just a bit of glow around the edges. Rough bubbles settle into fine sticky tan. Leathery tobacco, raisin-heavy Christmas pudding, mineral wind off the ocean. Flavor is raisiny port, molasses, rum, licorice, ink. Carbonation level is toward the full side, but not aggressive. Lingering treacle note. Lives up to the hype, but doesn’t necessarily push past it. 8/5/7/5 17",4.2
4155,Westvleteren 12,"Celebrating a big day with a big beer.  Top 1% with a 100%.  It poured a dark and cloudy chestnut brown with a light tan head.  Complex carbonation giving obvious life to the goblet.  Spicy, nutty, rich malt, plum, orange, cherry aroma.  Robust flavor of dark plum and berry.  Sugar and something slightly anise as well.  Coffee and chocolate flavors presented themselves later in the tasting.  This beer will move on you...a complex dance of flavors with every sip.  The six pack was a Father’s Day gift and I’m anxious for another reason to open a bottle.",4.8
4156,Westvleteren 12,"Pour was a super dark brown with some dark red and copper highlights.  The head was borderline tan with slight retention and little if any lacing.  This beer showed incredible depth and complexity in terms of aroma.  The first rush is malt, chocolate and licorice.  As it opened up aromas of fig, cherry, yeast and spice came into play.  Later into the beer I got brown sugar and grape soda.  The flavor was equally complex, seemingly having shifted gears each time I took a drink.  The initial flavor is a fairly straightforward blend of chocolate, malt and dried dark fruits.  As it progresses more tart fruits come into play like cherry and raspberry.  Yeast is noted as well.  Then I got a very distinct flavor of grape soda.  Not grapes, but purple, fizzy grape soda.  The mouthfeel was very nice and the alcohol was completely hidden.  A whirling dervish of a beer.  One who’s ever changing aroma and flavors give it an extra point or two in my rating, even if I didn’t think it was one of my favorite beers ever.",4.1
4157,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Nose is deep. Lots of sweet malt character, very similar aroma to the Bernardus 12. Fig up front, spice; a touch of sourness; and some hop aroma. Other fruits, possibly pear, and a faint hint of chocolate. Very dark brown, near black. Swirly head with small tight bubbles around the edge. The flavor and palate are astounding. The beer is heavy and thick, bordering on syrupy, but so utterly smooth. The finish is crisp and slightly spicey, taking the edge off such a sweet beer. The alcohol is strong, but balanced, reminiscent of a good bourbon. Strong dark fruit flavors with oak and chocolate. I understand why this beer is so highly regarded, but there is possibly too much alcohol presence.",4.4

4160,Westvleteren 12,"Dark rich colour. Aroma is very complex but sweet fruitiness tends to stand out.

Sweet fruitiness, rich malts and a warming finish.",4.4
4161,Westvleteren 12,[Thank you oslo2116] I have been trying many beers for the past few years but only started rating them then past few months after some urging by a couple of friends.  I thought it would be fitting to make this the first beer I’ve rated on Ratebeer because it’s the best one I have ever had.  I am seriously thinking about going to Belgium and getting a case.....or two.  Pours a chestnut brown with tan head.  Aroma fruity and nutty and spices.  Flavor is unparalled.  Tremendously complex.  I would love to spend more time detecting all the flavors/aromas of this wonderful brew.  Very smooth and absolutely no alcohol burn which is very impressive for being 10.8%.,5.0
4162,Westvleteren 12,"An honor to drink such a delicious brew.  Thanks to Carlos for getting 6 bottles of this heavenly beverage for me.  Pours a gorgeous light brown with an off-white head.  Strong lacing that sticks to the sides of the glass for longer than you see in your standard beers.  Aroma of mixed fruits and spices.  Smells like a loaf of freshly baked bread at Christmas time.  The flavor is out of this world - a phenomenally rich malt body and flavor.  Incredibly smooth finish.  The finish is akin to that of fine aged scotch - where there is no alcohol burn, just a smooth experience from the time it hits your lips until you finish your last sip.  I’ve got 5 more bottles of this and will save them for the most special occasions that arise.  Fabulous.",5.0

4165,Westvleteren 12,"Very excited to try this one out.  Perhaps I was a bit too excited as I may have poured too hurriedly into my chimay goblet and this resulted in a dissapointing, smaller head than expected. However, (very) fortunately I have a few more of these to pour with a good deal of prudence. Despite this minor pouring setback the brew had a beautiful chestnut brown color, and still a fair head with nice lacing.  The aromas sweeping off of the glass were fantastic and complex.  Mocha, nutty currant, figs yeast, wheat, cherry, berry aromas emerged and evolved throughout the session.  The body of this brew is simply perfect, with a velvety smooth texture and light warming sensation down the throat.  The flavors evolved tremendously while drinking and each sip seemed different than the previous.  Coffee/toffee charateristics emerged first quickly devloping soft and subtle spice flavors, yeilding hints of clove.  The fruit flavors were always present but evolved from berry, plum to earthy to some surprisingly acidic sour apple tastes, and again back to chocolate covered raspberries and a distant woody smokiness.  Over the hour and a half or so I spent enjoying this the flavors and aromas took me to such different levels that I had to respect this beers fine character.  While its reputation had filled me with certain expectations,  this beer certainly deserves its reputation and delivered  becuase of its layered complexity and incredible structure.",4.6
4166,Westvleteren 12,"I suppose this crown jewel of beers should be the the right one to drink for my rating number 1000. A 330ml bottle was bought at Plan B in Copenhagen in early August 07 and enjoyed at home in Tromsø some weeks later. Thanks to the guy at Plan B who in fact made some efforts to trace down a bottle on my request - great service. The elegant cap of the bottle is dated 01.11.2008. Served at cellar temperature.
The first pour gives a brilliant clear mahogany coloured body topped by a creamy, beige head leaving fragile lacing on the glass. The second pour, with the sediments, reveals an opague chestnut body. Aromatic nuances of dark bread, malts and raisin - however, the smell gives an impression of being a bit closed. Delicious in taste with delightful and robust malty depths followed by flourish prunes, then both dates and plums come to support added by dark candy sugar. The best part is maybe the lingering, lovely finish of bitter dark malts, herbs and spices. Developing and changing mouthfeel. Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness. Full bodied, but not cloying, and therefore very, very moreish. I will be hunting high and low for another bottle of this great stuff (25.08.2007).",4.6
4167,Westvleteren 12,"Amazingly good. Pours a deep brown with a tiny, creamy beige head. Notes of apricots, raisins, plums and a malty earthiness in the nose.

Very pleasant. Overall, a wonderful and complicated beer.",4.9

4171,Westvleteren 12,"Wonderful treat brought back from Europe by a friend.  Aroma was subtly spicy with a sense of malty sweetness and hints of candy sugar.  Light character of dried cherries perceived upon initial pour, faded into spicier notes when the beer warmed.  Appearence was a hazy dark brown with some burgandy highlights.  Very little carbonation and very thin head (may have been too cold on initial pour) but what head there was had a medium tan color.  Flavor profile was dynamic.  When cool, the flavors were dominated by rich maltiness, some plum/ raisin hints of characteristic belgian yeast.  As it warmed, the sugars became balanced by the phenolics from the yeast and the maltiness diminished.  Mouthfeel was rich and full, despite low carbonation.  Significant levels of residual sugars combined with what seemed like a wheat character to create a silkiness that was quite enjoyable.  Overall, a great beer, one I’m happy I enjoyed!  Is it the best beer in the world?  Not sure, but it is a fine product that I wouldn’t mind having access to more readily!",4.5
4172,Westvleteren 12,"Frosted pint glass served from Nitro tap at...Yeah Right!!
Poured carefully into a Chimay Goblet. Date ? (I’ll have to check the cap later) Dense, creamy light brown head with great retention eventually leaving a nice lacing. Body is slightly murky brown. Not much carbonation after the pour, at least that I could see. Beatuiful sight. Heavenly aromas! Yeast, dark fruit, caramel, candy sugar- everything you would expect from a quad but nothing out of the ordinary. Complex flavors hinted by the aroma with some dry bitterness. Very well balanced. Such a smooth mouthfeel! Hardly any sign of the alcohol. Incredibly drinkable for a big beer.

This was my first, and more than likely last, experience with Westy 12. As good as it was there are other more accessible Quads (St. Bernardus 12, Trappistes Rochefort 10) just as good that don’t break the bank like this does. One of those ""At least now I can say I tried it"" beers. Now onto the Dark Lord!!",4.5

I was surprised at first scent to discover that even an inexperienced beer drinker would determine that there is something familiar in this brew’s aroma. Banana yeast, coupled with some other fruits and subtle spice combine to make a very sweet and pleasent aroma. appears very dark brown with a shaving cream tanish head that laces a bit. First sip was outstanding, probably due to the anticipation of tasting one of the world’s best. Initial sweetness, some fruits, cherries, spices, and some peppery alcohol dominates towards the end. Sweeter as the beer warms up. The complexity is awesome, and the beer almost changes completely as you take that last sip. A very nice treat.",4.7

Fittingly for my hundreth rate, an exceptional beer that many consider the best in the world. The 12 is a feast for the senses and a beer that you really should track down and try if you possibly can. I still remember the first bottle I ever had (in Lowlander with tashi) vividly. It looks fantastic in the glass, ruby red with a good head. The fruity aroma of molasses, plums and raisins is delightful preparation for the rich, fruity, complex flavour. The alcohol is well concealed and the varied caramel and berry flavours surge to the fore. The mouthfeel is perfect, coating the mouth just so. Truly an awe-inspiring drink that you can’t help but wax lyrical about.",4.8

4179,Westvleteren 12,"#1000. Consumed in a can with a straw.j/k Bottle best before Feb 8, ’09 thanks to Eyedrinkale. I can already sense an assertive aroma just from popping open the cap. A pour into the snifter reveals a dark cloudy burgundy with a tall head. The head is firm and defined with cascades beneath it as I swirl. Lacing is clingy and dense. The aroma is excellent with assertive floral sweetness and spiced notes. I pick up cardamom, earth, baking chocolate, cloves, honey, molasses, pineapple; I just can’t dissect it thoroughly enough, yet perfect balance is maintained. This is actually lighter on the palate than I was expecting, though it’s still very full bodied and creamy. I’d say Rochefort’s offering is a little more dense. The alcohol comes through, but it’s not bad. The finish is drying with dark fruits throughout. A thin sweetness akin to honey balances things out. Each sip is a journey starting with the more acidic notes of plums and spices, fading into a semi-sweet territory like molasses, cherries, white wine, licorice, and lingering on a tangy, zesty flavor before my tongue is left with sensations of earth, honey, figs, and other fruits. This is easily one of my favorite Belgian brews with its sophisticated flavor profile, immaculate balance, and assertive palate.  I don’t know if it lives up to 100% of its hype or the fact that it’s so hard to get (especially since a couple of other delicious quads are a bit more handy), but it is seriously a very damned good beer.  Seriously.",4.1
4180,Westvleteren 12,"Number 200! Thanks Matt for this gem! Celebrated as I moved into my first house! I liked this as much as the Rochefort 10. Poured dark brown with large white head.

Very smooth and complex.",4.6
4181,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle share with cmr1517.  Big thanks man.

4182,Westvleteren 12,"15 months old bottle. Poured a very dark, almost opaque brown with a large & dense off-white head, and ample lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, brown sugar, a complex yeast profile (strong spiciness; cinnamon, vanilla), liqourice, raisins, dark chocolate, also some (welcome) oxidation, plus a slight Noble-hoppiness. Deeply malty taste, excellent balance between spicy dryness and vanilla/butterscotch/dark sugar sweetness. Great complexity. Silky mouthfeel, low carbonation. Pretty nice..",4.7
4183,Westvleteren 12,"Wow.  Thanks to Dan for the sharing of the bottle first and foremost.  
Did a blind tasting next to Bernardus 12.  
At first, I could not taste a difference, but after a few tastes the balance and the bright fruitness made this beer stand out so much that there was not even a question as to what beer was which (besides carbonation and color issues, which made it even easier to tell).
There was a very soft head to the beer.  A slight nuttiness in the aroma and an estery fruitness that was completely pleasant, if a little understated.  The taste was first of bright fruit, then of chocolate, and then, and then and then... this beer is deeply complex, but so simply complex that it is difficult to really get everything with a small sample, or even one beer.  
There was a slight, pleasant oxidation of the beer.  And the palate lingers in a honeysuckle sweet remembrance that is at once a jubilant thing  for the experience of having this beer yet is      depressing because I know that it will be a long time before I enjoy this beer again.
The hype, for me, is validated.  Is it the best beer in the world, probably not.  It is damn close though, if only because it reminds me of the first time that I had expedition stout; a time when my favorite beer was McEwan’s Scotch Ale (and I had not even found ratebeer yet), and my first taste of Traquair Jacobite Ale.  This beer makes me really appreciate and love beer.

Taste is nutty, sweet maple syrup, spicy, alcohol.  Something different in every taste.  Full, sweet mouthfeel.

A deep Malbec wine leaning toward cinnamon.  Dark chocolate cookies thick with rum.  Lighter moments of bananas and clementines.  The citrus punch resonates in the mouth after swallowing, slowly giving way to a visceral pulse of warm breath, though the alcohol is hidden.  Finishes with an expansive echo of honey, strawberry and dark spice.  Palate is at once delicate as a flower and forceful as fire.

First impression on palate is mint followed by a spicy oregano.  There is a an stringent rush at the end.  Would drink more if it was easier to get.",4.1
4196,Westvleteren 12,"A truly remarkable beer and the best I have ever tried.  The color is a rich reddish amber-brown with a thick, creamy, rocky, tight-nit, beige head.  Head duration is nearly fully lasting with Belgian lacing.  Malt is the dominate aroma with bread, toffee, and a hint of roast.  In the background are sublte hints of orange, pear, cherries, dates, a touch of smoke, and a bit yeasty.  The flavor is a symphony of tastes.  Sweet malt greets the palate but is tempered with the hop bitterness and a slight touch of fruit.  The finish leaves a hovering of maltiness on the palate that gently fades away.  I highly recommend that everyone try this at least once.  Without a doubt this is the best and worth the wait until I got to my 1000 rating.",5.0

4199,Westvleteren 12,"So, to be honest, I have sat at 99 beers rated for the last three weeks almost entirely in part because I haven’t known which beer I could, should, or would rate for my historic 100th beer.  As trivial as this may sound, it has played on my mind quite a bit.
First off I thought, pick the beer that you first drank and loved as a teenager.  Then I proceeded to, pick the most Canadian beer (me being Canadian and all).  Then I moved to the thinking, ""this is ridiculous, pick any beer you get your hands"".  Then, nothing.  As such, I have been sitting on the verge of the 100 beer club since early June (almost 1 month ago).  
Enter my backyard neighbour, a fun-loving American chap with a Belgian wife, whom I just got to know over the last few weeks when we have shared a couple of wheat beers, and a couple of whites.  Well, low and behold to my shocking surprise, Jim pipes up and tells me that he has 2 bottles of Westvleteren 12 sitting at his apartment waiting for a special occasion.  I told him, ""Jim, I am told the day you open a Westvleteren 12 is the special occasion.  Everything else is trivial"".  
Blah, blah, blah, the sappy story ends with Jim cracking open the beers and passing me the glass.  
The rest is history, just as people describe.  This is truly the most unbelievable beer I have ever tasted, and makes me want to re-rate the last 99 beers and knock them down a point or two.  
How in the names of all things holy did these monks pack 10.2% alcohol into this beer?  If you are lucky enough to drink it, then you will know what I am talking about.
Jim, my neighbour and friend, bottoms up.  You the man.

We compared the 2006 11% Gouden Carollus Cuvee van de Kaiser and the Rochefort Trappistes 10. This was a night to remember indeed. My preference is still the Cuvee van de Kaiser. Nevertheless, the monks at the Abbey do produce an incredibly superb beer. It is a real pity that it is so expensive and difficult to find. The high level of alcohol is unnoticeable. It is a very subtle and smooth beer with several flavors tightly knit together. Sweet but only mildly bitter. The foretaste is a disappointment. (Hmmm, it isn’t that good.) Then the full flavor kicks in. It is delightful. This is surprisingly smooth, not at all what I expected. Each sip is to be savored for several seconds. The aftertaste is likewise very subtle as different flavors melt away. It does not coat the mouth and throat in the way that the Cuvee does. The range or spectrum of flavor is not as wide.

Aroma is full of delicious aroma and some butterscotch and gorgeous, nostril-filling fruity esters. Divine. Flavor is chock full of gorgeous, mouth-savoring notes, including caramel, dark candy, plum, rich fruits, brown sugar...amazing. Extremely drinkable and as good as a beer as I’ve ever had. We had it side by side with an ’07 Westy 12, and this one destroyed the latter. Amazing.

Huge thanks to my dear friend peabody for this one. Looks beautiful. The smell doesn’t hit me as well as the Westy 8. The taste is amazing and so smooth for a 10% beer. Best in the world? Tough call. I think I like the Westy 8 more. Still, a fantastic brew here.",4.9

4214,Westvleteren 12,"Very exciting tasting 6/2 thanks to Jhop   and friends.  Aroma- nothing dominating but a nice complex blend of light roast, perfumey alcohol, dark fruit and banana.
Appearance- Hazy brown, tan head and hot legs.  Flavor- Similar to the aroma but a subtle hint of a noble hop variety into the warm finish.  Palate- medium-full body with a delicate presence in the mouth that is only found in a westvleteren.  Killer Quad.",4.4
4215,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with a small light tan head that fades leaving minimal lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, slightly burnt caramel, figs, alcohol, slight banana, and yeast spice. Taste is the same as aroma with just a slight residual sweetness. Medium mouthfeel with a nice but not hot alcohol warmth and mild bitterness. This beer lived up to all of the hype. I can’t wait to get my hands on one again.",4.5
4216,Westvleteren 12,The taste really flourishes at the end of the sip.  Its as if its aromas are released only after imbibing.  Great beer.  Worth the hype?  not sure.,3.9

4218,Westvleteren 12,"This is the last bottle from my first trade with Maria.  I had consumed one of these during my ’Iron City"" days and found it to be ""neat"" then.  Ignorance is not always bliss.  Pours a murky and mysterious dark brown with hints of brown arond the edges.  A large bubble head that is quite rocky erupts from my less than gentle pour.  Spice and sweet nose.  Rasins, and candied figs.  Body is also gently spicy with well balanced malt.  this beer is no way in your face about anything. I moved out of my standard consumption area (the basement) partly due to the beautiful day here in NY and the fact that my cats will not leave me alone at all since I opened this beer.  It seems they desire it like they desire tuna or catnip.  If you read my posts, the cats at times have given their two cents on a variety of styles. This time their antics drove me to the porch.  A fantastic rounded finish that makes you questiion whether or not his may be the best balanced beer on the planet.   #200",4.5
4219,Westvleteren 12,"Indeed, the best Belgian brew I have ever tried. Worthy of the #1 beer in the world status. Opened my bottle with jarpag after sampling his ’05 bottle in celebration of college graduation. My bottle is from mid-late ’05.  Poured a deep mohogany color with a small beige head that cascaded around its edges and good lacing throughout a whole Trappist glass. Then came the aroma....wow! Blew me away with thick notes of Belgian yeast, malt, banana, raisin, dark fruits and raspberry! Flavor was similar to the aroma, but soooo incredibly complex. Each sip was a new experience, and the palate was unique all its own. Plum, raisin, candy sugar, more banana and pear. Perfect -a mouthfeel that is nearly un-describable, so velvety smooth and numbing in the mouth, it keeps the wonderful flavor on the back of the tongue forever. This beer is definitely worth all the hype, and I am stoked to have tried it along side another bottle! It epitomizes the Trappist quadrupel genre of beer. Cant wait to have this one again!",4.6
4220,Westvleteren 12,"2005 Bottle from kramer17801 - thanks for the chance to dive into this.  --- sampled next to an ’06 on May 28th ’07 in celebration of my graduation from college.  This brew deserves the hype, I was definitely not let down.  It was very unique in many ways... The aroma was very enjoyable with some molasses, oak, plums, and a subtle raspberry punch.  The Westy was sooooo wonderful in the mouth.  So rich, smooth, velvety, complex and soft.  I wanted to take a bite out of the side of my cheek and lips after swallowing.  The carbonation was so elegant and perfect - hard to describe its superiority - it needs a 6 out of 5 for palate.  An all-around unbelievably complex beer and one which is deserving of holding the top spot - especially b/c it does not appeal to a certain preference  - I think it is a beer that all can enjoy in their own way!",4.5

Westvleteren 12
12 oz bottle
Capped 10/30/09 (bottled 06),found  God 05/07
Moderate pour in a tulip glass.

Poured a very murky dark brown with a moderate to large frothy mostly to fully lasting beige head.

Smelt of moderate to strong plums, raisins, vinous, with light cinnamon, cloves, caramel, mushroom yeastiness.

First sip was like an injection of Godliness.  My tastebuds got shocked all the way into my spine.  Upfront moderate sweet bitter and light sour everything followed by a strong bitter yeast moss and moderate sweetness on a long finish.

Palate was medium to full bodied, softly carbonated, creamy and slightly alcoholic.

Overall, the nose does not do it justice.  It tastes like mystery and is so beautifully balanced throughout, it is dangerously drinkable for a quad. Godliness in a bottle.",4.4
4222,Westvleteren 12,"My first ratebeer rating.  Bottle dated 06-12-09.  Tasted at near room tempature out of large brandy snifter.  Appearance dark caramel color with little head and beautifal lacing.  Some yeasties..  Complex aroma but difficult to pick out individual aromas (muted).  Tasted dates,cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, molasses and slight caramel. Overall taste reminds me of a fine cognac in complexity.  Pallatte is soft and silky yet thick with very, very, very long finish.  I was still tasting aspects of it after having a sausage, bacon and pineapple deep dish pizza.  How do I get more of this?",4.5
4223,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to my old long time friend Nick going out to Belgium to bring back a few cases of this masterpiece to the Northwest  - http://nickwusz.googlepages.com/westvleteren  When he came back, knowing the story made the experience so much more enjoyable.
The nose is just unbelievable.  Plum, butterscotch, caramel, butter, every dark sweet scent perfectly ripened, very pleasurable.  Appearance is really dense, but not too much sediment. Not like the Brune from Abbayes des Rocs we drank right beforehand.  Westy is finely filtered, but still dense.  
Flavor slight burn when it was cold, but the cold sharpness really faded into pure smooth silky goodness about 10 minutes into it.  It has an amazing fully loaded body, so many textures and contours.  The flavor was the most complex I’ve had.  Cherry, maple, nutmeg, chocolate, but not too sweet like a grand cru, and again, amazingly clear flavors with such a high alcohol %.  
Bottom line, this is the most skilled brew I’ve had to date, I’m being as objective as I can as so many people feel the same way I do.  Knowing the monks don’t mass produce it despite the demand only increases its succulence.  It’s made with care, dedication, appreciation, and profound skill.  I’m positive these elements show in the overall outcome.  My hat goes off Westvleteren and to Nick.  Thank you.",4.9
4224,Westvleteren 12,"I got to try this on tap at the cafe next to the abbey last summer and actually found it much more amazing and if I had rated it then it would probably have a higher rating from me.  I also brought back a six pack of the 12 and split my girlfriends six amongst the blond and the 8.  One of the twelves I used during a blind tasting of quads with drewbeerme and holdenn.  This is that rating.  White head sits on top of murky red-brown body.  Aroma is beautiful with lots of dark fruit, and malt.  Taste is syrupy but none the less fantastic.  Raisin, plum, sweet malt.  Large body matches large flavor.  Surprisingly though, Rochefort beat out the Westy when it came down to numbers.",4.4
4225,Westvleteren 12,"I don’t want to sound like I just jumped on the band wagon, but this is probably the best beer that I have ever tried.  Wholesome and rich, with a sweet chocolate/cotton candy aroma.  You can taste the ripe fruit and alcohol, and you notice the setery taste on the top of the mouth.  If I can do this justice, I would say that it tasted similar to a chocolate covered cordial cherry (real one, not those boxed types).  We just got back from Belgium, and I was fortunate enough to pickup two crates.  This is so good, that I don’t even want to drink it, in order to save it.",4.8
4226,Westvleteren 12,"Well... I was very anxious to try this beer and I had great expectations. But I coudn’t imagine how different this beer would be. I really liked it, it is VERY complex. I can’t describe the aromas or the flavours. I could sense some sweetness and some alcohol in the aroma, but some other things that I can’t describe. The flavour is wonderful, it is very balanced and the sweetness is very pleasant, as it is not so strong. A lot of fruits in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very nice also, and the carbonation is perfect for the style. A very unique beer. I have another bottle in my cellar for a future tasting, and maybe I will be able to rate it more properly.",4.6
4227,Westvleteren 12,"Ok the Westy 12..... poured out a deep brown with a red hue with some floaties and a lacing of white head that lasted throughout. Armoa is tons of dark fruits with raisins and plums the most dominant followed by a hint of alcohol. Taste is powerful and complex with plums and dark candi sugar, touch of dark chocolate and spice, it all finishes with a sweet alcoholic tingle as the alcohol was less hidden than I imagined. Mouthfeel was great, this is a wonderful beer no doubt but I must say I think that the beer is a bit hyped up and there are a few Quads out there that could be considered equals.

4244,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #1000   I did a side by side between an approx. 5 year old bottle (labeled at 10.6%) and a 6 month old bottle (labeled at 10.2%).  I will give the beginning stats on the five year old and then the traits / differences of the 6 month old.   The  five year old  bottle had a minor ""pfft"" when the cap came off.  Poured with the color of brown sugar with a nice beige head that was very respectable for the age.  The aroma is full and open with plums, raspberries, brown sugar, thick caramel, earthy malt, red wine notes, buttered toffee, raisins and more - there is something new with each wiff.  Full body that’s thick and velvety smooth with some incredibly soft carbonation.  The flavor starts with brown sugar, Belgium earthiness, plums, raisins & smooth rich toffee-like earthiness.  The finish adds some spice and a surprising sharpness and some astringency.  As it warms the raspberry aspect comes out more and the finish loses some of the sharpness and becomes more lush and adds dark cherry, brown sugar and caramel. (9/4/9/4/18/4.4)    The  six month  version pour deep mahogany  with a dense tan head - everything darker than the older version.  The aroma has cola, brown sugar and other flavors of the aged version, but all of the favors are more subdued and sharper.  There is less earthiness, but more fruit.  More brown sugar and caramel earthiness as it warms, but nothing like the aged bottle.  The flavors are much tighter and hidden, the five yar was significantly more lush and opened up.  Medium / full body with fairly sharp carbonation.  The taste is more sharp with earthiness, very dark caramel, coriander and pepper.  The finish gets quite sharp with anise and  pepper.  As it warms it opens up more, but nowhere near where the aged version was from the beginning. (8/5/8/4/17/4.2)   Overall, it is well worth aging the beer.  I’ve held onto the aged beer for years and it was worth it.  Big thumbs up  for this exceptional beer, but if you have the patience with a fresh bottle it is advised to give this a bit of time to age.  The rating numbers are for the older version as it was quite a bit better.  I forgot to add on the original rating a big thanks to  mkofron  and  mad_scotsman  for the hook-up on the fresh bottle.",4.4
4245,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at ’t Waagstuk, Antwerp. Pours a deep, deep brown bordering on black with a dense and foamy one-finger off-white, bordering on tan head.  Nose is complex and distinctive.  Dusty and earthy notes are heavy, as well as dark pit fruits that round into a nice fruity sweetness.  Also significant yeast presence here, in the form of some interesting esters.  Well balanced between an overarching sweetness and a subdued, massively complex and inviting stable of other elements.  Taste does not disappoint:  the epitome of the sweet/savory interplay that I find in a lot of really well crafted brews.  Dark pit fruits in prunes and plums, caramel, hints of milk chocolate. Slight, complexity-adding yeast funk. Finish is short and sweet, after just a dash of mild alcohol.  The lack of alcohol presence in this beer is really to be marveled at.  Palate is so incredibly sexy:  stunningly smooth and velvety on the tongue, this is the ultimate in sipper beers.  Searched far and wide for this and it definitely did not disappoint. Easily the best I’ve ever had - 4.7 may as well be a 5 for me, considering how conservative I am in my ratings.

Update: had the opportunity to try a 25 year old (1983) vintage bottle of this at Ebenezer’s in Lovell, Maine. It held up - mouthfeel a little lighter, taste definitely sweeter and noticeably complex.  Estery, spicy notes faded and more caramel and chocolate came up front.  Aged quite well.

Aroma is sweet, but not cloying, with very present raisins, oak, and belgian yeast. Flavor is much more impressive than the Westy 8, with caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit, and a light alcohol presence all forming a quite wonderful brew. The creamy mouthfeel is probably the highlight of this very complex belgian quad, really explaining why it is so highly rated. It’s not the best at anything, but it does everything very well.",4.5

Sweet in the beginning and dry and warm in the end due to the high alcohol %. Smooth mouthfeel. Fascinating, the best beer I ever had.",4.9

I haven’t rated an old version yet, but I think it would bring the score up to about 4.6. ""I’ll be back!"" ---- Rerate: 1,5 years old - same batch; much more smooth and mellow.

Not quite as complex as I expected.  Flavor is similar to aroma with very sweet dark fruits highlighting the campaign. I can honestly say that I have not had a beer quite like this before, however it is not my favorite beer in the world either. Didnt taste any chocolate, surprisingly.

Delicious everyone serious about beer shoud try to get there  hands on one.  Thanks again for the bottle Ford9719.,4.5
4273,Westvleteren 12,"I’ve had this beer quite a few times but have finally gotten around to rating it.  I believe Kevster provided this one for me.  Thank you sir.  Pours a cloudy dark maroon with a somewhat lighty dense white head.  Big, luscious aromas swirling around the top of the glass.  Alot of dark fruits, berries, sweet malts, yeast, and a touch of chocolate round out the big notes coming off of this brew.  The taste is just mouthwatering as it hits the tongue.   The blend of fruit and light chocolate in this beer is near perfect as it masks the alcohol beautifully.  Sweet Belgian candy sugar coat the inside of the mouth in the aftertaste.  Finish is smooth and delightful.  Just heaven in a bottle.  I’ve got one left and I’m saving it.  Always a treat drinking this beer.",4.7
4274,Westvleteren 12,"Huge, huge thanks to the one and only Kevster for being generous enough to share this with us at the O Town Throwdown. I’m sure not many people have the chance to have this beer as one of their first 40 ratings, so I feel very honored to have the chance to do so. Pours a murky, dark, cloudy brown with an off white head. Aromas of plums, figs, apricots, chocolate, dates, dried fruits. I literally spent a good 15 minutes smelling and looking at this beer before I even attempted to taste it, savoring the experience. When I finally did take a sip, my mouth was assaulted with a huge array of flavors: fruits, candy, chocolate, nuts. Sticky, creamy, warming mouthfeel. Flavors are so intense and complex, cannot wait to try this one again, if I should ever have the opportunity. Swirling around in the glass, the beer leaves a thick coating on every inch it touches. Warming finish with a nice hint of the alcohol that is present. One of the few things in life that lives up to the immense hype that has been placed upon it. The most complex, flavorful, wonderful thing I have ever tasted. Well worth any and all effort to try it for yourself. For me so far, this is as good as beer gets.",4.7
4275,Westvleteren 12,"Muddy brown coloration. Aroma of champagne. Dense and creamy consistency. Notes of nuts, coffee and chocolate. Light bitterness. Good cream. Excellent aftertaste.

Só uma coisa posso dizer: é uma experiência pra nunca mais esquecer. Quer você goste muito ou nem tanto assim, não dá pra ficar indiferente depois de tomar uma Westvleteren 12. 
Creme denso, escuro e consistente. Coloração escura e MUITO turva, com abundante suspensão de sedimentos minúsculos, os quais são magicamente ""integrados"" ao líquido, sem decantar.
No paladar, extremamente complexa e possivelmente diferente de todas as que já experimentei. Densa, sedosa e algo ""licorosa"".
Paladar de nozes e um pouco de café, mas intensamente saborosa.
Seja ou não a melhor do mundo, trata-se, talvez, de algo muito superior (ou, no mínimo, diferente) das cervejas a que estamos acostumados, mesmo as outras trapistas.",4.7

Sabor e paladar mais completos que a 8. A 8 é mais suave/equilibrada, mas a 12 é mais completa.

4280,Westvleteren 12,"Drank at In de Vrede, across from the abbey. I did not expect this beer to live up to the hype. What beer could? Looks like a black-brown stew with a bubbly hat of creamy froth. Nose of apples and brown sugar and garden greens. Creamy, stout-like mouthfeel. A hoppy version of chocolate milk with cider notes, but there are other mysteries. Like the faint lemon zest near the end, what was that about? Spicy-hoppy finish. Yeah, so, in the end I was wrong. Hype fulfilled.",4.7

Aroma is heavy and dark.  Plum, raisin, vanilla, caramel, hints of roasted malt and smoke, and bread nose.  Flavor is very complex.  All sorts of dark fruits, oak, caramel, spices, and toffee.  Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and heavy.  Wow amazingly good.",4.4
4287,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks a bunch to moejuck and spector for sharing this with me and bruno. Had this blind with a st. bernardus special edition. I picked it out pretty easily after the first sniff at the aroma. Pours a dark brown with reddish hints with a light brown head. A little smokiness and some barrel flavor coming through. Very dark fruity and raisiny. Sweet and very creamy and smooth. The smoothness of this was one of its best characteristics.  I also noticed some tobacco and some sort of black cherry candy coming through, delicious.",4.6
4288,Westvleteren 12,"This is the absolute best Trappist beer I’ve tried out of the six brewed here in Belgium. Freshness code has 13/08/08 on the yellow bottle cap, 10.2% ABV. Appearance was smooth creamy off-white head with outstanding lacy bubbles which settles to a thin layer after warming. Color is Dark brown.  The smell is a fantastic malt aroma, along with different kinds of sweet fruit.  The flavor hits as soon as it enters the mouth.  The velvety caramel complex flavor with little to medium carbonation is something to savor.  All these flavors throughout tasting are just incredible.  Complex flavor that stays balanced all the way through, but keeps changing as the beer warms.  Its amazing how this beer keeps its complexity and taste throughout the duration of tasting.  I must say of all the beers I have tried so far, nothing has compared.  Since my first review, I have tasted many more of these incredible brews.  My opinion still holds that this is one of finest beers produced in the world.",5.0

Ending is an array of wonderful flavors with a slight alcohol burn.",4.5

It’s almost black, and the head is moderate. The aroma is wonderfully complex, it has notes of malt, figs, fruit, oak and hops. The flavour is sweetish and very complex, and in my mouth the dominant notes are malt, figs and other dark fruits, caramel, nuts, basement, earth and hops. The hops are very aromatic and gives a very nice bitterness, that is very unlike to other Belgian beers I have tasted. It’s an incredible beer!",4.6
4293,Westvleteren 12,"330ml bottle. Dark red, brown body with a nice creamy head. Both aroma an flavor is complex. Sweet malty, slightly roasted warming alcoholic, dry fruit, spicy and a nice amount of hops. It’s a world-class beer and difficult to come up with something new to say. I believe true beer lovers have Westvleteren very high up on their top list. I have had the pleasure of sampling this beer and the 12 a few times during the years. Sometimes I have rated the 8 above the 12 and vice versa. Finally I had the chance to compare them at the same time, and I must admit that the 12 are just a bit better. It’s easy to notice the family likeness of these and natural to compare them. The 12 is the big brother, has a little bit extra of everything, and still so delicate balanced. Nothing is dominating in any direction. This beer is close to perfect and still have the quality of offering the drinker a different experience depending on the situation.",4.7
4294,Westvleteren 12,"(Bottle, Man in the Moon, Stockholm) Dark brown colour with ruby notes, foamy off-white head leaving very little lacing. Fruity and spicy nose with dried fruit (raisins, figs), spices (cinnamon?), marzipan and hints of fresh berries (raspberries, strawberries) coming through after a while. Malty, fruity taste, slightly roasted with dried fruit (figs, raisins), spices and bittersweet notes of cold coffee and liquorice coming through in the long and spicy finish. Alcohol giving it some sweetness, but still very well balanced, and a chewy, fiery mouthfeel. What can be said about this beer has probably already been said, so I can just certify that this is quite a lovely brew, or rather a masterpiece. (Just a pity it’s so darn hard to come by at a reasonable price).",4.6
4295,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle I received from my wife as a Christmas gift and my 500th rating. Pours a warm, deep brown with a moderate, creamy tan head. Complex aroma of plums, prunes, dates, malt, caramel, and molasses, with no single element dominating any of the others. These same qualities were in the flavor as well. Again, no single element was overwhelming. Each piece was well balanced against the others, like an orchestra - harmonious. Smooth, silky palate. A bit of warmth from the alcohol at the finish. Quite excellent.",4.6
4296,Westvleteren 12,Bottle aquired about 12 months ago and keep in the refrigerator. Poured into a Westy chalice. After opening the bottle the foam began to bubble up. Bottle poured with a nice 1 finger biege head. The head thinned out but lingered with noticeable lacing as the glass was consumed. The color was a reddish brown with some sediment evident even though I tried to leave most of the year in the bottle. The nose offers a sweet character that reminds me of caramel and butterscotch. The flavor is dark dried fruit with raisins and dates dominating. The alcohol is well masked and the overall balance of this beer is exceptional.,4.3
4297,Westvleteren 12,"11.2 oz bottle.  Pours a dark-reddish brown with a caramel-colored one finger head.  The aroma is dominated by yeast (smells like freshly-baked bread), followed by malt.  You can taste the malt and yeast.  Finishes a little hoppy.  Great beer!",4.6

4299,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. I had just realised that this beer could be found outside Belgium when I found it at my local beershop. Thank you to Ølkonsortiet.

What a beer, the best I´ve ever had.

A redbrown beer with a huge and long lasting palebrown head.

Aromas dominated by dried fruits especially prunes and plums. Very nice, but mayby there could be a little more to the aroma (when speaking of the perfect beer)

Taste Is fantastic, thick flowing and fills the mouth with sweetness agian taste of prunes and plums. Very long and warming finish. You don´t feel the alcohol at all.

A very complex beer, where everything is very well balanced.

Rerated 160607 to exactly the same score. Still the best I´ve tasted.",4.7

4301,Westvleteren 12,Bottle. Thanks to shrubber85. Poured a dark reddish color with very little to no head. Aroma of vinager and malt. Taste is just so smoth and I can’t even explain what it taste like but it is so good.,5.0
4302,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #600 - It took me awhile to get a hold of this one, but I’ve had it twice now so I can try to do the rating justice.  It pours dark reddish-brown with a medium, enduring head that laces nicely.  The aroma is yeast, spices, and rather tart dark fruits.  The flavor has yeast and malts accented by slightly sour dark fruit flavors and some pleasant spiciness (coriander?).  Full bodied and lively on the palate, this brew finishes dry and mildly hoppy with some alcohol noticeable.  This is a really great beer.  I have to say though that I think I like the Rochefort 10 a little bit more.  
(Lastest bottle, 9/21/07, I couldn’t stop smelling this beer, so I’m bumping the aroma to 10.  It’s really amazingly fruity with berries joining the malt and yeast.)

Additional notes from 12/7/09 alongside a Rochefort 10 - Dark fruits in the aroma include cherries and figs, especially the cherries.  The myriad flavors including the aforementioned dark fruits, the malt, the spice, and more in this beer are just perfectly balanced.  What an enjoyable drinking experience.  Bumping overall to 19.  In the side by side I give it the edge over the Rochefort 10.",4.7

4306,Westvleteren 12,"My 100th rating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ah, what a sweet treat this one turned out to be.  I’ve studied trappist beers for the better part of two years now and this was the crown jewel of all my efforts at researching this epic brew.  I’ve sampled this on two separate occasions just to reinforce my thoughts.  Plus, with all the hype I attempted to be as objective as possible.  However, this is one of those rare experiences where it certainly lived up to my expectations.  Simply put, this is a beer of legendary proportions.  

Pours typical of most trappist quads with a nice fluffy head and good lacing.  The essence of dark plums, raisons and dates drift into my nose.  Further exploration detects the esters of a masterpiece of fermentation along with the dark candi syrup which this is a hallmark of.  Taking the first sip brings wave after wave of deep layers of complexity that forms a tapestry of flavours the likes of which I haven’t experienced before.  Deep levels of caramelization that waltz in and out of your senses along with the delicate essences of northern european hops that masterfully balance out the candied sugars that are intertwined.  The body is matched perfectly for this style as you are allowed to taste the delicate nuances the monks introduced and not bombarded with an over-the-top chewy mess as other inferior attempts have tried to do.  The finish itself is an experience that leaves you wanting to step away from the glass for awhile just to enjoy the afterglow of an almost orgiastic feast of the senses.  A whole additional layer of caramelization sets in with a warmth of light alcohol making its presence known.  Perfectly hidden only to escape at the proper moment to leave you wondering how such a brew came to be so well done.  Minutes pass as the finish lingers in your mouth and I wonder how long I can prolong this experience.  There, it slowly passes and I find myself newly enlightened by a masterpiece of the brewing world.",5.0
4307,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to JK for sharing this great beer with BadgerBen, JoeBrew, and myself last week.  The beer had a pronounced carob (chocolate) flavor and like Joebrew i detected the faintest hint of peat.

Aftertaste is long,  malty and sweet accompanied with dates and light bready notes.",5.0
4310,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a deep brown color, with brick red hues when held to the light. Half an inch of smooth and creamy tan foam tops it off. Thick sheets of foamy lace. Belgian chocolate, fruit, yeast, and alcohol in the nose.

First sip - oh my this is nice. Soft and smooth flavors of sweet plum, bread, earthy fig, rum, and mild chocolate dance and dance and dance. There’s a delicate but sharp tannin-like bitterness at mid sip that could be hops, or it could be bitter chocolate, or it could just be the alcohol. After a couple sips, I settle on alcohol as the cause, as its presence is sensed as a pleasant vaporous warmth in my throat, my lungs, my tongue, my sinuses… I’d certainly fail a breathalizer right now, and these were my first couple sips of the day. Now I lick my lips expecting alcohol, and instead get a yeasty bready flavor with some smooth Mackinac Island fudge.

Silky smooth mouthfeel - creamy, velvety, soft, luscious. Moderate carbonation, full body. Prolonged alcohol in the aftertaste. Becomes even more fruity and even spicy the deeper I dive into the bottle. This is like candy, very addictive.",5.0
4311,Westvleteren 12,"Dark. Begie creamy head. The aroma brings alot! Plums, vanilla, chocolatte,rassin and malt are some of all the aromas that goes to your nose. Also peppry. Pepper also comes in the flavor. The flavor and the palate is so extraordinary!",4.6
4312,Westvleteren 12,"In the fall of 2003, I took a trip to Belgium and sought out this beer.  When you hear so much about a beer, your expectations are through the roof.  I found it at a small beer shop in Brugge and brought it back to the hotel.  My first sip made me a believer.  It’s hard to know where the hype ends and the truth begins, but with this beer, I think the brewers have truly come up with something special.  I understand that St Bernardus is basically the same beer, but I’ve had that beer on several occasions, and while I find it delicious, it has not quite impressed me in the same way as the original.",5.0
4313,Westvleteren 12,"Much thanks to JK for letting me try this beer.  Poured from a 33cl bottle a dark brownish-red, with a small off-white head.  The nose exhibits a nice earthiness accompanied by an almost figgy sweetness.  There is a slight hint of alcoholic bite in the nose as well and just a slight hint of dark fruits.  The flavor is very nice with a silky soft alcohol burn accompanied by a nice toffee/caramel presence.  There is also hints of chocolate, raisens and a very subtle, almost islay scotch peaty character.  I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to try this beer, and it was great to sip this delicious nectar with JK and BadgerBen.",4.5
4314,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from moejuck. Dark drown with fluffy head. Aroma of figs,rasins,and grapes. The taste was the same with alcoholic finish. Chewy and smooth with wine like quality. Sweet but not overly. You know, this is a good beer but I don’t see how it is the BEST beer in the world.",4.1
4315,Westvleteren 12,"My bottle stated 11.2 ABV. Pours dark tawny mahogany w/ a medium sized semi creamy tan froth. Froth is spattered w/ tiny bubbles and reduces slowly to a fine lace and a dusty canopy. Aromas of bright, dusty, dried dark fruits w/ slight tart cherry (jolly rancher). Medium nectar w/ ample residual effers creats a creamy, velvety texture. I think the palate texture of this brew is what sets it apart. It’s amazing that an ale can feel like that. Flavors are bold w/ a mild to moderate sweetness that is quickly balanced by a peach pit bittering componant. My first sip was pure bakers cocoa. Dark, bitter and chocolatey. Very nice! There is a defined alcohol presence in the flavor profile that really kicks in on the finish. This is not offensive to me at all. Dried dark fruits like black cherry, plumb, w/ slight fig and raisons. Meaty tropshire like a well marbled Porter House steak and leather. Other nuances of chewing tobacco and dark cakebread, bakers cocoa, molasses, red grapes w/ the seeds, and caramel apple. The Cocoa lasts throughout the whole sip to the finish. This is a very warming brew. I can feel my blood temp rising in my face about my ears. The finish is bittered better than moderate with that huge alcohol goins’ ons’. Finishes w/ velety hops that linger well past midnight. Overall: this is a complex brew worthy of its reputation.",5.0
4316,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle.  Poured into a Tulip.  I am lucky to have had this beer on a few occasions.  My first was in Amsterdam at a bar called Gollum.  It cost 12 euros, and of course was worth it.  My brother drove to the abby and scored two crates of this so I now have 10 myself that I am aging.  This beer is wonderful.  STYLE, TASTE, AROMA, APPEARANCE, are all tops.  What I like most about the beer is its mystique and its availability.  You can find it, but it ain’t easy.  For those who can’t find it get St. Bernardus, the taste is similiar enouph.  And remember always pour into a Tulip....Cheers.",4.9
4317,Westvleteren 12,"Courtesy boboski.  Bottle from 2002.  Poured thickly into a trappist glass with an amalgam of various dark ruby-brown colors topped with a slow moving thin off-white head.  Aroma is apricot, plum, and a variety of spice notes that change by the minute.  A wonderful malt base aroma compliments along with the yeast.  The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect - medium in body with enough carbonation to further enhance the sensory intake of aroma and taste.  The taste is spicy and warm, has clove and fruit tastes that develop as it warms and the finish has a slight tart suggestion that lingers along with the warmth.  The alcohol presence is detectable only a bit after you sip.  Once I had a Rochefort 10, I somehow doubted that a Westy 12 could be better, but it is.  As a rater, you don’t really know what the limits of aroma, taste, etc. are unitl they’re surpassed, and this one did for me in a couple categories.  Much thanks to boboski and his borderline warped sense of generosity.",4.6
4318,Westvleteren 12,"Rating # 200. Two bottles from my cellar, one for my love and one for me, to celebrate my fiftieth birthday. These two westies are young of age, obtained this summer with only six months of aging. Yellow cap says “30.08.09”. Beautiful appearance; Sparkling and lively, dark mahogny body with a glimse of red. Mostly lasting fingerthick head with a light tan. Enjoyed lightly chilled in trappist glass. Intense and complex aroma. Starts yeasty with notes of almond and marzipan. Continues with layers of all kind of fruits over a malty base.
Taste of this sample is surprisingly earthy and yeasty, still very complex and soft, loaded with dark fruits (raisins, prunes, dates), delicate dark malts, and notes of chocolate, vanilla and ripe banana. Alcohol is well masked, only a pleasant heath in the mouth. Full-bodied with a light hopbitter finish. A truly great beer.",4.6
4319,Westvleteren 12,"Is this the greatest beer in the world?  Approaching a beer with such a reputation is not easy and it is hard to remain completelyl objective about rating it.... But here goes... I have had this in my house for over a year but some how resisted the temptation.  Served in the Duvel glass.  Pours with a medium sized light brown head that dissapates quite fast, on top of the deep cloudy dark bronze hue.  Lots of floatersin the glass that ease their way down to the bottom of the glass.  Pronounces orangey nose with sweet honey hints.  Massively complex taste.  Impossible for a amateur like me to distinguish all of the flavour.  Orange and pear fruits with hints of cognac and a sweet toffee like finish.  This is beer heaven.  Certainly one of the best beers I have ever had.  If not the best.  Although with at the time of tasting this having just under 600 ratings I don’t feel qualified enough to say whether it is the best.  A master piece though.  My advice.  Drink it all! Even the floaters",5.0

4322,Westvleteren 12,"Finally got around to sampling the famous Westvleteren Abt 12. Pours a nice amber/auburn color with thick tan head and leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is sweet toffee, creamy buttery malts, figs and brown sugar. The flavor is beautiful. Very warming with some alcohol evident. Buttery maltyness and a creamy sweetness. Huge toffeeish notes, a sweet roasty almond character, sweet pastry doughyness, some spicyness evident of cloves and peppery alcohol warmth. Caramel undertones and a warming dry finish. In short it’s perfectly balanced, creamy, buttery and delicious. However, it’s not my #1 in the world. I think that there is such a thing as supply and demand. Have a description like ""only a small part of their production going very far into the world"" and you’re bound to be extremely highly rated. But I can’t deny that it’s quality and still a great ale.",4.2
4323,Westvleteren 12,"Current production Bottle; Nose of caramel, brown sugar, yeast, and raisins, kind of like my Mom?s raisin pie; very complex! Hazy dark brown with a huge tan head that laces the glass thickly as it slowly recedes; three quarters of an inch left out of an inch and a half after five minutes. Flavor is mildly tart, with notes of sugary sweetness, spiciness, and raisins. The medium body finishes with tartness and a little alcohol warmth! Rerate 72607!984 Bottle 3/9/07 Flavor seems very similiar but I don not note any tartness; lots of dark fruits and caramel in the flavor and some alcohol in the nose, which lasts mildly to the finish. Even after 23 years, still a very good beer 9/3/9/418 or 4.3 but crbonation is very small!
12/31/2014 Second of the two 1984 bottles I possessed for the past 8 years. Nose is prunes, caramelized sugar, and a light note I attribute to oxidation but nothing major. Clear medium brown with no carbonation. Flavor is lightly sweet and darkly fruity with only very light oxidation notes and a very light hint of tobacco in the finish.  Nothing spectacular but a good stale bread flavor from the thin body. I would rate this 7/2/7/3/14 3.4  Quite an adventure drinking fresh and older Westy bottles (including the 6) over the 9 years I’ve been on Ratebeer.",4.2
4324,Westvleteren 12,"Paper notes from the Falls Tasting / 2006 YeHA!.  Bottle dated 07-2001.  Many thanks to Cap’n Cougar for making sure I had the opportunity to sample both this and the Westy 8!.  Mild sour malty aroma.  Deep cloudy brown color.  Long dry malty flavor, pefectly blended.   No alcohol evident.  I only wish I had sampled this far ealier in the evening.  Peace brother!",4.3
4325,Westvleteren 12,"2002. Last bottle ever sold at Knightly Spirits, Orlando, Florida. Complexity I’ve never experienced in any type of beverage. Pours what seems to me a perfect head with beautiful retention and pretty lacing, but the taste and aroma are the only things I’m concerned with. Beautiful ruby with swirling ruddy brown highlights. Aroma of raisins, prunes, white chocolate, heavy cream, red berries. Taste always seems different and constantly evolving, but never uninteresting. So full bodied and luxurious, to die for. Flavor near-perfectly balances malts and hops. While present, the hops only serve as an agent to add to the complexity, never overpowering, always intriguing. 

1975. At thirty years old, I’m mortified that the first thing I nose is a slight tinge of oxidation once I’ve poured it into the glass. Fortunately after the first sip the ever-present alcohol hides the ever-so-slight caramel/sherry presence. Less carbonation, otherwise an otherworldly treat.",4.8

4327,Westvleteren 12,"Bruges, Belgium, 2002. Recollection is not as strong as I would hope on this one, but recall it being exceptional. I did feel the Rochefort 10 edged it out at the time.",4.7
4328,Westvleteren 12,"It is a very complex beer, very enjoyable. Nice white-beige head with a dark brown colour. The first impression is very good. Aroma was not present enough but could find yeast and caramel notes. The taste is sweet, very well balanced, some wood, fruits, caramel and raisins...a explosion of flavours. Too bad I had only one bottle.",4.7
4329,Westvleteren 12,"A bottle of 06- Similar to my Favorite brew St. Bernardus Abt 12 but less hopy and a bit more complex.Pours out just like it looks in the left pic. Great carbonated brew with a tan khaki head which seems to bubble to the top. The smell starts to come out as you pour it out, smell starts off hopy, piny, citrousy, and moldy, then as it sits in the glass it goes into a sweet, caramel, dry raison finish. The taste is awesome a tru Quad with hints of sugar cane, sweet bitter peaches, and a chewy yeasty aftertaste. I will have an aged version of this brew and come back with a deeper description.",4.6
4330,Westvleteren 12,"Milwaukee YeHA! 2006

Thanks to Cougar for driving this up from Atlanta as well.  I was planning on saving it for rating #500 but it is hard to resist something like this placed in front of you, especially a five year old vintage (2001-07).  I guess I’ll just have to try the new top beer instead.  After having it I can see how it stayed at the top so long.  This is complex, rich and very busy.  If you are ever in Belgium you must pick this up - while it is hard to justify at $25 a bottle it is a steal at $5.
Aroma / Appearance - Caramel, chocolate, vanilla, strawberries and cream create a rich tapestry of scents which blend together to form a very inviting aroma.  The body is a rusty brown color with lacing that leaves a history of the level as you sip.
Flavor / Palate - Caramel and chocolate greet the tongue on the first sip.  After that comes fresh Swiss chocolate dipped strawberries.  It might be a little alcoholic but it is well masked by everything that is going on.  Honey comes to the fore of a perfumy and sweet aftertaste.  This is one of the most complex beers I have ever tasted.  I am tempted to pop open my single bottle just to have it again.",4.6

No other beer is this Perfectly Balanced.   This is definitely the BEST TRAPPIST I HAVE EVER HAD.  God bless.",5.0
4332,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle courtesy of sk8viking.  Thanks, Rene!!  Pours a beautiful, oily golden-amber appearance; light head formation and lacing.  Generous aroma, showing honey, maple syrup, dried fruits, and spice.  Perhaps the most nuanced, complex mouthfeel of anything I can recall: plenty of sweetness, sure - honey most predominantly, followed by maple syrup and belgian sugars - but also impeccibly balanced: citrusy hoppiness, plenty of esters and dry yeastiness to compliment the mouthfeel; rich without being overripe, satisfying without being ridiculous.  Mildly dry finish: yeast and spice.  Simply a fantastic beer.",4.5

The head settled into a creamy foam, showing the most amazing lace patterns I have seen on a beer, I just sat and swirled it around the glass for a while, watching the webs of beer wind their way down the glass, I  would have given the beer 6/5 for appearance if I could. The aroma, strong, complex... raisons, smoke, nuts, sweet warmth, alcoholic spiciness, you cannot even begin to describe what comes through. The body is sweet, warm, sticky and smooth, so smooth... Delivering a list of flavours too long to mention, the hops are amazing, not too bitter, not too flavoursome, a little green and spicy perhaps. The malt profile is stunning, layer upon layer of complexity... you think, for example ""oh, its chocolate, there is more chocolate than anything else!"" then you have another sip, and  something different grabs you. The finish is slightly restrained, with light hops and a sticky alcoholic warmth.",4.6

4345,Westvleteren 12,"The bottle came to me in a trade from BA dogfooddog, and was unlabeled, with a yellow cap indicating a best before date of 08 04 08, making this a little over a year old.  As I poured into a tulip, the beer came out murky dark brown and had a two finger thick foamy head.  The aroma was spicy-sweet, with the smells of fresh hay, ripe cherries, chocolate, brown sugar, and apple skins detectable.  The taste was about as smooth as I have had in a beer of this strength.  Sweet tropical fruit and spiced bread like malts interplayed with earthy yeast and spicy hops, and everything was in perfect balance.  The beer was somehow robust and delicate at the same time.  At this young age the alcohol was evident, but only as soothing warmth.  The mouthfeel was oily smooth, and the beer went down very easily and left a sweet aftertaste.  Very fine beer indeed.

I decided to drink it side by side with a 2006 St. Bernardus Abt 12 for the sake of comparison.  The color of the two was almost the same but the St. Bernardus was much more carbonated.  It also smelled stronger, and had a distinctly sour note in the taste that was absent from the Westvleteren offering.  The Westvleteren was sweeter and smoother than the secular cousin.  Bottom line; can’t go wrong with either of them.",4.6
4346,Westvleteren 12,"Almost every month i get 2 crates.
My experience is that there are huge differences between batches. I suggest that people mention the bottledate. For example 01/07 and 03/07 are way below standard quality. (less carbonation and thus rather dull)
This beer is ... well... awesome good. But people who have diffuculties to find this beer should know that this resembles  the ""St bernardus Abt"". Watou made this beer under license from the end of WW2 until 1992.  There is however a difference between a westy of 6 months and a fresh one. 
Just recently the monks have limited the visits to 1 car a month. (I know people who managed to go there 5 times (x3 crates) since  14 october 2006), those crates were then exported immediatly. So it will be even harder to find  this beer in the future.

Very slight trace of alcohol.  Fantastic.  Great lacing and creamy mouthfeel taboot.  The cherry note seems to take the forefront in the body - followed by smooth plum and banana notes.  The fruitiness lingers long into the finish, which is a bit hot.  I can definitely see the love for this beer, but isn’t the best I’ve had.",4.3

 Ageing gracefully. Showed lots of powerful toffee, rum and raisen, not at all expected for a bottle with some age. Dried out a touch as the beer warmed up to reveal harder bitter chocolate notes. Even finishes a touch salty Structure is very much in tact although I think the fruit has dropped out a touch due to aging. (score is as per original tasting.



August 2006 Bottling (tasted October 2006)
Ok – the big daddy! Thin creamy head breaks up after 15 minutes. Quite garnet / brown in colour, a little lighter than expected. Sweet malts on the nose show some toffee. The obvious flavour concentration never goes over the top.  Big mouthfeel. Whereas the ‘6’ and ‘8’ may have felt a little constrained the beer definitely drops all the shackles. Sweet malts, toffee, cooked sugar, aniseed – plenty happening. Palate structure is less impressive (all things relative), as it delivers the all flavours in a more ‘what you see is what you get’ style (ie perhaps a little forced). Doesn’t really have the obviously layers that a JW Lees Harvest Ale, or, dare I say, Redoak Baltic Porter, delivers. Notwithstanding, this is a great beer. e5.0 @ Afspanning ’t Waagstuk.

The taste... a lovely malty/sugary sweetness tops it all, but underneath one can find a lot, some hoppiness, caramel, honey, lovely fruitiness coming up from below... like plums with that acidity, only sweeter, just a hint of earthiness, alcohol, sone herbs/spices. Oooh. A chewy hoppiness in the aftertaste. Damn smooth, yeah, velvety is a great word. Yup... pretty much the best beer I’ve had. Not a 5.0... no... the aroma isn’t a 10. But damn close.",4.7

Poured a ruby hued brown with a frothy, fluffy, bubbly topped off-white head that slowly settled into a thin bubbly lacing, small amount of laced sticking.

Tasty aromas of plums and ripe raisin with a light caramel, anise medicinal, herbal, spicy rum-like alcohol, and just a great sweet maltiness.

Good, even, steady carbonation and a crisp, dry, sipping velvety smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel, pretty close to perfect.

Delicious quadrupel taste, caramel maltiness that is followed by a plum fruitiness and Belgian candied sugar, clove and a good light spiciness, softly herbal, a dirty yeastiness, the alcohol is warming in the palate, a bit sweet and spicy as well, and a dry yeasty, malty finish with a lingering spicy alcohol presence.

It was sweet malts and glorious dried fruits, so many I could not pick out each one.  The flavor just would not stop it was sweet malts up front then kept on blending and changing from different dried fruits, some raisins, apricots, cherry.  The finish was the best part.

This beer is in a league of its own.  It came to me from the bar with a big rockyhead that foamed and gained beauty as I waited for it to warm up a bit.  Dark brown in color with a tanish head.  The aroma is great, but subtle.  You can detect all the elements, sliky malts, spicy hops and yeast, with fruits, like raisins.  The alcohol is present but is enhancing and not overwhelming.  The flavor is even better than the aroma.  Dried friuts are present with spicy notes from the hops and alcohol.  everything is perfectly in balance in this beer.  All of the elements shine though like no other beer that I have ever tasted.  Excellents active mouth feel that coats the mouth, tickles the tongue, and just says drink me.  simply amazing.

I think this is a beer that beer lovers are afraid to rate honestly because they feel their other beer aficianados my have a more sofisticated palate than they have. My honest opinion is that this is one of the top belgian beers that I have tasted. Strangely it is so smooth that I can understand that some (including myself) can not express one defining characteristic to describe this beer. It is in the same class as St. Bernardus abt 12 and Rochefort 10. I still prefer the Rochefort. My recommendation is if you can try it at what you feel is a resonable price you should. However, for those that can’t afford it or choose not to try this rare beer.... you shouldn’t feel like you are left out of the ""beer club"". If you can try a St. Bernardus or Rochefort you are truly tasting beers in the same class that are as good or better depending on your taste.

4368,Westvleteren 12,"Complete re-write for a very fresh bottle

In short: A decadent Abt.  One of the best (if not THE best) of its kind.  Lives up to the hype.

How: Bottle 330ml at In de Vrede (pub in front of the Westvleteren abbey).  About two months old, bottling date on the cap. 

The look: Purple-brown body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention

In long: Intense aroma with earthy dark fruits, tobacco, chocolate and more. That beer has lots of great qualities but its body is my favourite of them all.  Big, rich, smooth, creamy, filling.  Swimming in this 5/5 body are a ton of malts and juicy leafy hops.  Flavors of dark fruits, toffee, milk chocolate, nuts, tobacco, wood, name it!  I was very surprised at how hoppy a fresh bottle is.  Lot and logs of juicy leafy hops with a medium slightly resinous bitterness.  Alcohol remains well hidden until a little bite at the end.  Totally decadent.  The sad part about being labelled the #1 beer in the world is that you cannot surpass the expectations. It is not my own #1 beer but it will always be in my top 50 nonetheless. It is sad to see that this wonderful beer is circulating a lot but mostly is borderline illegal ways.  Very soon we’ll come across suspicious looking dudes going “hash, pot, acid, westvleteren 12, mescaline”.",4.7

I’m thinking that a few years in the cellar will improve this considerably. Luckily I’ve got my hands on a few more bottles.
Not my favourite but it might very well be, when I rerate it in a year or two.",4.1

I scoured the beer list, well it was’nt so much a list more like a copy of War and Peace, could I find this mythical beer?The heart rate started to climb, fingers getting twitchy, the other three had decided on their beers ""come on Fin what are you having"", I started running my hands through my hair and getting more irritable by the minute, it must be here. The lady came over, I asked nervously ""Do you have any Westvleteren"" without answering she brought a laminated small sheet with a selection of Westvleteren beer back, I gave the others a knowing look and picked the 12. She slowly walked towards me with bottle and glass in hand, I licked my lips, this must have been how Bobby Moore felt when the queen presented him with the Jules Rimet Trophy, and like Bobby Moore I wiped my hands, though on my trousers not shorts and more through sweat than mud. the glass and beer were laid before me and it was expertly poured. I lifted it up and ’hark’ was that the voices of angels belting out ’Jerusalem’? I cradled the glass whilst the others watched intently, slowly I lifted it up, the group on the other table were huddled like a group of Hyena’s staring silently waiting for scaps, I fixed them a steely glance and they cowered back. A delicated nutty aroma, backed up with dried fruits and spices slowly started to fill my nose. The taste was sublime, incredibly full flavoured and complex with some silky chocolate and soft maltiness, some burnt sugar, superb. The place was silent and then I gave them a little nod and a wry smile a triumphant cheer rose to a crescendo. Fantastic, I felt waves of elation course through me, now for the Westvletern 12 1998  A8 A5 F10 P5 Ov19   4.7   I’ve had this a few times since that wonderful day back in 2006, had it at the Westy Cafe 2-3 times, at home 4-5 times and whilst I still consider this a truly world class beer I think that it needs some age on it to be truly excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed that beer then and whilst it was young I think the 1998 Westy I had was even better that day.  The bottles that I’ve had since then have all been young, fresh and a bit raw, even dare I say it harsh, the alcohol showing more and without the mellowness of age its just not the same beer. I have a few of these aging now and I will continue to rate it but next time it’ll have some years behind it.  A8 A5 F8 P4 Ov16  4.1",4.1

This beer is at the top of its class, and rightfully so. There is so much going on in this beer it’s hard to describe. Every sip is different. Chocolate, raisons, and roasted caramel stood out most when I tasted it. Brilliant long lasting head, and gorgeous overall appearance. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it.

4373,Westvleteren 12,"So, the best beer in the world? Well, it gave me my first emotional experience with beer, back in 1999! I’ve had the priviledge of sharing this beer with many many friends, I’ve probably given more of this away than I’ve drunk? Why? It is simply sublime, that fruity dark flavour, sweet, yet dry, but it’s that saline finish that for me seperates it from Rochefort 10. Best drunk, with friends, at In De Vrede.",4.5
4374,Westvleteren 12,"Finally, I got the chance to drink ""the best beer of the world"". A friend of mine hand it over from an outlet in Copenhagen where he had to ask in an extremely polite manner to please buy two bottles, one for him one for me.

I’ve had it in my celler for quite some time and today I drunk it.

And what can I say? First of all, it’s good. Very good. These monastery guys really know whats beer all about. Fruity, dark flavour, its got it all. I understand why beer lovers really love and love and love this beer over and over again.

However, for me, it’s too much of everything. I loved to drink it, I loved to smell it, I loved to feel it, but I didn’t love to feel its incredible taste. Not that it is not excellent (cause it is) not that it is not perfect (cause it probably is) but the hype is bigger than the beer from my point of view. It is objective fantastic, but subjective only GREAT.

I had problems finish it, probably mainly due to my love for not that complexe beers. 

Still, what can I say? It’s what beers all about, but still too much of a really good thing. 

As you probably understand, the beer puts me in a total duality of a fantastic experience and a feeing of drinkability and enjoyment. It was like ""Shit, this beer is gooooood"" with a grimmy face.

Thx munks, but youre not my first choice and probably never will be.",4.3
4375,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle received via SecretSanta.  Pours deep mahagony, slightly cloudy, with a medium sized creamy light tan head, somewhat diminishing to more rocky head with some spotty lacing.  Aroma is caramel roasted nutty malt (biscuit, meal), yeast (dough, earth), some straw and floral notes, alcohol at the end, perfumey as it warms up.  Medium acidity that grows as the alcohol continues to singe the tongue, well balanced malt and yeast flavored body, a hint of hops (floral) with some earth notes, overall a very good flavor, nothing offensive.  Full bodied and warm, fizzy palate with some lively carbonation though still pleasant.  Overall a very good beer, but it is not ""perfect"" in my humble opinion.",4.6
4376,Westvleteren 12,"I finally got my hands on this beaut.  Typically when I taste a beer I pick out flavor spikes - pine, oak, smoke, etc and highlight them in my rating.  What made this beer so intriguing was that the flavor profile was almost perfectly round.  No single flavor within the spectrum of caramel/nutty/woody etc really stood out, everything blended and balanced perfectly.

Mouthfeel was soft and round, very soft small carbonation, complimenting the flavor profile.  Nose was spicy/floral/woodsy/root beer.

While I can’t say this is my personal favorite beer in the world, I certainly can agree that this may be the best crafted beer in the world, and so have no remorse giving it a big rating.

And... I can’t wait to open the next 5 bottles over the next 10 years :-)",5.0
4377,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle 53F Trappist. Light banana aroma, with a touch of black licorice, a touch of chocolate. A very cloudy dark, dark brown color, with a tan head that lasts.  Heavy fusil tastes, very big tons of raisin, maybe dates too, finishes with warm bread plenty of alcohol as well, with a bit of corn flakes at the end. Sweet taste almost no  bitterness.  The date on it was 26.04.09 maybe I should have let it set for a year or two. That would have made for better balance.  Really big bananas and good bready malts.  I think I drank this bottle too soon. I should have given it a few more months or years, it tastes a lot like my homebrew and that really disturbs me. Good palate light but tons of carbonation. A good brew just consumed too soon, damn I have no patience.",3.8
4378,Westvleteren 12,"Number 500. Cap dated 08-03-09. Ross generously gave this to me as a surprise on our first trade. I had been trying to get this for awhile. Thanks BP! Pours a muddy brown, murky with sediment, with a lasting creamy camel head. The aroma is not very aggressive on this bottle, which is faint sugary plums and cherry. I really expected more out of the aroma, along the lines of a Rochefort 10.  Creamy and slight evervescent mouthfeel. Initial flavor of yeast,  dried fruit...very earthy. In the middle I get some licorice and cinnamon. This transitions to a slight bitter and warming finish. I was expecting the alcohol to be hidden, it does come out in the finish.. As it warms, more brown sugar sweetness creeps out.  Great beer, no question. Worth the hype? Perhaps, but not in my book. Definitely not worth paying the absurd prices from  Belgianshopo or trading away your beer cellar. Get a Rochefort 10 or St Bernardus Abt 12 and keep the extra money. But thanks to Ross for giving me a chance to try the holy grail.",4.0

Aroma malt was clear caramel, bread. Some raisin and licorice like aroma. Notes of fig and plum as well. Amazingly complex aroma. Appearance was likewise incredible and very pleasing to have in the hand. Color was dark and yet golden like notes. Liquid was light sparkling, but very pleasing sparkling taste in mouth. Head was brownish. Flavor was heavy sweet but in a good way. Slightly bitter, but nothing overwhelming. Just enough to hold the sweet taste in balance. Sour flavour was very light. Maybe a bit of salty notes in the middle. Palate where the body was full full full…overwhelmingly full and rich. Texture was thick and oily and creamy like. Carbonation is soft and the finish just levees you with the longest and greatest finishes ever. What a world class number one beer. This is why I drink beer; it can be such an amazing experience.

Taste is a wonderfull blend of spices, sweet malt, port, cognac, wine, raisns, plums, grapes, yeast, dough, honey, caramel, some bitterness in the aftertaste and such a creamy mouthfeel. The alcohol seems to be way less than 10.2%.   A lot of hype on this one, but I prefer Rochefort 10 to this one.",4.3
4386,Westvleteren 12,"It is almost sacrilegious to call this beer. It transcends the category, with its deliciously enticing fruity-wine aroma and magnificent, malty raspberry/plum taste. Strong yet delicate, imagine biting into a perfectly ripe pear to get an idea of the texture and heartiness exhibited by ’12’. With such a high alcohol content, one would expect an overwhelming alcohol flavor, but it was masked as well as any ’beer’ I’ve had. With its rich, delectable taste, beautiful dark color, frothy head, and luscious aroma, this IS the perfect ’beer.’ An orgiastic feast for the senses.",4.8
4387,Westvleteren 12,"This beer looked much like a cloudy root beer that picked up some straw towards the edges, but had a mossy green halo around the edges when held to the light. Also, there were a few flecks floating around. The dirty off white head looked a little like my carpet with uneven bubbles creating a pleasantly chaotic surface that didn’t last for all that long.

Smelled of salty, flakey pastry that was creamy and doughy. Also included ideas of gooey cookie and/or bread dough with a sweet musky honey. Hell, it could even smell like baklava if you squinted right. There’s also some fruity notes of figs, cherries and plumbs. I was really astonished (as if I wasn’t impressed by now) by the “residual alcohol suggestion” where my mind pointed out where the 10.2% should be, but my nose could only pick up its shadow. Very nice indeed. 

Tasted of creamy, milky caramel then picks up a pleasant tingly sensation that blossoms into an amazing syrup, peaches and pecans. Then there are also some playful light nips of hop that roll around my tongue, back and forth re-releasing little hints of a milky bread dough, honey and nuts in between the suppressive drops of dryness. Finishes like the pastry from the smell with some honey. As I exhale, I get an amplified, brilliant doughy yeast.

The mouth feel is light to medium and creamy with a brilliantly paired sandy feeling carbonation. Perfect!

What can I say? This one’s in a class of its own.",4.9

I could have sat here & smelled it all day, but I wanted to taste it!! Seems so hyped up that you almost expect to be dissapointed, but that is just not the case. It’s just a flavor explosion.

Complex with a cornucopia of flavours... berries, plums, rye bread, honey, malt and nuts. As sipped becomes sweet with a long spicy unoffensive yet bitter finish.

4390,Westvleteren 12,"330 ml bottle, cap dated 26.04.09. At long last. After losing one to Canada Customs in a trade, I wondered if I’d ever get another shot at it, but thanks to a suggestion from Ross on a source, here it is. Dark ruby brown colour with an everlasting rocky, creamy, and rich tan head with lots of lacing. Dark fruit, chocolate covered cherries, brown sugar, toffee, orange peel, raisin, fig, and amber rum aroma. Brown sugar, toffee, and molasses flavours lead into dark chocolate, fruit, figs, raisins, and cherries which in turn give way to a light alcohol finish with more molasses, rum, and dark chocolate to top it off. Mouthfeel is remarkable – rich and full bodied yet soft and delicate, smooth and easy drinking yet substantial, warming but no sign of alcohol heat. Definitely worth the wait and a fitting tribute for my daughter’s 3 month birthday – one of these will hit the cellar to celebrate another one of her milestones 17-20 years down the road.

I don’t know about that.",4.5
4395,Westvleteren 12,"How do you review this beer? How do you rate a beer that many people believe to be the best beer in the world? With all the hype surrounding this beer and all the anticipation, (including the price tag), I had very high expectations. I was almost expecting to be disappointed as this beer has been pedestalled as ""the holy grail"" of beers. Truth is; it is deservingly in a league of its own. 

Appearance: Pours a deep brown color with a nice beige head that fades into a frothy cap and an attractive halo. It was surprising the head and lacing on a 10.2% ABV beer. 

Smell: The aroma is complex and sweet. Dark fruits like plums, figs and dates are all interwoven into a truly enticing aroma that smells only like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! I was surprised at the amount of floral character this beer displayed.

Taste: The taste can only be described as tasting like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! It is completely unique. There is a tartness surge on the front end, then a very mellow smooth silky vinous middle with caramel flavors that lead into what I might try to liken to figs and dates and toasted brown sugar malts; but it is really so well blended that is hard to isolate individual flavors. In the aftertaste, there is again a yeasty tart that maybe be similar to a splash of green apple, and a bit of alcohol warmth. I love the stinging character on the lips. It is not clear what causes that spicy stinging sensation (maybe the acidity) but it begs you to drink more. Truly though, I can only describe this as being in a league of it’s own!

Mouthfeel: Super freaking smooth and so creamy it is sinful! It is light and perfectly carbonated to be full and easy to drink at the same time.

Drinkability: Absolutely dangerous. I was pleased to share this beer with a couple of close friends, but I must say, a beer this big may never go down so easily! Is a $300 case out of the question? If it fits in your budget, absolutely go for it; you won’t regret it. It goes down so dangerously easily its indescribable. Until next time someone shares a Westy 12 with me, I will keep a special place in my heart for this spectacular gem.

Hope this is helpful.

-----------
8/2/06 Thanks to xnohatex for the sample straight from belgium bottled only about a month ago.  
Pours dark with a small off white head.  The aromas are very nicely balanced like everything else in this beer: plums, currants, raisins, brown sugar and dough.  At the first sip i’m struck: suprisingly medium to light body but a crazy amount of fizziness over the whole tongue.  The longer I hold it in my mouth, it almost becomes numb with the carbonation.  Drewbeerme described it as probably what it would be like to taste a little finger-lick of cocaine, i agreed.  Flavors followed with successive sips:  raisins, toffee, carmel, cinamon, oak, vanilla, clove, and alcohol all balanced so well (maybe even too balanced).  as the beer warmed it seemed to turn sweeter and the aromas and flavors turned more to chocolate and almond.  After a few sips of this i was suprised to feel heady very quickly.

My only downfall with this beer, while I dont even think it is a downfall...is that it is almost too balanced (if there is such a thing). I like a little more aggressive taste to my beers.

4420,Westvleteren 12,"Tasted to celebrate my birthday and the birth of my daughter...all within the span of two weeks.   What a beautiful beer!  Deep, caramel brown body with a long-lasting, creamy head.  The mellow malts and raisins slowly gave way to yeasty sweetness in the aroma.  I found this to be bright and lively on the tongue and warming in the throat.  The flavor was subtle and slightly tangy, with a tiny bit of barnyard in the finish??  All these elements combine to form a beer that is better than the sum of it’s (already good) parts.  A masterpiece of subtlety.  Thank you Santa!!!",4.5
4421,Westvleteren 12,Pours a gorgeous dark reddish brown color with a perfectly formed tan head that stays intact throughout the drinking experience. Aroma is full of dark fruit like plum along with a hint of citrus. There’s quite a lot going on with the flavor in this one. Big fruity flavors mix with hints of almond and caramel. Tangy finish and warming alcohol. It may not be the best beer in the world but it’s damn close. If only this bottle was a 750mL.  I usually take some time drinking beers as big as this one but I’ve noticed that I went through the first half of this one very quickly before forcing myself to savor the rest.,4.6
4422,Westvleteren 12,"Smells of malts, faintly; has a peppery spice, like Westmalle Trippel, though less pronounced; very dark, rootbeer colored. Effervescence is standard for a Belgian Trappist ale. Maltiness approaching a German dopplebock. Everything is well balanced, reminding me of a smoothed out, more sophisticated version of Ayinger’s Celebrator Doppelbock. Sadly, there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s overrated, due to its scarcity. It cost me €12 for one, small bottle in Brussels. After talking with the owner of Beer Mania, where I purchased it, he showed me a receipt of someone who ordered two bottles from London. The total cost was €193. Ridiculous! I feel sorry for the beer enthusiasts who feel as if they have to sample this one to complete their repertoire, then overrate it based on the psychology of rarity.Yes, this is a great beer compared to the standard lot, but within the sphere of the best, it falls short.",3.5

4426,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle sampled with Beerded_one. First I must thank belgianshop.com for this beautiful beer. Pours Dark with a two finger thick light tan head, that lasted until the last sip. The aroma is heavenly, belgian spices, yeast, citrus (orange peel), slight fruit, and alcohol. The flavor is ungodly, god damn smooth, spices, fruit, citrus, sweet, with a slight hoppy bitter finish. Oh then as this beer warms the flavor changes, i started to taste wood (oak), then vanilla, and nuts. I thought this beer was going to be all hype, yet still good, just not as good as it was rated, i was wrong, this is the best hands down.",5.0
4427,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #2000... Another thank you to my GF for getting these for me.  I’ve been staring at this bottle for six weeks, and now I’m going to drink it... profound, no?  Hazy deep brown beer, orange highlights, yellow-tan head.  Very lacy and sticky.  Aroma of spices and mint over a massive malty aroma.  Orange rind, plums and dried cherries.  Beautiful rich spicy yeast with overtones of clove, cardamon and cinnamon.  flavour is amazing, sweet caramel, toast, and a rye-like mintiness up front with a lingering burnt sugar toastiness toward the end.  Fantastic jammy fruity flavour as well with plums, raisins, and dried cherries.  Honey dipped almonds.  Very warming finish.  Lingering sweet toastiness and clovey phenolics.  Lace sticks all over the chalice.  As it warms even more malty sweetness comes to the fore.  Lingering peppery flavour and herbal woodiness helps to counter all of the sweetness.  Brown sugar and toffee flavours are also noticible.  Luxurious palate, wheaty body.  I gave the top score to the Extra 8, but this is first rate.",4.7
4428,Westvleteren 12,"I want to say this beer is a victim of the hype, but then I look at all the top raters and all but one give it 4.4+, so then I feel a little stupid. I try another sip, try to dig deeper, but still come up blank. Great? Sure. World Class? Absolutely. Number 1??? But I digress...

For a start, let me say that this is my 500th rating, after a bit more than a year on the site; a milestone I thought I would never reach (I tend to get bored of things pretty quick), and certainly not this fast. Suddenly, 1000 seems very close. 

Only 20 ratings ago, I had no idea what I would choose for the big 500. Probably one the Speedways sitting in my basement. But, lo-and-behold, my fellow ratebeerian Hopscotch started a goofy contest which held the top prize of a Westy 12. #1. The Big Numero Uno. Hyped so fiercly that mail-order shops in Belgium manage to sell it for $25+ a bottle. Yikes! After all sorts of complications at the end of the contest, my hard work paid off (and believe me, looking through hundreds of pages of pictures of half-naked hot celebs to get a positive ID is HARD WORK!). Suddenly, #500 seemed like a clear choice (though I almost caved and drank it for #492 the day I got it).

Now, on to the beer. I couldn’t have been more excited for this brew. The blank bottle and elegant cap just add to the allure. Of course... the best beer in the world is so small, odd, ridiculous, that it doesn’t even have a label! I warmed the brew with my hands for a good 10 minutes, bringing it to around I believe 50F, popped it and poured it into my brand new, virgin Gouden Carolus challice. The pour was a beautiful thick brown, with a foamy biege head and enough solid crap to form a nice beige base. First smell was pretty bland, though as it warmed, I picked up strong bread (reminds me of Dulle Teve), cherry, fig, alcohol and chocolate. The flavor is more exciting, very smooth and relaxing, distinctly bready, with late licorice, more fig... and a big alcohol burn. Most mention that they see no alcohol, but I am getting quite a kick. I guess now would be the time to mention that this bottle is supposedly only 4 months old (feb 2006), if the article about a Westy vertical on this site is to believed -- the cap is dated 15.02.09. Many have said before that this beer is strongest after years in the cellar, and this tasting has lead me to believe that. Now I just need another bottle.

So, hyped or not?? I’ll certainly throw it out there that I think your average beer taster wouldn’t at all rate this higher than Roch 10, St.B 12, if it were a blind tasting, and provided they didn’t already have the flavor profile locked in memory. Certainly, the three are distinct, but this just doesn’t have the otherworldy prowess that it’s taken on on the site. So, yes, I think this beer has been hyped out of existence. Maybe for the truely discerning palates, it offers something above and beyond pretty much anything else out there. Or maybe, by the time its 3 or more years old, it’s developed in to the beast it is rumored to be. But, for now, well, it’s just another solid beer.

That, and I think I’m going to cry, because my glass is nearly empty.",4.2
4429,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle: My second go ’round with this beer. And one that I absolutely refused to rate on memory. Pours a dark brown with a bit of haze, big off white head. Aroma was yeasty, floral, and fruity. Just a bit of alcohol was noticeable. Flavor, caramel, sweet and floral, with a beutiful fruity undertone to it. The finish is softly bitter with some more fruits. And just a touch of warming as it lingers in the mouth. Medium bodied with nice lacing.

While drinking this I couldn’t stop grinning at how good this was. I had it once before about 8 months ago right as I was really getting started on this site. I loved it then. Some of the beers I had earlier on though just don’t hold up anymore, but my god does this one keep it’s spot. If I could I would sip on this stuff for every waking moment, it is just so amazingly drinkable.",4.7
4430,Westvleteren 12,"Poured with little head, murky brown. Has a spicy aroma with noticeable alcohol. I was kind of surprised by how prevalent the alcohol was in this beer. It really threw the balance off for me. Taste is good though- much more german hefe tasting than other belgians in that I detected clove spice and a bit of banana. Also plum/raisin and apple. Quite sweet, but spicy hop finish balances that nicely. I’m glad that my friend was able to get one of these while studying in France.",3.7
4431,Westvleteren 12,"There’s nothing supernatural about beer. You might say the monks of St. Sixtus harbor a metaphysical relationship through this beer, yet in itself it is but the sum of a very tangible - though nonetheless complex - brewing process. I suppose that may seem obvious, but I only fully understood the implications after drinking the Westvleteren 12. In some way I have always believed that one day I would drink a beer that couldn’t be described in comparative terms, a beer that in the words of Hegel would aufheben. The reverie can never be utterly anulled, but certainly dimmed as it has by the disillusion of drinking such a strong candidate. Don’t get me wrong, the Westvleteren Abt is an exceptional brew, but the fact that I can pinpoint its shifting nuances with precision leaves me with a sense of control that could not exist in my utopian nectar.




Westvleteren is no epigone and their Abt warrants careful scrutiny, beginning with its beautiful black velvet robe that radiates a clear crimson hue in the light. The praline pillow-like head evolves gracefully and slips through the lips with a delicate creamy touch. Wondrous scents of banana and dark sugars are immediately apparent. Rich caramel and molasses develop and with each sniff appears a refining shade: chocolate, coffee, fig, plum, red wine, licorice. The complexity is ever increasing and builds a rustic profile highlighted by hints of dust, soil, wood and apple that evolve with warming to reveal buttery raspberries, cinnamon, honey and progressively sweeter and fruitier tonalities. The first sip is equally enticing and coats the tongue in a slightly burnt chocolate bitterness that slowly unveils a sweet pear flavor, not unlike a bite of Poire Belle-Hélène. A soupçon of black pepper enhances the nutty coffee and dark malts which gradually smoothen to reveal raisins and cherries. The finish is surprisingly hoppy, far more than most Belgian brewers allow, but this touch is not unwelcome and adds a certain identity to an almost excessively well balanced beer. My specimen was just a few weeks old, but I’ll be aging the rest of my bottles to observe this beer’s evolution. Perhaps its maturation will yield what I so deeply pursue.




Re-rate: As my bottles age I am beginning to understand the mystique behind Westvleteren’s Abt. Between three and five years of age this is a beer that truly radiates perfection. I had to increase my rating.",4.8
4432,Westvleteren 12,"So I’m on vacation over the 4th of July, and I finally got a chance to stop by my pal’s place.  My pal just happens to be BBB63.  We had a couple of beers then Mike says something like, ""I think its time for number one.""  At first, I had know idea what the hell he was talking about.  Well, I finally figured it out, I shat myself, that we opened it up.  Boy what a great beer.  Poured with no head.  Looks like brandy.  Actually even has some signs of legs.  Toffee and brandy aromas.  Alcohol.  Fruity and estery.  The flavor left me speechless.  Man, what a flavor.  Raisin, cherry, gosh.  Any description I could conjure up would not do this beer justice.   How can the monks be so selfish.",4.9
4433,Westvleteren 12,Thanks to kp again for the opportunity to sample this beer. My pour was close to the bottom and was a slightly hazy brown pour. An aroma of fruit but lighter yeast than I expected. I couldn’t detect alcohol in the aroma. A flavor of frruit that sorta changes the longer youi wait. After you drink it down the flavor still continues to change in your mouth. I couild taste the alcohol in the finish a little. As I’ve said before I like that. A most excellent beer.,4.6
4434,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle provided by xproudfoot, many thanks again Chris! Pours a rusty-brown color with a somewhat fizzy light tan head that dissapates to a nice film over the top. Aroma of raisin, alcohol, bread perhaps a bit of banana. The flovor get a good deal of the raisin, alchohol, clove, and perhaps some cherry, chocolate. It’s very dark and boozey, like a refined dessert where the sweetness is limited and balanced. It still has a nice light fruity quality over the tounge  with a good punch of booze in the middle with a fairly sweet finish. Despite its large amount of carbonation, it is still quite smooth throughout the whole experience. It may not have the biggest flavors or original flavors, I think this one is all about balance and just making one damn fine beer.",4.5
4435,Westvleteren 12,"""I was a little let down after all the build up and the difficulty in obtaining this beer. The Westy 12 poured a very nice dark brown color with a minimal head. The aroma was of dark fruits and herbs. The mouthfeel is spot on and definitely the best part of the beer. The tastes were dark and interesting. I got a good bite when it first hit my mouth that gave way to a very strong herbal taste(almost tobacco). The finish was sweeter and smooth. It had some of that herbal aftertaste as well. I thought this was a great belgian, but I honestly would prefer St. Bernardus 12 or Rochefort 8. """,4.3

Thin tan head.  Aroma is malty with a bit of fruity sweetness (dark fruits & grapes).  Flavor consists mostly of maslt, fruits, maybe a little vanilla and some alcohol.  Very nice mouthfeel.  Very rich.  Complex, but perhaps not to the degree I had expected.  I may be scoffed at, but I liked the 8 better.  I am very happy I was able to finally try this one, but given the insane price I paid for it, I do not see me trying this one again anytime soon.",4.4
4437,Westvleteren 12,"From the Pintelier in Groningin, NL.  Simply outstanding.  Pours dark brown, with a dark thick head.  The aroma is of apples and raisins.  The flavor is rich and very smooth.

4438,Westvleteren 12,Pours a dark brown color with a off white head.  Flavor was malty and sweet.  Alcohol was very present.  A little intense.  Aside from that this is a wonderful brew.  Something I would love to have again.,4.4
4439,Westvleteren 12,"It’s hard to not echo every one elses rating of this beer... It poured a brown colour that was completly opaque. The head was surprisingly white; large and fizzy but setteling into a ring around the edge. This was very wine like for me, grapes mostly, but with small hints of other dark fruits. There was quite a bit of alcohol present in this that became more dominating as it warmed from the mid 50’s to about 70 degrees F. Surprisingly, this wasn’t as complex as I suspected, but was very rich in flavour and body. It was a fullfilling experiance and quite tasty. However, I tend to prefer deep complex stouts to this. Hopefully I’ll have rated it well, giving it marks where it deserves, because it is a fantastic beer, without dining it too much for my personal preferances.",3.6
4440,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle thanks to tever.  this bottle took a long journey, from Belgium to Cali and from Cali to NY in a trade.  Cellared it for 2 weeks and fridged it for about 2 hours.  Poured into a small glass Budum coffee cup, split three ways.  Pours murky brown with a small head.  Cannot see through the beer.  Aroma is very present.  I get a grape aroma behind the sweetness and malt.  Same in taste.  Overall, its a good beer but ’divine’ or ’greatest beer in the world’ I don’t think so.  This did cause me to break out the Rochefort 10 in comparision, which I enjoy more.",4.2
4441,Westvleteren 12,"So tonight, the first beer had to be this, so the palate would be clean, and we would be ready for it.  Something I have wanted to drink for a very long time.  Pours out brown with a nice tan head.  Taste is sweet, and fruity, almost like drinking a dark cherry.  Alcohol is a little strong, to me at least.  I believe this is one that I need to let sit for a long time.  As the 765 other people have said before me, this is a great beer, worth the hype, and very worthy of its score on the multiple beer sites that are on the internet.",4.7

Smell is of candy sugar, raisins, brown sugar, and some black grapes.
Taste is of sweet brown sugar, rich malt, vanilla, raisins, nuts, and dark fruits.
Mouthfeel is lingering with chewy, malty sweetness, lip numbing stickiness, but very much balanced with the malt and hops melding together for a superb finish.
The ABV is well hidden.

Rating added 6/13/2006
Bottle at what was then ""The Ardbeg Room"" in Stockholm. Too damn sweet, didn’t enjoy it very much and can not agree to this being one of the worlds best beers. I guess I should try it again, but don’t think it’s worth the money...

Tried it again (second rating) from bottle at RBESG 2006, rather fresh bottle, didn’t like it and gave it even less score than above...
Shady dark brown color, tan head. Alcohol scent, some sweetness but mostly alcohol. Sweet taste. Full mouthfeel. Medium high bitterness.
I really can not, really not, understand why this beer is rated the best in the world by so many. My only conclusion is that since it’s hard to obtain and others say it’s great, most can’t disagree. Sort of like films and Fellini, I hate the bastard! Well, I don’t like this sorry, but I’ll leave my older, higher, rating standing...
New rating: 4/2/5/3/8 = 2.2
Sad but true...

Yet one more (third) rating. (Bottle, thanks oh6gdx!)
Shady dark brown color, small tan head.
Sweet vinous scent, also malty and quite grainy, some alcohol. 
Taste is sugar and alcohol very sweet.
Medium mouthfeel to the higher side, low bitterness.
The last of the bottle is way better than the first 4/5th, it turns nutty and full and is way better.
I still say that a non matured Westy 12 is way way over rated and hyped, it’s not bad but it’s far from perfection.

4460,Westvleteren 12,"Re-rate, 7/07 in a horizontal alongisde St. Bernie’s 12 and Roche 10. Bottle courtesy fozapd/Scott, stamped 18.01.09, about 1.5yrs old. Pour was brownish with a tannish colored off-white head, not great retention, but not as week as the Westv 8 on the same night, yet inferior to both St B’s 12 and Roche 10. Aroma and flavor of caramel, brown sugar, choco, lingering spices, stronger version of 8. Alcohol more detectable than with the 8, liquor/scotch type flavors, is this bottle over-aged, not as rich as once remembered. Honestly, against the Roche 10 and St. B 12, this came in last. Numbers dropping a little, but still an average of my three experiences. Thanks, Scott, for contributing to this wonderful horizontal! Excellent stuff. Original ratings follow: Poured a nice medium brown with a huge head that laced superbly while drinking. Sedimentation was under control. Aroma was primarily bready, yeasty, spicey. The high ABV was barely noticeable in the flavor or aroma. Rich deep flavor, and distinct from the St. Bernie’s and Roche 10. There was a true beer barley and bready base coming through (ie. it didn’t feel like they sugared this one up to the point of hiding the beerness... I don’t know how to describe that). My first Quad Belgian, where not just the dark fruits, candy sugar, and spices come through, but some chocolate (slight burnt touch) was noticeable too. Definitely a peppery finish (on second tasting / re-rate, I didn’t repeat this one). Immediate aftertaste was the candy sugar (a sweetness), which then turned to a surprising lowly hop bitterness after 10-15 seconds or so. Mouthfeel was carbonated and slightly less heavy than a stout. Very enjoyable, of course. Would love to put Roche 10, St. Bernie’s 12, and this one side by side one night and have at it. Thanks to E for the trade and Westy 12 experience. The re-rate was on a bottle (stamped 09.08.08) served at ’De Vrede’ across the street from the abbey.",4.7
4461,Westvleteren 12,"Ah, the famed Westy 12! Through some great trading, a friend of mine was able to score the Grail. Nice port wine aroma, very fruity. Lots of dry fruit flavors, mildly spiced, some candi sugar. ABV is well hidden except for the nice warming feeling, very smooth. This truly is a great beer.",4.7

The mouthfeel is very soft, smooth and lucious.",4.1

4465,Westvleteren 12,"A big thank you to bentley78 for this! I have to say my expectations are ridiculously high for this beer. Very nice cloudy brown with a big fluffy off white head. Aroma of dark fruit and light alcohol. Leaves a nice lacing that goes away quickly. And I have to say the taste lives up to expectations! 
This has an amazing sweetness to it...
""It, it tastes so good when it hit your lips!!"" The alcohol is very well hidden. Slightly yeasty finish. Even my burps taste good after this. I hope to make it back to Belgium some day so I can have a bottle at the source....",4.8
4466,Westvleteren 12,"bottle.  Very dark brown with some ruby highlights.  Split three ways.  Aroma: Vinous, dark fruits, plums, raisin, very slight but good alcohol, some vanilla, apple.  Taste is around the same, fruity especially dark fruits, toffee, caramel, apple, balanced by peppery, spicy, tartness, and dark fruit. Suprisingly dry finish. Amazing.",4.9
4467,Westvleteren 12,"Really.  What can I say that hasn’t already been said in one of the other 740 reviews?  Is this a great beer?  Yes.  The best in the world?  I can see (er, taste) that.  A silky smooth beer that, despite its alcoholic depth, is more than drinkable.  I was expecting large hits of sweetness countered by larger doses of peppery burn.  I got neither.  It is a well-played balance of power between the two.  And neither struggles to dominate.  I suppose we could argue as to what makes the best beer in the world.  But why?  It might be something that hasn’t been drunk yet.  So let’s get working on that.",4.7
4468,Westvleteren 12,"Finally got my hands on 7 bottles.  Opened one and shared it with my brother for college graduation.  Pours a hazy dark chestnut red...if you hold it to the light you see some nice greens.  Big old belgian cream colored head with tons of lacing.  Aroma is very remiscent of St Bernard 12, except maybe a bit more balance.  Tons of dried plum and raisin...spice...vegetables...yeast...bread.  Flavor was incredibly balanced.  I’m not going to trash it because it didn’t quite live up to the best beer in the world, but I will say that out of all the trappist and BSAs I’ve had, this one has got to be the biggest crowd pleaser.  Tons of rich dried fruit and candy sweetness to make it thoroughly enjoyable, enough belgian yeast to remind you that the brew you are drinking comes from a long line of tradition, and enough complex spice, bitterness, and veggie flavors to keep you thirsting for one more sip.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and similar to roch 10.  Now I can’t say that it is worth all the trouble to acquire this beer over roch 10, bernard 12, or some of my other belgian friend, but if this were readily available...even at a similar price of $13+...I would no doubt stock up.  Truly a great beer and I feel privileged to have enjoyed it...and this is not something I would say about many beers.",4.5

Pours a medium clear brown color with a very tiny head and the slighest amount of lacing.  Aroma is fantastic with cherries, sweetness and malt.  Flavor is unbelievable with nut hints and a kind of sweet maltiness that finishes with lots of fruit hints and a definitely noticeable vinous note.  Slight hint of hazelnut at the end that only serves to finish the beer off nicely.  So smooth and easy to drink with a very slight warmness to the beer that only serves to compliment the overall deliciousness!  Very, very tastiferous!",4.9
4478,Westvleteren 12,"Had this a few hours after the 8, bottled in Ghent.  Call me crazy, but I definitely prefer the former - the 12 is extremely alcoholic tasting.  Opaque dark brown pour, and a little brown sediment from the bottom of the bottle sat  on the top of the beige head.  Noticeably stronger, also more complex.  Has a flavor of its own.  Velvety, silk, dates, maltiness.  Clearly world-class, but the world’s best?  Eh....",3.8
4479,Westvleteren 12,"Best beer I evere had. Complex and refined. I’m happy that i’m living in Belgium and so I could get this for about 1,5€ / bottle. The 12 is for the weekend the 8 is for weekly consumption ...

Soft, deep, licorice and bread taste with plenty of alcohol warmth. Chocolatey, yeasty notes hover. Impressively harmonic and soft, yet somehow powerful. Aftertaste just fades out. A spicy licorice taste lingers. Very little bitterness is detectable. Clearly a great beer. Think this was a new bottle.",4.2
4483,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, couple different tastings.  Dark brown pour and clear (due to decanting).  Wonderfully balanced aroma of fruity esters, bready yeast, and some caramel malts.  Alcohol seems well hidden.  Flavors are similar - lots of estery fruits - plums and prunes and raisins.  Some risidual sugars provide a molasses flavor.  Hints of earthy noble hops too.  Smooth palate and a clean finish.",4.3
4484,Westvleteren 12,"Well who am I to blow against the wind? This beer is flat out amazing, and a big thanks to mighty Jetsbeer for hooking me up!
This beer pours a delicate brown witha slight white head. The only thing that holds this beer down is it’s lack of solid lacing. That is it though. 
The smell is extremely complex and layered. It starts off like sweet bread, with yeast tones, gives a bit of raison, English toffee, plums, honey and molassis.
It’s like wine, more than anything. 
On taste, words kind of defy you. Incredible malt use, there isn’t a hint of the alcohol wallop at all. It’s sweet and bubbly like candy, but far from obnoxious. The toffee taste is delicious. all in all, this is the king. THE KING! No chinks in this armor.",4.9

It has a malty softness like butter and a sweetness of dried fruit and a spicy freshness of hop; The body is perfectly balanced too, it touches all elements in your mouth from tip of tongue till way, way back. This with a perfect amount of carbonation; It finishes of incredibly long, not bitter or sweet, but everything combined again in a perfect balance. Nothing really stand out in this beer, it is its harmony, that makes it so perfect.",5.0
4486,Westvleteren 12,"Wonderful dark brown colour with high carbonation and a very impressive white head that diminishes slowly. The taste is very complex with a general sweetness from malts but spiked up with a strong array of spices and fruitiness. I find the beer a tad too alcoholic though - almost barley wine. Exceptional body. RERATE: [vintage 2004]
Well, this is still not as good as Rochefort. The body is still fantastic, aroma is stunning, but has that Westvleteren rye breadiness - which isn’t that much me. Still a bit too vinious for me, but really still a good beer.",4.0

Bottle opened with a stong hiss of  carbonation foured almost perfect with a nice off whit bubily head appeared dark to ruby brown with some murkeyness. aromas were slightly spicy to grassy backed by grapes cherries darkfruit. Flavor was very well balanced with flavors of fruit plum sherries with a mild alcohol burn that turns to brown surgar  in there. So much flavors and complexity at first I was not to much in favor of giving this beer a 4.4 but half way through I have decided it is worth a 4.6 not the best beer I have ever had but close...  
Second Bottle Thanks for sharing pailhead 3-31-06 No date on cap To add to the previous rating  color and appearance were identical. I would say the consistency with previous bottle with an addition of dark fruit and fig to aroma as wellas chocolate. The flavors were pretty much the same with a littlmoreof a surgary finish.

Mildly tart and puckering with some immediate alcohol bite on the tongue. Relatively dry and thin bodied with a surprising amount of bitterness. Does not have the explosion of flavor I was expecting. It does have a muted/mild  plummy fig character that opens up as it warms. Best beer in the world? Thanks Blankboy.",3.7

4491,Westvleteren 12,"11.2oz with no label and a best before date of 28.02.08 ink jetted across the yellow, black and silver cap. Acquired via trade and carefully decanted into a Val-Dieu chalice.

Mahogany under a huge off white head that slowly falls and leaves thick sheeted lace.

The aroma is an incredible mix of fresh bread dough made with cinnamon, raisins, dates and dark cherries with some peppery warmth from the alcohol. Brown sugar from the malts and suggestions of licorice and a sprinkling of powdered chalk. Wow!

Tastes malty upfront then fades into ripe dark fruits such as cherries, plums, and ripe red grapes all dipped in brown sugar. The middle brings a tart flavor followed by some more suggestions holiday fruit cake. Not the cheap fruit cake we all hate to recieve at Christmas but rather like the one made from scratch with a little apple liquer that has that yeasty just pulled from the oven flavor. The alcohol registers only as a pinch of pepper in the finish yet I don’t feel any heat upon my breath. Amazing!

The mouth is velvety fullness with just the right amount of carbonation. You bet your ass this is drinkable.

I’m giving this the exact same score I gave to the Gouden Carolus Carolus D’Or - Cuvée Van De Keizer. I think it might be a little better, or maybe that’s the hype talking.",4.9
4492,Westvleteren 12,".33 L bottle at the Tap House in Norfolk.  Chocolate brown with thin creamy head.  Whiff of flowers, malts; so gentle.  Incredibly balanced taste.  A flavor like other Belgians I’ve had but super refined.  I can see what the others were striving for.  Curiously recognizable but almost as if from a dream.  Once you’re immersed the 12 goes down just like water.  Buzz creeps in half way through; makes me happy.  I think I could drink these continuously for a few days.  Not the beast I expected but a Shakespearean achievement of fermentation.  A keystone of western culture.",4.5

4496,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled. Rating #500. I’ve waited quite patiently for this one. It has been in my cellar since september, and I decided when I bought it that I should save it for rating #500. I think I have entered my 499 beers quite rapidly, just over six months, but the waiting has been way to long, and the beer has been staring at me every time I went to get another beer in the cellar. Now, as I am to open it, I am a little bit nervous. It’s not my virgin-sample of a Westy 12, I’ve had it two or three times before, I am just nervous that it might be bad in any way, or that I might get disappointed. After all, my taste-buds has evolved a little since my first rating. It has a BB date of 28.02.08, so it is ok in that way, hope it is in any other way too. Well, off goes the cap. The first aroma is very vinous and oaked. Then, when it’s poured, black currant, caramel, dried fruits, light alcohol, spices and a light yeastiness comes through. You don’t get it much more complex than this. It looks gorgeous, dark reddish-brown and sparkling, and with some sediments if you prefer that. It has probably the most dense, lasting head that I’ve seen so far, beige in color, and huge. The flavor is rich, with caramel, candi-sweetness, malt, spices, bitterness, cherry and alcohol. Too much alcohol, I think. There are lots of other beers masking the 10% ABV much better, but it is not an unpleasant alcohol-level. The body is full and it has a sweet and bitter finish that is quite long. The flavor and finish is rounded of as the beer warms up, and my starting temperature of 10°C was too cold, especially for the finish to step forward. It turned out I had no reason to be nervous, the beer probably deserves its first place on Ratebeer, but I expected that I could give it a higher score. A beer that matches aroma and flavor even better will hopefully come my way some day, and then maybe the perfect 5 will be given. (060306)",4.5
4497,Westvleteren 12,"Taphouse in Norfolk -- I’ll admit, I never thought I’d rate another beer above a 4.4, but there you go.  A perfect dark cherry appearance with a nice ivroy head.  The aroma is very silky, almost not there and highly delicate.  Amazing taste of cherry, chocolate and many other flavors, too complex to be able to identify.  If one can call any beer liquid silk this would be it.  The Westy 12 was well worth the wait, though I’ll admit that the Rochefort 10 is a very close second and far more economical.  This beer ends with a nice warming effect all thoughout the mouth and throat.",4.6
4498,Westvleteren 12,"Got to experience this beverage with Immy at the Taphouse in Norfolk.  A lot of anticipation leading up to the first sip, and I was not let down.  ""Grape juice of the Gods"" kept running through my mind.  Pours a dark brown, maybe a hint of red, with a small tan head that dissipated.  Vinous nose, almost like a red wine.  This is definitely a beer to savor, as I still do not have a handle on the complexities of the flavor.  Suffice to say though, this is wonderful stuff!",4.8
4499,Westvleteren 12,"Being obliged to rate this beer seems apparently necessary ... I like W.12.  I do.  I wouldn’t rate it as the best beer in the world.     But it is delicious.  Note, however, that this is a ""vintage"" product -- some years are better than others and it changes with age.

(Bottled.  03/2006).  This batch seems ""green"".  Body is relatively thin compared to past experiences with this brew.  All the same major notes as described below but the body definitely seems thinner warranting a slight ""downgrade"" in the overall impression.
(Earlier notes)  Pours dark, dark brown. Complex aromas of dried fruits, nuts, and biscuits.  An intense flavor that emerges as it warms up.  A wonderful experience to be sure.  Vintages vary ... a ""4"" would be a ""4.5"" for some years and something less in others.",4.0
4500,Westvleteren 12,"FINALLY! Had mine at the Taphouse in the Ghent section of Norfolk, VA with gputty. Even brought my own glass for the occasion.
Many things in life do not come close to matching their ""hype"". Fortunately, I feel this one goes beyond the considerable buzz surrounding it.

Pours into my trappist glass a deep mahogany brownish red. Somewhat murky, a slight, off white head crowns the top, a foreshadow of the weblike dense lacing. Initially, the nose is rather vinous, like a medium red, with some cherry notes peeking through. As it warms, a far more complex aroma emerges. Notes of dark fruits - raisin and black cherries - shine through. The cornucopia of scents is almost overwhelming, too much going on to pinpoint all the complexities.

Finally, I lift the glass and draw my first sip. Light Muscatine grapes cascade across my tongue to start the show, followed by a textbook quad fruitiness, highlighted by black cherry, prune and some light molasses. All this flies by you as the finish approaches, a lovely sweet, slightly tart mildly dry epilogue.

All too soon, I see the tiny logo at the bottom of my glass, signaling the beginning of the end. Fully warmed, the alcohol becomes just slightly more apparent, and some of the initial winelike notes have faded to a warm, sweet end. Sad but sated, I give this my first 5.",5.0

Then when finished you sit back and smile...",3.9
4502,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a clear ruby red with mahogany, head of even cream with a fine bubbled geometric tan, followed with sticky sheeting lacing. Aroma is a phenolic fruit and floral quality, with a hint of lavender and honeysuckle, with a strong fresh blast of raspberries, almost candied, with cream. Bottom, with yeast, has a more subdued and dusky aroma, with raisins, yeast and light hazlenut. Flavor is classic fruity quad, that as it warms develops into a much broader level of complexity. A real strong edge of fresh squeezed orange juice and a tinge of the fresh raspberrie continues. Dense flavor, with sweet candi sugars, warm yeast and a hint of lime peel and juniper berries. A good strong dose of abbeyian fruitcake on the backend, laced with silken chocolate swirls. A smack of rich mulled apple cider, with light spice. A hint of nutmeg. It’s as delecate and deft as a rich creamy port sauce, over quickly seared kobe beef, with italian cherries in syrup. Mingled in is a hint of wild mushroom. All poured into a buttery crust of pastry. Palate is perfect and exquisite, dazzling the tounge, hiding any alcohol and carrying all these flavors most deftly. Obviously good. It held up to my expectations and deserves one of my Top 10 spots, but this beer is <i>perfect</i>. It’s not startlingly different, just amazingly crafted. Thanks Jason&#033;",4.3

Luscious raspberry, raisin, ripe plum, fragrant rose petals, and soft ripe peaches are intoxicating to the nostrils.  Initial flavors are of the ripe red fruits, but then a delcious breadiness takes over as the yeasts start to work their magic.  I’m flashing back to memories of eating freshly baked pumpkin bread as a child.  Fantastic experience overall, first by meeting my expectations for such a renowned brew, and secondly by masking the alcohol in such a marvelous fashion.

The complexity of this beer is the best I’ve ever come across. The taste of this beer just explodes with the sweet fruit and at first has a powerful vinos essences that subsides with warmth. 

This beer is one that should mellow even more with age but I actually prefered the fresher bottle I had about 2 years ago. As I let this beer warm up I began to taste even more of the honey and clove. Overall this is a great beer, I love things about the fresher version but I love the smoothness of this aged bottle.",4.7

That being said, this is a good dry Belgium Trappist ale but vastly overrated by others.  I also believe that the St. Bernadus Abt 12 and Rochefort 10 were better tasting and textured, relative to the Westy 12.",3.2
4518,Westvleteren 12,"33 cl bottle from the shelf. Dark brown with an abundant, creamy, lacy head. Velvety aroma of malt, molasses, nuts, strawberries... Initially sweet and soft taste followed by an estery explosion in the back of the mouth and flowing into a lasting, pronounced bitter aftertaste. A little sticky body, moderate alcoholic finish. Great balance - robust yet elegant, rather sweet yet very bitter.",4.4
4519,Westvleteren 12,Bottle. Beautiful lasting head. Last drop still had a small head on it. A bit hazy with sediments of yeast. Very complex taste with lots of spices and fruits to be detected. Aroma is almost as good as the taste,4.6
4520,Westvleteren 12,"Quite a chunky pour.  Nice carbonation and substantial medium-lasting head.  Bottle cap says 30/07/01, so quite vintage. Aroma of dates and plum. Nice, full flavor with a slight alcohol aftertaste.  Bitter, long finish",4.6
4521,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #300!!!!!!!!! 2003 Bottle, surprise beer from Suiiy. Not the most beautiful thing to look at. Pours a muddy brown with some mild off white head, recedes rather quickly. Aroma is lots of sweet dark malts, alcohol, dark fruits, figs, and maybe nuts. Oh yeah, lots of dirty musty bananas in the aroma as well. Taste is rather yeasty, which is the dominant player up front along with the sweet dark malts. Sweet for the most part, with a lurking alcohol presence. Finishes dry and alcoholy. For what its worth, I get much more of a satisfying experience out of the Rochefort 10. Will defintely retry as soon as I get my hands on another bottle.",4.0
4522,Westvleteren 12,nice lacing.  dark caramel color.  plae brown head.  raisin smell.  slight alcohol burn.  nutmeg and spice.  i’m not a fan of belgians but this is pretty good.  smooth as hell with the taste sitting lightly on the tongue,4.2
4523,Westvleteren 12,"Pours brown with a beige head. Very sweet. Nice dryness. Aromas of almondliqueur, nuts, alcohol and much more. Very full. I can imagine that if I to keep loving this beer I´ll have to drink only one per session; otherwise it might be a bit too much. Bought the beer (in a bottle) at the brewery.",4.0
4524,Westvleteren 12,The Abt 12 is substantial.  You can expect a cascade of flavor.  A lovely blend of malt and hops.  Inviting aroma.  A connoisseur could find a dozen flavors to describe.  I found myself sipping and savoring until the last.,4.6
4525,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #1000.  Big thanks to Martin (Engelsmann).  I cant beleive I have never rated this before- I think I have had samples at previous tastings.  Im glad I waited, this beer is very deserving of the 1000th rating.  Pours a very very deep amber- mostly brown and moslty cloudy even when I left the dreggs in the bottle. A very large light beige head  is created upon the pour with a crapload of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  Aroma is truly unlike any other beer I have had- not even the St Bernardus can compare. Aroma of light earthy and spicy hints with light barnyard notes.  Next the fruity esters from the yeast come into play, and then finish with a crapload of sweet fruity malt- lots of caramel, chocolate, and special B.  Almost a musty hint in the end of the aroma as well.  Flavor is mostly sweet malt in the front with caramel chocolate malst in the middle- intermingling with hops and even a touch of tobacco.  Good hop bitterness in the end- almost an earthy-hop character.  Finishes a bit dry but still a lot of complex malt sweetness.  Full mouthfeel with a smooth finish.  This beer is so unique and so complex that is is deserving of the highest rating on this site.",4.6
4526,Westvleteren 12,"Dark brown colour, average off white head. Rather sweet and malty aroma, fruity to. Smouth and creamy palate, wonderfull finish, light bitter creamy, some herbs.",4.1
4527,Westvleteren 12,I know most people like this one over Rochefort 10. I dont. I find the palate in Rochefort 10 better than this one. But dont get me wrong - still an exelent brew.,4.4
4528,Westvleteren 12,A nice healthy oak and citrus aroma.  A dark cloudy copper color.  A good thick cream colored head when is first poured draws itself into the beer.  A rich and heavy smooth malt taste that fades leaving the mild taste of honey lingering in the throat.,4.6
4529,Westvleteren 12,"I’ve tasted thousands of beers in the last 23 years,  and I have no doubt that this is the best I’ve tried. I first tried it on the only sunny day in my tour of Belgium in 2000, sitting outside of Het Spannekopke restaurant (a must-try if in Brussels).  When the waiter came to check on us, he saw my smile and said ""I know,  I know...""  Since then I’ve had it at home and at the Belgian beer festivals at Carlsbad Pizza Port. Most recently tried it alongside Rochefort 10 at home. Dark brown-burgundy in color, with a thick, rocky head. Very malty, but balanced with bitter notes of charcoal and a slight smokiness in addition to the hops. Gets better as it warms towards room temperature. Sweet toffee, molasses, and candy sugar flavors fill the palate.  A delight. (After rating, I went through and read the lowest ratings of this.  Several people mention the high cost.  When I bought it, both at the restaurant and at the bottle store, the price wasn’t out of the ordinary for a trappist ale.  I suppose that, since 2000, the beer has grown so in reputation and popularity that it has risen in price.  A rare find, and hence, expensive, if these stories of its expense are to be believed.)",4.9
4530,Westvleteren 12,"This is just the very best beer. Nothing compares to the special Westvleteren-flavour. Like the Rochefort 10, it’s sweet and is just a explosions of joyfull taste in your mouth. I cannot recommend this beer enough. It’s difficult to get a hold on, but prepare yourself for a taste of another world. The second best beer I have tasted is the Rochefort 10, and allthough it gets close to Abt12, it is not in the same ligue. Highly recommendable!!!",5.0
4531,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to Kevster for this badboy that his guy picked up from the brewery with 175 cars in front of him, so thanks to you also.

2nd time, big thanks to MikeTD. Dark mahogany pour with a white head that stays the whole time. Perfumy aroma. Dark berries, loads of candi sugar, caramel and a touch of chocolate in the background. Lots of floral hops and a big earthy aftertaste. As it warms apples, pear lights fruits and dark berries come out more. Perfumy as well with more spicy yeast and candi sugar sticking around. Truly is a world class brew.",4.5
4532,Westvleteren 12,Very very complex.  Fresh brewed bottle shared with SuIIy.  High alchohol content which isn’t even noticable.  Very very tasty.  Can’t wait to try a vintage.,4.5
4533,Westvleteren 12,"1999 vintage . Oranged hue brown ale with a beautifuk off-white head, resilient, lacing. Wonderfully maderized malt with raisins, prunes and dates in aroma, and  nice spices wifting through. Smoother than the newer beer tasted (2004), with fruityness coming out weel, dates, port wine, and orange peels. Rich and well balanced, all taste blending well. One word superb (9-5-9-5-18). The 2004 differed in that in aroma, the spices were more sharp, coriander and curacao, very present. The hops in mouth were also slightly metallic, so was the alcohol. (9-5-9-5-17). BW tasting at Dumdum’s, Late March 2005. Merci Dum.",4.6

4537,Westvleteren 12,This is the best beer i ever had. Literally i would buy this for 100 dollars a bottle. This is a must for any beer lover. There is such flavor and sweetness that it makes your mouth explode.  This is the best trappist ever and most likely the best beer ever made and will be most likely forever.,5.0
4538,Westvleteren 12,"The real treasure of the beers from this brewery. The same toasted smell as the double, but full of taste. Black color, a balance of sweet and bitter flavors, and a long aftertaste. If you can find this, it is strongly recommended!",4.3
4539,Westvleteren 12,"Finally!!  A special thanks to him for sharing this beer with me.  Aroma was nice molasses,chocolate and licorice in the nose.  Poure was a dark brown with a nice frothed head.   Flavor was as in the nose, chocolate with some raisin as well.  Palate was excellent very full and sweet.  It was really good just not the best for me.",4.4

Sweet, but not sticky. this bottle is fresh, and well taken care of, thanks Duane. alcohol is not noticable at all, very nice beer, perfect care of this bottle keeped everything right. the best beer I’ve had.

4541,Westvleteren 12,"HORIZONTAL WITH A ROCHEFORT 10-- deep dark brown almost transparent.the head was huge and frothy to start and laid down to cover the top of the beer and coated the glass all the way down. aroma had some chocolate, some licorice, raisins, and port wine in the nose.  flavor is a solid reflection of the aroma, very sweet, very well balanced, no hint of the abv, an almost syrupy texture.  imo (and my dads), this buries the rochefort, but i dont know about it being the best beer i have ever had.  many thanks to Walt for sending this to me last year (its been sitting in the basement since december)",4.5
4542,Westvleteren 12,"Cap date 25JAN03 Rated on 18JUN05. The real king of beers! This really lived up to the hype, which I wasn’t expecting. Awesome light dried fruit aroma – dates, raisins, you name it, along with slight vinegar notes. Taste is a complex array of dried fruits, rock candy and breadiness that changes on each slow sip, with a very slight alcohol warmth. Awesome mouthfeel. Very viscous and it almost seems to foam and grow in your mouth. The nectar of the Gods!",4.6
4543,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle dated August 2005. Made a pilgrimage all the way to Westvleteren to pick this up. Pours into my Westy goblet black with dark tan hints when held up to the light. Decent compact light tan head which recedes fairly quickly to a thin covering. Aroma is complex and amazing dark fruit, toffee, oak (almost wine barrel), subtle spice from the alcohol. Taste is full on - all of the components identified in the aroma, but so intense. Very sweet start is balanced we superbly by the bitterness of finish and the peppery spice from the otherwise well hidden alcohol. Mouth feel is full and velvety smooth, just about perfect. I can’t imagine having too many of these in a session - it would have to be the night cap, however it is almost sad to get to the bottom of the glass, so I have rated it high on that basis. Damn, only one left now :-(.",4.5
4544,Westvleteren 12,"11.7oz bottle from OhioDad....Thanks Scott!  A very slight gush as the bottle opens and a small amount of light tan foam begins to rise. Pours a dirty brownish green color with a dirty frothy head. Nose is bananas, bread, whiskey. First sip, banana bread soaked in whiskey. second -5th sip, more whiskey less banana. Then towards the bottom, more bananas, malted milk balls, slightly less of the alcohol and a bit more bready, doughiness. Overall a very good brew that lived up to the hype of being one of the best. Thanks Scott for the opportunity!",4.5

Flavours of sweet bread, smooth malts, dried fruits (raisins) and roasted elements all perfectly balanced. Full bodied with an oily texture. Finished crisp, with some bitterness and sweetness in the aftertaste. Highly recommended and exceptionally enjoyable.★★★★★",4.7
4547,Westvleteren 12,"I don’t give this a perfect rating, because I do believe, that if I find the perfect beer one day, I should stop looking. This is way up there. As everybody writes: A vinous nose, rich mouthwatering dried-fruits spicy flavor. A marvelous beer.",4.7
4548,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle (330ml).  Big shout-out to blankboy for allowing me to piggyback on his Belgianshop.com order!.  MY 500TH RATING.  Served at approximately 12 celsius in my Westvleteren goblet.  Poured a lively dark amber-brown with a decent off-white foamy head - the last 10% of the pour showed a fair bit of tiny black particles (tasty!).  Initial aroma pounded my hindbrain:  yeast; sweet dough, strong fruits, hint of wine, roast malt, roast nuts - more emerged as it opened, other fruits, caramel sweetness, earthy tones.  And oh, the flavour - all of the above, but with a restrained bitterness - alcohol & hops, perhaps? - keeping it in balance.  Each taste had a different mouthfeel as more and more elements vied for my attention - mouthfeel was full-bodied, not flat or carbonated - just complex.  Ultimately I have to rate this a 5.0 - it’s by far the best thing I’ve ever tasted; while there have been a couple of imperial stouts that are up there, this is definitely the holy grail of beers.  My only regret making this my 500th rating is I can’t ALSO make it my 1000th!  *note - re-rated down to 4.9 because on reflection I can’t in good conscience claim anything is perfect - perfection is to be sought after, never attained.",4.9
4549,Westvleteren 12,"Intens brown color, hazy, and creamy light brown coloured foam. Overwhelming aroma’s of cakes, chesnut puré, caramel, sweet bread, earthy tones and hops. Taste is powerfull and very mouth-filling. Taste is sweet nutty, breaddy, hints of dry figgs, caramel, and fine hops in the finish. Indeed a great beer !",4.5
4550,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle Inspection: Cap has a date, but I can only read the first two numbers: 11/08/? Cap is worn on one side and the bottle has the “American” label.

Aroma: Rich malt nose, hints of fruit, mainly fig, and a good dose of spicy alcohol.

Appearance: Clear tan amber glass with a good cover of off white head that lasted as a collar (impressive given the abv), but didn’t lace. Last pour was murky with a fair amount of blackish sludge (you KNOW I drank it all). 

Flavor: Belgian yeast and dark fruit are the main flavors with a touch of almond liquor (Frangelica). There is a hint of the “fresh Christmas present” taste that I get from Rochefort 10 as well. A well put together taste overall and enjoyable.

Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected but silky smooth texture

Overall Impression: Impossible to be objective with this one. In some ways I was a touch disappointed. I imaged angels dancing on my tongue and some sort of beer epiphany that would allow me some sort of deep beer insight into the nature of things. 

It’s just a beer. A good beer, heck, a Great Beer! But, beer. 

That said, it is massively drinkable and if the monks lived next door, I’d drink this daily! I’m not going to fly all the way to Belgium just to drink this though. If you get the chance, by all means, give it a shot, but if you don’t get the chance, don’t feel like you’ve missed out of what beer is about.",4.3
4551,Westvleteren 12,"Dark brown body with ruby tinges and a light tan head. Aroma took awhile to pick up but after that it was thick and heavy, full of dried fruit, soft pepper and yeast. Smooth and full bodied in the taste there was an array of different flavours starting with dried fruit, spice, licorice, a touch of chocolate, caramel and meat. Many thanks to Kook for this superb beer!",4.7
4552,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to Secret Santa (July) for this masterpiece. Pours dark opaque brown, little sediment floaties, and a huge tan head, that fades to film. Rotten banana up front with a little alcohol, lots of dark sweet malt, and dark fruits. Initial flavor is all sweet caramel malt, same rotten banana through the middle with some spicey cocoa in the finish. Flavor not as strong as aroma would indicate. Full bodied, very easy drink considering alcohol content.",4.5

4560,Westvleteren 12,"Tried this at the Hopleaf in Chicago with Paul. No doubt the best Belgian beer I’ve ever had (we tasted it alongside the Rochefort 10 and a pot of steamed mussels). I did not take notes, didn’t want to make the experience too much like work, or interrupt the far-reaching conversation. But enuff about me, on to the beer: Smelled a bit like apple cider, but more yeasty and dark. Palate was thick, tasted so complex I couldn’t pick out any one predominant flavor, loved the sharpness contrasting with the sweetness. If there are hops in this beer, I missed ’em. I quite like hops, so it’s hard for me to score this as a 5, but that’s splitting hairs with a beer this good. Someone wrote this beer is ""delicate"" -- that’s a great way to put it. $12/11.2 oz bottle.",4.8

I popped the cap on this one, and the beer immediately rose to the top and started pouring over the edge.  Not good!  I have to admit that the first thing I noticed about this was that the aroma was a little light.  I guess that’s a result of heightened expectations.  Once it warmed up a bit, the aroma became divine.  Dark fruits (fig, prune, cherry), chocolate, toffee, licorice, cherry cordials and somewhat vinous.  Every sniff peeled back another layer.  As it reached room temp, the aroma became very thick and chewy, just like an impy stout.  After the first sip, I knew I was in for something extraordinary.  
Chocolate, raisin, fig, prune, cherry, licorice, subtle spices, toffee and even a small puff of smoke.  The finish was somewhat dry but very silky smooth.  I find it amazing that something so robust (as in the 10%) can be so delicate, but that’s the nature of this one.  It’s in perfect harmony with the world.",4.8

""330ml in Westvleteren glass at Duvel Café, Stockholm, Sweden.
I had been looking for this beer for a while when I finally got hold of it.
Chocolaty dark and dim appearance w/ very little carbonation or head.
The aroma surprised me since I had been expecting a grand version of Rochefort 10 or something like that, that is, the aroma wasn’t very strong at all.
The flavor is wonderfully ’old’ w/ a smooth, rich bitterness and a nice burn. 
Mouthfeel was the best ever, a bit burning, very majestic if you will.""

If one were rating in terms of complexity, this would have to make the top 10 beers of the world. It was an impressive blend of fruit notes such as peach and cherry combined with darker flavors of toffee and bourbon. I can see why this merits some hype, but its not my favorite in terms of flavor. Perhaps its the Belgian yeast that gave it the funkiness that just didn’t do it for me. Still, for complexity’s sake, I give this an A rating.""

Aroma was almost wine-like, with dark fruits and a strong breadiness, very good, but still not the best I have smelt. Taste is amazingly all over the map, sweet dark fruits first, malty middle, long hoppy finish, very, very complex, every sip was slightly different. Velvetty smooth mouthfeel, without a hint of alcohol. This beer is exceptional and definitely world-class, but I had one better than it so far.",4.8
4584,Westvleteren 12,"Re-rate, from a fresh bottle in Poperinge, Belgium.

Holy moly.  NOW I get it.   Notes of chocolate and sweet malt in the nose, a flowing and feathery whisp of sweet chocolate raisin on the tongue.  There are many more descriptors that I will put down at a later time but holy moly, this beer IS that good.




So this is the almight Westy 12... Pours a bit (actually a lot) thinner than I expected... Dark mahogany tint with a thin head that clings nicely to the glass.  Aroma is cinnamon with a bit of toffee.  Palate is a bit thin, but the flavor makes up for it.  Raisin, yeast, toffee, caramel, and a tinge of vanilla round out the flavors.  Aftertaste is brief with a quick flurry of alcohol, but the latter leaves with a slight evanescence on the tongue.  Leaves the drinker wanting more.  RETASTE:0  Flavor is much more cohesive than last when I tasted it.  The raisin is less prominent, and there seems to be more malted chocolate in the drink.  A bit more bitter than last time, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  Still, for my money, Westy 8 blows this one away.",4.8
4585,Westvleteren 12,"Found at a local beer shop in Belgium. A very black opaque beer, with a small off-white head and not much acid. The aroma is difficult to describe, you can smell malt, raisin, nuts, wood, toffee, etc. Very well balanced. The initial flavour is sweet (but not too sweet) and it has a long aftertaste.
In a blind test, together with La Trappe and St.-Bernardus Abt, this beer was less balanced and more malty than the Bernardus, but clearly ahead of the La Trappe.",4.9

4588,Westvleteren 12,"On draft at the abbey cafe!  Arrived in a chalice, dark chestnut brown, hazy and only moderately translucent with a thick beige head that left delicate lacing.  Aroma of dark roasted malts, molasses, licorice, coffee grounds, bit of alcohol and spice in a cijnnamon, clove and nutmeg kind of way.  Sweet spicy flavor featuring ripe, dark dried fruits like dates and figs, coffee, lots of wild spiciness, clove, allspice, maple syrup and pepper in the finish with all the complex flavors still allowing a pleasant alcohol burn.  Creamy, smooth and full bodied.  Yummy indeed and what a privilege to have my first sample be at the Abbey St Sixtus itself!",4.5

Sweet, but tempered caramel taste with  darkish brown murky color.  Extremely complex in flavor, nose and palate. It has a smatter of four or five styles of beer  (as far as alcohol, taste and bitterness and balance): smooth then spicey and sweet then bitter on the tail; well balanced with hidden alcohol.  I guess hundreds of years of perfected brewing and high standards will do that for a beer.  Hard to get a hold of and very expensive, but well worth the investment.  If you get a chance to go to Belgium I highly recommend you make the trek and by a few cases to bring home.  Heaven in a bottle.  The best balanced as far as alcohol and taste.

Smooth brandy, ripe fruit, raisin, wine, a little hops with a sweet balance of malt and hops. Alcohol plays a perfect role in the taste. Aftertaste is a lingering somewhat bitter taste.

Palate: Absolutely perfect. medium body with a moderate-low carbonation. Wonderfully coating. Flawless.",4.6
4605,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #300


Well, the waiting is over and I finally allowed myself to drink one. Looked beautiful, with a rusty, caramel-red body under a  rocky, large-bubbled, khaki head. A lot of character-adding, chunky particulates as well. Aroma was potent and spicily malted, with dark fruits and apple amongst a myriad of others. Flavor was rich and explosively fruity with cherry and pear coming through after a highly sweet-malted start. Full-bodied with a great deal of alcohol to warm the stomach, throat and nose. Very good, but I’d rather have a La Trappe Quad or a St. Bernardus 12... mainly due to Westy’s high cost and limited availabilty, but also because I feel that St. Bernardus is more flavorful & complex, and La Trappe is more user-friendly. To each their own.

4606,Westvleteren 12,"Saw all the talk about Westly 12 lately, so went to a rerate, just different year.  
2002 bottle- Many of the same characteristics Yeast, rum, figs, and raisins are there. Palate is incredibly smooth, very different from the 98 bottle, but also on the room temp side.  The complexity change alone as it warms is remarkable.  Truly sets the bar for all other beers. 

1998 bottle -

Careful pour, just enough for a small head which recedes slowly.  Dark brown with ruby hues. 
Aromas of nougat, sweet bread dough, rum, and figs. More complex every second, but cant hold off on my first sip.

Doughy, yeasty, the layers keep coming through.  Midway malt prominent with subtle hints of pastry and overripe prune.  Almost a bit cloying, my only complaint.  Carbonation is a bit on the low side which might explain the mouthfeel.

Finishes long.  Lingering toffe/doughy tastes coat your tongue just to tease you that its all gone...

As it nears the bottom of my glass, I know that it is a beer like no other.  A few beers in the world fit into this category, and most are at the top of the charts.  No mistake this being one of them.",4.6
4607,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled.  Pours a deep, but penetrable, brown with red edges with a small white head that dropped quite fast.  Aroma was of candy and dried fruits: raisin, cherry, figs.  Some bready malt and caramel sweetness also came through in the nose.  Flavor was sweet of crystal malt and Belgian candy sugar, with tons of fruitiness and spice.  Hops were there for bittering but only bittering as I got none in the flavor.  Alcohol was more apparent than I think is reasonable, both upfront and in the warm finish.  Body was moderately thick and it went down smooth with slightly more carbonation than I would have liked.  Not number 1 in my books....or 2....or 3.....or 10.....",4.1
4608,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle 33cL.  I was sitting around at a tasting Sunday, when we were about to start up the main event (side by side Dark Lord vs. Speedway).  Glenn (a beeradvocate fellow) was about to leave after the imperial stout showdown, so he generously interrupted us and said, ""Hey, before we move on, is there anyone here who hasn’t had Westy 12.""  A couple of us, myself included, replied, ""Why no, Glenn, why do you ask?""  At which point he proceeded to pull an unlabeled, yellow-capped bottle of this from his cooler, crack it and serve.  Helluva guy.  Dark brown pour, with little whilte head.  Aroma is initally alcohol dominant, but gives way quickly to immense amounts of dried fruits.  The yeast esters are just incredible -- cherries, dates, figs, but mainly raisins.  Spices come through, too.  Cloves and nutmeg mix in with the alcohol.  The flavor is equally complex and interesting.  Raisins dominate, but there are massive amounts of other dried fruits begging to be identified and savored.  Caramel malt is there in force as well.  Unfortunately the alcohol flavor is as strong as the alcohol smell -- it has to be looked past.  The mouthfeel is oily and thick, but the alcohol keeps it clean on the finish.  I docked its aroma and flavor for the over-present alcohol, and the overall simply because I’m not sure it lived up to the incredible hype of the world’s best.  Incredible, absolutely.  World’s best, not quite.",4.3
4609,Westvleteren 12,"(Bottle 33 cl) Dark brown with only a small beige head. Extremely complex with notes of plums, raisins and perhaps some chocolate as well.

Westvleteren 12 is a revelation, a truly heavenly experience - the kind of beer that explodes with flavours in your mouth giving you new impressions each and every time.

Taste, mmmmmmmmmmmm, the taste. Rich sweet, fruits, citrus, rum and raisin, malt, alcohol, and about 40 other things ever second. However, i cant help but think its lacking something, more body i think. This is a very very good beer, your can drink a few of them too, if u can get them, unlike alot of quad’s. Pleased to have been given the opertunity to try it and will be aging the other 2 for a while, to see what goodness i can get out of that.

Sweet, overly ripe plums are the first thing I taste, followed by some pears and then hints of chocolate, nuts and even some spiciness.  A caramelized brown sugariness dominates the flavoring.

This particular bottle was rated at Lowlander and that was also the place where I had my first bottle thanks to Duff’s insitance. Aroma is vanilla, sugar and caramel with some chocolate and dark fruits. Red grapes and raisins too. Plus something that I can only describe as playdough. In fact it is reminiscent of all the best things you have ever sniffed at. Appearance is so very very close to perfection. Deep almost black mahogany red body and just the right amount of off white head and lace. Only reason it gets a 4 from me is that the head always dies just that little bit too soon but it is clearly the most inviting ""drink me I am gorgeous"" looking beer there is. Ok, what do I say about the flavour? Chocolate, cream, vanilla, raisins, pudding, a little biscuit, mazipan and just a touch of spice and malt. Finish is head and shoulders above everything else I have ever tried. I am not drunk, I will stand by this statement. A wonderful gentle warmth from the alcohol, more caramel (but more like toffee this time), just a dab of spice and also some cardboard and leather. Unbelievable length. Nothing has ever left me demanding another sip or being so sorrowful as you drain the last drops as this beer. On top of all this it gets you very very drunk indeed. I have been lucky enough to have had sessions on this and it is truely legendary. Nothing has ever satisfied me so consistently as this always does.

Taste is of nuts, caramel, apples, celery and licorice.  Excellent mouthfeel with a great amount of carbonation despite the small head brought forth by the pour.  Each taste seems to linger in the mouth for an eternity.



1986 bottle sampled 2/1/07



Pours flat with only a sparse hint of bubbles one might find in a glass of wine.  Smells of alcohol, dark fruit, oak, leather, hints of vanilla.  Tastes of chewy toffee, caramel, bourbon, raisins, chocolate and oak.  No sherry notes to speak of which is a surprise and a testament to this beer.  Subtle elements of spice are present and with only a hint of warming alcohol, this is dangerously drinkable.  Finishes with some celery and lots of rich chocolate.  Palate is reminiscent of maple syrup and is rich and velvety.  This was a surprising treat, but as good as it is at 21, it is definitely past its prime and is best enjoyed at 1, 5 or even 10 years old.",4.8

Yeasty sweet, fruity vinous raisin aroma which got more complex as it warmed.  Noticable alcohol in the aroma.  After 10 minutes, I finally decide to take a drink, this taste lasts for a while and changes as it goes down.  My first notes on the flavor say: Good beer.  Chewy goodness.  Then I try for a minute or two to figure out what I’m tasting...stuff like vinous dates, brown sugar, and a bunch of other stuff I couldn’t pick out because I decided to just sit back and enjoy it.  There was a hint of sourness and then a nice bitter finish.  Medium body, watery texture with a dry finish.  It was fun to try this beer.",4.3

Appearance is rich and brown/mahogany with a long lasting thin brown head.  Spicey flavor that is superbly balanced.  Very fruity and nutty.  Warming flavor and palate.  WOW!  This is one darn good beer.,4.6
4643,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to Lachesis for sending this one to me from Belgium. Aged for six months after I received it. Poured muddy brown with a huge off white head. The head retention on this beer is quite ridiculous only to be out done by the lacing this brew leaves.  Heavily carbonated.  Aroma is a sweet, bread, banana pudding, yeast, and a combination of fruits. Has a thick silky mouthfeel that is quite superb. I am not even sure what exactly I tasted. There was just so much going on that it was difficult for me to isolate any one flavor. Definately spiced with a combination of cherry, grape, plum, apricot, banana, peach, berries, and bread. The spices keep the sweetness from overly dominating. There is a slight alcohol warming sensation in the finish, but it is hidden very well under the fruit attack. Will definately need more of this to figure it out.",4.3
4644,Westvleteren 12,"Had to be something special for my #100
rating and this did not dissapoint. Nothing less than perfection in every regard, it’s greatness goes well beyond my words. This and the Rochefort 10 have a unique silky mouthfeel which sets them apart from the rest, only the Westy 8 comes close. Compared to the Rochefort, this might have a touch more sweetness and less alcohol presence, with such complexity you could write a book about it...I think they must have this on tap in heaven.",5.0
4645,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a hazy dark amber/light brown color with a fizzy off-white color. Not much head to start. The smell is dirt-like with hints of alcohol, raisin, yeast, and that Belgian horse-hair flavor common in many.  Flavor has some sweet dark candy sugar up front with a raisin/plum flavor coming in later. Very warming as the alcohol hits you pretty quick but is not overwhelming in the aftertaste as a sweetness re-enters. Some aging will do this beer well, but I am surprised by it’s world class rating since it doesn’t seem as complex as the Westy 8.",3.5
4646,Westvleteren 12,"I stared at this one for half an hour before mustering up the courage to begin.  Finally, I went for it...  Hazy copper-brown color with a lively, fizzy, off-white and thin head.  Beautiful lacing as the experience progresses.  Aroma is chocolate, prunes, coriander, nutmeg and sugar-brazed walnuts.  Flavor?  Delicious.  Flavor was a rotating sequence of caramel, nuts and toffee.  Subtle carbonation and wonderful malt complexion.  Warming in every sense - there goes my head, there glows my throat...  Not the second coming of Christ, but this is good stuff.",4.6
4647,Westvleteren 12,"First, thanks Chris for the present.  An excellent beer.  Gave a sip to my son who commented that it was nicely sweet, not too bitter.  He was very correct.  It had also nice appearance with a very nice head.  Even so, it still was not as smooth as the  Rochefort Trappistes 10 which I felt, regardless of availability, was a slightly better beer.",4.6
4648,Westvleteren 12,"Wow!  I decided that i would wait to crack this beauty until i set a personal best in the pole vault.  well, friday i jumped 17’1"" and today i just finished my bottle of westy 12.  the cap was best by 10.03.07 meaning march 10, 2007 so, this was just over a year old.  this was amazing. It poured into my westy glass a pleasing brown, with lots of floaties and an ample sized head that fades a bit while a thin layer exists until the end leaving some nice lace on the sides of the glass.  the smell just said ""drink me"".  it was sweet and yeasty.  the first sip made me want to just suck down the entire glass, but i restrained myself and enjoyed the rest over the next 40 minutes.  the taste included a bread, candy, and fruit.  there was a distinct tartness in the middle and a nice bitterness toward the end rounding out all the wonderful flavors.  alcohol was not present hardly in the taste, but the warming in the finish was very welcome.  if you have not tried this yet, somehow acquire a bottle--mail order, trade, you should try this.  that being said, this may be the best beer i have tried to date.  not one that i would drink every day, too expensive now hard to get(and probably too heavy) to be a favorite, but this is so artful.  as satisfying as a 7 course meal.  i am glad that i got to try westy 12.  and i look forward to someday drinking a beer that will surpass this in quality if that is possible.",4.6
4649,Westvleteren 12,"I’ll keep quiet as to where I actually got to sample this beer, as I don’t want to get anyone in trouble, but it was very kind of the person to do so and I thank them for it. Poured a lovely dark brown with a small tan head.  Aroma of plum and spice - almost like a very nice warmed piece of plum cake - very unique and inviting.  The taste again was dominated by plum and spice - I’m having a hard time describing it - it was very rich a dessert like, almost like a fine after dinner port.  The alcohol is very present but only adds to the overall taste.  This was truly a lovely beer, but only one I could have a sample of after dinner once in a while.  Contrast that to the Rochefort 10 I tried earlier this week, which I could drink very easily a couple of bottles.  Still, an incredible drinking experience, one of the main reasons I got into the ratebeer community.",4.4
4650,Westvleteren 12,"25 cl. bottle. Everything about this beer is as close to perfection as I’ve seen so far. 
Probably the best beer in the world!!",4.8
4651,Westvleteren 12,"I sought it out because of its high ratings on this website.  While it is a very good beer but it wouldn’t put it in at 100%.  It definitely has a small batch, hand/craft-brewed taste.  Rich caramely alcohol on the nose which is repeated in the flavor along with dark, sweet fruits (figs, dates, and prunes).  Has a well-rounded and smooth mouth feel across its wide ranging flavor profile.  Very complex all around.  A very nice trappist ale with a homemade feel.",4.1
4652,Westvleteren 12,"A friend of mine said that this beer is everything that is right about beer and he was correct.  It is simply the best beer I have ever had.  It is warm and creamy and nutty with a touch of fruit and no bitter taste afterward.  Lkke a previous rater, I will let my supply age and see how it is in 6 months or so.",4.8
4653,Westvleteren 12,"If this beer was any more rare I’d probably be rater #5507 rather than #557... or, am I understanding these numbers backwards?  Whatever the story of this ubiquitiously rare beer, it’s not pleasant to look at, a residue-filled, muddy brown with a white film for a head.  The aroma is darkly sweet, malt mashed with dark dry fruits, raisins and prunes and dates... and a lurking alcohol presence.  The taste is excellent - yeasty and fruity and toasty and laced with alcohol - sweet but well-balanced.  The finish is a long, dry alcoholic one.  I see that tradition seems to dictate that I rate this higher than I am today, but this is the best I can do despite the fame of this ale.  I will try some of my cellared stock of this rare brew next year and rerate.

Archer Liquors, Chicago, IL",4.0
4654,Westvleteren 12,"tricky to rate, this Westveltwelve.  most seem tempted to rate it tops in all categories, due, i suppose, to its price and rarity and renown.  it’s aroma is typical belgian (a nose i usually don’t particularly care for, in most cases), its appearance a murky brown with short-lived head.  there’s my lowest ratings.  but the flavor is out-of-this world.  balance.  as with the rest of life, great beer is all about balance.  sweet, with a backup dryness and spiciness, smooth mouthfeel, great finish.  excellent.",4.2
4655,Westvleteren 12,"A fine Belgian beer, one of the best you can get if you aren’t in Belgium or in Queens, NY.",4.4
4656,Westvleteren 12,"Dark brown/ruby. Small head for a Belgian. #1 on the site, my first time trying this beer, I’m a little excited. Dark fruits, sugar, malt in the aroma. Flavor to match with a distinct dryness neutralizing the sweetness. Very well balanced. More carbonation than expected by the appearance. Full body, clean finish. Pleasant aftertaste of the same flavors. Excellent.",4.3
4657,Westvleteren 12,"Beer 500. Pours a very cloudy, very yeasty dark brown, similar to the color of the bottle its been housed in.  When held to light some orange and red show.  Oodles of yeast.  Head is everlasting off-white froth that has dozens of bubbly strings rising from the sides of the glass.  Leaves an excellent lacing. When viewed from the side, the beer is like a starry night with particles floating and shooting all over the place. Quite unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Smell is strong and wafts across the room all by itself.  Powerfully fragrant, exhibiting caramel, roasted malt, fresh prunes, dark grapes, slight chocolate and raisins all in perfect proportion.  Taste is well crafted and of perfect thickness and viscosity. Coats tongue long enough to leave behind flavors of roasted malt balanced with pit fruits. No misused or maligned flavors. Alcohol is recessed in taste for nearly 11% and does not bother the palate in any way.  This beer certainly has an excellent reputation that precedes it and admittedly that worried me about rating it. How do you rank something that is supposedly one of, if not THE greatest beers in the world. Well, after drinking it I have to say it is great and I’ve never had a Belgian of better overall quality, taste, appearance and aroma. I can’t say that it was spectacularly ground-breaking or that it reformed my impression of beer, but it did perform what it was supposed to for its style, and it did so magnificently.  For now, this beer is king.",4.8
4658,Westvleteren 12,Thanks to beerhandy I was finally able to try this one. I was not disappointed. It is neck and neck with the Rochefort 10. Thanks alot. I couldn’t believe how fast that I got this.,4.7
4659,Westvleteren 12,"So, the time has come. In approximately 14 hrs, my senior paper is due. I have 24 pages, no footnotes, intro, or conclusion. I should hit about 40 pages (including coversheet and bibliography). So, I sit down with the monster, the king, Westy 12. It pours a golden brown, settling to a deep brown-red in my glass, with a big offwhite head that is peppered with little yeast particles. The smell is intoxicating. Roasted coffee, toast, white wine, bread, fruit rollups. This is definitely 8’s bigger brother. Very vinous nose. Taste is huge. Similar to Bernardus, but more going on. It’s epic. Last night I was discussing how I wasn’t sure that I really care for dark Belgians. This may be the exception that proves the rule. THe taste is very yeasty and fruity at the same time. I get wine at first, almost like bread soaked in wine. Through the middle and at the finish a pleasing bitterness comes through. In between the middle and finish, tamarind and unsweetened tea marry together to form one of the best tastes I’ve gotten from Belgian. This is indescribable. This time, the beer begins sweet and moves into the tea flavor once again. The alcohol warms my insides. While this is not my favorite beer of all time, I cannot find anything within this beer that detracts. Is this perfection?",4.8
4660,Westvleteren 12,Black with ligth brown head. The aroma has a plesant hint of the yeast. Soft and complex taste with good long lingering complex aftertaste. I love it.,4.6
4661,Westvleteren 12,"My new son-in-law stopped over unexpectedly, and to impress a budding beer fanatic, I popped one open to share, or so I thought...four empty bottles later we finally had to stop ourselves.  But I don’t see what all the fuss is about, really!  Seriously, this is a wonderful beer.   Rich chocolatey texture with dark fruits, plums, dates, raisins, and currants.   Subtle alcohol notes as smooth as silk.  You owe yourself the time to relax and enjoy a long leisurely sampling of this spectacular drink.  Linger long with each sip, and savor it’s complexities.",4.3
4662,Westvleteren 12,"This is a champion beer.  From the bouquet to the finish, it is dark, thick, caramel-malty and deeply well balanced.  It’s a bitch to get this--even in Belgium.  But it’s worth it.",4.6
4663,Westvleteren 12,"1 Yr Old Bottle. Raisins, liquorice, malts, alcohol and raspberry. Aromas seem subtle to the point of being muted and subdued but still pleasant. Rich and sweet with a brilliant balance and less noticeable alcohol in the mouth.  Light acidity and suprising hoppiness in the finish. All in all very good but not mind blowing as I might have expected - a younger sample may have been more my cup of tea, or perhaps an older one!? Either way its one to try again.",3.9
4664,Westvleteren 12,"Dark and super smell. Sweet and full body. Strong good finish. In my oppinion not as good as Roquefort 10 which I tried the same night.. Maybe because the beer ""hype"" about this beer. I’ll definitely try it again. :)~",4.4

4666,Westvleteren 12,"Rerate: 330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.2%. Dark reddish brown colour, some floaties in the glass. Large to moderate beige head. Lovely aroma of dark dried fruits, brown kandij sugar, vintage fortified wine. Hints of oak, leather and mild spices. The medium sweet and complex flavour has also notes of dark dried fruits, oak, brown kandij sugar and mild spices, followed by fairly distinct hops. Best beer in the world? - dunno, but it’s a darn good one, that’s for sure. Original rating: 330 ml bottle, bought at Pivni Galerie, Prague. Hazy dark reddish brown colour, enormous tan head. Lovely complex aroma of fruits, oak, leather and spices. Flavour is surprisingly bitter - hops of course, but also dead yeast cells? Leaves a not entirely pleasant bitter aftertaste on the back of my tongue. Elements of oak, caramel, toffee and spices. Warming mouthfeel, as expected. I much preferred the Rochefort 10 to this one.",4.4
4667,Westvleteren 12,"At long last, I came upon this famous brew. Fate conspired one day to bring this sacred beer to me...and, lo, I did keep it at a cool temperature until special occasions dictated a special beer. 

Although, it should be noted. This beer is its own special occasion.

Beautiful but thin white head with some lacing on the glass. Smell was heavenly. Full-tasting and complex. 

I think, to be honest, I liked the Rochefort 10 over this one. But this is excellent. 

It is also very strong. My ears are flushed and radiating heat. Droplets of sweat are on my bald head..but, oh, this is divine.",4.6

4670,Westvleteren 12,"Poured black color with a good head, dissipated to a cover over the top of beer. The aroma I detected in this one was of a brandy aroma which was alright. With the high alcohol content of this beer I was thinking before I tasted the beer, alcohol would be the flavor. Not the case, alcohol content wasn’t the dominate flavor in this beer. Smooth on the palate and an enjoyable beer.",4.0

But else a very lovely beer.",4.6
4674,Westvleteren 12,"Lost on my way through Belgium one clear, crisp, late winter evening, hope almost shattered, I stumbled across an aging man on the side of a dirt road. Cloaked, meditating, he weilded a glowing chalice, and muttered in a language I do not speak, but understood to mean, “take this glowing chalice, and become one with our beer.” I was nearly blinded by a glowing pillow of froth, and holding the glass to my nose, it became enshrouded in rings of trees bearing plums, burgundy grapes, hop bushes sprouting vanilla, strands of pale vienna malt, rum barrels and butterscotch. In a haze, I tipped the chalice to my lips, and a sea of velvet washed away first the tongue, then mouth, throat, stretching through to the soul. Vaguely I recall the monk gazing gleefully through my enraptured eyes, swept away by the 12, the most sacred of numbers, the 12 gods of Westvleteren. When I awoke in their humble monastery, a tinge of sorrow overcame me, for I may never experience joy this deep again. But I soon realized that I was fortunate to have had this experience at all, and was ready to continue the journey...

4677,Westvleteren 12,"Tasting such a highly-rated beer I expected to be a touch dissapointed by it. Au contraire, it really is as good as one is led to believe. Beautiful aroma, malty with hints of brown sugar and a little fruitiness. Pours chocolate brown with a creamy off-white head that lasts quite well through the drink. Flavour is sweet, very smooth and nicely carbonated you can hardly tell that it is 10%. Banana-ey taste at first, gives way to maltiness with sugar, spices and light fruitiness all present with other flavours I missed or can’t remember. This is a simply marvellous beer and is fully deserving of its status.",4.8

I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed. Aroma is nice but not a fragrant as I expected. I let it sit for 10 minutes in the glass to let it set up and true to form the beer came up a red/brown with a decent tan head. Flavor was of raisin, and malt. Very warm and sweet opening my eyes every time I drank it. The finish was smooth with a yeast kicker on the end.

Good white head and good condition. Obvious alcohol and spicy malt, with a faintly herbal dandelion and burdock note. Figgy in the mouth but surprisingly thin. Roasty bitter finish with hints of banana and some trace hoppiness. Re rate for six month old bottle (8-3-8-4-16), Born on 27/11/03. Deep ruby red/brown, thin off white head and quite low condition. Muted bready yeast,sweet figs and a touch of alcohol in the nose. Quite sweet and fruity with hints of yeast and cola in the mouth. Finish is sweet and yeastily bitter.

4683,Westvleteren 12,"[b]#100[/b], I got my crown! Thanks to JCapriotti and the Milwaukee RB action squad for this beer.  11.2oz. NB Worthy glass. 60°.  The beer fizzed out of the bottle when I popped the cap and continued to fizz slightly. Poured muddy chocolate brown with a 1/2"" off white head. As the head subsides, the foam rings the glass and shows the lacing that will steadily form throughout the drinking of this beer. Nose is yeasty, but hard to get much with the big foam head blocking the beer. When the head dies a bit, I got some cinnamon and spice hints along with the dominant yeast and malt. After 30 minutes the nose starts to blossom and smells like whole wheat pizza crust. The first sip tells me the beer is really ""full."" The beer has steady carbonation that makes it feel nice and the thickness of the beer coats. The taste is elaborate malts and yeast. Mildly sweet with citrus and estery notes as well as brown sugar, and nuts?. The beer is not sour, but sour enough to keep it from being ""sweet."" The flavors are complex, but restrained. It is not as ""flashy"" as some beers. It wants you to coax flavors and aroma out of it. The nose doesn’t waft up and hit you while you are not paying attention; you have to get your nose into it to smell it. The flavor is the same way, it is restrained and ""it is what it is."" The beer is probably a good representation of the monks that created it, ""rich"", but you would never know it. The finish is initially sour then mellows out to a calming, complex, but understated finish. 
 
 [b]RE-RATE [/b] 4/27/05 Bottle @ Hopleaf in a Westvleteren glass. Aroma is subtle. Spicy with bourbon? notes. The flavor is huge. Dark fruit, yeast, almost a caramelly flavor. The mouthfeel is absolutely amazing. The beer has the sweetness and flavor of a dubbel x2, hence the quad nomer? Raisins, plums, yum. Once again, it is very good, just too reserved. Very good beer. Scored the same.",4.3

Cap date 21/12/02 
This pours thick into the glass, producing an unusually large head considering the alcohol content of the beer. A few solids at the end of the pour. Slightly hazy reddish brown in color with a light mocha colored head.
Complex aroma, honey, brown sugar, dates, cherries all melded in malty madness.
The flavor follows the aromas, sweet and chewy with some alcohol that didn’t fade as it warmed. I would probably drink more of the 8 if both were comparatively priced and easily available as the 8 hides it’s alcohol a touch better and still delivers that same flavor that the 12 provides. Both the Westvleteren 8 and 12 are my kind of Belgians and I must learn how to brew something like this.  A very tasty brew that is worth seeking out.",4.2

Bottle poured brown with huge creamy head. Aroma is complex, carmel and roasted hops, dates, raisins. mmmhhh. Tasted flavors of rasins and malts, and oak, sweetness to the soul! I feel as though I am  missing this, it is going down so fast, and there is such enjoyment. The finish is balanced, not to dry. Amazing. Only a true friend would grab the only one, and give it ot me.

4690,Westvleteren 12,"I was skeptical when I heard all of the ravings about this beer, but I got my hands on a bottle and it was absolutely amazing. It poured out a beautiful dark brown and smelled sweet right after opening. The taste was excellent. Delicious sweet taste with an excellent alcohol flavor. Simply amazing.

4691,Westvleteren 12,"Happy birthday to clvand0 with the drinking of this beer. Although it was a few days ago, I still can’t get this one out of my head. The beer poured a beautiful dark brown color with a 2 finger head that barely falls at all. The lace is almost solid around the top of the chalice as I drank the beer down. The nose was very fruity, with lots of sweet fig tones, and an almost appley, crisp aroma. There is a nice spiceyness as it warms as well. The flavor is awesome. Very mellow, wtih a spiceyness and an alcohol burst that play very well together. The flavor moves into the fig, and slightly bready notes, but also with a touch bitter on the finish. The feel was smooth, slightly creamy and moderate to thick. Just a nice beer. I didn’t want to put the glass down with this beer. This is definately a world class beer. Thanks to my buddy Sheep for trading this to me before I knew what a treat it was.",4.9

4693,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Pours a deep ruby red/brown with lots of floaties. One finger head that fades into a bubble film. Nose is very sweet and strong of dried fruits. The first flavors to come out are prune, raisin, alcohol, earthy (clay), plum, figs, and brown sugar. Secondary flavors are apple/pear, dough, yeast, and salt. As it warms, the alcohol really comes out, esp. on the finish. This is a very, very good beer by anyone’s standards. But, it is not perfect. The alcohol is a little too upfront, as it detracts from some of the more subtle flavors in the beer. It is not as deep and multi-layered as I was hoping. But, in its defense, the bar for Westy 12 is very, very high.",4.5

And while it was a very tasty and delicious offering, i found that i have had far better in my opinion. Poured a murky reddish brown with a small white head, a fabulous aroma of grape, raisin, plum, sugar and chocolate. The flavor was impressive, and tasty, yet not as complex as i had hoped, with notes of raisin, earth, and some spice, a prominent alcohol taste in the finish as well. Good, and I will drink again, just not anytime soon at the price i paid",4.2
4695,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle thanks to wohlfs, average off white head, medium lacing, great aroma of fruit and alcohol, great taste of combination of citrus, alcohol, raisin, mild earthy tones, very smooth and slides off the palate with great aftertaste of alcohol and raisin.  definitely good.",4.5
4696,Westvleteren 12,Bottle scored from Pailhead and consumed on New Years Eve and also my birthday.  Hooray for me.  Nice deep brown color.  Frothy off-white head leaves good lacing.  Aroma is sweet and fruity.  Rich and smooth body.  Just so nice after drinking shitty airport beer on my way back to Michigan.  Balance is well done.  Fruity and sweet flavors with just a hint of hop in the finish.  Lovely.,4.8
4697,Westvleteren 12,"i was in brugges, belgium recently and i went into a little store there that sold approximately 600 different beers. i asked the lady at the desk what she thought the best beer they carried was and she said it was westvleteren abt 12, the one with the gold cap. i think i have to agree with her. it’s the best beer i’ve had besides rochefort 10. a little lighter in colour, and a bit harsher. nevertheless, incredibly good:lots of hops, a bit of citrus, coffee, and plum flavours were quite noticable, if i remember correctly. it’s a good one, drink up!",4.7
4698,Westvleteren 12,"Deep foggy ruby/brown color, with a off white head that forms.  I catch a lot of caramel, candi sugar, cinnamon, and pie crust.  Tremendous taste, very doughy, with dark fruits, butterscotch.  Not as complex as I expected like Rochefort 10.  I do get hints of chocolate, that subdue the fruit the more I drink.  A beer with a lot of depth.",4.2

4703,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle Pours a dark brown witha fizzy off white head.  great thick even lacing.   Terrific aromas of raisons, prunes, figs, brown sugar and a touch of belgian clove/spice.  Flavors are much the same, very complicated and busy.  A bit smokey and musty but still fairly sweet.  Feel is a lively carbonation and a smooth palate.  Soft warm sweet aftertaste. Not No. 1 for nothing. Delicious !",4.4
4704,Westvleteren 12,"Cafe in de Vrede, April 2013, fresh comparison of all three Westvleteren. Cloudy dark brown with a lasting off-white head. Aroma of brown sugar, caramel, dried fruit and vineous alcohol, along with cinnamon and a hint of banana. Sweet and full bodied flavour with brown sugar and dried fruit, vineous and slightly hot alcohol. Grassy hops, and a quite bitter finish




Original excited 2004 rating for 4.8: A cloudy to muddy dark red/ruby brown beer with very little head. What can I add about the aroma, that wasn’t already said here? I picked up earth and plums at first and then so many other impressions that I couldn’t pick them apart, but just sat and enjoyed. 
The flavour is quite sweet and malty, but balanced and very long lasting (the beer lasted an hour, the flavour lasted another hour). There is a lot of hops to balance, and a licorice dark malt note too that adds a dry finish. Round, pleasant mouthfeel with just noticable bubbles and an almost oily whisky like mouthfeel. It’s just a wonderful drink and at risk of being Ratebeer conformist, I’ll have to say that it earns the 20 overall score second to only Kaggen.",4.4
4705,Westvleteren 12,"Unbelievable!  What else can I say.  Can you give the aroma higher then 10?  This beer has the greatest aroma.  I had to sit down when I smelled this beer.  Bananas, Apples, Candy, Malt, and Hops and Caramel are all very present.  The taste is spectacular, but just a bit too sweet.  The caramel, banana and wine taste are quite unique.  Just awesome. 
Re-rate: I was not quite as impressed this time.  This particular bottle was a bit one dimensional and I am not sure why.  It was still great, but I am beginning to think that there is a lack of consistency in this beer. Still a world class beer though.

Re-rate: As great as ever once again.  This time my friend and I picked up gin and tonic in the taste.  It is hard to believe there was still another aspect to pick up.",4.9

4708,Westvleteren 12,"Ok, so I went for it, got done with a long project so I had to celebrate. Once again I was like a little kid at Christmas. Pours out a nice deep brown color with a decent sized white head. The aroma is amazing, with complex fruits and sweet spice. The taste is almost godly. There is such complexity I have no idea how they pull it off. It has a nice bananna flavor with other more subtle notes of spice, fruits and brown sugar, with slight yeast and a tiny little note of hops. Awesome brew, I can’t wait to have an aged one of these.",4.8

4713,Westvleteren 12,"Coppery amber in color with an off white head and a little cloudy yeast sediment.  Interesting aroma, definite alcohol smell, then a wine like aroma, oakey yet it still has some creamy malt fragrance.  Alcohol warms as I taste this, malt sweetness dominates, nutty, caramelly, and creamy vanilla in the finish.  The beer sits on the tongue and lingers with a warm malt creaminess.  This is a great beer, the only thing keeping this from being a daily beer is the availability.  Thanks ClarkVV for letting me try this.",4.5

4716,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle:  Excellent aroma.  Very malty with lots of fruit (apple, cherry, grape), chocolate, and caramel.  Alcohol is detectable in the nose but not overpowering.   Pours  a dark brown with a little red/orange with a decent off-white head that dies rather quickly.  Lots of sediment floating around, but not noticeable until you get to the last bit because a full glass is such a dark brown.   Very malty.  Sweet but not too sweet.   Flavors of fruit, caramel, and rasion.  Some chocolate in there.  Like the aroma, alcohol is detectable in the flavor, but not overpowering.  Balances nicely with the other flavors.  Has a nice warming effect.  Has sort of an sweet apple, caramel and alcohol finish .  Very smooth and great texture.   Light bitterness with the first few sips, but absolultely none outside those first few.    Gets better and better with every sip.  Definitely lives up to the reputation.",4.6

Not a very big nose, but what is has, powermalt and balsamics, could make a dead man walking again. A lot of carbonation, witch actually ruined the first sips. And I DID let it sit in the celler for three weeks before opening. The taste is a piece of heaven, I bet God has one of these everyday, but not for it´s taste as such, more the uniqe balance in the brew. Chestnuts, butterscotch, sherry and wet wood lingers for a looong time in the finish. had the big setup with wife, fireplace, Stilton and grapes and it was worth it all.",4.1

4720,Westvleteren 12,A real shame. I got the bottle for nothing and got to drink it all by myself. Thanks St. Ralph.  Pours clear deep red with a tight tan head. Everything about this beer was mellow. It made it very hard to decern the qualities. All the flavours had melded into one. Aroma was plum and raisin with a bit of carmel. Thick mouthfeel. Hard to locate any alcohol in the flavours but by the end of the bottle were apparent. Toffee and buttery malts. Yeast and raisin. Notes of chocolate and coffee.  Some cherry and raspberry tart. Really wonderful.,4.6

Both have loads of character, are dark and interesting, smokey and fruity with a hint of licorice root. I was totally impressed with both, but even then I didn’t score a 5, which means the search continues.",4.4
4723,Westvleteren 12,"I finally got around to drinking the bottle that I dragged across the world with me some 18 months ago. It was worth the wait. What a rich and beautifully balanced beer, raisiny hints of madeira, the texture of a fine aged port, bubbles from an ancient champagne. Complexity and simplicity in one glass. I hate to say it but I agree with every one else, this is fine beer!",4.5

Taste: very sweet, lots of malts in here, tons of yeast flavors, some bitterness - this is the epitome of balance.  Caramel, candy sugar, roasted malts, plum, raisin, toffee, wine grapes, port, cereal grains, and grapes round out the flavors.  Finishes quite dry, with a sweet, pleasing coating around your mouth.  Wow.  There is much complexity to this beer.",4.4

4728,Westvleteren 12,"Alrighty then..., I gave this one the maximum rating, because  I really can’t imagine a better tasting beer. There is simply nothing to improve about this one. It’s comparable with a Rochefort 10, but with an incredibly wide range of fruity tastes and other stuff of which I really don’t know  the English words for. I guess it’s  worth travelling +/- 260 kilometres to get a crate, if only I had a driving licence (bagger!).",5.0

4732,Westvleteren 12,"Poured reddish brown with a medium off-white head that left a lacing on the glass and film on the beer.  The smell is strong and enticing:  fruity red wine, with some spiciness.  I hypothesize that opening a bottle and leaving it in an unventilated room would have the same effect as putting up an air freshener or burning a scented candle.  The taste is extraordinarily complex and well-layered.  It starts off sweet with obvious fruit overtones.  In the mouth it gives way partially to some spiciness and a mild roasted flavor.  After swallowing it leaves a sticky sweet taste in the mouth that repeats on you long after you’ve finished it.  The alcohol warms the throat, but is exceptionally well-hidden in the taste of the beer.  Very smooth, amazingly drinkable, and undeniably enjoyable.  I will keep my other two bottles in my cellar a while longer to see what aging does to this fine brew.  Overall, I felt this beer lived up to the hype and then some.",4.6
4733,Westvleteren 12,"Nice dense, light tan head which reduces to a nice thin foam.  Reforms quickly upon swirling.  Light carbonation.  Nice rich aroma.  Plums, raisins, alcohol, caramel and a myriad of other smells in this complex aroma.  Bit of cheese as the brew warms.  Medium brown/mahagony in color.  Huge amount of sediment in the bottle.  Very woody in flavor.  Soft on the palate with a good bit of malts, alcohol and more fruit.  Seems slightly off to me but I can’t explain why.  Seems, dare I say, like a little plastic in there.  Still excellent flavor but not quite as complex as the aroma.  Alcohol kind of dominates the palate and may be killing some of the flavor.  Finish is warming and a little sweet.  I have been holding on to this one for a while to be used as my 500th rating.  Thanks to AMX1970390 for the brew.  I am a little disappointed with this.  A very, very good brew but to me there are some better brews out there.",4.3

Mahogany.

Heavily aromatic, complex, winey nose of cherries, plums, currants, caramel and toffee.

Complex, melded flavor. Up front, the beer is lacking in my opinion but does possess notes of cherries and grapes. Mid-palate leans into a brandy-like sweetness, notes of caramel and pepper and finishes with hints of plums and berries. The alcohol is precisely hidden throughout the brew and it simply just doesn’t show its potency. That being said, I truly don’t find this beer to be all that flavorful and I never have. It’s a great beer but I don’t think its the best beer in the world. I can see why others do though.",4.4

Full, almost orgasmic aroma of prune juice, grape skins, tobacco, vinous notes... so much more that I can’t describe. Flavor.... just as full. A dry fruity caramel, whisky barrel flavored sweet coffee, vinous prunes, spices, banana. A bit of yeasties in the glass... hard to pick it out in the aroma/flavor though. Maybe its the slight dryness. Sticky mouthfeel... fizzy by the looks, but not so much in the feel (which is good). Warming in the belly... to be enjoyed slowly. Mmm.....  I almost feel bad knocking it down slightly...  I think I'm just insecure about perfect scores.",4.8

4737,Westvleteren 12,"A special thanks to Jim Dorsch of Vienna, Virginia (Whole Foods Market) for supplying me two cases of this remarkable beer.  The bottle is dated ""11.06.06"" - was very carefull not to confuse 6 with 8, as 8 lacks a solid vertical line on the left side like the 6.  This beer pours (in Westvleteren glass) a dark, dark brown-red liquid with a generous one inch thick light caramel colored beige head that dissipates slowly, so slowly leaving a nice sized layer on top.  Aroma is of port wine, figs, grapes, plum, faint-pleasant alcohol, berries, dates, malt, yeast.  My mouth waters, but I can’t tell if it is because of the aroma or simply the anticipation.  Flavor is of port wine, figs, all those things and more!!  I was expecting quite a bit from this beer - and it delivers.  As this beer warms - it hits me - this beer is St. Bernardus Abt 12 with a fruitier nose, and less intense taste, very seductive.  Definitely one to drink again and again.",5.0
4738,Westvleteren 12,"The aroma is very wine-like with hints of herbs and madeia, yeast, choco and so on and so on... It has many dimensions! It has a dark body, with a short lasting head.

4742,Westvleteren 12,"Third Rate, Jan 13, 2013:  Courtesy of Skyview, this is a bottle from the recent official four pack set.  Brown color with a large head.  Malty and lightly herbal aroma.  Much the same for flavor.  This run seems to be between my previous ratings, and closer to the first.  None of the typical yeast or herbal/spice character.  No hops, no nuts... sigh.  7/4/7/4/15 (3.7)



Re-Rate Jan 13, 2006: Many thanks to JK for sharing the holy grail.  Now my original rating was pretty down on this beer and though my opinion has gone up, I still do not think it is the ""end all be all"".  Still the same murky brown color with a thin tan head.  Aroma is outstanding.  A complex blend of herbs, spices and dark fruits.  The taste is great, yet subdued.  Velvety grape, sweet malt and Noble hops.  Very fine, but to compare with Rochefort 10, much of the taste is the same yet much more subtle.  While subtle can be a good thing, in this case, I think it robs the beer of true greatness.  8/4/7/4/17 (4.0)



Original rating Sept. 20, 2004: Pours a dark amber color with no head.  Looks beautiful, like a scotch or brandy!  Aroma is... a little bland.  Just a few hints of barley for the upcomming joy.  Oh well, first sip! ...  What?  Where the hell is the flavor?  This has mild hits of barley and malt with a bit of spice and bread, but barely recognizeable!  Don’t get me wrong, this is a decent brew.  The best in the world?  Are you kidding me?  The monks who are bottling this bland beer and eventually peddling it to me at $8 a bottle are laughing all the way to the bank.  What a joke. 7/4/6/3/13 (3.3).",3.7

Very intense experience, worthy of being called one of the world’s best.",4.7

Tastes malty, with layered dark and light fruit, including prunes, cherries, apples, pears, dates, and brown sugar.  Medium palate, with a very complex, smooth finish.  The finish was also crisp, slightly dry, very fruity, extremely velvety smooth.  This is a very good beer, with extremely well hidden alcohol, and an exquisite finish.  As it warmed, more pronounced fruit emerged like the swollen labes of a Geisha girl.  A marvelous beer......not in my upper echelon, but marvelous.",4.2

This has been my holy grail of beers for over a year now. High expectations abound. Pours a deep red/brown color with no signs of co2 other than a nice large tan head. The head diminishes relatively quickly and leaves a nice creamy layer. Lace clings to the glass. The aroma is rich and earthy; malt and dried fruits, plums and spices. Hints of bubblegum and candy sugar. Flavor has a sweet start with quick effervescent spreading (rolling) of a dry metallic hop bite. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and surprisingly effervescent.

Flavor appears one-dimensional at first, but becomes obviously more complex and mellows as it warms. More dry than I had expected. A great warming sensation and a nice buzz that seems to come only from the Trappist brews.",4.6

The aroma out of the bottle is a sweet vapory essence of chocolate & vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, coffee & cream. Port wine, raisins & plums. Addictive. Ruby brown clear (until last pour) with small lacing off-white head. One of the best mouthfeels of any beer I’ve had. Liquid velvet. Sweet & complex to start. Can taste most of the smells described above. Alcohol, too. Finish stays sweet but some mild hops introduce themselves for delicate bitterness that persists to the aftertaste.

Heavy body, creamy/oily texture, average carbonation, light alcohol -- not hot though.  The bottom line is: Less aroma than I would like, but the flavor is incredible as is the mouthfeel.  I’d happily drink this or it’s little brother.  I don’t know that I can pick a favorite.",4.5
4756,Westvleteren 12,"My loving wife ordered 3 bottles of Westy 12 for my birthday...what a gift it was!!!  This beer had everything.  A dark rich color that couldn’t be seen through, a head that lasted the entire time a drank it....in a St Sixtus trappist! (she bought me the glass too!!).  The flavor was outstanding with a rich chocolate/coffee mix.  The aroma was divine.  The finish was great with my whole body warming from the high alcohol content.
The monks who make this at St. Sixtus have truly master their art.  This beer is hard to come by...my wife ordered it from Belgianshop.com, which makes it even more of a treat.  I’ve read many say that this beer has been over rated.....WTF....if anything it has been under-rated.  If God was a drinking man, I bet he would drink this.  I have two bottles left, one which i am waiting to age for a year, and the other I plan to drink on the day my first child is born...Jan. ’05!!!

Thank you rate beer for changing my palate and educating me on what beer truly is!!",5.0
4757,Westvleteren 12,"The one major drawback to this beer for me was that the alcohol was too noticeable, and could have been better masked.  Aplle was one of the more predominant flavors in the taste.  I do not think this is as good as Roquefort 10, but it is quite good still.",4.0
4758,Westvleteren 12,"I had great expectations for this beer, and when i finally found it in a bar i had a sore throat. Luckily i pursuaded the bartender to let me bring it back home (along with the the 8 and 6). It’s a great trappist, just like most the other trappist - i could go on about the body, finish, aroma etc. but it’s all been said before. It’s way overrated though - great beer, but not my favorite.",4.0
4759,Westvleteren 12,"I finally found the westy 12, after searching for quite a while, where was it? a damn coffee shop! Anyway, quite an amazing brew, although not my all time favorite, still quite enjoyable. Dark red/brown color with a nice ivory head. Malty aroma with some nice spices, a bit of a wine like quality, and some wood smells to it. Taste was rich, complex, and malty with a strong sweetness like caramel. Some mild bitterness toward the end gave it a bit of balance and the overall smoothness of this brew was very impressive.",4.2
4760,Westvleteren 12,"This is not my style of beer and, for some perverse reason,  I wanted to dislike it, to be able to denigrate the icon of the beer world.  Ain’t gonna happen.  This was awesome.  When Andy (Landseer) presented me with the bottle, the absence of a label told me what was in store.  The coveted Westvleteren Abt 12.  It took me months just to learn how to pronounce the damned thing.  And here it was.  The beer that many consider the best on the planet.  And it would mark my 700th rating.  Poured out a hazy burgundy with a foamy, whipped cream-like beige head.  The nose was complex.  There was hints of berries, plums, spice, citrus, oak cask.  What else?  Who knows.  Something different for everyone.  It was smooth and creamy in the mouth.  Full and rich.  The warm feeling of alcohol as it went down.  That esophageal warmth.  Elixir.  The flavor was equally complex.  Vinous.  Spice and fruit and sweetness and candy and bread.  Each sip brought new discoveries.  As the last sip went down, the only thought was, ""Damn, I want more of this.""  And so now the quest to procure more.  For this opportunity, my thanks again to Andy.",4.4
4761,Westvleteren 12,"Very dark and cloudy. Large, thick and light tan colored head. The aromas of peaches and alcohol were the first out of the bottle. Then, I detected notes of bitter-sweet chocolate and raisin bread. When you first take a drink, it is warm, spicy, fruity and sweet all at the same time. The flavors change with each drink as other world class beers that I have tried. Notes of apples and ginger are balanced with bread and a spicy, peppery finish. The alcohol is very well hidden. The aftertaste is also interesting with a little bubblegum and overripe banana. The aftertaste is strangely sour. I think that this detracts a little from an otherwise excellent brew. I would like to try a more aged example. I have had a more aged example and was not as impressed. Fruits and spicing are still detected, but the beer had also lost some body and life. Just the slightest hint of oxidation. I followed this with excellent St. Bernardus 12 this time, the Westy is still the superior beer.",4.2
4762,Westvleteren 12,"Well, now I can say I’ve tried one of the rarest beers to be seen outside of Belgium.  Was it the best I’ve ever tasted?  Not quite.  Very good, certainly.  One of the best quads I’ve had, just not necessarily what I would consider the best beer.",4.3

Pours very nice too, dark brown, muddy, with a medium tan head, whcih do not last so long. So much going on in the flavor, sweetness, dark fruits, chocolate, some bitterness like in an espresso, very complex, a nice alcohol burn in the end. Very subtle beer and very balanced. Like liquid candy!",4.5
4764,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled.  Date on cap 28/10/06.  It’s very hard to rate the number one ranked beer in the World.  Should we expect it to be the best beer we have ever tasted?  Should we be over-critical expecting an experience to beat any other, thus meaning any imperfections will lower our markings?  I have tried to be fair to the beer in my points and my comments, but it is difficult.
The aroma is malty, fruity and cakey.  The appearance is a lovely dark nutty brown with a thick long-lasting tan coloured head and great lacing (Served in an Orval glass).  The taste is yeasty, thick, chewy alcoholic and very warming, and the aftertaste is very long-lasting.  I enjoyed the experience drinking what is obviously an excellent beer but didn’t get any outstanding characteristics which are present in Rochefort 10.  I’m not going to say the beer is overrated as that would be a criticism of my fellow raters, but I think I’m fair in saying that for me the beer was only deserving of just over an overall 4.

When jercraigs invited a few of us over for tasting session, I figured that I would hit #500 that day, so I decided to bring this along to share the love. The question was: would this world-renowned beer reach our expectations? Colour is rich mahogany with a slight cloudiness and a prefect beige head. Aroma is full and appetizing with notes of sugar, raisins, molasses, cinnamon, plum pudding and gingerbread. Warm, full mouthfeel. The flavour is less complex than expected, but still remarkable in it’s balance and uniqueness, holding sweet fruity malts, worldly spices, and some hints of dark rye bread. In the end, it wasn’t the brain-expanding experience that we were half-expecting, but it is still a world class beer, and easily in my personal top ten.",4.7

4769,Westvleteren 12,"2008-03-02. Very dark brown body with a modest foamy tan head, excellent lacing (4+). Sweet flavour, booze soaked dark fruit flavours are similar but more complex than in teh 8, and much more so than I remembered from previously samples of the 12. Sweet malt, muted caramel lingering boozy fruit. Aroma is alcohol, mild notes of the sweet sugary malt to come in the flavour. Smooth medium palate is softer than the others and seems less carbonated (4+). Fabulous, much nicer than my previous examples.

It’s disaster for the locals!!!""
Re-rate April 22, 2005 Ruby brown, small white head. Aroma is noticeably alcoholic, with sweet vaguely sugary malt. Flavour is again quite sweet with malt and a hunt of brown sugar, alcohol lingers pleasantly in the aftertaste. Medium bodied palate. Thanks for sharing R. 7/4/8/4/16 (Interestingly I enjoyed this sample more than the first but rated it slightly lower in terms of the #s.)
Original Rating Aged 2 years+ Hazy brown body with  moderate beige head that diminishes a bit. Sweet malty aroma, with a touch of candi sugar? Sweet alcoholic notes and layers I can’t quite discern. Mouth feel is medium high. Flavour is dominated by sweet maltiness. Some candi sugar. Very mellow, the alcohol content is virtually non-existent.

The beer poured dirty brown with orange highlights and a thick, dissipating to medium, light tan head.  Nice aroma of bread, bread, more bread, prune, raisin, and alcohol, with a very perfumey, candylike feel.  Flavor let me down a bit, perhaps because it was minimally fruity.  Bread was predominant, with toasty and phenolic character, some prune (but not too much), and spice.  The alcohol burn was a bit too strong in the older bottle, while it was balanced better in the younger bottle.  Still, the alcohol did detract from the experience on the whole.  It’s solid, but I prefer its sibling, Westy 8.",4.1
4773,Westvleteren 12,"The true King of beers. Numero uno.  Very complex with caramel apples, toffee, coffee (latte), prunes, raisins, grape juice, chestnut, black walnut and a rich Chi tea flavor. All well balanced, but all in all reality a bit over the top. The carbonation is great. Sweetness present but not chewy. Brown cloudy appearance.  Overall, a dark mysterious beer with genuine flavor and outstanding complexity. Over-hyped? I don’t think so. Held to extreme expectation? Yes.",4.2
4774,Westvleteren 12,"I think I went into this one with overly high expectations. It is an amazing beer, but to be honest I was so hipped up I was expecting some kind of religious experience.

4775,Westvleteren 12,"OK. Now at least I can die a happy man.  I bought this beer over six months ago and have been waiting for a suitable occasion to sample same.  The resulting experience was worth the wait.  this beer poors a deep mahogany color toped by a nice and large light brown head.  The complexity of the beer first makes it presence known in the aroma with a malty and fruity nose present.  the tasting experience reveals a  cornucopia of flavors.  So many wonderful flavors are present that it is hard to single out any specific flavor for evaluation.  What a complex and wonderful beer.  I did get significant flavors of dried fruit (raisin, dates, plums etc) with some yeast (dough) present as well.  Nicely balanced as the moderately sweet initial taste is offset somewhat by an appropriate amount of hops.  Alcohol is definately present and adds a nice warming effect.  Its presense however is inofensive.

This simple little dark brown bottle, naked as a jay bird with no lable poured a very attractive clear mahogony brew (be careful however because if you get the yeast in the bottom it’ll change the opacity).  It had a light brown frothy head, like the foam on a good capaccino.  The smell blossoms as it warms like a bouquet of flowers opening in the morning sun (I know, cheesy metaphor, but this beer is the stuff poetry is made of).  The aroma had hints of caramel, roasted malt, perfume and herbs in the hops, a dough like yeast, and the darker fruits of plum, prunes and raisins.  Every taste bud was pleasurably engaged by the complex array of flavors.  A sweet caramel, roasted soy sauce, resin hops, richness of the darker fruits in the aroma, doughy yeast in every sip.  The Greeks would use this beer as the perfect example of the ""golden mean""  for it is very well balanced so no one flavor or smell was overwhelming.  There was a warming (yet not offensive) presence of alcohol in the smell, taste and palate.  This palate was just awsome.  It was like satin sheets on a warm day...smooth, luxurious, yet effervescent.  This beer could never become boring...it is definitely a slow sipping companion for any indulgent night.",4.8

Flavor is all of the above with the dark fruit notes of cherry, fig, raisin, and plum dominating.  Light chocolate and butter crunch  flavors bounce in and out of the dark fruit bowl with grace.

The aroma is an amazing combination of heavy and dark fruits and chocolately goodness.  It’s also noticeably sharp and a bit acidic on the nose.  Finally, I am able to taste this gem that I’ve heard so much about.  What a wonderful sensation.  Such a smooth beer,  and there is a wonderful nuttiness to this beer coupled with some nicely roasted malt flavors.  All of this mixes with the strong fruit and chocolate mentioned with the aroma.  The beer finishes great as well.  The nutty taste is the last to leave the palate proceeded by an alcohol presence and the previous flavors mentioned.  I have to thank my buddy Mike who called me from World of Beer in Tampa and said ""Hey, I’m at this huge beer store, do you want me to see if they have anything for you?""

I asked for more lemonade-flavored punch.  Oh, for those innocent days, when the existence of such a beer as this did not influence my whole drinking outlook.  Now, knowing what I know, having tasted what I’ve tasted, never again will I have an Abbot Quadrupel, or any creamy dark beer for that matter, without subconsciously comparing it to ""Westy"" Westvleteren 12, and being slightly disappointed.  One gains, one loses, however; and having lost that beer drinking innocence, I have gained the appreciation of this fine specimen.  Malty and faintly acidic in the nose, it had a foamy, creamy and huge lightest-of-browns head with beautiful lacing and an amber red color in the bulb of the glass.  The taste was malty, chocolate milk at first, completely filling my mouth with flavor; the hops in the finish start very faint and somehow grow in intensity like the sun emerging over the horizon to attain a smooth, smoky quality, which fades into the twilight of a fond memory.  It’s almost dry at the very end, and some of the citrus I smelled comes forward.  There is noticable alcohol, but it’s a big beer, so that’s understandable.

I had an extra bottle that a buddy in Belgium sent me and it’s in the mail on the way to your house!” 

Dudes!!! Is that not the coolest gesture of any RateBeerian? So, CHEERS to my buddy Snoot, You Rock!  

Rating #500

 Pours with the darkest of crimson. The head is a substantially thick; a fluffy kaki cap with lacing that is plentiful, yet fine enough to adorn  Princesses wedding gown. 

 The aroma is far more fruity and less chocolaty than the Rochefort 10. Dark notes of plums, raisins, figs, prunes, apricots, sweet red apples, a note of banana. Wow, what a robust fruity complexity! 

The coco must have been hiding in the flavor, because that’s where I found it! I totally pull out monstrous notes of Figs, Dates, and Prunes, a touch of that tart-ness that is mostly found in the prunes. There is a great depth of sinister malty complexity here. Toffee’s, caramels, and baker’s chocolates to eternity! There is a great nutty complexity.. wooded cinders, a hint of smoke, and earthy notes of peat! The yeast brings a depth of pumpernickel….. this is very Remarkable! 


 The palate is lush and velvety… near perfection I suppose.. I’ll probably never actually know perfection; even if it were in front of my face. There is some spice in the finish, black peppercorn, with  undertones of clove… Damn… Westy 12 is very much praiseworthy of its high marks!",4.5

4790,Westvleteren 12,"330ml bottle, obviously; poured in Westy glass.  Sadly, this bottle was a gusher, but only a few ml of beer were lost.  Intended to be the highlight of my recent trip to San Francisco, this beer absolutely lived up to every expectation.  After the first whiff and sip, I made the decision to put down my pen after jotting a quick: ""This is what beer is supposed to be.""  The supreme highlight of my first and only night at the Toronado, a night that included more than my fair share of interesting to amazing beers from California and Europe.
If Westy 12 does not actually deserve this, my first perfect score, any imperfections in the beer were compensated for by the bliss of the day.

4791,Westvleteren 12,"Proof of the existence of God.  The yard stick by which all other Belgian Trappist beers (indeed, beers in general) should be measured. Head: the ultimate rocky Belgian foam.  I would not be surprised if they pack the pillows of the monks at the abbey with this heavenly mousse.  Thick, long lasting, creamy, dense.  Aroma: mysterious, deepening with increasing temperature.  Chocolate, layers of malt, Viennese coffee, caramel, notes of port.  Flavor: the Everest of complexity.  Sweet treacle and toffee but not cloying, because a well balanced bitterness, alcohol and spice mixture immediately tempers the first impression.  Roasted malt, chocolate chip cookies, caramel sundae topping, hot buttered rum.  Let it warm up a bit and discover why people become monks at the abbey breweries.

After my fourth tasting in a year, I must downgrade this legendary beer. The consistency just isn’t there.  Every time the rich cholocate is there.  Otherwise, the aroma goes from cobwebs to fresh brewed coffee depending on the bottle.
Surely handling has something to do with this inconsistency.  This inconsistency could be attributed to the volume of its complexity, with a new element shining through each time...I just don’t really believe that.  Still a great beer...just not the best.

To celebrate my 33rd bithday, what else could I request...A 33cl bottle of Westy for my 133rd rating, of course!  Best By 25-Nov-05 (18 months old).  I’d like to give all the alluring details, but this one was a *slight* dissapointment.  The aroma and appearance are second to none.  The flavor is not.  While all the complexities are present, roasted chocolate dominates, making this less than ideal for me.  The mouthfeel included noticable alcohol burn, without being creamy.  All of this seems to paint a grim picture, but really these are just gripes that make me belive this beer is a *tad* underwhelming compared to its reputation (and price).",4.2
4797,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle: Poured a deep ruby colored beer with a huge thick foamy dark white head with incredible retention (the head was still in place when drinking the last sip of this beer 30 minutes after the bottle had been opened). Carbonation is really good with lots of bubble at the bottom of the glass and some other ones sticking on the side of the glass. Aroma is comprised of light and sweet roastiness with a nice touch of spice but I could not detect any alcohol. Taste is an almost perfect mix between caramel malts, candi sugar and something else, which might be cinnamon. I was really glad that I could not taste the alcohol since it could have been quite harsh at 10.2%. Wow, what a beer. I originally thought that this might be a bit of an over hyped beer but I’m glad to report that it lives up to all the praises.",4.8
4798,Westvleteren 12,"This was a total surprise rating.  I helped my professor bottle a batch of his homebrew and afterwards as were standing around talking he opens this and pours it round.  Zowie!  I actually have a bit of allergies left, so my nose is not as good as it should be.  Nevertheless, it smells like honeyed sweet-dough biscuits and cream, like raisins and apples and passion fruits, grapes and apricots.  Also alcohol.  The fruity smells were most apparent, I was hard pressed to get any non-ester malt smells.  Looks supremely confident of itself in its shimmering dark brown translucency.  Taste is like a sticky bun full of cinnamon, rum, apricots, dates.  Sweet muffin dough malts and just a little bit of yeastiness.  Finish is chewy and long.  This is way more complex than I was up for tonight, but I DO intend to try it again (har, har) and will probably adjust my description.  Only detriment was an apparent alcohol taste, but at least it wasn’t harsh...it was warm and soothing, but it still tasted like ethanol.",4.3
4799,Westvleteren 12,"This is a great beer, but I have to believe it is somewhat overrated.  Actually, the more I have of this, the better it gets.  Not bad, but I?ve had better that are ranked lower.",4.3
4800,Westvleteren 12,"Rerate 1/12/2007.  More complex than I remember it.  This bottle had an ""05"" on the cap; I’m not sure if that is the ""best by"" date or not but if this was old, it has aged very well.  The alcohol is completely hidden.  The aroma is full with plums, oranges, sweet white wine.  Flavor is outstanding as well.  Lots of sweet malt, and more fruit.  There is a vinous quality, some yeast, wheat, fermenting fruits, apple.  Cloudy brown appearance, not much of a head and low carbonation.    When the bottle is held up to the light, I can see the sediment.  When in the glass it is too dark and murky to see any sediment.  Thick and heavy palate.  I had this bottle so long I almost didn’t want to drink it, but I’m happy a few other people had the opportunity to try it. ------------------This beer is too complex to do the rating justice from my first bottle.
Aromas of malt, coffee, tea, and flowers.  Dark brown, a huge white head, and brown sediment.  Flavors of coffee, malt, and an herbal taste.  Full bodied, but less so than I expected.  Very smooth and easy to drink; the high abv is not noticeable in the taste.   
A very fine beer.",5.0
4801,Westvleteren 12,"From my tasting notes (tasted on 1/14/04); How lucky was I to find a case of this in PA. Expensive ($160/case but well worth it). I bought the case 2 years ago and these tasting notes were on my last one. Poured a beautiful dark mahagony with a small tan head. Initial aromas of maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses and fruits.Soft tastes (sugar, fruits, molasses, prunes, dates, so many tastes coming thru). Alcohol content well hidden. I can’t say/put into words the depth and greatness of this beer.",4.8
4802,Westvleteren 12,"Now is the time. This is number 666, and what better beer than this to be rated on the devil’s number? I have had Duvel, as well as Lucifer. Old Nick doesn’t make much of an appearance in these parts and so I am left to deal with this one. Why? Read most of the reviews and you will see that this is described as heavenly, as angels crying on the tongue, as a beer made in heaven, as a religious experience made holy by the dedicated men of the cloth who produce this unctuous brew. So I pour this into two small Chimay glasses, as this should rarely be a beer that is savoured on one’s own. In fact my colleague in taste was one who is unique amongst the Ratebeer community. My 18 year old son, of legal age in these latitudes was the willing fellow supplicant in the search for the beer nirvana. Aware of the beer’s standing he treated it with reverence in a way that belies his youthful years. And so it came to pass. Said I, let us exorcise the demons so often worshipped when the meter ticks over to beer 666. Two pours were taken, the first without the sediment so that the rich and bright body of the beer could be noted. A deep and lustrous copper hue with creamy head presented itself. And then it was left to settle. For a respectful period of time. From the nose came a potpourri of flavours, plums, grapes and subtle hop aromas. The initial flavour to greet the tastembuds was the intense frutiness from the nose combined with an equally intense breadiness and clear alcoholic mouthfeel. To state it is warming is an understatment but to also state it is the most amazing beer ever is, regrettably, an overstatement. Hell, it’s great alright, but it just doesn’t put my head into a 360 degree spin either. The devil is cast out, but there could be a chance of his return. Thanks to you Brother Spiesy for delivering this for my holy consumption.",4.5
4803,Westvleteren 12,"Appearance: deep, dark burgundy brown, rich as a raisin, with a fine reddish hue ’round the edges. Head is towering, huge, off-whitish color, and slow to sizzle down to size.
Aroma:....requires a new vocabulary! Deep, and heady, rich, full of fruit, grapes, raisins, plums, and spices, a very complex blend, soft, but sensual, deliriously so, and delicious, and the more I breathe it in, the more the flavors become pronounced, more is revealed here, pepper, anise, rich mollasses, rum, sweetness compounded by rich dark flavors...
Now to drink...I...um...serious contemplation is required, for I am seriously, honestly, taken aback by the force of, not only the alcoholic content, but the strong, full, bewitching flavor of this incredible ale! It staggers the senses! Honestly, I reel from it’s effects and must wait until my consciousness can comprehend what is going on...many layers, many flavors, many ways that this incredible concoction can impact upon the senses. 
I feel thoroughly slayed, laid waste, but utterly uplifted in my oblivion! Let the sword fall upon me more often, if the taste is as sweet!
Have I said heavenly already? No matter if I did, it’s a truly transmogrific feeling, it is, and I could be in another galaxy, for all I care...fly me not to the moon, nor Jupiter, or the outer stars, but, merely wherever this impossibly exhilirating nectar may blossom...
Now that I have finally downed a simple sample of this much renowned ale, I can only say...""more, please!""",4.9
4804,Westvleteren 12,"Smell was nutty, almost reminded me of a brown ale.  The pour was a cloudy reddish brown with decent head.  Taste was addictive and best decribed as a sweet hoppish taste.  drank the glass way to quick and wish I had another to taste.",4.2
4805,Westvleteren 12,"Looks great after pouring into the proper glass.  Taste was good, but for much cheaper I can get other great Belgian beers.  I know its good, but I have to pay $13 a bottle for this stuff around here.",4.3
4806,Westvleteren 12,"I was a skeptic after the abt 8, but now I'm reformed.  rich bready pale tan head, some larger bubbles pushing through the surface.  firm lacing all along the rim of my westy glass.  very cloudy brown/yellow/gold color with thick yeast particles.  fizzy mouthfeel, light strike of unique yeast, not so sweet.  head has great staying power with peaks remaining.  warming. . light vinuous and raisin nose.  next, raisin bread nose!!  warmer, dried apples nose and flavor.  more sweetness arrives, but still extremely well balanced with mild malt and hop.  alcohol plays off every flavor at the wide range of temperatures.  lacing forms every time I grab the glass.  now it's empty.  Noooooo!!!",4.7
4807,Westvleteren 12,"Poured a murky dark brown color.  Very thick looking brew with a thick tan head.  Sweet fruit aroma, raisins, berries, apples.  Same fruit taste present in the taste with a slightly nutty flavor.  Slight alcohol burn.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  A most excellent experience",4.7
4808,Westvleteren 12,"Where to begin? Where to begin? When the ""what makes you nervous on a label?"" post came up I put this one down. Guessing that many if not most figured I was just being silly. No, I was actually intimidated. Not that I don't feel I know my beers, but when you stray from the overall opinion, not to mention the highly touted raters, you risk being ostracized. Been there, done that. At least I can say with conviction that I did indeed enjoy this. Rather incredible in so many aspects as has been noted in page after page of notes. But be it the lack of refinement of my pallet or ever continuing sinus problems, I did not get the awe inspiring complexity. What I did get is what had eluded me in other references, that being what ""tobacco"" means in flavor. I damn near felt that a Cohiba or even better Cuban cigar had been sent my way in liquid form. Throughout it became almost TOO much. At least it is extremely pleasant as there were the other flavors and sweetness of malt, etc. And I was sad as he glass neared being empty. Always a sign of a great beer when I stare at bottle and glass with sad puppy eyes whining so that some will reappear as I invert the bottle to let minuscule drops come ever slower so that I can pretend to be savoring the experience just a tad longer. And to make it all the more a holy experience, the bottle was sent as a gift from krisbierjaeger. THANK YOU, my friend. I will cherish the memory as I attempt to come into possession of another so as to see what will happen if I can manage to wait long enough to let it AGE.",4.3
4809,Westvleteren 12,"One of my favourite beers of all time, best served cool, and clear.
The beer is a dark auburn ale, with a good white head, a complex aroma from the head. The flavours start off powerfully malty balanced by Belgian hops(old, for preservative value) filling the palate with an explosion of flavour being followed by the lucious winey 'old beer' flavours lingering at the end. Don't drink too quickly or it'll pole-axe you with the first bottle.",4.6
4810,Westvleteren 12,Bottled. Fantastic beer. Nice smooth sweet malt flavor and smell all the way through. Alcohol was hidden very well.,4.3
4811,Westvleteren 12,"Interesting stuff. Had this at Delilahs in Chicago Illinois. (interesting experience, read my review of the place in the places section) The beer poured a nice dark amber colour that did not seem to let too much light through. The head was thin and a tan colour. Left a good lacing on the glass that was slightly slimey and stuff. The nose is sweet yeasty and malty, slight hints of fruit, maybe some cherry but I couldnt exactally pull it out. The taste was initially sweet and warm, followed my yeast slightly and some cream. Very smooth and sexy taste. Brown suggar definately present in the aftertaste. Overall, this was a great beer that really shows how a good trappist can be.",4.2
4812,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a deep deep brown with a small off-white/beige head.  The aroma is of brown sugar and dough, but not overly yeasty.  The flavor is of the same: Brown sugar and bread and almost winey, but with a cookie overtone.  It is pretty smooth on the palate.  Not as much of a bite as a few other Quadruples have.  Too bad I only have 1 bottle.  I guess I'll need to trade to get some more.",4.3
4813,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled @ Helsinki Beer Festival 2004
Dark brown, medium head with some lace. Caramel-like sweetness, notes of wine in aroma. Full and smooth body. Flavor is sweet, caramel-like, spicy, wine-like and has notes of alcohol. Excelent brew, although not as good as 8.",4.5
4814,Westvleteren 12,"It’s a close call what my favourite beer is, but this beauty comes very close and may indeed be it dependant on my mood.  One recommendation, make sure you add some of the yeast, it gives the flavour an added dimension.  A deep chestnut brown brew with a very enticing aroma of liquorice, hops, rich maltiness and a very complex fruitiness that’s hard to describe (for me!).  The flavour, for me at least, is the perfect mix of strength, poise, and elegance.  Full and malty yet not cloying.  Hoppy and bitter yet not astringent.  Fruity and complex yet not overpowering.  I could go on.  The alcohol is just about noticeable, but it hides it well like most Belgian beers, and the strong bitterness in the long finish balances the malty palate perfectly.  A beer for the desert island and for life.  So, religion does have it’s uses!  (bottle at Botteltje, Oostende)",4.6
4815,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled (Helsinki Beer Festival 2004)

Dark brown. Murky hazy color, like ""home beer"". Very small brown head. Aroma is smooth and pleasant: prunes and yeast. Taste is very complex: prunes, raisins and yeast. Aftertaste has bitterness and alcoholic flavor. Warming, great beer and goes to my ranking #1 (9/4/8/5/18 4.4).

Re-rated, bottled 

Dark ruby red, almost opaque. Huge steady tanned head, lace. This bottled had quite light aroma of yeast, plum and licorice. Palate is outstanding: balanced marriage of malts and hops. Wineous with fruits and licorice in the medium to full body. Bitter long aftertaste of hops, alcohol and licorice. I really would like to try a matured one! (7/5/10/5/19 4.6)",4.6
4816,Westvleteren 12,"Nice, dark orange to brown pour with an everlasting mocha colored head, thick lacing, specks of sediment floating about. Aroma is sometime sweet with cherries, toffee and maple syrup but the next whiff brings an essence of olive oil. Flavor has elements of toffee, maple syrup, raisins and a wee bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is luxuriant, just feels right - stays strong to the finish. All around a most enjoyable little ale. Wonder if anyone has heard of this one yet?  Thanks out to Aurelius for bringing this one back from Miami.",4.2
4817,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to Joey Capps for hooking me up with this baby! Pours a dark body. Very cloudy, and murky.  Aroma is malty, and sugary. Taste is woody and also malty. I really like this beer. There also are som floaters in this brew, which are not noticable when drinking it. Amazing beer! This would be really nice sitting by the fireplace after shoveling the driveway in a snowstorm.",4.6
4818,Westvleteren 12,"bark brown, murky and opaque with a few small floaters. aroma is very pungent, leathery malts and burnt sugar. Wood and vanilla, no hop aroma. Taste is very powerful alcohol, figs and toffee. bitterness tempered with some ftuity sweetness. Prefered the 8 but an awesome beer non the less.",3.9
4819,Westvleteren 12,"The Westy 12 pours a tawny brown and has some dirty brown sediment drippings towards the end of the pour. Settles super opaque as a rosey dark brown color with a finger high crown of dark ivory creamyness, fading evenly and slow to a hazey broken skim and a firm collar hugs the edge of the glass a good portion through the session. Lace quickly slips back in with minimal spots sticking.

Aroma is soft and yeilding, complexing and layered; at it sits a welcoming orangey fruit yeast tone releases over some really nice cookie sugars and waffer light chocolate. Deeper wiffs bring out some darker fruits within of raisin and fig with and soft dry woodish earthyness. Slight phenolic notes emerge here and there as it warms giving it a bit of spice and burn. There's more here then I can really put my nose too. Cocoa filled fruits and light spices is what I can figure. It's very appealing however way you smell it.

Taste has a refined roundness with an encompassing natural tasting softness of fruits, earth, yeast, spice, cocoa, and some slight roastyness. Its quite soft for what seems to be such a big beer. The flavors carry alot of the effects over from the aroma, lending a bit more dark fruits then the smell would lead you to believe is there and they're there in good stature. There's some artfully placed sweet malts throughout that bring out the darker fruits and sweetness bringing in raisin, fig, apple, and touches of banana, oh but there's a bit more that continues to ensue. There's delicately hidden melding of chocolate cookie sugars, bits of yeasty spices, and mild caramel. There's a milding woody earthyness that keeps a small drying presense throughout as well. Again, there's more here then a can put my mouth too and intermingles with the body and feel of the beer. Quite complex and full of softly spoken actions. Very enthusiatic and engrossing to say the least.

Feel is beyond words here. Wow! Amazingly full, yet calmingly smooth and fluffy with a heavenly fine carbonation that continues to give way to the flavors, never too sharp and never too distant. Well rounded, superbly soft, and exceptionally drinkable. Its nearly a meal! It doesn't seem to have 10.8% ABV, its masked very well. One isn't enough, not nearly enough. It's Loftly, noble, sublime, and wonderfully put together.",4.6
4820,Westvleteren 12,"First Rating (March 2004). Limited rating of this so far; I didn’t take notes at the time, but I have several more bottles of it left. Alcohol wasn’t overbearing, my mouth warmed up to it straight away. Malty with a raisin or grape quality. Sweet, yeasty finish. Brilliant. A better review will follow. Absolute brilliant and gets a perfect five from me. [5.0/5.0]

Rerate, August 2004. Wonderful dark sweet and malty beer with lots of fruit and high complexity 5/5

Rerate, September 2004. At the brewery cafe alongside the 8 cap. They may serve it too cold, but it quickly warms up. Sitting here in the warm sun and in the middle of the Belgian countryside, can beer get any better than this? A perfect combination of a 5/5 beer and a 5/5 location

Rerate mid September 2004. These bottles I have were only bottled a couple of weeks ago - and are so wonderful when this fresh, certainly better IMO than any older example I have had.

Rerate, January 2005. Still wonderfully sweet and malty - but these bottles are almost 6 months old now and were better fresh.",5.0

A really complex beer that wants you to ask for more.",4.6

Aroma is very strong. I smell sweet malt, brown sugar, raisins, alcohol, dried cherries.

Flavor is rich and full. Heavy with dried fruits all over it with dark cherries coming through. The alcohol makes a cameo appearance but nothing more. The finish is dominated by the flavors of the fresh juice of a blueberry, as if I just took and squeezed a blueberry between by tongue and teeth, accompanied with the bitterness of the berry skin.

Mouthfeel is robust and full.

Drinkability is hampered by two things: the sheer magnitude of this brew, and the $$$$ that accompanies the beer.",4.6
4824,Westvleteren 12,"I managed to get a bottle of this at the Sharp Edge in Pittsburgh back in 2004. I remember not being incredibly impressed but never had a chance to revisit until now in 2013 with a fresh bottle. I remain unimpressed +++ Sampled from an 11.2 oz brown bottle this beer pours a very dark brown color with a huge foamy orange-tan head that slowly dissipates and left good lacing. The aroma was a bit soapy, yeasty and bready with hints of honey, caramel, dark fruits and a bit of a boozy presence.The flavor is tangy, woody and a bit boozy with notes of honey, caramel, fig, cherry and bread. Long finish of caramel, fig and bread. . A solid beer to be sure but really does not live up to the hype. There are many many Belgians that I prefer to this one.",3.8

Beautiful brown black color with a lasting creamy head.  Smelled wonderful and tasted even better.  soft as a kiss with a bit of spice towards the end.  good carbonation throughout and gets better than sex as it warms (almost).  so creamy and smooth and sweet with a slight hop kick due to lack of aging perhaps.  a must try before you die.  enough said, i think i'll have another, does anyone have 10 bucks?  oh , the 10.2 % alcohol is by far the best masked ever!!",4.8
4827,Westvleteren 12,"3/6/04.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, obtained in trade with Evan Ochsner, 2/19/04.  Bottle expiration 11/06/06.  Pours a deep, dark, rich amber brown-- some red edges and even a hint of deep purple.  Great, dark cream head that lingers in a thin, dense-but-rocky whisp very long; very, very good lacing.  Looks stately and just excellent, but I expected a little darker brown, murkier body.  This one looks a little young.  Nose is rich and decadent-- cake, raisins, a hint of peppery heat, and a touch of vinous sourness and sharp vanilla pungency.  Subtle chocolate notes, but I think this is still too young for that malt depth to be fully charged.  First sip reveals what it's all about-- very full-bodied with dense, creamy texture.  Peppery yeastiness and alcohol heat cannot be ignored, but it's balanced against a backdrop of swirling dark dried fruit and cake flavors.  Feels absolutely divine in the mouth.  I do feel that the flavors haven't really come into their own yet, as everything is a little too sharp.  Finish is very elegant, even despite the apparent harshness of the beer in its relative youth, but is a little too peppery for me-- seems like the yeast.  Also a touch of burnt malt flavors way in the back of the finish.  Immediately warming in the throat and a little bit prickly.  Tremendously long-lasting finish with bits of brown sugar and cake lending some of the big impressions.   Mouth-watering and complex, it reveals new layers and just tickles, teases, and toys with your senses-- once you think you have it pegged, you find something new inside.  Truly very good, very unique stuff, but I feel that the bottle I had needs to sit awhile to grow into a top 5 beer.  The appearance and mouthfeel are already there, but sadly, it needs to round out its maltiness quite a bit.  Still, a damn treat whenever I can get it.",4.5

4829,Westvleteren 12,"Disclaimer, it is the first time I have this beer along with 6 other comparables, 5 of which are classified as ABTs and there's only one among the 6 that I've had before. Only one was not taken blind (ommegang three philosophers). So basically, I've taken the 5 following beers blind in the same session: rochefort 10 (only one I had before), westvleteren 12, st-bernardus 12, weyerbacher quad, gulden draak. All 5 were taken in a Chimay chalice  A deep chocolate body with a fully diminishing off-white head, initially well-laced. Bottle-conditionned, with some beige sediments at the bottom. Aroma is a nice blend of vanilla and chocolate (black, brown and white), milkshakish, slightly vinous. It didn't grab me particularly, but seriously, let this warm and this becomes a tremendously complex malt offering. Full-bodied, creamy with a good carbonation. Taste is loaded with dark fruits: blackberries, plums, dates. It's a complex caramel cream with a chocolate syrup, no it's a cake, it's a pudding with a little alcohol bite. Very complex with a well-expressed yeastiness. Definitely the most complex of the ABTs. It's delicious for sure, but doesn't strike to me as the best beer in the world. It's the best balanced of the big dark ABT trappist styles to my liking, but it's not necessarily the most intense, although such a refined aftertaste is hard to match. Maybe I will rate it higher in a future tasting. It sure held the competition in a blind tasting, so I know this is pure world-class stuff, I'll have to get into deeper analysis eventually and will definitely enjoy doing so. By the way, this was a nice fit with the great quebeccer cheese Victor et Berthold, recommended by Simon_Patrice and provided by MartinT.

So then the description - nothing new obviously. Beautiful rich brown beer with a complex melange of malt, bread, plums, brown sugar, raisin, etc etc etc. Smooth as sin with equally complex flavours - especially as it warms a little. Very dry finish with no alcohol anywhere except in the awesomely warming sensation it gives you.

Flavor is incredibly smooth, with little carbonation.  The initial taste is peppery, then a sweetness comes on which finishes in a warm dryness in the back of the mouth.  There is a distinct bread/yeast character.  Wow, I just keep noticing more as I drink.  After it's done, a hoppy bite develops.  This is a very subtle and enjoyable beer.",4.3

4844,Westvleteren 12,"Lives up to expectations.  Good appearance, and incredibly complex aroma and flavor.  I prefer the 8 though, as the complexity is slightly masked by the high abv.",3.2
4845,Westvleteren 12,"Have you ever heard a pianist play a wonderful piece of music and they play it technically perfect but it just seems to lack emotion or soul?  For me, that sums up this beer nicely.  There's no question it's well made and really very good, so my comments are primarily directed toward this beer being ""the best.""  It's very nice, but lacks some special quality to make it ""the best"" to me.  Anyway, a nice dark burgundy color with lots of visible sediment and a somewhat thin light tan head start this highly anticipated brew.  The nose is light with lots of rich fruits.  I could swear there's a hint of chocolate raspberry truffles, as well as other fruits.  The flavor of this beer is also quite nice!  More dark fruits abound and a nicely balanced hop bitterness that begins subtly and ends magnificently as the beer fades into a vineous alcohol warmth.  I can certainly see why so many believe this to be the best beer in the world, and it certainly ranks among my favorites, ESPECIALLY among Belgians, but it still seems there's something missing to match all the hype.",4.3
4846,Westvleteren 12,"Very very smooth.  Best before 2006. Alcohol is almost not noticeable.  You could be hammered before you knew it. Looking forward to next trying an aged version. Cinnamon and light pepper quality.  If this is the model Unibroue et al use they need to keep working to catch up.  Aroma was the lowest quality of the beer. Aroma moderated after a few minutes.   Dark colour, even a little head.",4.3
4847,Westvleteren 12,"The color is a gloomy golden brown with barely any head to it.  The armoa is overpoweringly sweet, with hints of maple and alcohol.  This hits your tongue like air.  There's very little flavor at first, then it settles in with a malty alcohol flavor with hints of citrus that spreads across your tongue like honey oozing across a spoon.  Precious.",4.8
4848,Westvleteren 12,"what can I say about this beer that hasn't been said before?  plenty:



my first beer of the evening, alone at home.  I'd been looking forward to this for weeks.  I'd been saving it for quite some time and I was finally going to have my bottle of westy 12.  I opened the bottle and poured the beer into a glass.  the lights dimmed, ""that's funny..."" I thought and went up to check the light switch - nothing wrong.  I heard a voice from behind me, it said ""we've been expecting you jesse, you're late.""  I turned around and floating above the glass was a loaf of dark bread, a box of raisins, a bar of bakers chocolate, toffee, plums and apples dancing around a tree.  ""what the hell?!?""  I said.  then the loaf of bread punched me in the face and knocked me out.



when I came to I was in my chair, but not at home.  I looked around me and saw I was flying through a hazy brown  tunnel.  ""what's going on?"" I said to myself.  a voice that sounded powerful, yet soft said ""...we are westy...we mean you no harm...we only wish to show you something...""  we started moving faster and I shut my eyes, we seemed to go on forever, then suddenly we stopped and I heard loud music.  I opened my eyes and saw myself, sitting with a friend in a bar.  I was younger(and thinner).  I wondered where I was.  I looked around and realized I had gone back in time.  it was 1997 and I was in montreal for the jazz festival.  we were at the peel pub, I remember they had $5 pitchers between 3-7pm and my friend and I were starting a bit of a piss up before the night began.  ""what on earth am I being shown here?""  I thought to myself, then I heard my friend say ""my uncle said we should try this beer...""  I looked at what we ordered and it was blanche de chambly.  I heard my self say ""wow.  beer can actually taste good.""  I smiled as the words echoed in my mind.  I stood there looking at myself having a revelation.  everything faded to hazy brown one more time.



I woke up in my chair in my living room with an empty chalice in my hand and a warm feeling in my stomach.  this beer reminded me of why I fell in love with belgian beer, my first love.  totally worth all the hype and compliments it gets.  thanks westy.",5.0
4849,Westvleteren 12,"Complex beer. I was hoping this would blow me away but it didn't. Still a good brew though. I was impressed by the complexity of the aroma and flavor. Creamy, spicy, and fruity in both the aroma and the flavor. Medium bodied and finished off well. Not the best in my opinion, but still really good.",4.2
4850,Westvleteren 12,"A gorgeous beer with extraordinary complexity and extraordinary smoothness. Adjectives only eviscerate this beer. This is the real deal. Somewhat variable, but when it’s on, it’s really on and includes gorgeous soft and supple balsamic vinegar notes plus deeply rendered malt, and a very pleasant yeast profile.",4.7
4851,Westvleteren 12,"First of all, props to Slikwily for the 1999 bottle of this beer for the Secret Santa.  I was surprised that is had a very small light beigish head, but I'm guessing it was knocked down by the alcohol;  the body is a nice even coppery brown color.  Wow!  What a plethora of aromas to be taken in all at once. ""Do you know what a plethora is?""  Malty, bready, yeasty, apple juice, raisins, a light malt whiskey, hints of buttery oak and caramel.  Plums and raisiny malt flavor start things off, then caramel and dates!  It's very well balanced with a malty finish;  the aftertaste is malty smooth with a light roastiness.  A little woody flavor and light hop flavor makes their way into the finish as well, as well as a hint of vanilla.  I'm still waiting for the alcohol to show up!  Very smooth mouthfeel, so smooth it's only lightly warming and has a full body with low carbonation.  Also probably another reason for no head.  Merry Christmas to me!!!!!  Again, thank you Slikwily for this phenomenal beer!  I think someone forgot to tell those monks to put alcohol in this because it is barely noticeable making this a very dangerously drinkable beer.  In the immortal words of Ferris Beuhler, ""if you have the means, I highly recommend it, it is so choice!""",5.0
4852,Westvleteren 12,"paid 12$ for a 10oz bottle, though at the cafe de vrede across from the abbey the were charging 1.25$!  wonderful sweet, rich taste with big sediment pieces.  not much hop taste...a great beer, but i'm still amazed that everyone likes it THIS much.",4.1
4853,Westvleteren 12,"Pours with a large tan head that quickly fades to a thin layer that remains for the rest of the beer. Aroma is very raisiny with some other dark fruit, a slight mild chocolate, and a noticable but not overpowering alcoholic vapor. Flavor is raisiny with a slight chocolate and a slight coffee and a mild alcoholic warmth. Body is medium to full and the palate is very creamy. It is a very drinkable beer.",4.2
4854,Westvleteren 12,"Oh, it was good.   Not the best I've had though.  Taste is a sweet assault of raisin/date/fig and other stuff, very complex.  Aftertaste is, oddly enough, kind of bitter.    It doesn't hide its alcohol well, especially as it warms - probably the biggest flaw.  I'd have it again if it were not $11 a bottle.",3.9
4855,Westvleteren 12,"No doubt, this beer is amazing, but the more good beers I try I discover that, to me, it is not the best beer of the world.
Pours a dark brown body with a fine reddish glow and a foamy tan head! The aroma is very full and complex. I smell a basket full of fruit, plums, raisins, toffee, yoghurt etc. Flavor is just as full-bodied and complex. Sweet fruity with millions of things I can even describe here! Soft, smooth, full, heavy and complex...excellent!!",4.6
4856,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle dated 01-14-06 Poured a cloudy murky brown with small beige head and light lacing. Aroma is decadent. Malty caramel, spicy and big notes of sweet cherries. Body is full, smooth and delicate on the tongue. Possibly the most smooth ale I've experienced. The flavor of this beer is also one to savor and combined with the aroma is one that's hard to beat. That's one thing about this ale I found most impressive. The in your face aroma with the flavor is an onslought of your senses. The malty caramel and fruit flavor leads to a gentle warming sensation towards the middle of the glass. I'm glad I finally had a chance to sample this wonder, but at a price of $13 a bottle it's one I won't enjoy often. The only downfall of this brew.",4.4
4857,Westvleteren 12,"Ok, my favorite beer types are strong ales and stouts, but I can see this beer as deserving of the 100 percentile position at ratebeer.  Sweet, luscious, rich, aromatic, complex.  This will not dissapoint.",4.4
4858,Westvleteren 12,"After telling a dangerous vixen about the top rated beer in the world, she batted her eyes and whispered sweet promises if I opened a bottle for her to try.  At first, she wasn't too impressed as the lager was too cold for the complex flavors to blossom.  I stole the glass from her unsuspecting hands and told her to wait - all her desires would be fulfilled in time.  Minutes passed, the sweet expectations driven by the site of the beads of sweat slowly dripping down the glass.  The lager warmed and she took another sip.  Her eyes widened.  Her mouth opened and words tumbled from her quivering lips.  I could only smile as she muttered words describing the amazing port flavors, ripened with fruit and covered with chocolate, lingering with spices and coated with molasses.",4.6
4859,Westvleteren 12,"dark amber tan head, blah blah... smell is amazing, dark fruits, malt, alcohol. tastes far too complex for my pallate, but it's like getting your ass kicked by a supermodel, you don't really understand it, but you love every second of it. the answer to anyone who has ever claimed that brewing is not an art.",4.9
4860,Westvleteren 12,"(2005 bottle sampled 12/2008) Aroma of raisins and dried plums, anise, saltiness. Salty-anisey flavor, lots of dried fruit, quite intense, sweetish maltiness, slight sourness, orange-peel and anise in the finish. Medium body, no alcohol presence.
(Bottled, BBE 09/2007, sampled Dec 27, 2005) Smooth, syrupy aroma of raisins and plums, plus anise hints. No alcohol. Very malty, syrupy, smooth-anisey flavor with soft, warming alcohol hints. Some sticky-sugary bitterness. Quite full-bodied, silky-smooth-carbonated palate. Already considerably better than the fresh (06/2008) bottle I compared this with. Will probably get much closer to 5 by more cellaring...
(Bottled, BBE 09/2007, sampled Dec 19, 2004, was 8-4-9-5-18=4.4) Dark reddish brown color with a medium, beige head. Slightly roasted, malty and alcoholic aroma with licorice and some coffee hints. Sweetish, malty and wineous flavor with some salty soy-sauce, fruit, anise and other herbs. Quite full-bodied, smooth and slightly alcoholic, very warming palate with a somewhat high, but balanced carbonation. A very nicely balanced, complex, but a bit alcoholic brew. A few years of maturing would probably do good for this one.
[Old re-rate Feb 4, 2004, was 3.7 before this] Dark drown color, no head. Wineous, a bit alcoholic cocoa aroma. Very full-bodied, wineous, peppery flavor with plenty of herbs (anise). Heavy stuff! Needs to mature more to soften the flavor, but very good anyway.",4.5
4861,Westvleteren 12,"Unlike most, I do not understand why this is the God of Beers at all. A nice ale, yes but a little sweet. Aroma of dates or raisens (I could not tell which). Very complex flavors.",4.2
4862,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma and flavour were very complex and full with strong notes of molasses/sugar, malt, licorice and many more components. All in good balance with the alcohol and carbonation. Mouthfeel was fantastic and the bitter aftertaste just lasted. Great.",4.4
4863,Westvleteren 12,"I saved my 100th rating for the beer most everyone hails as supreme.It poured an exquisite brown red color, the aroma was malty sweet, with a little bit of citrus,not as wonderful as I thought. The taste was sraight malt citrus, with a hint of cherry. A very nice brew, but not the elexiar I was led to believe.I read one report that the new brew is a little raw and may take a couple years to peak, so I bought another bottle and will let it sit.",4.6
4864,Westvleteren 12,"Now, I usually prefer blondes to brunes, at least in beers, but Westy has amazing complexity. Every sip is a discovery. It looks splendid and smells good too, but there's less aroma than I anticipated.

The alcohol is warming and as you get further down the glass you'll be finding yet another facet of this many splendored nectar. Variety of fruits and tastes to be discovered, among the dried fruits some chocolate. I'll need to rate this again to do it properly, but I'm hardly overrating it now!",4.6
4865,Westvleteren 12,"Sweet. Vapory essences of chocolate & vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, coffee & cream. Port wine, raisins & plums. Addictive. Ruby brown clear (until last pour) with small lacing off-white head. The best mouthfeel of any beer I’ve had. Liquid velvet. Sweet & complex to start. Can taste most of the odors described above. Alcohol, too. Finish stays sweet but some mild hops introduce themselves for delicate bitterness that persists to the aftertaste. Leaves with nutty dry sweet-bitter. This beer is near perfect.",4.7
4866,Westvleteren 12,"OK.  I signed up for ratebeer a few months ago and have been trying to become a beer snob ever since.  I have spent a great deal of time ""tying one on"" achieving my goal and I would like to start my ratings today with the ratebeer king of beers.  Opening the westvleteren 12 was a treat.  Not an overpowering aroma as I anticipated however there was a strong smell of dates/raisins to me and a strong alcohol aroma.  The appearance was dark cloudy brown, with a thick light brown head that never died.  The taste is quite complex.  I taste the dried fruit and molassas. It is extremely silky on the tastebuds and has an outstanding burst of complex flavors.  It almost leaves you guessing.  I like that.  Outstanding on the palate, in a class of its own.  I can see how this beer is rated as one of the top dogs in the world.  As I finish the bottle, it gets even more enjoyable.  The only drawback is that the bottle ends to quickly to make a final analysis.  I look forward to purchasing another bottle and doing a rerate.",4.5
4867,Westvleteren 12,"Pretty damn close to perfect.  I sample this side by side with the Rochefort 10 (which I thought was slightly better).  Very complex aroma - molassas, dried fruit, toffee.  Flavor was equally complex - all aromas were present as a flavor, with some addided rich spiciness.  Finish has some nice hops, along with some nuttiness and toffee.",4.8
4868,Westvleteren 12,"Cloudy, brownish color with a sensational malty aroma of chocolate and raisins.  It had a nutty taste with butterscotch or caramel notes.  The feel was full and creamy.  Perhaps one of the best beers of all time.",4.8

4870,Westvleteren 12,"It is a rich symphony of flavor.  It was sweet and chocolaty and fruity and warming, but it also had a perfect finish.  I am in awe of this.  I’ve had none better.  I’ve been to the mountain top.  What else is there?",4.9
4871,Westvleteren 12,"It is with much trepidation that I approach the throne of Westy 12.  Upon opening the bottle a lovely fruity aroma is released.  Nice head of varying sizes of bubbles.  The color is a deep red.  When held up to a light, it is a beautiful red glow with hints of yellow.  The aroma is of ripe fruits (pears, berries, apples, bannanas) and yeasty as well.  Now for the first sip.  Some vinous qualities in the finish, which are surprisingly pleasant.  Hoppy bitterness upfront with thick rich malts in the middle.  Bready yeastiness as well.  Plum flavor.  Notes of coffee and chocolate(!) as well.  I can see why some people say this beer is inconsistent, as every sip seems to taste a little bit different.  I think that what makes this beer is the malts.  They are so rich, and the texture is so smooth.  The aftertaste is a constantly changing array of flavors that lingers for 10 seconds.  I am very disappointed that my glass is almost empty because every sip reveals an amazing new aspect.  Westy 12 transcends my expectations for what a beer can do on your palate.",4.9
4872,Westvleteren 12,"Big thanks to jcalabre for this one. A full bodied sweet candy-like barage of flavors, blended with a beautiful complexity that finishes with a cocoa tinge and warmth from the alcohol. No question that you are experiencing something special and world-class. Incredible!",4.5
4873,Westvleteren 12,"Amazing.  It's full of yeast.  Dark copper in color with a head you could float a quarter on.  Aroma of citrus, spice, alcohol, and yeast.  The taste was a complex blend of all of that and more.  Those monks sure know their beer.  Great stuff.",4.3
4874,Westvleteren 12,"""I can see the yeast"" was the comment from one of my friends upon the pour.  A dark copperish color with a thick heavy foam.  It had a complex citrus, yet yeasty flavor.  I can understand the draw of this beer,  but it's not going to convert me to a belgifile.",4.5
4875,Westvleteren 12,"A winey, yeasty aroma is the first thing to meet you upon pouring.  The tan head is pretty thick and mounds well over the lip of the glass.  The flavor is intensely bready and yeasty, with a woody dryness to it.  The aftertaste has smoke along with some fruit.  The only thing I disliked about this beer the woody aftertaste.  It was approaching unpleasant, but was quickly dissipated by another sip ;-)

8/25/05 notes - Again with the figs (just had the 8), just with darker, roaster dates.  Alcohol, maple, wood, and brown sugar.  Odd, I think I liked the 8 better!",4.3
4876,Westvleteren 12,"The holy grail of beer.  Thankfully I did not have to embark on a quest to obtain it.  
Incredible aroma with abundant depth.  Black currant, alcohol, raisins.  Georgeous appearance.  Dark brown/purple ala plums.  Head is initially massive but mostly dissipates.  There is some moderate lacing.  The flavor is extremely complex.  I am sure this is what everyone lines up for.  Fruit, yeast, spices.  The finish is extraordinarily long and rich.  Like an incredible ultra-rich chocolate dessert.  Massive and perfectly ranked.",4.7
4877,Westvleteren 12,"Murky reddish brown. Large frothy tan head that leaves huge sheets of itself behind on the sides of the glass. The aroma has definite alcohol and woody notes. Semi-sweet fruity aroma is also present. Quite a nice aroma! Two clear stages of flavor: intially its sweetness, candi sugar and dark fruit. Then as you swallow it turns tails and you get a big wallop of wood and yeasty goodness. The alcohol, all 10.2% of it, goes almost unnoticed until you get the warming in your throat and the tingling in your gums. Truly an extraordinary beer worthy of the tons of praise heaped upon it.",4.6
4878,Westvleteren 12,"Lots of carbonation when opened. Reddish brown and murky. Excellent lacing and smallish off-white head. Aroma is very woody and dark fruit. Taste is amazing. Fruits and bread evident. Detect some cocoa flavors as well.  Alcohol bite is almost non-existent, yet slightly warming on the swallow. Truly an excellent beer.",4.6
4879,Westvleteren 12,"Dammit.  I love this beer.  I drank this beer out of my Westie glass.  This is my favourite beer.  It was my favourite glass.  Alas, the glass is no more.  I dropped it, and it shattered into a million pieces.  Kind of like my heart felt, as it slipped from my fingers.  Anyways, very large, bready head.  Musty, bready, mature aroma.  Very peppery, spicy flavor, with some cherry, and alcohol is definitely present.",4.7
4880,Westvleteren 12,"Mahogany brown, nice head and lacing.  Ripened dark fruits (plums and dark berries) and port in the aroma,  incredibly complex flavor that somehow hides the 10% alcohol.      Perfect.  Thanks to Gerdy555 for this one!",5.0
4881,Westvleteren 12,"What I like about Westvleteren brews is the fact that I drink them to celebrate AC Milan's victories. This one was purchased before the derby (Inter Milan vs. AC Milan) and opened after the match, in order to celebrate another glorious 3-1 win. ^__^
It's hard to ""rate"" a legend without being influenced by its status; anyway, this is indeed one of the best belgian beers I have tried, and its fame is obviously well earned.  
Huge, mountain-shaped head, almost solid, leaving a fantastic lace over a deep garnet, hazy body. Lively carbonation, with a perlage of tiny bubbles all around the glass. A joy for the eyes. Caramel, ripe fruit, raisinis, brandy and something yeasty in the aroma. The taste is full, rich and balanced; gets dry and nearly bitter (almonds?) in the finish. Very long and hoppy aftertaste. Full, creamy body. More complex and thicker than the Westvleteren 8, a bit less drinkable, due also to the higher ABV percentage.",4.5
4882,Westvleteren 12,"Amber/brown color with creamy head.  Have some floaties but I can live with that.  Aroma is of dark fruit, toffee,  yeast, and a hint of alcohol.  Has nice flavors very distinctive from other beers.  Toffee flavor, very sweet with a spicy finish.  I detect a woodiness too. Humm??   Bready characteristic and very warming(if only it was cold outside and I had a fireplace).  A soft mouthfeel.  Very good, just a little too expensive.",4.7
4883,Westvleteren 12,"I must admit, its quite good. But I feel that most people only talk it up cause its so expensive and hard to get.  Not that much different from a St. Bernardus or even a Chimay Bleu.  Good, of course.",3.8
4884,Westvleteren 12,"Dark muddy brown with lots of floaters. Off-white creamy head. Fruity, nutty and spice aroma. Hint of alcohol.  Buttery, nutty, fruity on taste. Finish is spice and ash. Coats my mouth and makes it feel like I just smoked a cigarette.",4.3
4885,Westvleteren 12,"Like the commercial description indicates;I remember the rumours years ago that you had to go to the monestary in the middle of the Belgian countryside,to get their ales and that Westy 12 was only available on certain days.You would go to a window and pick them up in a wooden crate.By the time I was hooked on Belgians I found that some specialised beer stores like Belgian shop and De Bier Konning would make that trip for us.Now it's great yet kind of sad that this Holy grail of beers is so easy to obtain.Anyway back to the beer.Complex sweet sour orange spice,chocolate bread aroma with no alcohol.Dark chestnut appearance with perfect head and small white particles.Thick sweet fruity orange bitter spice, dark fruit flavor.Only a little old fashion bread flavor towards the finish combined with apricots.Lingering fruity aftertaste with very slight hops and no alcohol burn.Strange that the last time I tried this I remember it seemed more like a dark bread bomb.Succulent.",4.8

Nose and taste of dark malt, espresso, and floral hoppiness, with a huge finish.  Does a good job of hiding the taste of its high alcohol content.  Hard to find any fault with it at all.  Delightful complexity of flavors, near perfect mouth feel.  Worth the price, but too strong to drink very often.",4.8

Old rating, november 11, 2005:
Dark amber, nice brownish head. Now, this is a complex beer... Aroma brings alot, but the nutty  and malty touches came thorugh the most. Some dark chocolate, vinous, spice and peppery. Some hops, you name it, it was there.
Flavor is dry nutty and malty, spicy and peppery hoppy and from dark chocolate, even more nuts and malts. Some syrup and a pleasant finish. Incredibly complex and a very. very good beer. Oj, vad den var god...",4.5
4890,Westvleteren 12,"My original glass was enjoyed on one of the most picture perfect days I can remember (4th July 2002): sunny, 70 degrees (F), nice breeze and I was sitting on the patio at the ’brew pub’ across the street from St. Sixtus. . . I remember the amazing fruity aromas and robust malt well.  I recently sampled another bottle and though the setting was as great, the flavours were just as amazing. . . the aroma has loads of different fruits: ripe pears, bananas, watermelon, and kiwi, as well as freshly cracked nuts, almonds, pecans and deep, full malt.  The body has light brown edges that get steadily darker and more red in the middle.  What little alcohol is present in the nose is also folded into the complex flavours and velvety palate.  Smooth chocolate, strawberries, toasted and buttered sourdough, this is truly a first rate beer!


11.2 oz bottle [22.05.05 on the cap, sampled 4th July 2005]: cloudy beechnut with a modest taupe cream that diminishes significantly, but never fully leaves…The palate is actually softer and smoother than I remember, I didn’t think it could possibly get better!  The flavours a bit dark and more developed than the fresh sample: the alcohol has penetrated each ounce and helped spill more of the nuttiness and fruitiness throughout.  I have heard that it is best at 3 years, and after this experience I would tend to agree.",4.8
4891,Westvleteren 12,"Every drink of this brew brought with it new flavors.  From nuts to berries to spices, it never ran out.  The color seemed odd but that was most likely due to the lighting in the room.  I was sad to make it to the bottom of the glass.",4.7
4892,Westvleteren 12,"This was a very complex and amazing beer.  A lot of different flavors coming at you all at once.  Fruit, candy spice and an absolutely velvety mouthfeel.  At 10.2%, this is a velvet hammer.",4.6
4893,Westvleteren 12,"Well, I finally bought the true ""King"" of beers. 11.2 oz slender, tapered brown bottle. No freshness date seen, but none needed either. Poured out a dark, murky brown color, with hints of ruby around the edges. Had an enormous white head at first, but slid back to a yeasty island on top of the beer. When I poured this beer & got near the bottom of the bottle, I noticed big, brown chunks of yeast coming out, so I eased off on the pour. Aromas right off the bat are of brandy soaked raisins, plums, and other dried fruit. No hop aromas at all. All dried fruit, spices, and sweet caramel malts.
The aromas are very complex & change over time as the beer warms up. Tastes kind of strong at first, then the malts soothe the tongue from the bite of the spicy alcohol. Very malty, very well made beer overall. Finished with a warming effect, and a slight coating of the tongue. I truly wish I could afford more of this nectar.",4.9
4894,Westvleteren 12,"Very interesting.  Absolutely gorgeous looking beer.  Thick head that dissipates slowly, large bubbles, deep amber color.  I can’t say that I’m experienced enough to describe the flavor, but it is quite fantastic.  Smooth for such high ABV.  Alcohol is hidden well.  Deserves the high rating.  One terrific beer.  Wish it was more accessible, and cheaper.",4.2

There are others more qualified to describe it, but if I had to describe  one of the flavors that jumped out at me, it would be the fruity charactistics that come out.  Quite interesting.

4898,Westvleteren 12,"[3 - 7 year old bottle rating] Beautiful cloudy brown color with a medium tan head.  Aroma was that of dark fruits such as grapes and plums.

4899,Westvleteren 12,"Nice dark ice tea appearance, and some nice cream head topping it off. Smell is sweet with hints of apple and other fruits.  Alcohol is almost not apparent in the flavor, which is very balanced.  There is the first initial hop taste, then a very complex mouth feel.  There is a a bittersweet quality to this one for me however: I finally got to drink it, but I was supposed to drink it with my brother, who is now en route to China...",4.5
4900,Westvleteren 12,"This was very good choice for my 1107 . I am the 304th to rate . Well let see if the wait was worth it . I shall review this beer same way as I did to all of my previous ones. Westy looked quiet decent with its creamy white head. Aroma -it reminded me of the bark from centuries old pine trees that grow south of Krotoszyn. Not a surprise to anyone that malt (roasted no to darkly) used was also one the best. Slightly sweet, and alcoholic in finish. If you think that Zywiec Porter with its 9.5 % was drinkable what a surprise was to see 10 % brew to be event smoother. Very clean, well executed, made beer. True masterkraft",4.3
4901,Westvleteren 12,"i'm sure many of you must KNOW what i've gone through: i've fretted, worried and mooned over my bottle for months now; she came in the mail from england, just after three p.m. on the fourteenth of february. little westy weighed in two pounds four onces-- with all the frilly packaging. people said she looks like me, but they're just being nice, oh, she's just beautiful.  we'd been, you know-- trying --for years to get one, but no luck; we were just about to give up when this miracle happened. given up for adoption, the silktork agency paid to have her sent to me--and i'll love her as if i brewed her myself!  when we heard she was coming i got busy and fixed up the spare shelf in the refrigerator: painted it bottle brown with cute silly little monks dancing around.  brought her home from the mailbox and everyone was over and we had cake and took video and everything, gosh, and then put her in her little coverlet, checked the temperture, made it all snug-wuggy and cozy, i kissed the diminutive palm-tree on her cap, and closed the door...  and waited. for what, i don't know.  weeks went by.  sometimes i'd go out and just check on her, and stroke that darling little label-less brown glass cylinder.  i'd heft it like i was going to drink it, haw-haw like a pirate, and then feel guilty--(why?! oh, WHY?!?)--and i'd put her back down, smooth the covers and feel bad and maybe just go drink a bass or something.  i just couldn't bring myself to sully this magnificent bounty by sucking it's lifeblood and sending it through my carnal, undeserving and corpulent body!  but the moon was full, i was writhing and wincing like a werewolf tonight under the spell of that hypnotic  bottle.  i crept out to the fridge, trembling with nearly erotic anticipation and experiencing frightful inner-conflict.  but this time the bottle wasn't dormant, but standing and radiant, and then she spoke her first words: ""do me, stud!""  hallelujah! my time is at hand! this wanton extravagance blesses a snifter with oak-barrel ochre hues, ruddy at the core.  head was the buffy tan of sparrow down, thick as a queen's mattress and with lace billowing downward in the most regal self-assured gothic lacing.  jewels of yeast within the pour are practically as collectable as moon rocks-- so celebrated is this beer.  as each swirl writes a chapter of lacy elfin script, the nose speaks it's own tongue: alcohol and vanilla, vienna roast coffee, with caramel cream, dijon mustard, and the honied perfume of aphrodite's hair, drying on the bee-buzzing summer lawns of nirvana. at fifty cents a sip, i decided to name each sip after great heros of the bible, alphabetically.  from abraham through adam and onto amos, i was already slave-like to the spell, the apple-strudel spiciness had made me dizzy, while the bitterness had sculpted my tongue like a yielding slab of marble under the loving and deliberate blows of michalangelo's hammer.  sweet malts of fruit finally dominate an otherwise perfect balance; alcohol too well hidden because it was over too quickly.  i considered breaking the bottle to lick the damp insides of each shard.    yes, call me a cork in the current of peer-pressure, yet i fully and willingly succumb to the hype of my mentors, and hereby write my own hyperbole onto the tablet of ratebeer tasting. i must concur that the drink is in intimate proximity to perfection-- at least as far as we mortals are allowed to know.",4.8
4902,Westvleteren 12,"Appearance is awesome.  It looks like there's a moist yet fluffy cloud floating on it.  Quite a bit of yeasties in the bottle.  Taste is kind of like Kasteel with the candi sugar.  Westvleteren is less sweet with a ton of complexity.  Balance is perfect.  Taste lingers and takes you for a ride.  Various images come pop up in my head while drinking this.  I need about 20oz. more to decipher what's going on here.  Very worldly and mysterious.  Something that a U.S. brewery has not been able to duplicate.  Worthy of it's # 1 status.  Even if this style is not your favorite, you will still know it is very good.",4.6
4903,Westvleteren 12,"(33cl bottle) Deep brown body with an almond head. Strong nose, brown malt and vanilla. Complexity that reaches the center of the Earth. Malty, tones of vanilla, prunes. Sweet and delicious. Finishes as everything you'd imagine!",4.5
4904,Westvleteren 12,"Deep amber with a billowing creamy head.  Sweet malty aroma, with loads of dark fruits.  Luxuriously sweet maltiness with light sherry notes.  Deep profound bitterness is quite beautiful.  Not overly complex in my opinion, but a work of art nonetheless.",4.3
4905,Westvleteren 12,"pours a redish brown with a tan head that is initially thick but dissipates, but still leaves some lacing. flavor is very complex and it is difficult for me to tease out flavors. i am definatly too much of a novice to fully appreciate this beer, yet I still enjoy it even though I can't describe it well. an excellent beer",4.6
4906,Westvleteren 12,"Pours with a deep red-brown/mohagony body topped by a medium thick off-white head with lots of lace left on the glass.  Spicy malt aroma with a slightly sweet, fruity character and a touch of alcohol.  Slightly sweet and fruity malt flavor with notes of licorice and pepper with a slight alcohol bite.  The finish is bitter and spicey.  Full bodied and very tingly on the tongue.",4.8
4907,Westvleteren 12,Cloudy brown with lots of sediment. Small creamy beige head. Smells sweet caramel and smells like paint. Taste very sweet with alcohol. Medium body with a velvet palate.,3.4
4908,Westvleteren 12,"Dark brown with red edges. Big brownish bubbl;es dissolve quickly. Spice, fruit - raisins and dates, in the nose. Thick body, with intense malty sweetness and spicy hoppiness. Coats the tongue and gives a long lasting finish. May be the best beer in the world",4.7
4909,Westvleteren 12,"Murky dark red amber with a creamy head and sweet aromas. Full-bodied with moderate bitterness. Fruits, sweet malts, flowers, dried herbs are all present with some bitter hops in the end. Alcohol content detracted somewhat making this slightly less appealing than the Extra 8. Very potent with a strong aftertaste.",4.5
4910,Westvleteren 12,"ok... this is my second time having this... its very dark with a creamy thin head that stays the whole way, the aroma is sweet - malty - nutty, the flavor is has lots of alcohol to it - which is a major diss to the old tongue, it has a rather nutty flavor - that was rather bitter - malty - but leaves a nasty film on my teeth that ive never experienced before... i dont know... this isnt #1",3.7
4911,Westvleteren 12,"Great! Similar to the westy 8, but I actually liked the 8 better because the head was fuller and creamier and the taste was even more spot on. With that said, this is a perfectly, and i mean PERFECTLY balanced beer. One of the best belgian strong ale I have tasted. Period.",4.7
4912,Westvleteren 12,"O.k. so I finally spent the money to grab this beer. 12oz for $10. The expectations are high. The body was brown with a very small white head. A ton of yeast in suspension....I have to wait a while to pour the whole thing. The aroma is of alcohol and paint. Some nice brets and caramel. Is this the beer everyone has been raving about?? The palate is slightly oily and very smooth. The flavor is quite alcoholic with some caramel hinting at chocolate. Well rounded with some malts and some nuttiness. I am not really finding anything too wonderful about this beer to necessitate such a rating. It is a fine beer but, I have had much better.",3.5
4913,Westvleteren 12,My lord...this is perfection in a bottle.  this is so beyond complex in the flavors and aromas... simply stated... wow.,4.9
4914,Westvleteren 12,"Beautiful brown color with a nice head. Taste is exceptionally great, complex, fruity, spicy, just excellent.",4.6
4915,Westvleteren 12,"As I'm approaching 100, I considered holding this off for the big event.  But then I decided, nope, too cliche, let's drink this sucker.  Fudgy brown color, with decent, beautifully creamy light tan head.  The aroma is of grape must, and a touch of shampoo.  Perfect palate.  The taste, quite surprisingly, is nothing like the nose of the beer.  I noted faint cherries, and silky chocolates.  Although very, very nice, I didn't note quite the complexity or layering of flavors others have.  But I can't complain about it's #1 ranking.",4.3
4916,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle.  Complex beer, I let it ripen for three years before tasting. The head vanished almost instantly and a strong alcoholic, portlike smell entered my nose. The taste was mildly sweet and more like a good wine, very complex. The finish was a bit dry and acidic adding to the very wine-like character of this beer.
Yummie.",4.6
4917,Westvleteren 12,"Presents a soapy, floral nose containing notes of plums, ginger, grapes, and maple.  Sticky sweet, medium bodied.  Bubble-gun like flavor and sharp acidic tinge in the finish.  I had it a number of times subsequently in Europe, and overall it didn’t do a lot to make me change my opinion or score.  It still is a delicious, strong, heavy beer.  Subsequent bottle sampled in Belgium in 2006 were much better, very flavorful, everything you could expect.




Fresh bottles at In de Verde in Westvleteren are hot, a bit thin, and too green.  Scores are in the 3.5-3.8 range for young bottles.




Rerated scores for 1-2 year old bottles hold true: 4.5.",3.7
4918,Westvleteren 12,"7/5/03-My 40th Birthday present to myself!

Deep brown with orange hues. A foamy beige head. Some sedimentation present.
A rich complex aroma, reminds me of hazelnut liquer, port, caramel and toffee, delicious.
A worthy elixer to hold the #1 position.",4.7
4919,Westvleteren 12,"Brown and opake.  Highly carbonated for any beer. Head has a chocolate cream colour and is so thick it looks like ice cream in glass of cola.  Tiny pearl string bubbles eminate from all over the glass.  Some fruity aromas and wine like notes.  Rich and creamy with a stable rich flavour profile.  This is an extremely complex and balanced beer.  Nearing perfection. Rich and malty brew.  First some rich raisin and plumb notes reveal themselves then chocolate like flavours step in with a subdued balance hop bitterness.  The initial sweetness and flavours linger on the palate like a silk lining for minutes.  There are no sharp edges in this beer at all.  It is all about malt and balance and imenseness.  A slight drying effect, minute as it may can be detected.  This is easily one of the best beer experiences I've ever had.",4.9
4920,Westvleteren 12,"Shaggy was kind enough to share this beer and Rochefort 10 with me after waiting weeks for delivery from Belgium...the wait seemed to take forever, but the giddiness and anticipation was almost as fun as drinking it. Dark with sediment, fruity, so sweet and complex. An excellent choice for this style.",4.6
4921,Westvleteren 12,"I've been keeping an eye out for this beer at local liquor stores and discovered bottles at Joe Canal's in Millville, NJ.    This liquor store is more of a budmillercoors joint, with some speciality imports and micros.   Cost was listed at &6.59 a bottle but wound up paying $2.19 thanks to the cashier ringing it up as a generic loose micro.   So this beer is winning points already!  I found the Westvleteren 12 has a dubbel style, heavy malt alcohol flavor, with a thin head and some floaties.   Not an everyday beer, however I will try one again, hopefully for $2.19 a bottle!",4.1
4922,Westvleteren 12,"Opened this to celebrate my #200 rating. Murky reddish/brown hue. Huge tan head and wonderful lacing. Medium to full-bodied. Sweet malty aroma with huge fruity hint of plum, raisin, strawberry. Slighty vinous on the nose. Sweet tasting with a note of toffee and mild spices, can note the alcohol but not overpowering. Warming and comforting beer. Mouthfeel wasn't creamy like I expected (seeing how creamy the head was), more oily, thin compared to other strong ales (but not to, say, a APA). Well I'm not sure if I'd say that this is the best beer on the planet (to each their own)...but it's still an outstanding trappist and world-class.",4.7
4923,Westvleteren 12,"OK, here goes my crack at the number one rated beer on ratebeer.com on June 3rd of 2003. I held a special party for this one. I invited 3 friends and Hotstuff to join me in a little Westy 12 sampling party. Two showed up and the third gets his sample tomorrow as well as 2 other co-workers. My Rating: This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a cloudy yeasty semi opaque dark brown beautiful body. The aroma was its weakest point as it was only a sweet mild malt aroma. I would have expected a stronger more pleasant aroma for a higher rating. It has a very complex flavor of roasted notes as well as spices and the taste that a high alcohol content brings to a great brew. It had a tingly mouth feel in its finish as well as an alcohol taste. This is truly a brew to sip and enjoy as long as you can make it last because you certainly can’t get too many of these especially at $10 a bottle. This brew has to rate as one of the best beers available. It is truly a masterpiece! The high point of the tasting came from a younger gentleman who had never had a great beer before. He rated it as the best beer he had ever had. Who would have guessed! The low point of the evening was when the host offered up a couple of more beers after the Westy’s. Sorry to say, he had Miller lights in the fridge! Gag! The friends rated the brew as 8-3-10-4-16 and 6-5-9-5-19 per the RateBeer rating system. They did truly enjoy the brew and stated that it was probably the best beer they had ever had. Go figure!",4.5
4924,Westvleteren 12,"I've been waiting for this brew and it was well worth the wait!!! Poured a large, invigorating long-lasting tan head with fine-small bubbles. There was good lacing on the sides of my glass. This brew had a cloudy brown body with yeast. It had a sweet aroma to it. I could definitely taste the alcohol in this brew and was it ever good!!! I think thedm enjoyed this brew just about as much as I did! What do you say thedm??",4.5
4925,Westvleteren 12,"Rerate. Bottle cap says 7.10.06. 
Okay, I was a total newbie in Trappist beers when I sampled the WV12 a little more than a year ago. What will be my impression of this so called wonder, at this point?
At first my nose senses pepper and apples. Next smell evolves plum or prune. Another sniff and there is plum or prune. Yet another smell, and I sense chocolate. Hehe....
Flavour: Aah...this is a big beer! Must sip it very slowly, in order to catch all the delicat flavours. It's more than full-bodied, has chocolatey undertones plus that feel of exotic fruits(mostly lemon), much more pronounced than in Maredsous 8, which happens to be my favourite Belgo this(!) far. The body is also a bit oily(like Nils Oscar Julöl 2003) and unbelievably pleasant to gargle around with in the palate. What a beer, the texture is amazing! From an intellectual(common sense) point of vies this beer is perfect. But when giving the points, there is always the personal liking that has to be considered. Therefore it's only a ""17"". I love it. But there are beers that I love better.
Old rating gave  7/4/8/3/15. 
Nut brown color. Creamy off-white head. Fruity aroma with notes of vinegar, clove, raisins, dried fruit to name what I can interpret. My friend who got a sip from it claimed that ""This tastes like shit!""...well, I can't agree but since I'm not a fan of Belgo beer my rating is indeed generous. I will rate it again of course...",4.5
4926,Westvleteren 12,"Beige head that diminishes too fast,  but leaves a nice brussels lace. Dark brown body. Aroma is great; sweet/malty, raisins, over-ripe fruits, winey, rum (sweet+alcohol?), dough. Body is medium to full. Full of flavour; sweet, then spicy (some liquorice!?!), and a long slightly bitter plus dry finish with an alcoholic warmth. Complex.",4.4
4927,Westvleteren 12,"The best ever trappist-beer. It has fruits, nuts and chocolate and a lot of warmth from the alcohol. It has a fantastic head and a beautiful color.",4.6
4928,Westvleteren 12,"Very, very good, chocolate pudding nose, and slightly sweet smell, malty is the word, and smooth (especially for 10.8%), lots of fruit, and chocolate, but i think the alcohol does shine through in the finish. But a very good experience, distinct candy sugar flavour, as with the other 2 Westy beers.",4.7
4929,Westvleteren 12,"This beer is hard to come by. But it's worth searching for it. This beer is simply incredible. Perfect appearance with a nice, slightly brown head. Complex taste with hints of port and raisins. The aroma is very sweet. Every time I drank of this beer it was an amazing exprecience, but at the same time I felt really sorry because I had less beer in my glass...",4.9
4930,Westvleteren 12,"This was the beer I picked to be beer 100.I had Trois Pistoles for number 99 which is a outstanding beer. Westy #12 is truly outstanding. A super complex beer with many flavors,(toffee,chocolate,raisins and even more).Ruby red in color with a huge white head. Extremely smooth for a 10.8%.The finish is stunning as it warms your every bone.",4.9
4931,Westvleteren 12,"Deep garnet red. So murky with haze as to be nearly opaque. Huge off-white head. A full quarter inch lasts until the end of the glass. Aroma is mild at first but becomes stronger with each sip--some grassy notes bread, plumbs, raisins. Slightly sweet front. Notes of brown sugar, molasses and dried fruits--an intensely complex combination of sweet flavors. Flavor changes dramatically as it moves across the tongue. Full round mouthfeel. Slightly sticky. Alcohol is slightly present in the aroma and finish but well hidden. Perfect carbonation. Candi sugar softness. The best beer ever? No. Delicious? Yes.",4.2
4932,Westvleteren 12,"The beer gods have smiled down upon this brewery.  Absolutely the most satisfying beer that I have ever tasted.  It pours a dark and murky brown with hints of red and an impressively large head that dies down quickly.  The aroma reminded me of a barley wine with a lot of fruity scents and a hint of alcohol (I'm not a fan of Barley Wines, so I was hesitant). The flavor was incredibly complex.  The flavor is so incredibly smooth that I was in shock (considering the aroma)  I think I notice a hint of chocolate in the taste as well as some different fruits and a couple spices.  The mouthfeel of this beer is extremely smooth and satisfying.  I could drink this beer all night long - although I'd probably not last more than three because of the alcohol.  Again, this is THE best beer I've ever had and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of the $8 per bottle price.",5.0
4933,Westvleteren 12,"Aroma is of pears, spices, and alcohol. Apperance is brown with a ruby tint. Flavor could best be summarized in a 12 page essay after no less than 20 different samplings, but considering the limited space I will do a brief summary....Chocolate covered raisins, darker fruit is present maybe plums or dates, caramel, and other things I cant pick apart very easily. Its like trying to pick out every single instrument in a symphony. It goes down smooth with an alcohol warming effect. This would be an excellent way to warm up on a cold night. Palate is spicy, fruit filled, and tingly. I’m a hophead by nature but for this style of beer, by god, you cant and wont go wrong. Go to whatever means to obtain this beer!",4.5
4934,Westvleteren 12,"Very nice brew, I was actually a bit surprised to taste the hopps in the aftertaste, it was a surprised, I just wasnt excpecting it.
I´m gonna order some of these soon from Belgium.",4.9
4935,Westvleteren 12,"Fantastic head, lacing, and carbonation.  Try as I might though, I had a lot of floaties in my glass.  Ambrosial aroma.  I think maybe the most complex smelling beer I have had.  However, the mouthfeel was desperately lacking with almost no body and a thin, feeble texture.  The flavor was vacuous compared to the aroma and nothing like I was expecting from this distinguished beer that does not live up to it's hype.  Try a Unibroue 11 or Epluche-Culotte instead.",4.0
4936,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled on 9/7/2001 sampled 3/2/04:  Cloudy brown with some sediment and a nice lacing head.  Big caramel complex malty aroma.  Bready sweet body has some dark fruit complexity and crisp dry balance. Hides its alcohol well.  A nice beer, but I still prefer the Westy 8 or Rochefort 10.    

5/6/2003: Pours a murky dark brown with a thin, lightly lacing head.  Musty wood and malt aroma with notes of alcohol.  Light chocolate flavor with some caramel and a moderately bitter finish.  Silky, effervescent body terminates with a soft alcoholic burn.  This is a good Belgain ale, but I was not as impressed with it as its rating shows.  I guess you come to expect a lot out of the highest rated beer on the site.",4.2
4937,Westvleteren 12,"Thick head fades to leave mohagony , brownish beer.  Alcohol tickles the nose.  Beer has one of the best mouthfeels I've experienced, like velvety somehow.  Light bitterness.  Raisins, dark fruits, and bready.  Finish is dry and toasty.  A very well crafted beer, but still not my favorite of all time.",4.2

(re-rate: a six year old vintage, same charachteristis, a bit overly sweet and yeasty, very sticky. Thick dark chocolate, coffee, fruits (bananas?).

4945,Westvleteren 12,"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is yeasty and sour with a touch of fruitiness. WOW. An amazingly complex and excellently made beer. Full bodied. Malts are bold and flavorful. Very complex. Seems to be a different taste/flavor aspect with every sip. Fruity with raisins, plums and cherries interplaying with vanilla, chocolate and orange peel. Hides the 10.2% alcohol very well. This is one beer that is definitely worthy of all the hype/accolades it has received. Very smooth and extremely complex. Excellent beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Beer # 1100 on my personal list. Thanks to herbjones for this one.",4.8

Pretty dark ruby/brown/orange color with a medium tan head. Crisp feel with a long finish.",4.5
4949,Westvleteren 12,"Extremely close to perfection...simply grand. I could drink this every day of my life and just appreciate it more as time went on. Malty, figgy, hint of ""real"" vanilla. Really beautiful in the Trois Pistoles glass, I was content to sit and watch the swirling head and rising bubbles for awhile. There was no rush or expediency for me to taste. Mind-boggling amount of various flavors that constantly changed as the brew warmed to room temperature. The perfect amount of spicy richness in both the aroma and flavor. One that can only be described accurately to one wbo's enjoyed it before. I would give it a perfect 5, but I know I will have another bottle and be able to describe much more about this beauty.",4.7
4950,Westvleteren 12,"So I finally got my hands on a bottle of Westy 12 thanks to mwsf.  I finally get to see/taste/smell what everyone is talking about.  Creamy, slightly beige head.  The head takes a while to settle down.  Fairly aromatic, I can smell it and the glass is a couple of feet from my nose.  Sweet aroma, yeasty with hints of raisons.  The color is dark, like the cloth of a monks robe.  Lots of carbonation, but not huge bubbles, they are pretty small.   When this beer hits your tongue, you know something special is in your mouth.  Yeasty taste, but not as much as some of the other Belgians and Belgian Strongs I've had.  Delicate on the tongue.  The carbonation doesn't ruin it.  The alcohol is hardly evident.  This beer is numero uno for a reason.  I'll buy this every time I get a chance from now on.",4.8
4951,Westvleteren 12,"You wanted the best, you've got the best...well this was the introduction of a great rock n' roll band, but it's perfect for this beer. Brown colour, thin head, but really lasting. Incredibly creamy texture. Raisins, strawberries and raspberries in the aroma, with some vanilla hints. The flavour is delicate, complex, really pleasant, it's difficult to describe all the sensations that this beers gives in your mouth: fruity (raspberries, apricots, peach, strawbeery, raisin), sweet (caramel and vanilla) with a touch of sourness. The finish is balanced between sweet and bitter flavours, with good coffee notes, very persistent in your mouth. This beer is perfectly balanced and you can't even fell the high ABV percentage. Westvleteren 12 is simply the best beer I've ever drunk in my life. I'd have never thought to give a ""5 out of 5"" percentage, but this beer really deserves this rating. An unforgettable beer (and I dont' really care if I had to pay 8 euro!).",5.0
4952,Westvleteren 12,"Pours cloudy brown, with a tan head. Aromas are dark fruit (berries, plums, raisina), sweet malt, caramel and wood.
Flavors are much like the aroma, with a musty touch as well. Body is rather heavy.",4.2
4953,Westvleteren 12,"Superb dark belgian appearance, but the overt alcoholic flavor was too much to deal with.  Along with the burnt old tabacco taste.",3.1
4954,Westvleteren 12,"I loved this beer.  White rockey head that dissipated slowly until it was firm lacing across the top of the dark copper body and up the sides of the glass.  The aroma was pleasantly restrained, it made me work to name things in it.  A slight woodiness sneaks out behind bushels of sweet malts.  Esters and alcohol compliment the sweet maltyness with aromas of plums and raisins.  The moment this beer hits the taste buds life gets so much easier to deal with.  Full flavors develop over long periods of time, right through the swallow and keep going until the next sip.  Rich maltyness with plums, raisins, a hint of wood and some well controlled alcohol will swim through your mouth as this silky smooth full bodied delight goes down.  The finish is not so much a finish as an intermission because the flavors keep going with a slight acidic note to clean the palate.  please may i have another?",4.7
4955,Westvleteren 12,"3/05/03:  bottle.  nice tan head with a small bit of rockiness (patches of yeast atop head.)  some lacing.  beautiful deep ruby color.  raisins and malt in the nose.  wow!  excellent all around mouth activity, something for each and every taste bud to enjoy.   taste: raisins, some woodiness, sweet malt and a tad bit sour.  somewhat bitter aftertaste.  alcohol taste appears more as this beer warms up.  most enjoyable.",4.4
4956,Westvleteren 12,"Poured a murky, dark brown with some chunks. Big and rocky head that diminishes to a nice thin coating. Lacing but not much.

Lots of malt, raisin and yeast in the nose. Very bread like smell. There is also a slight smokiness with the bread.

Holy esters! There is so much going on in the flavor.   A big kick of malt and hops is a given. Plums and raisins mixed with a ton of alcohol. There is a single malt scotch undertone too. Maybe it's the wood note others have tasted. Or it's more likely the dark candi sugar (if there is any...). I'm need to cellar a few and see what changes.

Very dry finish that almost leaves a chalk-like feeling on the tongue. Nicely carbonated at cellar temp.",4.4
4957,Westvleteren 12,"Wow....and i do mean that with a wow!!!! Definitely worthy of the best beer on ratebeer distinction. Upon admiring our bottles for about a minute or two myself and akinm decided it was time for the opening. It poured a reddish brown cloudy color with spots of ruby and extremely noticeable yeasty deposits. It maintained a wonderful pearly white head which danced marvelous around the glass and had moderate head retention. The aroma was ALL OVER THE PLACE and as it warmed led to SOOOOO much more. Raisins were quite evident, plums and cherries..specifically plums were right there upfront. A Deep malty sweetness..some very old oak aged wood was apparent. I also got hints of a citric apricot or peach, with the ever so slightest hint of alcohol, 10.8% is hard to hide. The taste is unbelievable...only the second beer ive ever tasted that got more complex the more i tasted it. Plums were right there..raisins coating the back of the tongue, sweet sweet vanilla and complex malts caressing the sides of the tongue, oak and slight spicing give it an aged feel, with medium carbonation in the mouth. Something of a bittersweet citric orangey apricot that adds a minor and i mean minor but PERFECTLY balanced citric aspect to counteract the vanilla sweetness. This beer definitely got more pungent in every respect as it warmed, just wonderful in every respect of the word. Aftertaste is fairly dry, like chewing on a vanilla covered orange peel, or apricot skin..just magnificent. World class beer for sure, and a nice choice for beer 250, 1/4 way to 1000!!!",4.6
4958,Westvleteren 12,"This beer is solid as a rock. I have had Sint bernardus  before, wich tastes quite similar, but this one has a much more consistent taste.",4.8
4959,Westvleteren 12,"Pours cloudy, but a nice thick brown with a bright belgian head. Aroma of toffee and caramel with the usual banana/clove belgian yeast notes. Flavor was very complex with raisin, caramel, toffee, and other malt dominated flavors shining through. Finished a little bit drier, but still complex and never alcoholic despite the strength.",4.0
4960,Westvleteren 12,"How can one describe this, this beer can only beer experienced.  Spices, chocolates, madarins, raisins, peaches, and many other flavors which I have not been able to distinguish. Lots of co2, flavor, this is the prized, the best belgian, and 10.2 percent of alcohol that is virtually undetectable.",4.0
4961,Westvleteren 12,"aroma was reminiscent of tart, chocolate covered grapes or raisins with nice added notes of port wine and the carbination was very lively..Upon first sip i noticed definite cocoa, slight grape or raisin, and an ending that wrapped itself around my brain and squeezed me insane...as I was coming to the bottom of the glass, the flavor twisted to creamy and brownie-like and I was enraged that the experience was coming to an end...Second time: finding all the marvelous flavors of before but now noticed an additional surreal and virtual world of juicy sweet raisins and i could actually see and feel myself chewing on a mouthfull of raisins...3rd Time/Older bottle: i felt that the beer had just gone over the hill and was slowly losing its complexities..4th time: i opened a nice fresh bottle of westvleteren 12 ..I put my nose up to the glass and slowly took the aroma apart into must, chocolate, concord grapes, plums, freshly ground pepper, mildew, toffee, and even more must...Upon my first sip the tastes were just where they ended with my very first bottle with thick chocolate brownies, fresh juicy sweet black plums..you know the ones with the pinkish-orange flesh..the mouthfeel was so silky and so velvety it was like fudge melting in your mouth..a little bitterness makes its rounds near the finish and the aftertaste exhibits the most realistic plum and grape skin astringency that...well..I’m speechless..The alcohol does not make a single appearance in all its 10.2% glory..and every sip gives life to new flavors and all new experiences...last few bottles have not been as complex..so I’ve noticed a lot of inconsistency with this beer, although it is still one of the greatest beers there is.  Points deducted for inconsistencies.",4.7
4962,Westvleteren 12,"Extremely carbonated.  Dark brown, cloudy with tons of chunks floating in it.  Aroma is exceptional - fruit, chocolate, malt.  Flavor is complex but very smooth.  Mouthfeel is bothersome with all these little floaters in the glass.  Some people like the chunks but I'm not a big fan.  Flavor and aroma are great on this beer but appearance and palate could use a lot of help.",3.5
4963,Westvleteren 12,"Could there be any better than this? i have been fortunate to have friends visit Westvleteren and bring some home, previlaged, the taste is incredibly smooth and ritch a slight hint of almost peach fruityness yet a mellow bitter aftertastes that just melts in the mouth. Make sure your sitting when u try this one.",4.9
4964,Westvleteren 12,"Powerfull in tastes and aromas as no others. Lot of dark fruit makes a complex, balanced mix with nots, chocolade. The high alcohol is only increasing the aromas and flavors, it is not present as a distrubing element.",4.8
4965,Westvleteren 12,enjoyed every sip.  aroma of alcohol but very well masked by malty fruit tone.  i think I picked up some apricot.  wasn't a big foam head but it had a thin layer which left a nice lace on the glass.  lots of dark sediments which made the last few sips even richer than the rest of the beer.  wish I had more access and money on this one.,4.5
4966,Westvleteren 12,Dark and cloudy with a nice head. The first drink has an initial alcohol bite and then the full warm malt flavors take over. Many complex flavors going on. I got hints of banana or caramel. Improves as it warms. Overall a very good beer.,4.5
4967,Westvleteren 12,"probably the best trappist to be found, though i'm not an absolute fan of the brown beers this is still a classic",4.6
4968,Westvleteren 12,"Finally, I get to try the legend.  Quite a bit going on in the nose.  Everything from vanilla to lime.  The alcohol is totally hidden.  Probably the best smelling brew I've encountered.  The  head appearance of the first bottle differed from the second.  The first poured from the bottle a cloudy dark walnut with a large amount of fixed particles and had a fully lasting light tan frothy/fluffy head with mediocre lacing.  The second had an off-white fluffy head that diminished quickly.  The overwhelming flavor is deep and pungent with a sweet start, warm middle and a balanced peppery finish that speaks of anise.  Again quite a bit going on here.  The heavy body is full, lively and dry.  At close to $12 a bottle not something I could afford to drink often, but I'd drink it again for sure.",4.5
4969,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled (off course).  Today I went and got a cisk (by train, god, I'm lucky I live in Belgium :p)  It has an magnificent almost black colour, and a 'brown' head.  Complex aroma, little sweet, malt.  Dito flavour, but also a bit spicy.  In Dutch, we have a proverb for this: ""It's like an angel pissing on your tongue.""  Dito palate.  Just Excellent!",4.5
4970,Westvleteren 12,"Thanks to Belgianshop.com I finally got may hands on some of this (8 of them to be exact).  It's hard to add anything else to what's been said, except it is about the closest thing to an orgasm in a bottle.  Absolutely wonderful!",5.0
4971,Westvleteren 12,"This beer poured a very dark cloudy amber color and formed a light tan foamy head that disappeared quickly leaving some circular lace. An aroma of alcohol, raisins and yeast/grains. A flavor of malt, caramel and raisin with some elements of spices. The finish is creamy and a touch sweet with elements of the alcohol. A very great belgian beer, but will need to try some others to see if this is really the best out there.",4.1
4972,Westvleteren 12,"1/12/03. Cloudy amber brown color with a tannish white head that was thick and lasting. Fruity yeast aroma. Flavor quite complex. It fit together like a scenic jigsaw puzzle. Sweeeetness, bready, figgy, vanilla, creamy, malty. Currants in the aftertaste. Medium carbonation. Quite enjoyable to sip on. Left me wanting more.",4.4
4973,Westvleteren 12,"Call it part of the inherent education.  I found this beer to be too thick and Vermouth like to call it balanced.  It was enjoyable, don't get me wrong, but when compared to outher superior beers it simply was to thick, sweet and IMHO imbalanced.",4.0
4974,Westvleteren 12,"OK, so this stuff really is something special. The aroma was unlike anything I've had - it reminded me of some variety of fragrant orchids. The appearance is appetizing, and interesting with what lookes like small particles suspended in mix. Thick and delicious in the mouth with flavors from all over the place, hearty multi-grained bread, fruits both light and dark, and wonderful chocolates. New flavors arrive several seconds into the experience as you let it settle on the tongue. It's really just plain fun to experience this beer.",4.9
4975,Westvleteren 12,"This beer has so many things going on.  It's fruity, slightly yeasty, very dark but yet not overly thick.  Them monks sure know how to brew a beer.  I only wish it wasn't $12 a bottle at the bar.",4.4
4976,Westvleteren 12,"Nice rocky off white head with nice lacing.Spicey peppery nose. Hazey amber color with some yeasty beasty,s floatin around.Nice steady flow of tiny bubbles rising up at a constant pace.Carbonation is decent.Full bodied,fruity. Taste some anise/licorice flavors, maybe a little black pepper?I did notice the taste of alc on the first sip or two but not after that.As it warms up the yeasty, bready flavors and aromas are coming through, nice.Very slight astringency in the aftertaste. Overall a damn nice brew! They did do a fine job of hiding the alc also.The price will keep me from enjoying this brew more often. It seems a little bit out of line at $10 a bottle.",3.9
4977,Westvleteren 12,"07/09/02 date stamped on the cap.  Murky brown pour, lots of sediment swirling about in the glass.  Thick, medium lasting tan head, huge clingy bubbles initially formed on the side of the glass, then burped their way to the top, never to be seen again.  Aroma filled the room with strong apple scents, with some yeast and doughy aroma coming with a more intimate sniff.  Taste is strongly doughy and apple, with hints of banana, grape, plum and strong malty sweetness in there.  The banana seems to come through more as it gets warmer.  Slight alcohol comes through towards the end.  Mouthfeel is huge, pummeling the palate with all the different luxurious flavors, feelings, and hints of alcohol.",5.0
4978,Westvleteren 12,"Opaque and cloudy dark brown, for some reason this bottle did not develop much head - perhaps it was a bit too cold. Raisins, nuts, almonds and the spirit of christmas to come in the aroma. Massively dark fruity (plums)and malty fullnes with overtones of  
sherry and cognac. It feels kind of strange to give the beer so many top scores, but I have to anchor the upper end of the scale somewhere, and this is probably not the worst place to do it :-)",4.8
4979,Westvleteren 12,"Nice brown cloudy body.  Very thick, long lasting head, off brown on color.  Super sediment all throughout the brew.  Nose is loaded with ripe fruits, some spicy notes & nice toastey cereal grains too.  Sweet and fruity, Ripe fruits all around, sooo smooth, phenomenal  balance!!  Superior stuff, for sure.  A funny alcohol sensation in my nose.  Really soft and so fruity!!",4.6
4980,Westvleteren 12,"Lives up to the #1 Ranking! Almost like an apple cider champagne! Too bad it was $11 for 11 ounces! Great colour and sediment!

I didn't want to touch this rating, but figured I had to given that I've had this beer more than 10 times since this entry, been through more than 14 YEARS since this entry and still think just as fondly (perhaps even moreso), but can be quite verbose about it:
Happy Birthday Claire (16-October-2012)!
Happy Birthday Paige (02-January-2015)!
Happy Birthday Tate (02-November-2017)!

Sampled for Tate's Birthday, purchased from Beer Mania in Bruxelles, Belgium on 19-August-2013 for €12,00 sampled at the hospital in Arlington, Virginia on 02-November-2017. Another amazing sample with a ridiculously complex finish and palate with deep fruits, a ton of yeast, dry grain, sweet pungent honey and caramelised sugars, yet a relatively malty and earthy bite near the end. Amazing, as usual. Wish I had more to drink now, but the rest will have to wait until another special day. Rating for this sample: 10,4,9,5,19

And having yet another bottle after my 10,000th rating, here is this one:

s: molasses | figs | yeast
a: collodial rich brown | not much head left
t: rich | sweet | musty & complex
p: pit fruity | earthy | rustic
o: still great | flavourful | yeastie & complex

33 cL bottle | Beer Planet: Bruxelles, Belgium | purchased: 18-January-2015, sixteen days after my second kid was born | €13,00 | sampled, after rating #10,000, in celebration, on 15-July-2023, about 8,5 years after purchase

4981,Westvleteren 12,"Deep color, vaguely translucent brown-red.  Amazing scent.  Ripe, ripe raisins.  Loads of sugar plums.  Explosive tartness there, like a fresh orange or tangerine.  Very noticeable milk chocolate.  Don’t know how to describe this.  Soft and luscious.  Like sucking on the world’s best candy with the lovely candy sugars.  Fruitiness is quite subtle, softer fruits like apricots and pears.  Incredibly long finish, a sweet, tart, sugary, fruity ghost that haunts the tongue for several wondrous minutes.  Best word for the palate is just soft.  I don’t drink it as much as it somehow deems me worthy of placing it in my mouth and it gently works its way around my tongue and down my throat.  Is it strange to be repeatedly thanking the bottle for allowing me to be near it?  The Westy didn’t taste in any way overcarbonated, but it acted like it in the bottle.  After pouring out several ounces into a glass, I put the bottle down.  A good ten minutes later I noticed foam coming out the bottle, slowly wandering its way upward.  Just damn lovely, no bones about it.",4.8
4982,Westvleteren 12,"Time for a treat !!!! Well deserved after my hard, but successful, phoning job to obtain some two crates of heavenly fresh Westy 12. Yes, the time is indeed right to celebrate.
And.....what is more appropriate than tasting my cellar remainings: In this case: A one year old Westvleteren 12 ! Well, I need to empty my remaining wooden crates of Westy 12 ASAP to bring back to the monks, do  I.
Jesus Christ, what a beer !!!! The ester aromas that escape the bottle, just after uncapping, are just phenomenal ! Nearly a miracle..... Flowery, banana, prunes, fruity, in one word: ""wow..........""
Amazing creamy foam. First being fullbodied, and later falling into a thin creamy layer, including some resistant carbonation bubbles. The layer stayed there till the end of my victory celebration. An excellent quality observation.
This Trappist beer has aged with alot of complexity results. The flowery perfumes, in combination with some subtile Port flavours, makes the beer tasting like an angel pissing on the top of your tongue. This is a TREAT guys !!!!
This brown nectar is very soft too, and amazingly creamy. Tasting gives an immediate strong hop (Poperinge) bitterness, but the candi sugar sweetness immediate balances this, to give something extremely delightful.
The alkohol is there, absolutely, and this just in the right measures....... 10.2 vol%. Taken with care !!!
Don’t worry, you will definite get drunk after a couple, but don’t worry, a hangover is un-existant !!!
The more I taste, the more tastes I define. The Westmalle yeast gives the beer something fresh and digestable. Also something soapy, hard to describe really.
After one year of ageing, I notice some huge sediment inside the bottle. Pouring gave those lumpy sediment particles. Yeast mixed with some protein floculations. No worry, this is not unhealthy. I drank(eat) everything till the ever last drop.....",5.0
4983,Westvleteren 12,I can''t say much more than what has been said.  The alcohol is well hidden.  I noticed the licorice and raisin flavors.  It indeed get''s better as it warms.  I drank two to celebrate the new year.,4.7

An excellent beer. I thought it would taste a little like the Rochefort Trappistes 10 but it didn't. This beer tastes a lot better. I could taste caramel and nuts in this beer. Very complex with a superb aftertaste. A must try.",4.7
4986,Westvleteren 12,"Bubble gum is prevelant in the nose of the brew with hints of toffee, raisins and chocolate.  Rich brown in appearance -- the bottle I sampled had tons of suspended yeast even after sitting out for 30 minutes, none of the yeast fell to the bottom of the glass.  Wonderfully complex flavor profile ... everything from anise to cotton candy.  The hops are imperceptible but this brew has enough bitterness to counterbalance all the malt.  Overall this is a fantastic brew ... merits the hype ... would be in my top 20 list, but not top 10.",4.4
4987,Westvleteren 12,"Rich chocolate aroma, dark fruits and slightly malty. Unbelievably well balanced beer. Somehow the flavors unite to create new unique complex chords. There are no off notes in this beer to speak of. Each flavor fits perfectly with the others. A true masterwork and no doubt made with divine inspiration. In retrospect, I was one of the luckiest people on earth to have been able to buy half a case of this stuff before leaving Chicago. Needless to say its all long gone now...",4.5

Oct, 2007Chris_o tasting. This was a 1996 bottle I picked up at The Cracked Kettle, Amsterdam. Yeasty and bitter. Ovaltine. Good condition. Sweetness in there. A dense beer which doesn’t give up the flavours and pleasures easily. [3.3]",4.4
4990,Westvleteren 12,"Dark amber-mahogany color. Large thiny and creamy beige head. Aroma is sweet with caramel, raisin and slightly alcoholic notes. Flavour is malty too, with candy sugar, banana and dried fruits tones, ending in a short slightly spicy finish. Medium to full bodied.",4.0
4991,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a dark brown with very dark ruby hued edges. Has a large foamy head that lingers as the beer is drank. Lacing is quite nice to boot.  Aroma is extremely pleasing. Apples, pears and banana. Coriander. Some yeast, but not much. Barely a hint of alcohol detected. So good. Flavors. Very balanced. Fruit again, this time a bit more banana, maybe some orange that gives it a slight bitterness to it. Spices are lingering. Again, I'm finding the coriander. Sharp and tangy finish. Creamy palate and a big body. This is definately a great beer. I would like to thank Buck_Dich for my first bottle last Christmas, and my girlfriend for my bottles this year. I need to move to Belgium.",4.9
4992,Westvleteren 12,"Head creeped out the bottle shyly, (maybe from being tossed in luggage too long).  Strong alcohol smell with sweet carmel thickness.  Brown sugary fruity taste, drank warm. Lovely gift.",4.6
4993,Westvleteren 12,"Another powerful beer. This one had a dark brown to almost black color. The taste was very strong but not overwhelming in the alcohol department. The taste was reminescent of Chimay but with a much more noticeable anise taste. A lot of sediment in the bottle I had. This was VERY memorable and I can""t wait to enjoy another. Will rerate then when I have another to get a better taste. But this was definitely worth seeking out. Highly recommended. (9, 5, 10, 5, 19)

Re-rate. Bottle. Cap reads 27.11.06. Apparently, this has ""expired"". Muddy crimson/copper mix with only scattered froth on the surface. Nose is dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs), sweet malts, caramel, light toffee, and light alcohol. Taste is rich and sweet. Creamy malts, ripened dark fruits (black cherries and raisins), light alcohol, caramel, light spices, and light yeast notes. Body has thinned out a bit. Light-medium overall feel and not much carbonation left. Still rather creamy, though. Finishes with a touch more alcohol, sweet malts, caramel, light spices, rum soaked dark fruits and some port-like notes. Still very nice! (8, 4, 9, 4, 17).",4.5
4994,Westvleteren 12,"What a beer to drink on Christmas day! Best before 07-05. Overwhelming aroma of malt, cinnamon, plums and butter. Sweet and thick. Buttery with roasted malt, plums, licorice, some well-hidden alcohol, apple, raisin, porto, cinnamon and pepper. Amazingly complex and powerful, sweet and overwhelming, delicious beer. Without any doubt one of the best beers in the world.",4.8
4995,Westvleteren 12,"color is deep orange/brown with a light beige head lasting very nicely indeed with some good lacing. aroma is perfumey with a little bit of alcohol present. ripe bing cherries, tiny bit of citrus, currant and melon are also present. also got a hint of new tire smell or nitrous gas at a dentist. flavor is a bit strong on the alcohol which diminishes quite nicely as it warms, but there are pleasant notes of peach there. ok, the comparison with abbaye des rocs...i''ll take abbaye any day of the week and twice on sundays. ok, that may be a bit strong, but i do prefer it to westy. i chose this as #501 to be my starting point for the next 500!",4.5
4996,Westvleteren 12,"Had one shipped straight from Belgium. Not too much head as I was expecting, but everything else delivered. I don’t think i’m up to giving the flavor impressions yet, i’ll need more of them. Extremely soothing, complex, and got me way more drunk than I expected.Rerate of a 2001 edition - 4 years old, wow, mellow, complex, yummy shit. Still, I lack the words.Rerate again of a 2002 one, with more time on my hands: Deep orange bourbon mahogany color, thick retentive head, light lacing. The nose shows complete circle of life here. The water yields the earth, which yields plants such as apricot, figs, grass, floral notes. The plants support animals that create honey. The honey supports other lives and so on. Very clean, pleasant, full bodied yet mellow on the palate and easy drinking. Finishes delicious. So herbacious and fantastic that still, even when I try, I want to spend more time with the beer than the notes. What can I say?",4.8
4997,Westvleteren 12,"This beer has been hyped more than any other, so when I saw it on the menu at the Sharp Edge in Pittsburgh, I decided to order it despite the $11 price tag and my ever shrinking bill fold after tasting many other fantastic brews.  I must say that it was good, but definitely not worth the price.  Deep brown colour with lots of sediment.  Sweet apple/fruit aromas and flavours with hints of brown sugar. 12-9-02:  My second westy 12 sampling.  Nice red burgundy colour.  Extreme vinous, black currant aroma.  The flavour is smooth, but complex, sweet, yet bitter with a delicate elegance.",4.1
4998,Westvleteren 12,"This beer is different than any other I've tasted, and definitely in a good way.  Cloudy, in fact chunky (from the yeast), red-amber color.  Okay head with some lacing.  Spicy, malty aroma with hints of dried fruit (cherries, raisins).  Same flavor, very smooth, don't notice the alcohol.  I have yet to try many of the high-end Belgians (Rochefort, etc., its so hard to justify spending $7+ on a beer), so I don't have much basis for comparison, but I thought this beer was definitely on a different level than anything else I've tried.",4.7
4999,Westvleteren 12,"Great pour and consistency, muddish red appearance.  The only thing that really got me down about this beer was the fact that there wasn't much creativity in hiding the alcohol and the warmer the beer got, the more the flavor wasn't apparent.  Still an excellent brew, although I question its deservedness of the #1 rating.",4.2
5000,Westvleteren 12,"Two words.... OH WOW.  Smooth, malty, spicy... everything a beer should be.  Very dark in color.  A bit of fruit, maybe plums or raisins.  I always wondered where the monks derived their pleasure in life.  I now know.",5.0
5001,Westvleteren 12,"Good gosh!  Like a silver plate full of the world's finest fruits and chocolates--what more can I say?  The first thing I noticed was the color.  It was like no other beer, a cloudy burgundy?  The taste was very complex with several sensations to examine at once....striking!  I may trade in my current wardrobe for a brown robe.",4.3
5002,Westvleteren 12,"Delicious.  What a great subtle, complex aroma.  Unlike other Belgians (Orval, Chimay) I''ve tried lately, the flavor of this one actually delivers on the aroma''s promise.  Without a doubt, alcohol is present, but never hot--better concealed in my opinion that Rochefort.  A lot of candy sweetness up front.  Follows through with pear, a hint of stewed fruit, some creamy light chocolate and a lot of alcohol.  Filmy head lasts throughout.",4.2
5003,Westvleteren 12,"Brown with orange-red highlights. Huge head of compact, med., and large bubbles. Aromas of brand new Dr. Scholl''s insoles, wild flowers, Stilton cheese, chocolate, and tart raspberries cloak the alcohol well. Flavors of raisins, plums, bread, alcohol, bitter chocolate, nutmeg, grains, and medicine, with hints of caramel, roasted malt, flour, flowers, and a few items I''m familiar with, but can''t identify. Feel of alcohol on the tongue. Dry sensation pulling the flavors down the throat leaving a peppery bitter lingering finish.",4.3
5004,Westvleteren 12,"nose of pepper, black currant and ripe juicy fruit, just outstanding.  Warms with spicey, toffee, chocolate cookieish, mild bitterness.  I''m savouring every sip of this, thank you Kaya.",4.4
5005,Westvleteren 12,"Dark Brown, maybe a little mahogany. The aroma is amazing - Caramel apples, plums, roasted walnuts and a touch of cinnamin. The first taste is mildly fruity, maybe grape jam, but with a nutty graininess throughout. Finishes with a pleasant but not overbearing bitterness. Head remained to the last drop. Definatley a benchmark and worth seeking out.",4.6
5006,Westvleteren 12,"Very dark brown, with a thin but long lasting head. The small head might be due to the fact that it exploded all over my keyboard after I opened it. Aroma doesn't seem to be as strong as the 8. Alcohol is a little more pronounced too. Other than that, it seems to be pretty much the same beer.",4.0

Surprisingly different for such a consistently highly rated beer. Musky, fruity, and sweet. Picture some circa 1950''s homemade toffee wrapped in brown paper and tied with twine, mix it with dried fig and currant, now add some musty peaty ingredient from a dingy cellar and you''ve got this beer. Lovely malt and wonderfully dark tone. Damn, this is good.",4.9
5008,Westvleteren 12,"I am not a beer expert but I am aficionado. To me this ale has a wonderful aroma. I guess it could be described as a cross between candy and a banana. The color is a dark brown on my desk but if you hold it up to a bright light it shines a auburn red with sediment floating in it. This beer tastes fantastic if you like the taste of monk beers.  I do and I find this to be the best of the bunch. There is a little alcohol aftertaste but not too bad. Too bad the bottle is so small , I really enjoyed it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I paid $6.99 at Sam''s in Chicago.",4.8
5009,Westvleteren 12,"Ah yes, finally I have tasted of the mythical westvleteren 12... dark purple submitting to a slight touch of crimson lingering at the bottom; gorgeous color... deep and rich. The aroma was of grape and nut, with a small plum note and some spice... the kind of spiciness you would expect from a great trappist ale... the flavor was more balanced than that of rochefort 10; wonderful vinous quality, slight floral, spice and grape flavor with small hints of chocolate, nut and coffee... not as overpowering as the rochefort, subtle and ever changing. it is fairly sweet with a great dry finish that just knocks you back... you can finally taste the hops that seemed to pop up every once in awhile throughout the tasting experience. Wonderful, wonderful brew... I am looking forward to trying the others that I am saving in my cellar. Try this one!",4.9
5010,Westvleteren 12,"(Best by 12/13/02) The beer poured well and produced a good thick and lasting head. The beer looks very eye-catching in my Burgundy glass. The nose is straightforward with a touch of candy sugar and spicy noble hops, perhaps Hallertau or Tettnang. The palate is creamy and sweet with a touch of noticeable alcohol. I taste fruit flavors that are subdued, light flavors of raisin, banana, and plum. However, I do get a strange off flavor that tastes similar to plastic that I do not find favorable. The finish is good long and sweet, but does show some alcohol. This is the fourth time that I have sampled this beer and feel it does not live up to its hype. The plastic quality has been there every time I have sampled this beer; so I do not think it’s a batch problem, but a brewing flaw. Westy 12 is a good beer, but not the best Trappist Ale.",2.5
5011,Westvleteren 12,"Wow, what can I say, this beautiful elixir is just so full of flavors, I think I could drink one every month and find something new about it - beyond complex.  I got a lot of malty chocolate, plum, wood, various spices including cinamon.  The finish was lingering and continued to evolve.  Now I understand.....",4.9

One person also experiences it differently each time.",4.8

Medium-Full bodied w/ moderate carbonation but also smooth & creamy. Flavour was quite complex: ever-so-slightly sour at first, then malty, nutty, cookielike, meaty, roasty, and spicy.  Nice warm finish. I was a little dissapointed based on my expectations but this is still one damn fine beer.",4.4

Great aroma. Heavy malt and yeast. Blasts of rich, dark bread and dough. The high ABV never does break through into the nose.
A murky, medium red (not quite crimson) color, this ale has a small, mostly lasting white head.
The flavor is moderately sweet and malty and lightly bitter. Dark fruits and sweetbreads abound. A little too sweet for my taste. Full bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel. Fizzy. Long, dry finish. An excellent beer.",4.9

A  tangy, lingering, dry aftertaste that is ""Devine"". Alcohol presence  brings a slight warmth to your face and tummy. Not an everyday beer, but a special treat!",5.0
5021,Westvleteren 12,"This isn''t really cracked up to all the hype.  It is good, but seemed almost too complex and alcoholic.  I would prefer Rochefort 10 or Chimay Blue.",4.2
5022,Westvleteren 12,"of course it’s very good. it is a little prejudicial tasting a beer and knowing your peers consider it the best in the world. but that’s understandable, it is not at all offensive, none of the little nasties that creep into a lot of strong belgian beers. i figure most people who like this will probably still like another trappist beer more. i guess it’s the most mainstream and people who aren’t too sure if they like it will be swayed by the weight of opinion of those they respect. and it is very tasty. lots of caramel pears floating in creme caramel. alcohol almost too well disguised. little wonder it is so popular
had it again the other day, an ’04 bottle, and i have to give in and follow the herd and bump this up a few points. flawless. roasted almonds all over the place",4.8

5024,Westvleteren 12,Too strong tasting of alcohol. But still is something i would reccommend to someone because of its rarity here in the states. If i wanted a good belgian stroin ale i ould go for a Chimay Grande Reserve or even a Maudite from canada.,4.0
5025,Westvleteren 12,"Wonderful aroma--sweet and perfumey, with notes like fruit-cake, including hazlenuts, peaches, and chocolate. The flavor however was not terribly distinct, interrupted badly by a profusion of carbonation. There were some nice vinous notes in there, some sweet chocolate, an appreciable bitterness, but nothing that made me stand up and say ""Goddamn that's good.""",4.1
5026,Westvleteren 12,"(Best before 25/01/03)  I was at my brother''s place for my 25th birthday tonight when he offered me a beer.  ""I''ve got a couple of trappist beers if you want, Rochefort 8 and Westmalle tripel.  What do you say?""  ""Don''t you have any Westvleteren 12 instead""  I reply just to kid him.  ""Mmmmmm, let me see""  he goes.  That''s when I saw his face come out of the fridge with a big smile on it.  ""I just found one.  I was keeping it for a special occasion and forgot about it.  I guess a quarter of a century is good enough.""  After letting the beer warm for a while, he poured me a nice glass of this muddy reddish amber liquid.  Unfortunately, it had almost no head.  During my outer body experience I met nuts, plums, alcohol, wood, chocolate, caramel, honey and so much more I couldn''t describe.  For a moment, I thought I had picked up some hemp notes in the aroma but that was just the neighbour.  This beer sure knows how to warm a man''s heart.  Cheers to the best brother in the world.  Eric, you rock!",4.8
5027,Westvleteren 12,"Very well made beer.  The hype caused for a bit of a let down.  I do love this beer, but I do not know if it the greatest beer in the world.  I think I like v-10 as much",4.5

5030,Westvleteren 12,"Sometimes the hype is right on, such is the case here.   I finished my half of the bottle (split with my wife) before I could discover most of the complexities here.   Aroma is not strong but very unique, earthy, fresh, after a spring rain.   Tiny bubbles in a tan head, lasting, lacing.   Golden orange color with floaties that make it look like a fishtank.   Wants to be sweet then stops.   Spicy earthiness.   Burns the back of the throat for an instant.   Alcohol gets stronger as it warms.   Also is in the finish.   I need another couple of them!   Thanks to alcfron for picking this up in Kentucky, along with a couple of others.",4.7
5031,Westvleteren 12,"Was almost as fun just to look at it.  The nose was bountiful. Too much going on to name. The flavors bounced around in my mouth and grew in number with each sip. ) Grapes and plums, cookie dough and caramel, pizza crust and orange marmalade, yum!
Seems evertime I open a new westy 12, I am less impressed.",4.0
5032,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at Akkurat (cap date is 11.09.16).

Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, light brown, fully diminishing.
Body is hazy medium to dark brown, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, milk chocolate, cookie), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of raisin, date, orange peel, marshmallow, brown sugar, toffee, cinnamon.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

The one Westy that Akkurat had truly FRESH bottles of (probably because short-sighted thrill-seekers only seek out the 12, even though the Blond might actually be the best of the lot), and frankly I dunno if I’ve had a fresher bottle outside of the monastery cafe. This is no longer a style of beer I enjoy very much, but it’s still a very nice, very clean beer.  Boozy and very sweet, but balanced very well (surprisingly bitter for the style) in the finish to drink the whole bottle enjoyably. Rich dried dark fruits as expected in the nose, lots of raisin and date, and many layers beneath. It’s hard to say what ""the best"" Trappist strong brown ale is, but it’s almost certainly this or Rochefort 10, although both are too fizzy, boozy, and sweet for my tastes. Incredibly fun to revisit, though...especially such a fresh sample.",4.1
5033,Westvleteren 12,"This one pours a very dark, cloudy brown color with a medium sized, off-white head that lingers. The aroma is sweet and spicy. After two sips, this beer has become me, the beer is Godly. Full bodied, the flavor is malty, fruity, and bready, with a nice spiciness from the yeasts. Alcohol is not apparent at all. This beer is so smooth and perfectly balanced that my burps almost taste better than the beer itself. The aroma makes you wish you could eat the beer rather than drink it. This stuff is perfect, no overpowering sweetness or bitterness, just a perfect balance that flows through you. Excellent brew!",5.0

5035,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled: This is truely a great brew. I’ve had the pleasure of sampling this many time in Belgium and back home in Denmark. Had it as vintage and had it fresh. My personal favourite is a 2 - 3 year old sample. Just when you look at it, you’re in love. The colour is dark and brown with a huge foamy offwhite head. The aroma is fantastic. Ripe fruits, light liqourice, a bit of brown sugar, spice, a subtle sweetness. Flavour as well i out of this world. Smoth, balanced and pleasant. The ripe fruits (raisins and plums) is mingled with spices and the sugary notes. Has a slight touch of alcohol. The vintage samples is a bit more smooth than the fresh ones. Has a fantastic spicy warming end, that last forever. One of these in front of the fireplace with the one you love! Who could ask for more.",5.0
5036,Westvleteren 12,"This blows away the 8.  I must have had a bad bottle of 8, because this was exceptional. Creamy flowing beer with a flavor that is smooth as silk.  Crisp and flavorful.  Abundant spices and fruits (plums, grapes, port flavor) blend very well together.  My only problem with this beer is the floating sediment that is abundant.  The beer is a dark, cloudy and murky brew with chunks of yeast floating about.  Not a problem for me though.  The flavor is excellent.  The aroma also still has a very yeasty smell that is a little overpowering.",4.4

Your cough will go away immidiatley cause of my healthy chocolate, alcohol and plum taste. You''ll feel alive cause I tickle your lips and give a a fullmouth aftertaste.

5039,Westvleteren 12,"I have had quite a few crates of this beer. The aroma and taste varies a bit with age. In the young ones you have an uncontrolled bitterness that shines through. With age it develops its taste: port wine, bread, old fruit, choclate, etc. Vintage bottles get a slight petroleum aroma/taste just like old Mosel wines. I think that older versions lose some sweetness. For young bottles, say up to 3-4 months I would probably not rate it more than 4.2. For the more matured it varies between this value up to religious expereience levels.",4.9

Original rating: Very, very good, chocolate pudding nose, and slightly sweet smell, malty is the word, and smooth (especially for 10.8%), lots of fruit, and chocolate, but i think the alcohol does shine through in the finish. But a very good experience, distinct candy sugar flavour, as with the other 2 Westy beers.",4.7

5043,Westvleteren 12,"At the end of a long evening of drinking at the Toronado, I was just foolish enough to plunk down $15.50 for a bottle of Westy. I was drunk, it was my first time, and it was wonderful. As the number one rated beer on RateBeer with a score of 4.57, I""d have to say this beer is under-rated. Seriously. Sober re-rate coming soon.",4.9

5046,Westvleteren 12,"Re-rate: Now I drank this one a couple of times, once in 'de Vrede', and I find the taste a little too violent. There is clearly notes of both alcohol and yeast and some nutty and fruity hints. It has a high complexity and I intend to save some bottles in my cellar for a few years to watch the development. But at this moment I like the Chimay Bleu better.",4.3

5048,Westvleteren 12,The smoothness and flavour of this particular beer is one of if not the best in the world. Travelling from Australia to Belgian for this beer was worth the airfare by far.

I had to wait to pour the rest of the bottle into my glass, and no, I do not have any Belgian chalices to drink it out of.  Due to the pour I did have floaties in the beer, which otherwise was a nice red-orange color.  Very vinous nose with sweet, alcohol smells with a little musty hints hiding in the background.  Very complex malt sweetness, with stong dark plum fruity notes initially that warmed up with more grape/raisin flavors.  Nice alcohol warmness.  Not my favorite of the big Belgians, but still a hell of a beer.",4.1
5052,Westvleteren 12,The head that the beer poured with was very disappointing (nothing like the picture on this website).  Very dark and slightly sickly beer with a very strong burn't aftertaste.  Probably this beer is a little too complex for my taste buds.,3.5

5055,Westvleteren 12,"First of all, Westvleteren gets my respect for not tampering with their trappist ale recipes at all.  Just keep brewing the same beers for years and years because it is fantastic  beer. I was very impressed with this beer's complexity.  I get  raisin, chocolate, spice and much much more.  It  also has a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  About the only thing I didn't care for was it's sweetness (I'm comparing with Westy 8, which I did enjoy a bit more) but that is not to say I didn't enjoy this one overall. Definitely a top notch Belgian ale.",4.6
5056,Westvleteren 12,"This is the best beer I've ever had. Its taste is more to my liking than Rochefort 10, probably since it's not as rough and powerful in alcohol. The amount of aroma in this beer is unbelievable. The appearance of this beer is great, especially the somewhat thick scum on top of the beer makes it look great. It lacks a litle in color tone though. Overall it beats Rochefort 10 and anything else I've tasted. If you haven't already, then give this beer a try!",4.5
5057,Westvleteren 12,"This is by far the best beer I've ever had.  Thick and beautiful.  Hazy copper color with tastes of plums, grapes, and various woods.  Nothing more to be said.",4.9
5058,Westvleteren 12,"Very fruity/musty aroma, reminding me of lambic, balsamic vinegar and (oddly) kids' vitamins.  Smelling the empty bottle, the diacetyls and acetyls come out. Continuously effervescing in the glass with flocculent yeast. It hides the high ABV content quite well -- until it lands you on your tail.  Woody, musty, dusty & aged tasting. Quick finish, and it tastes good off the moustache.  Oddly, it makes me want to go back and take a more critical look at Ommegang Hennepin and Trois Pistoles.",4.2
5059,Westvleteren 12,The only reason for the dropped mark overall is to leave room for the belief in a 'holy grail' of beers.  This incredible ale is as close as I have got to it so far.  Absolutely superb.,4.9
5060,Westvleteren 12,all i can say is: yeah......................................................,4.7
5061,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled. Cloudy dark brown color, short brown head. Although Westy 12 has always disappointed me actually, this time I can finally appreciate it. Aroma of roasted malt combined with lots of fruity notes like cherry and berries. Hint of marzipan is also present, port notes. Very fruity taste of cherries and cherrypits, nice alcohol burn, quite bitter as well.",3.8
5062,Westvleteren 12,"I guess everything has already been said about this one. My humble opinion?The 12 is the best of the Westvleterens, in line with the 8 by flavour, but far more complex and substantially sweeter. A nice brew, but nevertheless imho not worthy of the title ’best beer in the world’, but i guess scarcity has a lot to do with that title. However, i’ve never had a fairly aged sample yet, which might considerably enhance the flavour.",4.3
5063,Westvleteren 12,"Definitely a beer for the nose. Out of the bottle, I'm hit with the same cereal grainy, sweet corn aroma of the Westy 8. As the nice, sudsy head diminishes (remaining significant), the aroma opens up quite a bit, becoming perfumy, with a grape juice/young wine/ fruit punch/sangria -like quality. Not as cheap as it sounds, this is the fruitiest smelling, non-fruit beer I've ever smelled, but it is robust and woody, rather than cloying and sweet. The taste of the beer is very sweet and smooth, with serious, but gentle carbonation. Sediment is very present and the beer is a cloudy brown color with a reddish cast. Mouthfeel is extremely rich and luscious, with faint licorice note and some nuttiness. The finish is gently bitter, like bittersweet chocolate.",4.3
5064,Westvleteren 12,"Brilliant. What more can I say. :) 

Rerate. This beer has a lot,. is very tasty but is certainly highly overrated. For the same money I can buy 3-4 Rocheforts 10, who are much better I think.",3.6
5065,Westvleteren 12,"Pours out to a dark, almost purple color in the glass with minimal head.  Taste is that of a spiced fruit.  Very wine-like in character and finish.  Reminiscent of brandy as well.  Enjoyable, but my palate didn't find it to be the best beer in the world.

Thanks to VA Homebrewer for sending this my way.",4.0
5066,Westvleteren 12,"Warming toffeish glow. Little head retention. Plumish and one of the finest pallates of any of the trappists. The best beer in the world? Nah, I like Rochefort better, but this is damn good. Not something I'd purchase regularly.",4.4
5067,Westvleteren 12,"So much has been said of this beer that when I finally found it, at the Ginger Man in NYC ($15 a bottle) I was sure I was going to be disappointed. How could a single beer live to such reputation? My doubts were erased as i took the first  brandyish whiff.. It poured with a reasonably creamy head that left perfect lace. Color is dark ruby/brown. The taste is out of this world.. complex yet unified.. tastes like brandy, plummish and rummy, sort of like raisins,  with an acidic, dryish finish. As it warms, chocolate and caramel become evident. AVB is barely noticeable, I couldn't believe it was 10.2%. This is my first straight 5 across the board, and well deserved. I have never tasted anything like this.",5.0
5068,Westvleteren 12,"Re-Rate 08/30/02: I've had this bottle for about 18 months, and decided, I could not wait to re-rate it. The pour is a cloudy cherry like color, minial head, minimal lace.

5071,Westvleteren 12,"As I am rating this beer, sitting in front of my computer I have a bottle of it that I am drinking, obtained online from belgianshop.  The use-by date on the cap is 23.04.05 and I'm thinking I'll age my other bottles to see how they develop over time.  Fantastic, perfect, sweet malty aroma.  Color is a nice medium amber and the head has a nice nutty color to it as well.  Flavor has a nice malt-hops balance with a little more to the hops side, and yet it seems as though the monks used almost mathematical precision to obtain this balance.  Hidden within the balance one could imagine almost an infinite variety of flavor undertones, and this is a very neat effect.  For this reason, I imagine that after aging, it will be quite incredible.  Fine carbonation adds a nice tickle to the tongue, but slightly less than in the 8 (which I preferred a bit over the 12).  At room temperature the flavor of alcohol is more present.  This is an incredibly great ale, however, I do think that it is developing a somewhat legendary status due to the fact that it is made by trappist monks and it is pretty rare.  It is really great stuff and I'm glad I bought it but I think I will still be satisfied drinking my favorite american microbrews most of the time instead, and for a lot less cash.  If you're really into belgian trappists though, this is definitely the one for you.",4.5
5072,Westvleteren 12,"As the number one beer, I had to see if it lived up to its name. I was not let down. The complexities of flavor that mow down yer taste buds in a relentless assault keeps you guessing as to what yer next sip might taste like. Litte spicy that time. Oh now that one was kinda fruity. Now that seemed a litte roasted. I swear i just tasted meat. No seriously. Excellent belgian that for ten bucks a bottle was worth every penny.",4.6
5073,Westvleteren 12,"Probably the most complex beer i've ever had. As I am only 60 beers into my experience I will no doubt rate this again. But this is the best belgian ive had yet. Figs are everywhere in this beer. In the aroma and the taste and finish. The taste begins like port, which port disgusts me, but it was soon replaced with figs and coffee, possibly some roasted flavors. But figs describes it best. Goes great with chocolate. As a rule Belgians go great with dessert. Not a beer to indulge excessively in. Also...the alcohol was hidden in a totally perfected execution of craftmanship. Worth 12 bucks a bottle? Worth every penny my friend paid for it.",4.4
5074,Westvleteren 12,"Re-rate 8/14/02:  Beats the Rochfort 10 head-to-head.  The most complex beer you could hope for.  Almost no trace of its high ABV.  If there is a heaven, I know what's on tap.  First rating: Stunning.  It is a smooth feeling brown elixir that has a complex taste that is hard to pin down.",4.9
5075,Westvleteren 12,"12/8/02: Rated 6 Westy 12's ranging from 6 weeks to 6 years of bottling age - notes too detailed to summarize here. Hope to submit article to RB soon. Ratings range from 4.5 - 5/5. 

Rerate 7/25/02: Rated during dinner at a small Belgian canal lock-side cafe while having a meeting of our local beer club. I ended up having this beer by accident along with a desert of Belgian chocolate and vanilla icecream smothered in a rum and raisin and advocar topping. I have never thought of a Westy 12 as a desert beer but it went togther with this desert incredibly well. The rich festive complexity of the the Westy just cut through and complemented the sweetness of the icecream and topping like a hand going into silk glove. 
Yes it's still deep murky red brown with fine bubbled medium size and lasting light beige head and makes a really delicate lace. Aromas are like all your Christmases at once - I could sniff this stuff for hours to try and work out what's there. I get dried concentrated fruits like apricot and raisins, sharper fruits like apples and green grapes, aromatic sugars like  karri honey and chocolate, port wine, spices and a light fruit yeast, and virtually no alcohol.  The big yeast aroma and flavour in this beer is somehow special in that it doesn't overpower everything like it does on some of the other stong Belgians. 
This is probably because there is so much variety and complexity of flavours that generally match the aromas in this beer. Really smooth, creamy and filling on the mouth/tongue. A slightly softer sweeter middle and a bigger bitter finish followed by a longer mellow bitter sweet chocolatey aftertaste. Still the best aftertaste of any beer I've rated.

5076,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle brought to me from my Uncle John shipped back from Monk's in Philadelphia.  A dark reddish brown swampy color with an off-white head that quickly subsided and laced.  After the cap was taken off the bottle created a
small head but never blew off the top.  The aroma is predominantly of
dark fruits and alcohol but builds to a stinging spicy fire in the nose
if you keep drawing it in. Wonderful.  A medium to full creamy smooth
body that tingles the palate with its spirits.  Everything about this
beer becomes more intense as it warms.  The alcohol is well hidden in the flavor but ever present at the edge of every sensation.  The dark
fruits and spice carry through to the flavor which has many layers that climax at different stages.",4.8
5077,Westvleteren 12,"Full & Thick as you pour it in to your glass, this beer is very complex, just looking at it makes you see Quality Let it warm up as you would any other Trappsit Ale.Fully loaded,awesome flavors, just simply a First Class Brew, One Great Belgian Ale Brew......... JDW, Flavors of coffee, caramel, and cocoa, Absolutley A WINNER",4.3
5078,Westvleteren 12,"Very dark. The color of a raisin, black except at the right angle when it turns a deep mahogany brown. Light khaki head is a creamy foam that is long-lasting. Laces the glass well. Yeasty caramel on the nose. The taste is vaguely stout-like. The richness of the flavor is very nice but not too rich to make it hard to drink. Caramel, spicy yeast and wood come out first. As it warms, more coffeeish flavor and some lactic characteristics. The beer manages to be slightly creamy and bright on the palate at the same time. Amazingly easy drinking for its strength.",4.5
5079,Westvleteren 12,"The king of beers. I haven’t had it in awhile. I don’t remember it well enough to comment on it. I had some comments here, but I wanted to rerate. I didn’t have this beer at a 5. Well, I’ve drank a whole lot of beer in my life, and this is still the best.",5.0

I am a little man, and unworthy of describing the complexity of flavors. maltysmooth. noticeable yet blended alcohol background. complex aftertaste. truly, the king of beers",4.7
5081,Westvleteren 12,"Pours up with a boisterous head that lingers over the deep brown body that leans toward opacity by virtue of its cloudiness.  The head sheets down the glass as you progress.  The aroma is simply Belgian perfection, and the flavor itself is full and complex, with hints of roastiness and esthers peeping through the spicy yeast.  It sits well on the tongue, causing the entire mouth to tingle.  The alcohol, while initially well-masked, becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.",4.9
5082,Westvleteren 12,"Ah, tried this one on my way through Belgium earlier this summer.  Definitely a world-class beverage, although imho not quite the best.",4.3
5083,Westvleteren 12,"I think that the mystery and limited availability make this beer seem better than it really is.  Don't get me wrong it's definetly a fantastic beer, it's just that the memory outweighs the actual experience. The flavor is all there; rich fruity esters that will make you weep, however it is too damn sweet for me.  I'd take a LaTrappe Quad at less than half the price anyday, but then neither beer is something I'd drink on a regular basis.  Long and short: Enjoy it while you have it and don't overspoil yourself!!!",4.5
5084,Westvleteren 12,This deserves the #1 spot but the price just hurts. Nice head on a dark pour.

5086,Westvleteren 12,"Saved this for my #100 rating - glad I did! Very fizzy upon opening, foam kept seeping out. Pours with medium sized head, light tan in color. Dark amber color - hazy. The light colored head looks spectacular against the dark colored beer. Medium sized nose - very complex aromas - sweet malt (no winey notes), bubble gum, orange, honeysuckle flower, sweet perfume, spicey notes - awesome aromas - wow! Flavor lives up to the gorgeous nose. Very complex flavor notes: sweet malt (a unique sweetnesss - sort of flower like), delicate spices, bit of citrus - simply delicious. Very smooth finish. This is not an ""in your face"" beer/style like DFH WWS. This is a very elegant, delicate and refined beer. Full appreciation comes with the extremely complex nose and taste - layers upon layers of different flavors - pay attention - there is alot going on. Simply marvelous!",4.9
5087,Westvleteren 12,"My 200th beer rated.  Aroma wins out here.  Initially it was strongly raisin, but then warmed to suggest plums, grape, and caramel like a toffee-coated apple.  I thought the alcohol was hidden rather well, considering, although it can’t be ignored.  Not much head on mine.  Inside of bottle cap was strangly molded; oh well, I haven’t died yet.  I wouldn’t say the flavor is quite as engaging as the aroma--very nice, to be sure, but a qualitatively different experience, sweet and malty.  Overall, it compares favorably against the beer I rated #199, Kaliber. :-)  (original rating: 22 July 02: 10-4-8-4-18, 4.4) //  Re-rated 25 May 05 in celebration of the birth of my third child, Simon.  I also had a Konigshoeven Quadrupel tonight, so I had a comparison (that’s a 3.8 beer).  This is a great beer but still not the top of my tree.  The palate is very nicely frothy, exploding in the mouth.  The sugars are controlled and balanced by hops.  The alcohol is surprisingly noticeable, but the grape spectrum in the flavor (from grapes to ports) have some wonderfully complex dimensions to offer up.  Really enjoyable beer.  Happy birthday Simon!",4.3
5088,Westvleteren 12,"Don't expect a thick head, this beer has way too much alcohol to have enough surface tension for foam to stick around long.  Had this one at the Steelgaarten under the Bethlehem Brew works, so the atmosphere was perfect (dim, high end beer bar)  The word of the day for this beer is ""SPECIAL B"", that magical dark belgian crystal malt.  The top end toffee and molasses profile stands out from the get go.  Carmelization of the malt sugars carries in the nose like roasting a marshmallow on the campfire.  Then the hops kick in to bring your palate back down for a lingering alcohol fumed finish.",4.4
5089,Westvleteren 12,"Must have been flat when poured, because there was little or no head.  I say this also because the first sips were hard to get past.  The alcohol was overpowering in the mouth, with barely a hint of taste.  But, after a couple sips, I warmed up to it and actually enjoyed it.  It has a somewhat sweet, fruity flavor that is pretty good and the aftertaste is nothing to complain about.  After a doubtful first sip, I think that I would recommend this beer to everyone now.",3.8
5090,Westvleteren 12,similar to a barleywine style great aged or fresh the murkyness people seem to notice is actually a chillhaze from the huge amounts of malt used to make such a beer this is not a defect as many of your wit and wheat beers have this.this is a beer i prefer to buy ahead of the time that i like to let it sit a week or two before drinking so the sediment can settle and after about 6 months the chill haze will drop but this means storing the beer as close to 32degrees f as possible dont be afraid to waste a little beer at the bottom as this will contain the yeast sediment and proteins. this stuff is about 4 or 5$ in belgium.,4.4
5091,Westvleteren 12,"Every sip of this BSA is a pleasure. Large long head, nutty/fruity nose. Lots of fruit and nuts...caramel? in the taste. Long finish that lingers. I cannot imagine something coming along to knock this out of No. 1",5.0
5092,Westvleteren 12,"The head forms a loose ring around the edge of the glass.  Slightly uneven, but fine-bubbled and more effervescent in this bright light than I would have imagined.   Color is rusty, brownish-red color, partially translucent but hazy (bottle swirled).   The incredibly complex aroma sets the stage perfectly for this beer.  A multitude of different breads, sweetness, alcohol, date, plum, wine, yeast and many more things are here.  The flavor is one of the most intriguing I've yet found.  It goes through so much development, so many stages...  The array of tastes as time goes by with each sip is truly wondrous.  Malt is obviously in control here, lending a variety of fruit and other flavors that progresses into something new as the aftertaste comes about and as the beer warms.  Complex, to say the least.  The finish is equally intriguing, warming, and satisfying.  Maybe the longest finish from any beer I've tried to date.  One of my friends described it as ""the Earth in a glass.""  
The changes this beer undergoes are amazing.  Writing about it does it no justice at all, it must be tried.  Find it.",4.9
5093,Westvleteren 12,Both the aroma and the taste develop in a fantastic way. Every sip is different from the sip before and new taste and aroma notes arise constantly. The palate is extremely satisfying and pleasant. This is smooth and very tasty.,4.5
5094,Westvleteren 12,"the power of the alcohol almost overdoes it.....almost. has a vintage port quality to it. perhaps cellaring could be an option? creamy head, complexity is too great to explain. A true belgian strong ale, but I would have to say the chimay bleu is still my favourite. thanks to tom jones for the opportunity to taste one of the world's finest",4.5
5095,Westvleteren 12,"Dark reddish, frothy brown head, and a fruity aroma which is hard to pin down. Palate is smooth and creamy, and each sip is different from the last. Has an alcohol aftertaste which is by no means overwhelming. Defintitely a great beer, but I probably wouldn't drop 10 bucks on another bottle. Re-Rate6/24/02 Well, I dropped another 10 bucks on a bottle, and I am glad I did. My impression is almost exactly the same as it was last time, except I think I appreciate it a little more now. The aroma is the best I've ever smelled, and its appearance is so elegant. It is definitely one of the most interesting and complex brews out there. Very creamy, thick texture, with a slight bitter, alcohol finish that has great length. A top notch beer, but still not a top ten for me.",4.0
5096,Westvleteren 12,"Well, hard to believe I have the opportunity to rate what is arguably the finest beer in the world. Again, thanks to austinpowers. Same beautiful color as the Westy 8. Quite a bit sweeter than the 8. I taste raisins and figs. It does have a cognac quality to it making it a beer I can sip and savor although I have a hard time sipping and savoring anything. An exceptionally high quality beer although my personal preference would have to be the 8.",4.8

I've seen the Notre Dame in Paris, David in Florence, and the Roman Ruins but nothing convinces me more of the power of man to create art more than this beer.

5099,Westvleteren 12,"One of the best beers of my life. Although I originally had this at the little cafe across from the Abbey, I most recently tried this beer two weeks ago in a bar in Brussels. The bartender treated it as a religous thing, honoring me by letting me have a beer, not letting me pay for it (said he would not put it on the menu) and told me that people were not supposed to sell it by decree by the monks. I do love this beer, although I have had bottles from 3 different times and one of them the beer was horrible. I have been told it is best to age it three years, (by this bartender) and I have to admit this bottle was better then I remember from the abbey. It still has just a hint of an alchoholic aftertaste so I can not give it a 5 on palate. However, I would reccommend getting this if you have the chance. Most people are not aware of this, but those of you who are desperate for a taste of what is proably the consistenly one of the best beers in the world, you can order it (highly inflated price though) at www.belgianshop.com.",4.6
5100,Westvleteren 12,"Deeply aromatic and arousing, like a fine port or cgnac. Creamy and fruity with burnt alcohol notes. Smooth exquisite palate shows sweet creamy flavor, a fruitiness of maraschino cherries and cassis, hints of chocolate and woody tones. Cognac like alcohol finish just dries over the palate a little, but sweet creaminess returns and lingers long. Outstanding. Thanks to Davhgbrew for this one.",4.9

So many flavors in this beer but the ones that stood out were a fruitiness like currants, the dried kind I put in my granola, and something like the cashew brittle I love so much, made in the candy shops of Eagle River, Wisconsin.  Quite the lovely, exotic, extravagant brew!",4.5
5103,Westvleteren 12,"Prelude: A pair of Westys, gifted to us by the inestimable PsychProf, a fine summer evening, our balcony, and Carolyn's wonderful eggplant pasta in our bellies.  Could it be any better?

Appearance: Well, ""murky"" has been used by a bunch of you guys, but it might not go far enough.  This brew is loaded with heavy sedimant, to the point that it resembles a pond brimming with organic organisms - this thing looks ALIVE.  One thing I will say is that the delicate white bubbles holding the edges of the glass last through the entire drinking experience - the thing might look like a swamp creature, but the gentle effervescence lets you know it's a quality brew.

Aroma: I've already raved myself into nonsense about one aroma - Old Horizontal's - this one is similar - a pungency that draws you into inhale after inhale.  Depth. Power. Grace.  Warm honeyed and gingered biscuits steaming on a plate ...

Flavor:  This is a radical adventure.  I swear that I got something different on every sip - the  chronicle begins with spices and nuts, moves definitely into big red grapes, hits bitter chocolate and maple sugar, and moves finally into breadier flavors as you hit more of the sediment at the bottom.  

Palate:  Seems much smoother and fresher than the 8 and despite the sweetness of the taste, never gets syrupy.

Overall: Is this the best beer in the world?  Well, it definitely is the best Belgian I've ever had, one that is able to excite my sensibilities like the balrywines, old ales, imperial stouts that I tend to like better than belgians.  A brilliantly done beer to be sure.",4.6
5104,Westvleteren 12,"Not as amazing as the hype would have me believe.  The Extra 8 is definitely superior.  It has a slight note of Dimetapp, but is still very tasty.",4.2
5105,Westvleteren 12,"Vintage bottle sampled.
Redbrown beer. Quite faint aroma with gingerbread and some chocolate. The flavor is sweet chocolate and fudge tones. It is peppery and spicy in the finish and a sharpness that lingers on.
In a fresh bottle the aroma is alcoholic and malty with tones of licorice and fruit.
The flavour is alcoholic with tones of licorice, chocolate and mints. The palate is soft as velvet and it has an alcoholic and minty finish. It is truly a great beer but the Rochefort 10 still give me more.",4.0
5106,Westvleteren 12,"Chosen for No. 100. I spent the first few minutes just trying to smell everything there is to smell; caramel, plum, berry, vanilla, chocolate. Then the first sip, and I am not an experienced Belgian drinker by any means, but it had more body than I have come to expect from reading and a half dozen samplings of other Belgian ales. It is quite thick (full-bodied, I mean!), and at the very tail end of a super long finish there is a pepperiness that is unbelievable. The finish of this beer is like the final, 42 second piano chord of the Beatles’ ’A Day in the Life’...it gets only slightly less intense, but changes over time. Beautiful.",4.3
5107,Westvleteren 12,"Might be a little over rated due to it being hard to find. Still, it's one of the worlds great beers. Tastes much like Dogfish Heads Raison D'Etre. Overall I like the Westvleteren 8 just a tad more.",4.4
5108,Westvleteren 12,"(10/13/05, bottled 5/22/02) Given the greater experience and context I have gained since joining RB, it definitely is time to revisit the true king of beers.  Small off-white head dissipates fairly quickly (no doubt due to the age of the beer), giving way to an opaque dark brown-red body.  Aroma is medium sweet, raisin/prune, vinous, cookie dough, some cherry, light oak, orange.  The flavors are bursting at the seams -- moderately sweet, cookie, raisin, floral, cherry, some orange, chocolate, molasses, herbal, faint vinous.  The alcohol is nearly invisible.  Smooth, even creamy, medium-full body. It will be a very sad day should I no longer be able to obtain this masterpiece. (8/4/10/5/19)

There's some carbonation, but it hardly has any head; some solids drop into the glass too. Still pretty solid, almost no signs of oxidation, good malt, maybe a bit thinner than I remembered, but beers nowadays are so different anyway.

2023-09-01, bb 23.03.04, vintage 2001, 22 years old, 10.8% ABV, 7-5-8-4-16=40
Reasonably malty, balanced, moderately sweet, with barely any trace of oxidation. Still carbonated. Excellent. 


2017-12-22, bottle from Beer Planet, Brussels, bb 15.12.13, 7 years old, 7-4-8-4-16=39
Mature brown color, clean, with fizzy head, short lived. The arom abrings notes of malt, caramel, chestnut, and evident but not disturbing signs of oxidization. The first sip is relatively dry, with flavor of chestnut honey, and evident alcohol; the booze mellows out as the glass gets warmer, leaving some room for deeper malt flavors, still on the thin side.
Old but still excellent.

2016-07-22, bb 23.03.04, 15 years old, 7-5-8-4-16=40
probably purchased at the abbey in 2001
Mild aroma, robust body; dark malts and some caramel, with limited residual sweetness; the nuttiness in the final makes up a bit for the missing bitterness.
Good beer; less signs of oxidisation, more balance and more enjoyable than an equally old Rochefort 10 that I had a few days ago.

2015-03-03, Westvleteren XII, bb 05.10.14, 7-3-7-3-14=34
While pouring, the head is very fizzy, frothy; and it doesn't last, leaving a naked brown liquid in the glass. Mild aroma of malt, a bit oxidised, a bit of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Lean body, thinner than other vintages; dark caramel flavor, some malt, light oxidisation, some roasted nuts. Warming alcohol.
A good Belgian beer, not the one that you would expect though.

2013-03-08, bb 23.03.04, 12 years old, 8-5-9-4-17=43
probably purchased at the abbey in 2001
The bottle is slowly gushing; hazy brown color, with thin but persistent head. Strong malt aroma, with hint of caramel and chocolate. Rich malt flavor, with still a favorable body structure, and medium sweetness; the age doesn't really translate into signs of oxidization, but there are some roasted nuts; correct bitterness, and comforting alcohol warmth.
Mature, elegant, harmonious.

2012-06-09, Westvleteren XII, bottle at Pibar, Lausanne, bb 05.10.14, possibly just 8 months old, 7-5-7-3-14=36
Cloudy brown, generous head, lovely lace. The caramel and gently roasted malts aroma is harmonious; it's sweet and malty, simpler than Rochefort (having a 3yo of it side-to-side), but with some honey too. Malt and caramel flavor, with some roasted malt, a bit too much alcohol perception, impression of vegetables and herbs, correct bitterness.
Good, but very young, immature, requiring at least a serious breathing in the glass.

2011-01-28, bb 23.03.04, possibly vintage 2001, 10 years old, 8-5-10-4-18=45
Dark chestnut color, edging to black, with a thin creamy cap. The aroma has caramel and light roasted malts; sweet and with a shade of oxidisation; similar to the Westvleteren Extra 8 same vintage tasted side to side, but deeper. Good body strength, smooth mouthfeel; strong malt flavor, still very sweet, with caramel, milk chocolate. No signs of age, no signs of alcohol; the bitterness is obviously low; there is caramel and sweet nuts in the end. This beer is convincing for the malt profile and the velvety feeling.

2002-05-14, 9-5-10-5-19=48
Ruby-amber ale; wonderful thick head., Strong malt and hop aroma. Full body, some residual sweetness, strong malt, caramel, light liquorice, low alcohol in the mouth, warming, smooth, well balanced.

I recall the 2001 bottling being much better, but I may have been a callow taster then, unfit to criticize such a highly rated ale. This bottle has some fruitiness in the nose, with some grains, with a mild sourness. The body is fairly thin, with a sweet and sour grainy flavor. It lacks the rich chocolate and notable spice that the earlier bottling featured (although that may have been my imagination, given the super high rating on this site). It is, in fact, rather watery with a distinct alcohol note, with light amounts of chocolate; hardly inspiring. The earlier five bottles from this vintage were similarly unimpressive. I don’t really even want to finish this, but it was very expensive so I’ll try. There’s a lot of black crap sitting at the bottom of my snifter, which makes this even less appealing.",3.0
5121,Westvleteren 12,"#500-Deep muddy brown color; Head was frothy pale tan; Aroma was full of surprises including Worschestire sauce and plums. Smooth on the tongue with a shocking hint of licorice at the first sip- I HATE licorice. The alocohol is only moderately present, but not hidden. Some chocolate. I am surprised by the thinness of the 1st few sips- this was one of the categories in which it did not get a full mark from me. Baileys? I appreciate the alcohol coming through at the 1/2 mark: a beer like this should show its strength at some point and it it shines through nicely. The licorice is mercifully gone. The bottle was for sure too small. After drinking this beer, I really wanted to re-evaluate my highest rankings and I have to say that for the most part, I have no problem with all of the rankings that I have given my top 15 or so. Is Chimay Blue really better then this beer? At this point I would say yes, because I have had samples that were truly remarkable. Likewise, the Fullers 1999- a truly orgasmic experience for me.

Now about the taste, I honestly don't think my palate is refined enough to describe accurately what is going on here. This will be one I have to try again around beer #250 I think. There is a trail mix aroma, and the flavor is hard to pin down. If they captured this flavor in a cereal I would get up earlier every day, hints of berries, grain, nuts, chocolate.

5131,Westvleteren 12,"I got this and a Rochefort 10 as a late Christmas gift with my brother in exchange for some Macanudo Hampton Court stogies.  What a trade!  Okay, onto the description of ""the beer"".  First off, it didn't have nearly as much head as in the picture.  The coloration was a cloudy reddish-brown with maybe vague hints of green (jeez, look at me, I'm describing ""hints"" in the freaking color).  Much like Rochefort 10, I wasn't sure what to think of it when I had my first sip; I was trying to balance the psychology of drinking something so hyped by this web site and so looked forward to with the general experience of a great beer.  The smell was very nice, fruity, chocolate, sweet.  The flavor is quite complex, with the most distinctive taste being chocolate.  I loved this stuff!  Malty finish, kind of stays on your tongue for a little while.  Well balanced, just plain great.",4.4
5132,Westvleteren 12,"Looks and smells very burgundy-like:  deep red/purple, and deep grapiness in the nose, along with many of the elements one finds in the ""8"":  dried fruits, bananas, a hint of candy.  Flavor competes well with, even surpasses the ""8"":  incredibly rich and smooth, chocolaty and plummy, caramel and bananas, so much going on that its useless to try to get it all on the basis of one bottle.  Mouthfeel is, along with Rauchbier Urbock, the best in the world; if the nose were just a tiny bit more ""potent"" this could be my new favorite; as it is, will have to settle for ""top 5.""  This is the last of the beers I'm sampling from my first Belgianshop order, and I must tell everyone who lives in out-of-the-way places like I do that they are well worth it!  This worked out to about $6.50 a bottle and I'd pay double that if I had to.  Incredible.",4.9
5133,Westvleteren 12,"The only beer I have had so far which does not have a label on the bottle. Curious.

The beer has a dark, ruby color. Amazingly complex palate - caramel, malty, nutty, raisin-like taste. I did not notice the 11% alcohol. It has a very full creamy body.

The aftertaste is the best beer experience I have ever had, it stays and gives your tongue and cheeks a heavenly massage. I don't believe there can be a beer that is better than this.",5.0
5134,Westvleteren 12,"Having tried several thousand beers, if I'm hard pressed to come up with one single favourite this is usually the one. Every time I try it there are new fascinating flavours. It has a deep burgundy colour. A fruity complex aroma with a hint of raspberries. It is very malty, and as the beers warms to room temperature the flavours explode. Toffee, fruit, licorice, yoiu name them. The mouthfeel is soft and vinuous, and the finish is salty with well balanced bitterness.",4.9
5135,Westvleteren 12,A true beer. The flavour is too complex to describe in one post. A beer that deserves further investigation though. A superb aroma and delightful palate almost bely its high alcohol content. Close to perfect. Not for heavy consumptiom though. 2 is enough!,4.6
5136,Westvleteren 12,"An incredibly complex beer. Starts with a strong combination of flavors--chocolate at first, then evolves into ripe fruit/ banana flavor and raisin-nut. The most amazing thing about this beer is how smooth it is. At 10.8% abv, I don't detect even the slightest bit of alcohol flavor in the aftertaste. Truly amazing. I am hard pressed to find anything wrong with this beer. Maybe the finish could be a little longer, but that is still stretching it. Almost perfect, if there is such a thing.",5.0
5137,Westvleteren 12,"Huge head that kept well throughout, very dark brown color, malty flavor, nice aroma, lots of complex flavors, very excellent beer, nothing much more than I can say other than what has already been put out there, one of the best in the world hands down!!!",4.8
5138,Westvleteren 12,"Again, from my view, overly frothy, the foam spills out of the bottle despite a 55 degree temperature, an almost perfectly dark amber brown appearance, a wonderful aroma, and an almost perfect complexity of lightly sweet malt flavor with indescribable flavors, perhaps caramel, nuts, and smoke, with a touch of fruit, very smooth, with a finish that beer drinkers can only dream about, but here it is, in my view, better than the Extra #8, and while superb, I still prefer the flavor of the Westmalle Dubbel",4.8
5139,Westvleteren 12,I had read about this beer prior to purchasing and it was worth all the hype.  Superb in every possible way even with the high price.  Maybe my favorite beer of all time.,5.0
5140,Westvleteren 12,"Consumed with the hype, I plunked down almost $10 a piece for 3 of these babies and man was it worth every penny. Complex, soothing, robust and delicious, I kept wondering how such a delicious ale had an alcohol content of almost 11%. A truly wonderful beer, well worth the price of admission.",4.8
5141,Westvleteren 12,"What could be better? Frothy head, beautiful complex flavor. The high alcohol content is well concealed.",4.9
5142,Westvleteren 12,"Very nice aroma with a perfect head.  Complex flavor, just sweet enough to conceal the high alcohol content.  This is the standard for belgian strong ales.",4.7
5143,Westvleteren 12,"at first did not know what to think, but aftefr a few sips i realized this is a pretty unbelievable beer with a liquor taste, only with a beer taste on top of it.  After taste is pretty good, and I'm pretty buzzed off one.  I can definitely see why this is the top rated beer on this website",4.2
5144,Westvleteren 12,"Fresh, yeasty, fruity nose. Soft and smooth texture, like liquid mercury. Stong and warming. Spicy. A huge ball of flavor sat in the back of my throat. Very well-balanced and very intense. Wonderful beer. RERATE: On a recent trip to Belgium (Jan. 2013) I looked forward to revisiting this beer -- to see if it stood up to the hype. My conclusion: While it may not be the very best beer I have ever tasted, it’s definitely toward the top. There’s something about it ... it has amazing depth and complexity, but it doesn’t smack you in the face with boldness. It’s like a bunch of moderately bold flavors and aromas all hitting your olfactories at the same time, and they refuse to fade. Notes: Frothy, rocky, tightly packed, lasting head with sticky, intricate lace. Rich, vibrant, complex nose (tobacco, toast, roast). Myriad flavors -- vanilla, wood, brown sugar, fresh bread, banana, bubblegum, ... and on and on. Complex and full flavored, yet it has true finesse. Makes my tongue sing.",4.8
5145,Westvleteren 12,"My favorite beer of all time.  Extremely difficult to find outside of Belgium.  The first time I tasted it, I understood why the monks call it ""The Bread of Life"".  Could easily sustain a person while fasting for whatever period of time, plus with the alcohol content, you'd sleep through most anything!  This beer represents, in my opinion, what a Trappist strong ale should be.  High alcohol content is masked by an incredible malt taste with just the right amount of hopping to balance the sweetness.  A rare find, which makes the price tag worth it.",5.0
5146,Westvleteren 12,"I finally enjoyed one... What an intersting beer;  to many smells to recognize; sensory overload in a good way! Molasses, maple syrup and spice at first, then minty, then fruity.  Every sip tasted  and smelled different,  the head lasted forever as i savored this beer over about 30 minutes, letting it warm up to about 60 degrees before finishing it.  The alcohol is nicely hidden.  Not too heavy and as clear as a dark amber could be. This has to be the most intersting and peculiar beer I've ever tried.  It's going to be tough saving my other bottle for too long...",5.0
5147,Westvleteren 12,"Absolutely the best Trappist beer, very sweet aroma, long aftertaste, creamy foam",5.0
5148,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a cloudy deep brown with a small off white head and big carbonation. Aroma is very sweet with some nice nutty notes and plenty of dark fruit.  The flavor is nicely sweet, the carbonation really brings a lot of the flavor out of the malt. Very dry almost immediately after it hits the toungue. Medium to large bodied, silky smooth texture.",4.6
5149,Westvleteren 12,"Unbelievable.  It will take me a little while to process the joy I feel at partaking of this fine beverage, but I promise I'll write about it when I return to Earth.",4.9
5150,Westvleteren 12,"All I can say is ""WOW""......................................................",4.9
5151,Westvleteren 12,"I am not an experienced beer drinker by any means. The good beers I have had have been limited to the imports I find at my local grocery store, mainly the Spaten Optimator and Franziskaner HefeWeisse. I read through most of the reviews here, and decided I had to try this beer. I looked in the yellow pages under beer and found only one store. Lucky for me it was close and carried ""the beer"". $11 is a lot for a beer, I don’t know if any beer can be worth that much money, so perhaps that is its only drawback(although considering it lowers the demand, it’s a plus). The casheir warned me that this beer had a very alcoholic taste and suggested I try the Rochefort (10). Thus he planted a seed of doubt in my mind, but that did not deter me. I can’t add to what’s already been said here, only confirm it. I brought the Bottle home (from Beer Shack for those of you in Tampa) and read some of the reviews here(again) to prepare myself for the experience. Then w/o delay I poured it, still not knowing what to expect! It poured with a surprisingly light and abundant head, definitely not like any other head I’ve seen. I took a sniff, to read these reviews is one thing to experience it is something else! It’s wonderful! To complex to describe here. I’ll stop at this point because anything I would say has already been said!",4.7
5152,Westvleteren 12,"The opposite of Deüvel. Chocolate, nuts, cherries. It's like a Whitman's sampler in a bottle.  Heavy, everything but the creamy center. It's not beer, it's candy! Give some to the one you love this Valentine's day. And also, I'm a bald-headed non smoker. Sure I can't pronounce it, but If the beer store has it, bring it on! Also, I'm guessing that the name is in Waloon, the official language of Belgium. And I have had this stuff IN BELGIUM! So back off Snugglemittens!",4.3
5153,Westvleteren 12,"A very smooth drinkable beer for the strength. The aroma and flavor do not overpower you. This is one beer, if you can find enough of them, that could waste you before you know it. A heavenly way for sure.",4.5
5154,Westvleteren 12,"Almost as good as touted and how rare is that!! Expensive for sure (I paid almost $9 for the bottle), but you must get your hands one of these. The 10.8% alcohol content is barely noticable, very very smooth with complicated flavor palate, little to no carbonation, malty, virtually no hop presence whatsoever, fruity.",4.7
5155,Westvleteren 12,"Not as fruity as Rochefort 10. Alcohol comes through as subtle. Tremendous complexity. This is what beer is meant to be like! Soft, malty expression is very satisfying. Liquid silk. A classic!",4.8
5156,Westvleteren 12,"This beer is in a class of it's own.  You really have to get it at cellar tempature to experience the rich flavors of carmel, berries, chocolate, without the alcohol aroma getting in the way. Excellent!",4.8
5157,Westvleteren 12,"Much more refined than the 8 IMHO.  Many of the same flavors (plus many more), but they blend together much better in this brew.  Very smooth chocolate, malt, yeast, fruits, hops and other things throughout the very full flavor profile.  Alcohol is totally hidden.  Just a touch of sourness and some hop astringency in the finish.  Beautiful deep copper to brown color with an amazing off-white head.  So complex I'll have to drink it again to fully understand everything going on in here. Well worth the effort it takes to find this.",4.3
5158,Westvleteren 12,"Wow, what a treat.  After tasting, a $175.00 per case does not seem that extreme.  The flavor is so much better at cellar tempature, keep this prize out of the fridge.  The carmel and chocolate notes are quite abundant, but no flavor overtakes the other.  At 10.8% you do not even notice any powerful alcohol aroma or flavor.  This is just the finest smoothest you will find.  P.S. if you see this, dont buy it, (It will leave more for me)",4.7
5159,Westvleteren 12,"One of the best.
I would advise to taste this beer.  I've once been near to the abbey, and it was love at first sight.
The power of this beers is enormous, the balance is wonderfull.  It tastes almost perfect.
You know why monks make beer on earth?  In heavan they don't have beer...(Once said by a monk of this abbey.",4.4
5160,Westvleteren 12,"Re-rate. Clear Copper.(except for when you pour the rest of the bottle...yeast floaties) Pretty nice head. Amazing aroma...grainy, nutty and fruity..like a nutrigran bar and reminicent of a berry flavored wine. Palate is too much for me to describe but i will give it a shot. Chewy maltiness, toasted grains, plums, berries, nuts, bitter chocolate, pear,sugary sweetness, yeast, bread and others things that I catch and I know the taste but it comes and goes soo quickly, its difficult to discern, almost like having the answer at the tip of your tounge but not quite able to retrieve it. Awesome body, semi bubbly and lively mouthfeel, very lush. The smoothness,class and depth of character this beer posesses is uncanny.  Alcohol is almost unnoticeable except it shows itself in the dry/sweet finish. (I feel the alcohol is far more noticeable in Rochefort 10)  Superb balance and brewing. A must try and definitley top of the line and well deserving of top rated beer of this sight.",4.9
5161,Westvleteren 12,The best trappist ale!......................................................,4.7
5162,Westvleteren 12,"one of the most interesting trappist beers, taste the differences when it's aging!",4.6
5163,Westvleteren 12,"""In de vrede"", the Westvleteren café, I tasted this next to the ""blond"" beer.
Eggshell brown head of foam topping the dark brown colored, very opaque brew.  Fine bubbles.
Young fruity excellent aroma, fine and elegant, this (like the blond!) is a very young white winelike nose.
Fine foam in the mouth, leading to very intense but balanced tastes, licorice, great chewable body with complexity.
It's an absolutely excellent world class beer (yet I prefer the freshness of the blond!)",4.6
5164,Westvleteren 12,"Bottled, 2 years old: Chocolate cake adn cinnamon aroma. Reddish brown color, beige head, good lace. Unbelievable amount of malts, soft bitterness but more bitter in the finish. Thick and warming. No complexity, just power. Bottled, Nov. 2001, 4.4: A wonderful complex aroma with fruits, hops, nuts and yeast. Dark brown colour with beautiful firm head. Very full, spicy and thick like syrup. Sweet as well. Heavy due to the alcohol but no alcohol bitterness. Long lasting finish.",4.4
5165,Westvleteren 12,............................................................................,4.5
5166,Westvleteren 12,"Definitely has the long foam, color - appearance perfected. Sour and yeasty nose that turns a corner to a roasty, malty, sweet and fruity flavor with pears and carmel. Superb!",3.8
5167,Westvleteren 12,"What's great about this beer is how something different is experienced with every taste.  Huge aroma of grapes, dark fruit, sometimes toast with jam.  Taste is nicely balance between sweet and a little bitterness.  Spicy, perfect carbo.  Reddish brown cloudy color. Defenitely a great beer.",4.6
5168,Westvleteren 12,"It has a cloudy brown colour with a creamy head. Aroma of hazelnut, nut and chestnut. Full-bodied and very complex. Very long aftertaste with a nice bitterness - fantastic !",4.7
5169,Westvleteren 12,"Malty, chocolatey, winey, spicy flavor.  Well balanced, not as sweet as Chimay G.R., not as hoppy as Orval.",4.7

5173,Westvleteren 12,"Carlsberg is saying that they PROBABLY have the best beer in the world

No beer has such a rich palate and good flavor. Raisins, Fondant and a touch of oak. MMMMMMmmmmmmm",4.8
5174,Westvleteren 12,"Bitter chocolate, alcohol, and raisins all hit the mouth right away.  Finishing heavily yeasty and dry, yet quite supple with a plump bed of bready grains and candied plums. Pretty stellar.",4.3
5175,Westvleteren 12,"The most magnificent beer on the earth. It is costly. But it is well worth the price. This beer contains so many positive characteristics.  If you are lucky enough to find this decadent liquid, buy all of it that you can! It is supernatural.",5.0

5177,Westvleteren 12,"This one is absolutly my favorite beer! Far better than the Rochefort 10. Too bad that the monestary is not massproducing this beer, but then, it's part of the magic I guess. If you're gonna get drunk, do it with style. Do it the Westvleteren way!",5.0

5179,Westvleteren 12,"One of my favorite beers, this Trappist brew has a very complex flavor.  Hints of fruits/rasins are to be found throughout.  For such a high abv, the alcohol taste is eerily nowhere to be found.",4.7
5180,Westvleteren 12,............................................................................,4.8
5181,Westvleteren 12,"Superb. Magnificent copper/brown colour. Frothy head, and a fruity/grainy? aroma, much like an oatmeal raisin cookie, or a Nutragrain bar. The oaty fruity taste is a bit malty, with raspberries and grapes pervading. A bit sugary, and the subtlty of alcohol taste is astounding (for a beer with 10.8%abv). To put it plainly ""desert in a glass"".",4.6
5182,Westvleteren 12,"It is almost sacrilegious to call this beer. It transcends the category, with its deliciously enticing fruity-wine aroma and magnificent, malty raspberry/plum taste. Strong yet delicate, imagine biting into a perfectly ripe pear to get an idea of the texture and  heartiness exhibited by ""12"".  With such a high alcohol content, one would expect an overwhelming alcohol flavor, but it was masked as well as any ""beer"" I've had. With its rich, delectable taste, beautiful dark color, frothy head, and luscious aroma, this IS the perfect ""beer.""  An orgiastic feast for the senses.",5.0

5184,Westvleteren 12,"My personal choice for best beer in the world.  Hugely flavorful, particularly a nutty, malty, burnt fruit flavor that is married perfectly to a soft but full body.  The taste lingers in your mouth for a many minutes after you take a sip.  Elegant, sophisticated, powerful, and down-right awesome.  The true king of beers.",5.0
5185,Westvleteren 12,"This is it. Beer in heaven or any after life shuld taste liker this. It is everything I want from a glass. The texture is as unique as the flavor. Pay whatever, but drink one, you cannot be sorry. You can get one at The Map Room in Chicago, too.",5.0

5188,Westvleteren 12,"Usually I prefer the smaller beers from within each Trappist brewery.  Not in this case - the 12 has everything the 8 has and more.  The alcohol presence is very welcome here, and carries the complex malt profile (dark fruit, spicy yeast flavors, a little tanginess) into the palate.  Nearly identical in appearance to the 8.  Deeply satisfying.",4.8
5189,Westvleteren 12,"What can I say, the absolute best Trappist product I've tried, and I've tried six so far.  This beer is incredible, only wish I could have more.  Unfortunately, cost too much to consume in large quantities.  I feel I can still taste this beer.  I recommend it to anyone who can get ahold of one.",5.0
5190,Westvleteren 12,"Chestnut brown.  Aroma shows alcohol, wood, hint of smoke.  Flavour notes highlight raisin bread, allspice,  deep fruitiness (apricot), demerara.  Long, sweet, silky malts in the finish, with dates and light bready notes.  Ultra smooth.",4.4
5191,Westvleteren 12,"2001 vintage, sampled 03/2004 - dark brown colour with a fine head, very complex aroma: bread, raisins and black chocolate, impressive malty palate, deep balance between sweetness and bitterness, slightly oily, the finish is moderately dry showing candy sugar, plums, gingerbread and a long warming alcohol touch - my deep consideration goes to the monks who are brewing this wonder and who make me think for a moment that I'm living in paradise",4.8
