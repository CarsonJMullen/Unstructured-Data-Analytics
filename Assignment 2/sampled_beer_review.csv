8816,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,Wow holy shit.....greatest nose of a sour I have ever smelled..super funk and balance...taste is the same....hot damn!,4.8
8864,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Blind tasting: Amber gold. Ornate tiny-bubbled white head is rocky and extremely persistent. Mesmerizing nose of peaches and lactobacillus. Equally proportionate hints of clay, iron, horseblanket and musty minerals and oak. Vigorous swirls unveil an astonishingly lustrous fruitiness as well as some band-aid phenols. Fine carbonation massages the palate. Slickly bodied. Tongue-buckling acidity slowly yields to an explosively juicy, flavorsome and bright peach-fuzz acidity. Unbelievably polished from the get-go. Harsh phenols take a backseat to the supple fruitiness. Oak is clean and artfully restrained, allowing the dizzying array of nuances to fully bloom.  Oak tugs on the palate and dries things out, beautifully contrasting with the fruity esters which coat and gently embrace the tongue. Fusion of oak and hay-like malt is in perfect harmony as are the seamlessly interwoven slick fruitiness and cleansing dryness. Finishes with a gorgeous flash of acetic acid which is adorned with clean oak and bouncy notes of nutty and hay-like malt. World-class stuff all the way. Easily one of the most well-rounded and extravagant beers I’ve ever experienced. Thanks for sharing, cquiroga!",4.6
8606,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle shared at Leighton’s. A group share effort. Pours hazy orange with head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a little musty, sour funk. Taste is green apple, sour funk, a little gooseberry. Really nice and mellow. Great stuff.",4.2
8775,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"From notes. Hazy yellow/gold, small white head. Intense gueuze- barn funk, citrus like acids, more mild acetic notes, earth, subtle menthol, plenty of tartness. Medium body, sparkling, very dry. Awesome lambic.",4.5
8661,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,had this bottle at mikkeller bar. well we didn’t finish it there we finished it at KFC (kind of a good paring :D) it’s a must have if you haven’t had it and like geuze!,4.9
8938,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Light hazy orange-yellow beer with copperish shine and with a good airy head. Nice aroma’s of rasped Renette apples with touches of Greek yoghurt, nutmeg, humide tobbacco leaf, fresh rubarbe, wet wood, led pipe, horseblanket and hints of lemon and grapefruit zest. Taste is dry and has a nice dosis of tannins who are accentuated by the high accidity of the beer. The mouthfeel is rich but dry, it has nice complex fruity touches of green prunes, peaches, Granny Smith apples some cinnamon-stick and cigare-box. The afthertaste is dry and ends with a fine bitterish touch of Vin Jaune,  hops and and grape-pits. A very complex Gueuze with a gastronomical avantage. At the Ambiance Magazine Gueuze tasting (De Heeren van Liedekercke) Denderleeuw.",4.4
8707,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"This is a cracker, waited a long time to try it. Full of biscuit and funk and is a surprisingly easy drinker. The beer is very complex and improves when let to breath for a while. Superb.",4.5
8627,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Aroma is really nice with great herbal and earthy notes. Moderate barnyard funk with medium light tropical and some fruit. Moderate citrus and light oak. 
Pours a cloudy copper orange with a faint, forced, thin, rocky head. 
Flavor has fairly strong acidity. Rather herbal, earthy character. Faint tropical fruit and citrus notes. Light stone fruit character. Light oak with really nice barnyard notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer with great barnyard funk and nice fruit notes. Bottle could have used more carbonation though to make this beer really pop.",4.6
8660,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"And this is what Sean finished the tasting with. Had this back to back with the Roze. 750 ml bottle served in a Portsmouth tulip.

A: Much darker amber color than the Roze. A nice frothy white head forms on the pour and slowly recedes to a thick collar and thin cap. Splotchy lace is left behind.

S: Sour raspberry, tart cherries and some oak. Light sweetness and mild funk as well. blends really nicely together.

T: Dark sour cherry with a nice pucker. Almost like a warhead candy with out the artificial sugar flavors. Tart raspberry, vanilla sweetness, some woody oak and nice funky cheese on the finish.

M: Light bodied with a crisp, drying mouthfeel. The sourness gets in there gives you a nice pucker. A real jowl hitter.

O: I enjoyed this just a tad more than the Roze as it had more a sour kick to it. The Roze was more vibrant, but this beer went deeper in flavor. Huge thanks again to Sean (Sean9689) for sharing this rarity!!

8866,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"C-bus 10, compliments of henrikb.  Lightly sour aroma, slightly earthy.  Simple but elegant aroma.  Murky golden brown color with a large head.  Perfect carbonation on this--which I love.  Medium sourness in the flavor--which surprised me a bit at first.  Citrus flavors for sure with a funky mix and definite yeast component.  Didn’t get the peppery, dryness that I detected in the Roze--which made this one more enjoyable and smoother.",4.2

Aroma is delicate funk, a little oak, some wood, and a variety of gentle, well blended barnyard, funky love.  Flavor does more to up the ante, with more delicate and gentle blending of funk, wood, fruit, and just a hint of acid.  Wow, this is so gentle, delicate, nuanced and well blended it’s scary.  I found myself wishing I had gallons of this stuff.  Thanks a bunch David, you rock!",4.5

The aroma was horse blanket, lemon, citrus, must, and a nice funk.  flavor was lemon, grapefruit, musty, earthy, sour, brett, and just a huge array of flavors.

Aroma was divine with fragrant concord grape, balsamic, lemon zest, earthy, funky, leafy.  Flavor is quite pungent and shows lots of horseblanket, Jolly Rancher, tart vinegar, and just a hint of wood.  Kind of shows a little blue cheese, moldy bread, and tons of citric acid.  Lingers on the palate.  So glad I had an opportunity to try this!!!",4.3

Beautiful aroma. A little funky, a little dusty, and very citrusy. Taste is tart initially, and highly citrusy--particularly grapefruit. Outstanding. Very dry finish, good mouthfeel, sour citrus finish. Not as funky as some gueuzes that I have tried, as the citrus tends to be more dominant, but it really works for it. This is the best gueuze that I have ever tried and one of the best beers overall...if only it was still being made and widely available.",4.7
8922,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"750ml bottle thanks to mds. Whoa. Massive funkiness in this one, especially compared to the Roze. Aroma is stinky as hell and it’s a beautiful thing. Very cheesy, stinky basement, barnyard, some citrus, and a nice dose of brett. Quite sour, but it doesn’t seem to come across as overbearing because of how funky it is. It’s balanced in that strange way. Nice puckering mouthfeel, moderate to high acidity, very dry, and relatively soft carbonation. Wow.",4.7

8649,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"750mL bottle at Akkurat, pours a hazy golden orange with a medium white head. Nose has incredible barnyard funk...wow...with horse blanket, and more funk - holy shit this is complex. Flavour brings out leather, barnyard funk, horse blanket, and some dry citrus notes. Tremendously complex and funky. Feels a little tired, as though this has peaked a year or two ago, but the complexity is wonderful and the drink ability is extremely high. A world class brew.",4.3

Amazing, funky, cheesy, tangy, a touch spicy, lemn citrusy aroma. Fairly tart lemon citrusy, moderately cheesy, fairly sour, vanilla, light woody, somewhat musty, earthy flavor.

8885,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,Poured a hazy amber color with an off-white head.  Dry leather aroma.  Nice tartness.  Citrusy malt.  The flavor was light and had less funk.  Some good leather though.,4.0
8786,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"[Bottle] shared with tytoanderso with a HUGE thanks to yespr! Pours a hazy gold with a massive khaki head. Aroma has tons of barnyard and brett, loads of lactic acid, as it warms, tons of bitter grapefruit peel come forward. Really a rich and full aroma with a surprising amount of sweetness still evident. Flavor is quite tart and sour, but not nearly the most sour I’ve had. Somehow the beer manages to be dry and sweet at the same time. The flavor has lots of bitter grapefruit peel, various citric fruit rinds, funk, and lots of other citric juciness. Full mouthfeel and surprisingly smooth and creamy. The yeast pour doesn’t change the beer a whole lot other than to add a little more citrus to the nose and a little more creaminess to the mouthfeel. Very nice beer and I’m happy to be able to check this white whale off my list. Thanks again yespr!",4.3
8868,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"2007 PP SAF Bottle brought by JohnC, many thanks! : Cloudy golden hue with a fluffy head and spotty lace. The aroma is wonderfully funky and herbal with sour apple and tangerine esters, catty and oaky vapours as well. The taste displays tart fruit, chewy yeast, earthy herbal pungent notes with woody and light spice finish. The mouth feel is sprite, lively and quite refreshing with a dry finish. A ROCKING BREW that is not overpowering like some other guezes. Surprisingly ""balanced"" and even Tomme dug it! Thanks again John!!",4.3
8747,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle shared with the wife on August 12 2010 at De Heeren van Liedekerke.



A: Inviting golden, pale-amber colored body with was capped by a beautiful craggy off-white head. Lasted for quite sometime and left a healthy dose of soap-like lace.



S: The only thing that outdoes the lemon-lactic citric nature of this beer is the massive musty, oak funk that permeates the immediate area surrounding the freshly opened bottle. Certainly inviting to any gueuze-head.



T: Magnificent. A well balanced performance is put on by the lemon, oak, must, wheat, and tart notes here. This bottle demonstrates why great geuze can be cellared for years.



M: Quite the effervescent treat here. Loads of carbonation delivers the flavors to the tongue with each sip. Bone dry finish with a healthy, but not overpowering tartness.



O: An undeniably great geuze. Traveling out to DHVL is also a great part of the experience!",4.6
8630,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"750 ml bottle shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks Brad! Pours a hazy orange with beautiful white spongy head that leaves a lacing on the glass as thick as the head was once it settled down. Aroma is citrus sourness, straw, hay and brett barnyard funk. Flavor is amazingly complex: perfectly balanced sourness with notes of citrus (grapefruit, lemons) and mild wood. One of the best sours I’ve ever had - everything about this beer is appealing. The mouthfeel, balance of flavors, carbonation, finish, all make this an outstanding beer.

From note 1/23/10 (Geist Dark Lord Tasting).",5.0
8654,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Sample from a bottle at Monks for Zwanze day. Pours a cloudy golden orange shade with small to medium sized white head, tons of lacing was present in this gueuze along with medium carbonation. Aromas were dusty barn, wood, earth, and lemon skin. Taste was delicious with acidic fruits and yeast, currants, grapefruit, grass, horseblanket, light cheese and other funk. Finish was very dry and puckery tart in the mouth. Great lambic.

8719,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"750ml bottle sampled at Daknole’s Memorial Day Tasting, (Thanks Rusty).
Pours a straw yellow color, with a white head. Aroma is sour, a bit  funky, cheese (feet).  Taste is acidic, sour, tart and lemony.  Finish is tart.  A refreshing sour ale.  Perfect for hot summer days.  An incredibly rare ale that I would highly recommend, if available.",4.0

8714,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(sampled at Dak’s Memorial Day tasting.  Huge thanks to Rusty for the share!!).  Pours a cloudy, yellow apricot.

This was really good and I’m really glad to have tried this.",4.2
8863,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle from Theis. I don’t even know where to start with this. What a fantastic beer. This really was everything I hoped it’d be.

Cork ejects with a huge pop, which makes the huge, beautiful and firm head on the pour no surprise. Typically orange lambic color disperses all light coming through. Deftly and dangerously sour aroma would scare off all but the most hardened sour beer fans. Unripe plum, green grape, and a load of acid. 

The flavor is a whole other game entirely. Not as roughly sour as the aroma, but still powerful. Elegant and balanced, very welcoming. When cold and unbreathed, the beer has a bit of a rough finish, but that all fades as it warms. Incredibly nice going down, with a soft carbonation and sourness. Nutty and oaky up front, this beer remains awesome all the way through. A near perfect beer, a near perfect lambic, it’s hard to imagine much better than this. I just can’t give it a 5 because the experience was not quite up there with my other 4.7s. Still, it’d be hard not to count this amongst the best beers ever made.",4.7
8773,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Cork bangs off, pours a clear medium orange/gold with a tempestuous head that just stick around the upper regions of the glass.  Epic.  Big, funky nose full of light fruits, slightly vinous.  A bit light and tingly on the nose.  Crisp, snappy, and lively in the mouth.  Tight, dry, but wondrously rich and full-bodied.  Not the most funky or sour geuze out there, but just so refined, balanced, and lively.  Light oranges, lemons dance about a musty barnyard funk.  Near perfect really, and  absolutely delightful.*********************After fantasizing about this beer for the past few weeks, the thing that struck me the most was the really lively, vibrant lime and lemon which kind of fizzed throughout the whole thing.  This quality really reminds me of batch 3 Sanctification (the really good batch), so that’s the closest comparison I would have to this wonderful beverage.",4.7
8882,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Thick head, Good lacing! Aroma is mildly sour with subtle wood. Medium body, sour...green apples! I liked this a lot!",4.1
8789,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Damn... a white whale I thought I’d never get the chance to taste. Big, big thanks to Jesper for making this one possible. The aroma is pure heaven. A sharp, acidic earthiness hits the nose from about a foot away. Lots of wet earth. Leather and saddle. Some barn. A slight saltiness reminiscent of sea water and sea shore. Tons of gravel. An incredible minerality to the nose. Rotten orange peel. As it warms, the orange peel turns to a grapefruit note. Loads of dirty, funky, wet-animal like sharpness. Old cedar. Wow. Pours a glowing, hazed dark orange with a pillowy, fluffy, lasting eggshell white head. Flavor is insanely sharp, funky and dry. Absolutely zero residual sweetness. Stones, gravel... Leather. Sharp, sharp acid. Long aged cheese and earthy mushrooms. A slight hint of tangy smoke. Moist cedar wood. Wet wood tannin all over the sides and especially the back of the tongue.  The palate is full of intense and stingy acid. Lively, but not overbearing carbonation. Once past the carbonation, the texture is fairly creamy. 


 Wos! Wow! Wow! Intense and satisfying. This one is hittin’ on all levels. Tons and tons of life left in this one. If I could give a 20 for aroma, I would. Absolutely one of the best beers I have ever nose. Thanks a ton for making this possible Jesper!",4.4

Not as much funk as the rose, which makes it less complex,  balanced and drinkable, but more assertive. Lightly astringent. Average palate. Solid but a bit tougher to drink than the rose.

Very light ultra-crisp body with quite a bit of sharp carbonation.  The flavor starts with blue cheese, high amounts of citric tartness, wild yeastiness and sweet/tarts with an lot of dryness to it.

Pours rich and murky yellow.  Smell is funky and sour and very gueuze like.  Taste is tart, sour and very similar to the Rose but maybe a bit sharper and more tart.  Medium body.  Decent, but too mild flavor-wise aside from the neutral sourness for me.",3.3

 Poured a clear coppery golden with a tall, sticky, and creamy cap of white head.  The aroma was much more upfront and complex than the Rose with a huge lemon and vinegar presence.. deep, lightly-spiced fruits abound and are well-complemented by dusty barnyard notes.  
 
 The flavor was characterized by sharper lemon and acidic notes backed by some tart wheat.. freshly-sliced lighter fruits dance across the middle and through the long, tangy finish.. powerful and expertly-executed!  Tangy on the palate with phenominal balance.. long, dry, and very refreshing finish.  Masterful!",4.7

The aroma was fantastic - complex, sour and earthy.  In a good way, it smelled like old books, lemon peels and acorns.  Lots of oak and sour were apparent.  The flavor was possibly even better.  The sour wasn’t overpowering but inviting and interesting.  It starts with sweetness and acidity but finishes quite dry.  Great funk.  Gentle feel.  An absolutely excellent gueuze.",4.8
8658,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle @ THE Sour and Saison Tasting. The pour’s deep, hazy gold with a massive white head. Lively indeed. The nose is sharp lemon peel, sweaty sock, dank basement and a bit of dusty cork. Very earthy, musty aromas. The taste is more musty dust and buggy wood. Some light sweet lactic lemon cake. Barnyard yeastiness, hints of meaty grapefruit and lemon pith. A bit of cheddar cheese. Soft, complex flavors. Wonderful, but the taste is a bit muted and lacks some of the vitality I was expecting. Smooth and very drinkable. Active carbonation on the palate. Overall, a very pleasant experience. This bottle felt like it was starting its decline. Still, very good.",4.1

8682,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"750 ml bottle @ The Camper on our Denmark Tour (before and after the S&B/CBC Festivals). Opened the bottle following a trade earlier this week and after having noticed that the cork was a bit dried out (making some gas escape)... Despita that - beer was still in a perfect condition drank it paired with a first course based on tuna and a Danish smeus as the main course)... Now the beer: pours hazy golden orange with constant and continuous creamy white head (looks like beaten egg whites). Aroma of wood (and plenty of it), some green herbs (cresson, parcely) and spices (I had some cloves and thyme). Medium body with fresh yet very subtle acidity which pushes its way through from the middle to finish extremely dry. Taste is again some wood, citrussy notes. Wauuw, truly an incredible beer - and one of my favourite geuzes!
-----
Re-rated 22/02/2014 at Jeffo’s place. This is just perfection. Sampled this next to other gueuzes and this one simply stood out in balance between funkiness, subtle sourness and - yes - bitterness and what a looooong aftertaste. Just magnificent. Passed from 4.7 to 5.",5.0

T - A perfect balance is what describes the taste. Not as funky as the nose, nice lemon, oak, white grapes, with a tannic finish.

M/D - high carbonation, tannic dry finish, with decent acidity that does not wear on the palate. The only reason I stopped sipping on this beer was to enjoy the assortment of funky cheeses.

25631,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle shared at O’Briens on 3/23/07.  I also bought one to go, but left it at O’Briens.  There goes $45.  Yay for being an idiot….
Nice to see this available at a beer bar in the States.  At least now I can hold on to the bottle I do have in my cellar.  Though I’m not so sure how long I plan on holding it, after having tried this bottle.  This particular bottle had a distinct metallic flavor, not sharp and poignant, but rather sweeping in towards the end and blanketing the palate with soft metal notes.  Hmm, that makes little sense, but at the time, Chris and I were better able to describe it.  Suffice to say, the metallic notes definitely cut in to the experience in a negative way.
Not that I plan on scoring this beer based on this bottle.  No, that would be silly.  A bottle the next day and pretty much every review on this site mentions nothing of metal.  Obviously just an off or mishandled bottle.
The aroma was rather impressive, nonetheless, and I didnt note the metal there.  Very fruity, with tons of soft brett suggestions, none of the stronger, sharper lactic or pedio (or less of it, anyways) of the Cantillon, De Cam and newer 3F beers.  And that’s fine, it’s still got a lovely funkiness to it, very musty, rustic and lightly sweaty, with a vibrancy that defies its age.  Nice strength of aroma as well, with what lactobacillus notes there are, adding a little snap to it.
So back to the flavor, it’s obvious this is made from a very similar stock as the 1999 vintage.  Fruity, very malt apparent (not sweetness, of course, but with a soft, well-malted texture) and highly bretty.  Again, I prefer the stronger, more aggressive nature of the newer 3F gueuzes and Cantillon, as this one remains rather light and more ""Belgian brett golden ale influenced"" if you will.
Great stuff, but I’d be hard pressed to believe that even a bottle in great condition would be radically different from the 1999-2001 3F gueuzes.  Appearance/mouthfeel/texture/carbonation are all perfectly to-style.  No alcohol noted, of course.",4.3

The aroma is a fantastic potpourri of stinky cheese, horseblanket, sweet apples, tart lemon, dry hay and a pronounced earthy, floral bitter scent.  The nose on this is one of the most complex I’ve experienced in some time.  The body is light and crisp with a happy, lively effervescence that really awakens the tongue.  When sampling, one of the first things that jumps out at me is a light, fruity sweetness.  The sweetness is more perceptible than in most examples, but quickly morphs into a stunning, bracing example of funky, earthy acidity.  The acidity is greeted by a surprisingly strong and slightly shocking bitterness.  Mostly citrus zest with a hint of pine and a lot of shock.  Definitely more bitterness than I remember in most Geuze.  This is just one fantastic beer.  The complexity is robust and damn near profound.  As the beer warms, it metamorphisizes into a smoother example of itself, showing a bit more fruitiness and allowing the funky acidity to permeate its environs.  The finish is funky and dry, exactly as it should be.  This has to be one of the most elegant and enjoyable examples of one of the most elegant and enjoyable styles in all of beer.  Wow.",4.6

Good mouthfeel, light carbonation, gentle acidity, with a moderate finish. This is a peculiar gueuze. The mintiness is kinda distracting honestly, it is way different than anything I’ve had from 3F. Thanks to Bryan for popping this guy, a real treat.",3.7

The flavor is really, really good, mildly sour with notes of citrus, apples and sour white grapes and and bitter notes like in bitter lemon soda.

Taste is rich with strong funkyness again and tartness sorrounded by a sort of yogurt-like sweetness. Huge citrus and lemon peel notes. Grassy notes in the background. Some wood and fruit too. Mostly dry finish. Palate is creamy, silky, with good carbonation. So easy to drink, I’m glad I had a whole bottle for myself. This is now rounded, complex, almost on par with the Millennium.",4.5

Pour is a deep orange with a billowing, 3 finger off white head. Lots of retention and lacing. Smell is a deep musty funk up front, with some lemon, and a floral touch. Taste is a bit subdued on all accounts. Nice lemony bite, cobwebs, hay, and mineral funk, but with the same floral aspect, and a touch of mint on the finish. Drinkable, and only a touch dirty on the back of the throat. Medium dryness. A privilege to try this one, but I think it falls short of other geuzes of similar age.",4.0

25541,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle generously shared by Destructo at his 3 Fonteinen vertical dinner.   After working our way backwards from the 2010 vintage, this bottle was just a little disappointing.  It had many of the acidic citrusy notes that I love about 3F, but it also had a ""chemical taint"" or off flavor.  Would like to revisit this one because it might have to do with the way it was cellared..
Re-rate I have to change my original rating of 3.9.  I shared a bottle received from a friend whose cellar conditions cannot be questioned.  This version was much dryer with champaign characteristics.  The tartness and sourness were almost non-existent.  I believe this to be closer to the Armand’s intentions.",4.1

Hazy golden brown in appearance with a thick white head.  The palate is full, and carbonated perfectly.  This is a divine tasting brew to be sure.  Starts lightly sour with some faint green apple taste.   As you get past the initial flavors, you begin to pick out the yeast and and floral aspects.

S: Subtle musty, earthy tones.  Damp hay.  Smells like the barrel room at Drie Fonteinen.  Mild citrus.



T: A truly fantastic flavor profile.  If you aren’t going in expecting something super dank and funky, this will amaze.  Delicate complexity.  A refined blend bringing together a little bit of everything... lemon, orange, sweat, musty oak, barnyard notes of straw and musty air.

The nose has a rindy cheese to it, light dusty paper quality as fruits are unfolded.  Lemon rind, hint of mint, bright ripe tangerine and peach notes.  The taste has slightly less chessy find and a touch more dusty paper, the fruit flavors are even more bright and take stronger hold on the presence of the beer.  more peaches with a little less of the tart lemon than I anticipated as the sourness takes hold and adds to the overall awesomeness and complexity of this beer.  The body is extremely light, lovely effervescent feel, high crisp carbonation and just enough driness. Mid to late bottle pour is more funky, early pour is more fruity.  Absolutely perfect!",5.0

Holy crap, this is complex as hell. The funk is more complex than any gueuze I’ve had thus far. Finished on sharp funky notes, with a very dry palate and low acidity.

Appearance : Nice healthy pop, no gushing. Hazy pale yellow with a big head. Not much lacing.


Aroma : I start to smell it while my glass is still a foot away. Awesome brett, funk and wet barnyard. Notes of pinneaples and other exotic fruits. Nice notes of wood with a light dust. Awesome green apples tartness. WOW! 


Taste : Awesome brett with notes of exotics fruits. Lively carbonation but not harsh at all. Light tannic and lactic notes on the finish. Awesome green apples tartness. Very dry and sharp. Light wood on finish. Very fruity.


Overall : Wow. I had big hopes for this and I wasn’t disapointed at all. Hugely fruity nose with awesome notes of exotic fruits. Very nice carbonation. Awesome tartness. Awesome fruity notes on finish. Very well balanced and very drinkable. Much more complex than the Millenium Geuze, same type of carbonation (that I really appreciated). I think this is aging very nicely and shows no sings of decline. I’d be surprised to know if it was that good when fresh.

Opened with a bang.. poured crystal-clear (at least initially) with a sticky cap of white head.  The aroma was to die for!.. wet horseblanket, ripe lemon peel, and dirty old barn character jumped out of the glass and tackled the nose.. balance was incredible, and I could’ve smelled this all night.  The flavor found sour lemon rind, funky earth, and aged oak the whole way through.. not powerfully sour, but perfectly balanced.. just lingered on the finish forever.  Medium-bodied with moderate-plus overall sourness on the palate (as mentioned).. crisp, well-balanced, and entirely awesome all around!",4.6

25588,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Big, big thanks Jason for opening this one up (I’ve been trying to get this one for a while now!). Poured a medium and hazy golden color with a larger sized white head. Aromas of funkiness, oak, citrus, hay, musty, and barnyard. Tastes of funkiness, citrus (lemons), green apples, wood, vanilla, and earthy. Nice sour and tart finish. Now to have this again when I’m semi-sober!",4.6
25461,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"The legendary special blend made in 1998 for the fiftieth anniversary of the Drie Fonteinen blendery, released in 2000 as a one-off, and the first to bear Felix De Boeck's ""Nightlights"" (a Flemish 1977 painting) on its label, later reused on the Oude Geuze Vintage. Never thought I would ever get the chance to taste this legend, but Akkurat had a few bottles left apparently and I was more than happy to pay the 1295 SEK they charged per bottle - considering the skyrocketing prices whales like this generate on the black market, it seemed proportionally very reasonable. Fun to see how nervous the waiter was when he had to open the bottle, quite a solemn moment really. And after twenty years, this geuze was still very much alive: some gushing was apparently inevitable but with minimal loss (not more than, say, 5 SEK or so…). Thick and very frothy, off-white, lightly lacing and slowly opening but largely stable head on a misty straw blonde robe with warm peachy tinge and lively sparkling - looking like a bottle of no more than a year old. Ancient damp cellar and decades old wine from said cellar cover the original profile like an ornamental blanket, a profile consisting of ripe peaches, sour apple, oxidized white wine, haystack, very old dry sherry, moldy lemon peel, moist jute cloth, green plum peel, sour grapes, old artisanal cider, barnyard, faint hint of chlorine - all the fine elements I am looking for in a top quality 'oude' geuze. Softly and complexely estery onset, wryness of grape and plum peel soaked in gooseberry and crabapple sourness with a softer pear- and peach-like edge, yet nowhere descending into a harshly burning acidity and enlivened by a perfectly measured, cava-like sparkling on the tongue. A soft, bready 'soil' carries the esters onwards with pear and gooseberry remaining the most prominent impressions, towards a 'brut', highly complex, dense but still refreshing finish in which the musty cellar and very old wine notes are accompanied by hayish and leathery Brettanomyces effects on top and wet wood tannins below, the latter quite long-stretched and eventually bittered by a dim, structurally essential and perfectly positioned, very late hop bitter touch. The tartness carries on, adorned by the woody effects and the noble effects of elegant aging. I have held this producer in very high esteem ever since I first put a Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze to my lips a couple of decades ago, but this absolute masterpiece of a geuze was a real honour to taste, all the more so because age has not demolished its basic structure: on the contrary, the ancient wine and musty cellar merely oversee the funky, estery complexity with great care and nobility. Underneath these charming old age aspects still lies a perfectly refreshing, perfectly solid, complex and bright geuze, internally untouched by age, like the roguishly twinkling blue eyes of a weather-beaten old man's face still betraying his soul's eternal youth. Before I get even more lyrical: among the most masterful geuzes I ever had the pleasure to taste, one I had been dreaming of for a long time, and one to reverentially bow one's head for when it happens to cross one's path. Granting it a perfect score is the only option I have on this site.",5.0
25656,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle  Opens with a very hard explosion-pof, but no beer splashes out. Clear amber body.  Slightly off-white, creamy head, which fastly diminishes almost totally.  Very beautiful beer.  Complex nose of old wood, apples, white wine, fine liquor, citrus.  Moderatelately sour, lightly bitter initial flavour.  Moderately sour, moderately bitter finish.  Nicely well balanced beer.  The typical 3 Fonteinen mark is enormously shining through, but somewhat less sharper (but more softer) than the ’ordinary’ gueuze.  Definitely another succes of Armand.",4.2

25686,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"1/7/05.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, sampled courtesy of TAR and cb on RateBeer 1/7/05.  Hazy golden-orange with a huge fluffy white head that lingers long.  Very good, long patchy, sticky and blotchy lacing--pretty close to a perfect appearance if the lacing were more consistent.  Awesome aroma that screams with brett and barnyard tartness, beautifully funky with lemon and shades of lime citrus.  Whispy and very soft body with deliciously pleasant flavor.  Very faint in all its measures beyond the tartness, and while it starts tart, it finishes dry and very soft.  Leaves mostly traces of the tart residue on the finish with a light glow of acidic citrus and must, dust, and chalk.  Light honey and very traces sweetness.  Bright particles of lemon tart sparkle in the mouth.  Really beautiful stuff, delicate and subtle the equal of any geuze I’ve yet had.  Thank you so much, Jeff and Emily!",4.3

25630,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Many many thanks goes out towards Clark for opening a bottle of this, shame you left the other bottle at O’Briens. I don’t feel so bad about leaving my 2004 Speedway behind now. Once again Clark’s review is much more detailed that mine but I will add my two cents to a rating of this brew:  Poured surprisingly clean and was topped by a big foamy white head and had excellent strings of lace work upon the glass. The nose detected lots of barnyard and brett yeast character along with fleeting vapors of floral meadows and lemongrass. There was also a strange corky and steel nature to the nose that shows some damage in aging.  The flavors are very rustic and farmyard up front with some lingering acidic fruit. I too found the metallic finish but unlike Clark, Chris and Mike (sorry guys you are wrong) I did not seem to mind it as much as my rating proves. The mouth feel is soft yet does have a crisp around the edge bite to keep things interesting. I loved this beer and would truly freak out for another chance to try it. A work of brewers art...THANKS AGAIN CLARK!",4.3
25684,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Hazy pale yellow. Tightly-woven sticky foam with some rockiness. Alluringly aromatic nose of cedar and must. Swirl of the glass yields lemon, oak, and airy elements. Creamy with a well-rounded softness. Initially firm with musty oak and a brett-laced blast of lactic acidity and vinegar. Soft bodied, yet remarkably brisk at the same time, with a staunch foundation of crushed minerals. Rich toasty oakiness thwarts much of the irony tartness, while the brett virtually fades into a mere afterthought. Vague sparkle of perfume and husky Pils malt. Less tongue-grippingly tart, though, showing trace peach acidity and tannins, which are shortened by the body’s softness. Ends woodily firm and dry, but insistently soft and seemingly low-attenuated, with a muted mix of white grapes and honeyed malt. It’s undoubtedly on the oaky end of the Lambic spectrum, which you gotta love, but it needs a lengthier malt character and certainly more influence from the acidity and brett, to be flawless.",4.2

Not being a lambic/gueze fan this is a huge step for me to rate this beer over a 4.  I really enjoyed this one though.  And for almost being 10 years old...boy did this beer hold up against the test of time.  It was in magnificent shape.  Lots of funk in the nose, some sour, a little presence of the dusty/musty cobwebs aromas...but not too much.  The flavor is very acidic but not over the top and very welcome in this beer.  Lots of tartness and fruity flavors going on as well.  Very enjoyable and one of the best lambics/guezes I have ever had",4.1
25516,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"2 x 3 oz pour from a bottle @ The Festival (Portland). When I drank it, I thought it was regular 1998 Oude Gueuze, but I was confirmed after that it was the 50th anniversary. My oldest lambic so far. Hazy golden/orange with a small to medium white head and little lacing. Aroma is so enticing with barnyard, green apple, musty notes, light banana(?), funk, horse blanket and fruity notes. Taste is slightly sweet and moderately funky with barnyard, horse blanket, green apple, musty notes, fruits, earthy notes and light lemony presence. Mouthfeel is dry. Still well carbonated. I’m really impressed by how good and multi-layered this gueuze is, even after 15 years. This is amazingly complex, but what is even more impressive is how well balanced this Gueuze is. That would be a perfect everyday gueuze. Incredibly drinkable. Not far behind J&J Blauw (and on par with Lente) for my top gueuze (and top beer) ever!

EDIT: Had it again, this time at Akkurat. Still a world-class beer but it was not in the same league as the Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1999 we head the day after and the regular Oude Geuze 2002 that I had a few hours before. It was heavier than the first time I had it.",4.6

17733,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bottle (8 4 9 5 18).  Solid black color with a minimal head, but when I do scare up the head its a rich dark milky brown color.  The aroma immediately signals a big and wonderful imperial stout.  The licorice, coffee, vanilla bean and molasses stand out.  At the outer edge of the aroma is a hint of fruitiness.  Lush, milky, smooth, and creamy - a true delight on the palate.  The first wave brings a roasted malt, followed by a tangy frutiness that lingers until the finish.  Moderately sweet with a bitter chocolate aftertaste.  Remarkabely clean and smooth with the 12% abv hidden well.  Thanks to lowerdsixth for sending this my way.

This might be regarded as one of the best beers in the world, and it sets a really high bar, and woe betide the pretenders",4.4
16649,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Pitch black, decent viscosity and a medium sized pale brown head that settles rather slowly actually and leaves espresso-like lacings.

The smell is amazing. Rich, powerful and very balanced. Big coffee notes of espresso and freshly ground hard roasted coffee beans. Hints of soy sauce, salt licorice and dark fruits. Delightful notes of dark chocolate. Just a hint of tannins and slightly acidic roasty aromas. This is really impressive.

The taste is dominated through and trough by rich coffee flavors. Freshly ground coffee beans and espresso blend with wonderful flavors of dark chocolate and some nutty aromas. Notes of dark fruits. The sweetness is restrained in favor of bitter roasted flavors. The malty backbone is present, but hard to detect beneath all the coffee flavors. In the middle, the roasted character is accentuated further towards a taste of almost burnt coffee and malts. At this point, the beer actually gets a little too much and doesn’t manage to keep everything together. But this is just a minor slip, and hardly of importance for the overall impression. Further, i notice a nice hop flavor that works really well with the coffee character. Notes of wood and fresh earth. The finish has a real coffee- and hop bitterness to it with notes of soy sauce, salt licorice and vanilla. Long lasting coffee notes lingers in the mouth. The alcohol is almost completely absent except for a pleasant warming sensation. This is just oh so tasty.

Very smooth but it still manages to leave a nice sticky sensation in the mouth. The body is not as big as I had expected, but I think this suits the beer well.

This is just a fantastic beer. Great flavors, big complexity and very balanced. It’s really nice to come by a beer that manages to hold such bold and rich flavors together as this one does. And as this wasn’t enough, it’s really really easy to drink, I went through a bottle way to quickly.

17325,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Very, very impressive. I’m glad it lived up to the hype. The Speedway Stout comes in a massive champagne bottle. I was suprised to see green glass after I poured out the black oil from the interior. As soon as the cap was popped, the aromas of coffee and milk chocolate came waving through the air. The look of this monster was dark and ominous. The caramel colored head lasted a nice amount of time. When this buttery liquid cascaded into my mouth, I was born again! The milk chocolate flavors mixed perfectly with the roasted malts. The coffee flavor didn’t dominate as I had expected--everything in balance. Before I knew it, my glass was half empty. There is no way a 12% monster like this should go down like a glass of chocolate milk, but it does. This actually reminded me most of Old Rasputin (underrated), which has a very similar taste and mouthfeel. Can’t wait to get into my next bottle.",4.5
14988,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Pours thick with a big, billowing dark brown head; plenty of lace around the glass, and it’s pitch black in color of course. Complex nose of dark chocolates, buttery/creamy malts, lightly spiced, bitter honey, brown sugar, and of course a lot of bold, dark-roast coffee. The taste is just as complex as the nose. It arrives with bright, acidic coffee with a little bit of spice and hops before transitioning into a smooth, creamy malty middle. It finishes very nicely with plenty of bold coffee notes, brown sugar, and some alcohol. The warming of alcohol is present throughout the palate but is especially noticeable in the finish. Once warm, the coffee notes stand out the most and followed by some more sweetness and alcohol. Smooth, heavy body; low carbonation; finishes warm, long; dry as hell.

17426,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Another one of the beers I recently picked up at Hi-Time Wine in Costa Mesa, and curiously one of several Imperial Stouts with coffee I seem to have run into lately.  Out of the green 750 ml. bomber, and into the goblet, the beer came out deep reddish black with a one finger thick light brown head.  The body was opaque when held up to the light with some brown highlights at the extreme edge.  Aroma was chocolate malt and leafy hops mingling together.   The first taste was about as intense as I have ever had in a beer.  The acrid roastiness of the malts provided the backbone of the flavor profile, while the green bitterness and acidity of the hop oils provided the muscular heft. Together they had quite a tug of war on my tongue.  I believe the hops won out in the end.  They claim to have poured in pounds and pounds of coffee beans in the brew, but the other flavors were so strong, the coffee was barely detectable as a distinct taste.  There was a lingering note of chocolate in the aftertaste.  The body was thick and smooth, providing an excellent feel on the palette, which was spoiled only a little by the peppery spiciness of the alcohol.  The strength was well covered by the abundance of the flavor while the beer was in the mouth, but since there are no taste buds in the stomach, the warmth spreading to the extremities from there was dead giveaway.  This is a beer best suited for a nightcap duty, although the large bomber size gets in the way of that a bit.  I would love to see what some age can bring out, as at this fresh stage the hops dominated everything else.  Maybe I can get my hands on some more to set it aside for a while.",4.5
17381,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Poured a deep black, chocolatey tan rocky head that left great lacing.  The smells are awesome of coffee and malt and caramel. Some hops are present and even some plum. Relatively light mouthfeel and well hidden abv.  Smooth body.  Best Imperial Stout.   Period.  I got this one from Liquorama.net, and will soon fork out the dough for another.  Phenomenal.",4.6

Finish was very smooth, full bodied....couldn’t be much better.",4.4

Really big and heavy aroma. Flavor is bittersweet, with touches of both coffee and sugar. Alcohol is detected but not disturbing. Mouthfeel is pleasant and soft, low carbonation going on and a long, sweet aftertaste. Nice complexity hidden inside this beer. Very nice example of the style and this beer is great for all the different treatments it has gotten over time. Can’t wait to try them all!",4.3
15841,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bought a bottle of this at beverage warehouse in LA due to the rate beer hype around it.  Was impressive in texture, color and had a wonderful dark coffee aroma.  Tasted great but the lingering aftertaste gave me that feeling of anticipatory indigestion.",4.4
15428,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Cappucino immediately springs to mind when popping the cap. Lots of nasal-burning blasts of alcohol, tar, and fresh coffee beans. The aroma is spectacular, but all other characteristics seem concealed within. The appearance is a sheer delight that includes plentiful carbonation and a velvety mouthfeel. Mild roast lies beneath the stacks of bittersweet chocolate, Ryan Bros. coffee, and burnt malts. Long finish of dark chocolate-coated espresso beans. Awesome stuff. 2003 What happened? Nowhere near the same brew. The aroma and flavors no longer boast the elegant coffee flavors. Moreover, the mouthfeel is far less than velvety and much thinner. A huge disappointment from Skip V’s version. Interesting, since this is supposedly the same recipe.",3.7
17678,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bottle pours absolutely pitch black!   Head is minimal, but from what was there it was dark dark dark...   Lacing is very slick, not leaving much trace.   Heavy aroma of roasted malts, coffee, and light chocolate.   Taste is forwardly bittersweet coffee, followed by some mild roasted malts and major semisweet chocolate near the end.   Mouthfeel is smooth, but not as velvety as I would have liked.   Slight tinge of alcohol on the finish, but otherwise the 12% is well hidden.   Definately a good Imperial Stout, could have used a bit more carbonation/livelyness,  but I still prefer Great Divides Maverick Imperial Stout over this one.   Thanks goes out to TChrome for the trade!",4.2

14795,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Since I long time that I was looking for this beer. Finally, I have found this bottle at the sterk grocery in Amsterdam, in can version. I have tried this beer yesterday and it was my last beer and I have taken a long time to drink it alone and it was really the beer to go to the bed and looking for the stars. It is a classical but powerful imperial stout, better to drink not cold or a little.The body is, as usual, a powerful black body, thin and creamy white foam, the carbonation is low but it is normal for the style. The taste has directly notes of coffee, at the beginning, it is a dry coffee and step by step, it develops notes of mocca, roasted malt, vanilla, hop but hidden by the malt, dark chocolate, the alcool is perfectly hidden, giving a «warm» sensation, liquorice side, creamy and all these aromas gives a powerful sensation at your body, the kind of beer to drink with time and with a dessert of chocolate.",4.4

Aroma is very rich dark malt, caramel, perfect tangy espresso, dark chocolate, a little raisin and dark fruit.  Flavor is richl full sweet with vanilla a dark roasted grains.  The mouthfeel is insanely thick and chewy.  But it isn’t an overbearing beer at all.  Other than the mouthful of residual sugars its pretty clean with a spicy hop, warm, and drying end.  I love this beer and am beyond psyched it is so much more readily available now and not $30 anymore.",4.5

Aroma is powerful, full of coffee beans and bitterweet chocolate, of course, tones of roasted malts and, on the background, molasses, caramel and dark fruits. Incredible mouthfeel, full-creamy-viscous-bodied. Mind blowing! Extreme coffee bean flavour, dark chocolate, cocoa, toffee, dark malts... anything you can imagine in an Imperial Stout but powered to the limit. Extremely balanced, alcohol is so well hidden. Aftertaste is bitterweet and ridiculosly persistent. Amazing journey!",4.8

Black as an unpopular high school kid’s heart. Flavour is full and rich... Lots of coffee, a bit of booze... Not that complex, really. A hint of molasses lingers with the coffee in the finish... Aftertaste is just really good coffee. Mmm. With a bit of air and oxygen there’s a bit of brandy and bourbon that gets in there. Very nice. Huge wonderful thick and smooth body too, by the way.

Aroma is coffee, licorice, chocolate and leather, moderately boozy. The taste is velvety chocolate, coffee, not too sweet which is nice, in fact it leaves a nice dry cocoa powder flavor in the finish, the coffee beans used here are obviously of high quality, not overbearing either, all blended wonderfully. Body is obviously huge, the beer coats the mouth long after the swallow, carbonation is medium. In love with this beer, a true masterpiece, I really wish I could get my hands on a barrel aged version now!",4.5
17645,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Had with an Ashton cigar.  Overall it was very good, but I personally like the Moylans better.  The coffee is not as nearly as present as I thought it would be.  Chocolate, hops, and alcohol were dominate.  Coated the glass nicely, and was better as it warmed.  Mocha head was nice too.",4.2
15379,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bomber, poured into a snifter at room temperature.

A: Pours a viscous black, forming a thick ecru head that leaves lacing even as it dies to a cap and thick ring. The iPhone flashlight test reveal no light at all getting through, save at the very top edge of the beer, where the color turns a murky dark brown at the very edge of the liquid. No complaints about lacing during consumption - there’s plenty, and it’s sticky.

S: Medium roast coffee strikes out of the glass straightaway, as fragrant as if it were freshly brewed. Beneath it, notes of a deep, dark roasted malt swirl about, alongside some hints of bitter dark chocolate and a vague nuttiness.

T: Coffee stout indeed, as those notes are again at the forefront, a medium roasted blend. The black-burned malts are there as well, a charred bitterness to them, with notes of scorched toffee and seared caramel alongside. Vague, ephemeral suggestions of dark cocoa and figgy fruit waft through the flavor profile here and there, and it finishes with a dark, deeply bitter, tongue-biting earth and ash bitterness that lingers long after the swallow.

M: As if drinking heavy whipping cream straight from the carton, this is a full, silky stout.

O: Not a bad coffee imperial stout at all. Definitely one of the better balanced versions I’ve had, if still a bit heavy-handed on the hop side for my personal taste. In a style-neutral comparison, I’d take the AleSmith Wee Heavy over this any day of the week and twice on any day ending with a Y, but this is far from a bad beer.",4.3

There’s also a kerosene thing going on.

Nose was not as much coffee as I expected and had much more there.  A little burnt toast, a lot of cocoa, and a lot of great roasted smokey malt smells here.  Not quite as viscous as I expected and actually a bit sweeter, but still a very nice brew.  Chocolate comes out more than I thought that it would.

15696,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Had this on tap during the Speedway craziness going on, this time had the Hammerhead version. The rating here is for Hammerhead.  Unfortunately walked in unknowingly that they had 12 Speedway varieties on tap. Because I didn’t pre register, was only allowed to have regular or the new ""Hammerhead"" with no explanation as to wtf Hammerhead was. Once I took a sip, it was obvious to me it must be some coffee. Also I would like to note that I was very sad I could not try the others :-(

Pours pitch black with a small mocha head on top, looking super creamy. Aroma of huge acidic earthy coffee, a hint of chocolate, and just more huge coffee and espresso. Flavor follows with massive espresso, earthy and spicy, lightly acidic, with some hints of chocolate fudge in the background. Slight warming alcohol and lingering espresso. This really highlights the huge amounts of coffee here. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Honestly, this blew me away. One of the best coffee stouts I have ever had.

Was hoping for more on the aroma (the only knock here and it is minor). Huge coffee flavor with a nice bitterness. A bit of a cocoa powder lingering on the palate. Another sip reveals a bit of dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel, lighter than I had expected but still pretty chewy. Love this because it doesn’t go all syrupy like some others.

I should have thanked whoever poured this much more profusely",4.5
14284,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Bottle from Himmeriget back in late March with Herr Angstmann. All Speedies are amazing, but this was something to behold. A bit more sweet and vanilla from the Vietnamese coffee, and a thinner body than the non-BA Speedies. The bourbon is almost overwhelming with its taste and heat but somehow backs off just enough to showcase all the other flavours. It is still smooth and very drinkable, marshmallow/brownie flavours competing with the coffee and smoky bourbon. I love it, one of my favorites.",4.6

>> Three different samples over a two day period. Flatter ink black pour with wispy yellow lacing. Nose is more in the Creme Brulée vein than the Creme Brulée version of Speedway on tap today. But the main character in the nose after it warms is almost pure rum raisin. Taste is a bit sweet and almost all bourbon barrel forward with big rum raisin, flashes of soy. If you like the nuanced flavors of the Vietnamese coffee, they are gone, taken over by the barrel. I honestly don’t see the point of this beer as it kills off what makes the Vietnamese version so good. Rich bitter chocolate? Gone. Balanced hoppiness? Gone. Vietnamese Coffee flavor? Gone.

Ba! Nie zamierzam się nawet wycofać i dalej podążam w poszukiwaniu tzw. beer whalez. 
Zostało już ich na prawdę niewiele (oczywiście mowa o tych nieodhaczonych w Top50 RB;). Niektóre będą niezwykle ciężkie do zdobycia, ale wierzę, że uda mi się kiedyś wypełnić ranking powiedzmy do poziomu 45/50.

Wersja: 2016

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy diabła. Kompletny brak przejrzystości.

Piana: Trudna do zidentyfikowania, ponieważ po odkapslowaniu pojawił się mocny gushing. Beżowy kolor i struktura składająca się z małych, beżowych oczek. 
Szybko skurczyła się do obrączki pozostawiając ładne krążki na ściankach. 

Zapach: Niezapomniany, wszechobecny aromat.
Jest tutaj wiele warstw wtajemniczenia.
Beczka po bourbonie wnosi intensywną woń czekolady, cukierków Kukułek, wanilii i przypalonego karmelu.
Tuż za nią podąża aromatyczna, mocno palona kawa.
Kroku również dotrzymują akcenty lodów śmietankowych, kakao, marcepanu i mokrej dębiny. Na ostatniej prostej dobiega cukier trzcinowy i melasa.
Zapach układa się w poszczególne warstwy i otwiera się z czasem jak kwiat.

Smak: Na języku, gładziutkie, jedwabiste już od pierwszego łyka.
W ustach rozpływa się mleczna czekolada, kakao, orzechy migdałowe, Nutella i przypalony karmel. Kawa ma słodki profil i umiarkowany stopień nut palonych.
Słodycz wafelków kokosowych, drewna dębowego oraz beczkowej wanilii wypełnia i głaszcze podniebienie.
Posmak cukierków Kopiko oraz Kukułek wypełnionych chrupiącym karmelem i czekoladą, przez długi czas utrzymuje się w ustach. Piwo chociaż ma wysoką pełnię i jest niezmiernie syte i treściwe, charakteryzuje się dość wyraźnym palonym finiszem.
Tekstura jak wcześniej już wspomniałem jest gęsta jak olej silnikowy.
Ukrycie procentów - arcymistrzowskie. 
Sama radość! Sztosiwo warte swojego hajpu! 

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

BBVSS uwodzi smakiem i powala aromatem. 
Kryje w sobie bogactwo różnorodnych nut smakowo-zapachowych. 
Profil beczkowy jest niezapomniany, chociaż kawa nie jest aż tak esencjonalna, jakbym się tego spodziewał. 
Balans i wielowarstwowość to dwie najważniejsze cechy tego trunku. 
Prawdopodobnie najlepsze piwo AleSmith i w 100%-ch najlepsze z serii Speedway Stout.",4.5
14215,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Barwa nieprzejrzyscie czarna z brunatna pianka. W aromacie jest bardzo duzo irlandzkiej whisky, mega wloskie espresso, bardzo prosty aromat mega palony z przelamanymi waniliowo/migdalowymi klimatami. W smaku jest palonosc i beczka. Mega klasyk ale troche przymalo cialo. Piwo mega nadrabia szlachetnym alkoholem, super klasycznym risem beczkowym. Klasa swiatowa. Po ogrzaniu i odgazowaniu jest jeszcze lepiej. 4.35/5",4.3
14354,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"From notes. Bottle. Nose is lightly fruity with a ton of chocolate, booze, and cake. Smells like BA speedway in that it is like a boozy chocolate cake. Fruitiness is higher than regular though. A touch more vanilla maybe. Taste is similar but seems a lot more forward with the chocolate and a big, thick, chewy mouthfeel. Pretty damn tasty. A bit big with some alcohol warning but always smooth.",4.1
14188,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"355ml bottle. (2022 vintage). Pours an opaque black with a medium, creamy, short lived, brown head that laces. Sweet aroma of roasted malt, milk chocolate, coffee, bourbon and oak. Sweet flavour of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, licorice, vanilla and oak in a dry, mild bitter, bourbon warming finish. Medium to full body with a sticky, smooth, oily texture and soft carbonation. A world class Impy that was a pleasure to sip on.",4.3

This is how a bourbon ba coffee ris should be. Extreme flavors, but with great balance. Fantastic.",4.4
14379,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Vintage 2014. Thanks SaltyMalty!

Pours black with some tan surface foam, opaque. Smells awesome. I’m not getting a ton of coffee here, but the barrel offers up just what I love: nougat, mineral, vanilla, oak, cocoa. okay, give it some time and air - theres the coffee, and it is classic coffee with a touch of soil. I suspect then fresh it’s more aggressive, but I’m uncertain I would like that. Flavor is spectacular as well with sweet malts, mineral, vanilla, bourbon, marshmallows. Full, silky body with nice low carb and a semi dry finish. Very nice, very fucking nice.",4.6
9751,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Dark dark brown, not quite black coloured beer with a surprisingly decent well retained tan head. Aroma has lots of malts in it, a bit of coffee, and wisps of whiskey. The flavour had a lot of alcohol in it but it’s controlled by the tons of other flavours; fruity, coffee, oaky, some roasted malts in there as well. Somewhat of a drying finish, but it’s still luxurious and full of flavour.",4.3
9607,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2006 bottle shared with the family for my 1000th.  Poured a deep black with a one finger brown head that hung around for a while.  The aroma was mainly oak and vanilla, with notes of chocolate and roasted malt.  The coffee has pretty much faded away.  The flavor was mainly chocolate, with roasted malt, vanilla and oak present.  The body was full, the carbonation was very soft and the mouthfeel was thick and creamy.  This was a great beer and I was glad to try it.  They didn’t go overboard with the aging here.",4.6
9452,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle at tasting, 2006 version. Side by side with a fresh regular speedway. Black pour, thin tan head. Aroma of leather, vanilla, oak, roasted malts. Flavor is extremely smooth, oaky, leathery, roasty, all in an amazing balance. Perfect balance, perfect body. Amazingly wonderful brew.",4.6
9787,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2003, bottle 12 of 225.  Wow.  This poured very dark black with no head.  It smells like slipping into warm blankets on a cold night -- lots of oak, vanilla, malt.  I can’t smell any coffee in this beer, despite how much I tried.  The flavor is nice and sweet, with a heavy mouthfeel,  The flavor is where to find the coffee -- there’s a lot of it, and it follows through to the aftertaste.  There’s very little carbonation here, which makes the beer smooth and almost milky.  I couldn’t taste the alcohol at all, except long after I’d set the glass down, I could taste it lingering.  The beer has a drier finish, but pulls through with an overall sweet character.  I’m more than grateful to csbosox for sharing this taste of heaven.",4.8
9864,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2002 vintage, bottle 113/115. Even more luscious aroma than Speedway, with huge amounts of maple and vanilla, pear, phenols. Truly phenomenal. Dark black with thin tan head. Medium oily body with light carbonation. Bourbon, vanilla, maple, phenolics, sweet and waring, comfortable. Fruit esters, coffee, toffee, chocolate. This is one awesome beer. The best beer I’ve had to date. Light bitter, sweet silky after.",5.0
9182,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Three year old bottle, but with black neckfoil (the print on the bottle says ""with coffee and aged in bourbon barrels"", so I assume it is the same thing). One of the most expensive beers I ever bought, delivered to me by my dear former colleague Maaike. I taste this a little above cellar temperature from an old port wine snifter. Black colour (but in fact an extremely dark ochre brown), thin deep beige head, a little more ’loose’ than I had expected and breaking open after a short while but retaining well around the edges, with a delicate, silky lacing. The aroma is heavenly: a dense, thick, strong and intoxicating perfume of all the good things you would expect in a big stout, and more. Impressions of freshly roasted coffee beans, kahlua, orange liqueur, warm chocolate sauce, cognac, liquorice, vanilla beans, peat, leather, oaky tannins and even moist wood, gingerbread, hints of soy sauce, cooked meat, cloves and butterscotch. This liquid commands respect, nothing in the nose reveals even the faintest flaw; I’m beginning to understand why this beer scores so high on this site. Taste is... well, intense, to say the least: an overpowering symphony of candied fruits, espresso beans, fondant chocolate, vanilla, oak, candi syrup, dried orange peel... Difficult to point out which comes first. Carbonation is sharpish, even a bit fizzy at first; mouthfeel is thick and smooth, somewhat cloyingly sweet at first but drying more and more towards the end, over a big yet refined, oily, multi-layered maltiness. Spiciness, bitterness and intensity increase in the finish, where a strong bourbon presence takes the lead along with strong woody tannins, with a drying, even somewhat burning effect which can be felt from the tip of the tongue till deep in the throat; peppery hops are quite strong as well, and so is the remaining syrupy maltiness. The bourbon alcohol and the strong, coffeeish roasted bitterness keep struggling for dominance but remain matched. How sweet the onset may have been, the ending of this complex ale is bone dry.  This is a powerful, demanding form of liquid gastronomy in which many things are happening at the same time. Still: this is, contrary to what I had expected, probably not quite the best stout I tasted so far - the alcohol burn is just a little bit too much over the top for me, the mouth and throat keep sticking a bit with the initial candied sugariness and it is, for this particular style, a bit overcarbonated. Nevertheless: hugely complex, hugely enjoyable, very impressive with a formidable balance between sweet and bitter, both present in their most ’compressed’ and intense form. Something to be reckoned with and enjoyed carefully, concentratedly - and sip by sip. Wow, what an experience... Big cheers to Maaike!",4.6
9263,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"shared bottle, poured a pitch black colour with a nice beige head. roasted malts, coffee, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, thick and smooth mouthfeel. really awesome stuff!! but the vietnamese speedway is a bit better!",4.3

9550,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2006 750mL thanks to nimbleprop at the Sexual Chocolate release.  Thanks man!  This was spectacular.  I wasn’t a huge fan of the base beer, but the barrel and the age on it smoothed out all the imperfections.  The aroma was of deep malts, oak, vanilla, bourbon.  The taste was subtle, smooth and delicious.  It came through and coated the palate with bourbon, vanilla, malts and hid the alcohol like it wasn’t even there.  This was super smooth and tasty.  I loved it.",4.6
9378,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle, merci Phil! Nice black pour, thick brown foam. Aroma of chocolate, rich molasses (typical Alesmith), alcohol, light bourbon (really light IMO). Taste is chocolaty, bourbon vanilla, toffee, a very very light hint of coffee, boozy finish. Palate is slightly hot, but right on the mark for the warming alcohol feel, a real sipper of an imperial stout, it coats the mouth and never seems to leave. A huge beer, absolutely delicious.",4.6
9738,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle thanks to Chuck, 2004 #11 of 240.  Poured a lovely shade of black with just a dusting of beige head.. loose ring of head and a mahogany glimmer in the light.  Aroma was somewhat sour with rich chocolate and espresso.. warmth brings out some very wonderful stuff.. drier oak and some sort of liqueur that I can’t place, but love emerge.. lots of oak comes out, and this was some great stuff!  

Flavor kicked it up a notch for me.. the roasted coffee is very well-accented by a wonderful barrel presence (bourbon, oak, and vanilla rock it well!).. drier oak and some almost smoked darker fruits ride through the long finish.. just a magnificent treatment from the barrel!!  Warm and full-bodied on the palate.. integration of the barrel-aging was rock-solid.. just a touch sour, but great all-around!",4.1
9210,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle from 2012. Thanks to Matt for hooking me and ma bros up! Man have I been looking forward to this?? Oh yes! Pours Pitch black with a brown lasting head. WOW the aroma. Oh boy! The aroma just have everything you want from a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Lots of fresh coconut, vanilla, oak, fresh speedway stout coffee, nice and smooth milky chocolate, fudge, some oak as well which contributes to such a nice and decadent note. Also some weak buttery notes and some sweet dark fruits as well. Taste has lots and lots of sweet bourbon notes. I get tons of coconut, dry oak, vanilla, weak buttery notes, smooth and creamy milk chocolate, roasted coffee, dark dried fruits and some fudge as well. This is one delicate decadent imperial stout. Smooth gentle and balanced. I really really like this beer :) !",4.5
9222,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2013 bottle. Bottle shared with cards04. Dark black body with brown quickly fading head. Aroma of bourbon, warm malts, biscuit and booze. Taste is bourbon first then cocoa and faint touch of coffee and tomatoes. Less coffee-centric than the original.  A touch of booze but quite smoothe palate. Excellent beer.",4.2
9675,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Poured from 75cl bottle at Alesmith dinner.  This was an unknown vintage bottle that they brought to the dinner in Las Vegas.  What else can be said about this beer?  It’s really more a work of art in a bottle.  Huge aroma and flavour that covers everything from whisky, to chocolate to roasted malt to smoke, coffee and finished with some alcohol heat.  Outstanding. ***Update: found out this was a pre-release of 2007.",4.5
9749,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"sample at DLD, ’04 vintage. huge thanks to leopoldstoch for sharing. i had this sandwiched inbetween Stille Nacht Reserva 00 and Oak Aged DL! I guess that could only mean at DLD. poured beautiful black with tan head. nose had loads of wonderful cocunut, dark fruits, toffee, caramel, charred wood, and bourbon. an amazing nose. flavor notes of raisins, plums, chocolate, coffee, caramel, and bourbon. alcohol was warming but hidden well. too bad the nose was just better than the flavor. it all didn’t seem to come together that well and the Oak Aged DL i followed this with was more impressive. thanks again for sharing! 4.3. 



2/1/08. ’04 vintage.  sampled at ""An evening with Pantanap #3"". Big thanks to alafito for this amazing bottle. pours dark brown with thin beige head. nose is tight with coffee, roast, chocolate, slight bourbon, and aged malts. flavor is coffee, chocolate, roast, nuts, nutmeg, bourbon, oaky charness. body is silky smooth and full. low carbonation. alcohol warmth but well hidden. this is extremely good and easily the best AleSmith BA beer and worthy of a 4 in appearance. 8/4/9/5/17=4.3.

11/3/09, ’03 vintage. pours black with no head. nose of licorice, ashy. flavor is ashy, chocolate, licorice. wow this is not what BA speedway is supposed to taste like, this barrel has dried this out and it is so ashy. 3.1.",4.3

9609,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2007 Vintage, Bottle #295. Good call on this one, UncleJedi. You have chosen... wisely.

Appearance: Pours a turbid, dark brown, near black body with a thin, short-lived, tan head.

Smell: A very full, all-encompassing bourbon barrel presence on the nose -- large notes of oak wood and full-on bourbon with lighter notes of vanilla and coconut shavings. Pair this up with a malt aroma replete with plenty of chocolate and roast and you have something worth smelling.

Taste: Cup of Sumatra Dark Roast ’Black Satin’ Coffee stirred up with aged oak and light touches of vanilla and coconut and garnished with a few chocolate-covered coffee beans. Fleeting plum fruitiness. Some fire-roasted marshmallows. A pinch of Black Cavendish Tobacco. Medium roast bitterness. Plenty of alcohol to be found, but, thankfully, it’s not glaring. Warming, roasty finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Yes! This is going to be a pleasure to finish off, I can tell. It’s so darned yummy, I just had to tell the world!",4.3

Courtesy of jdubFL.  Pours super deep darkness with thin tan head. The aroma is full force bourbon, musty aged oak and rich dark fruitiness from raisins, prunes and cherries followed by yummy chocolate and a sense of dark roasted coffee. The taste brings up a pleasing mix of chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, sweet dark fruitiness and oak. Wow! Smooth rich tasty goodness offering up velvetiness into the finish with chocolate, coffee, oak and smooth slick sweet bourbon. Love this.",4.6
9888,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle #39 (Many, many  thanks to argo0) - I picked up malts, coffee and sugar in the aroma.  The color, well, my notes call it a black hole.  It had a nice thick brown head that dissipated without completely disappearing.  The flavor was coffee, but sweetened with a touch of smokieness and alcohol.  This is a smooth, creamy beer with a slightly bitter aftertaste that comes upon you slowly.  Barrel aged stouts are wonderful things.",4.7

9668,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle courtesy of Sparky27...Eric is a great guy and is unbelievably generous to offer up this!!!  This brew can’t get any darker...like a black hole, light can’t escape it.  A beautiful milk chocolate head sits stubbornly atop this one and leaves solid lacing on the inside of the glass.  The barrel definitely left its mark, most impressively, in the nose.  Oak, vanilla, and subtle bourbon are delightfully infused into the rich Godiva and roasted Starbucks aroma normally present.  Unfortunately, the alcohol isn’t as well hidden and, in fact, fights violently with the other flavors in this beer.  With other brews, specifically Angel’s Share, the barrel-aging added to the complexity and enjoyment.  This wasn’t the case here.  Hot, woodsy, and good...but I’ll still take the one I can get daily!!!  THANKS ERIC, for giving me a chance to try this!!!",4.5
9730,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"I usually get a chance to get my hands on about 5 ounces of this per year. So 5 years in, I have consumed about a bomber of it.  Thanks to the few of you who have shared.  The last bottle (from a sharing BAer at Maproom) had crazy writing all over the bottle, signitures or something.  I just don’t find this as satisfying as the normal Speedway Stout. Again, I thought that too much bourbon was left behind in the barrel, thinning out the stout and pushing too harsh a bourbon flavor upfront.   The Speedway’s complexity fights it’s way through, wonderful coffee roastiness and touches of anice in the finish.  It just doesn’t seem to work as well as bourbon barrels work for Numbskull and Bells Stouts.",3.8
9503,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Creamy salty butter nose is a bit stronger than the lighter charcoal and dark toasty notes.  Jet black, tall fizzy mocha head.  Hard to get past all the butter.  Plays well with the creamy body of the stout, but still distracting and more disappointing from my lofty expectations.  Had a pour from the growler the next day, butter was very much subdued and the barrel came out in with strong charcoal and oak.",3.3
9721,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2006 Vintage, bottle #226 of 235. Pours black with just a few bubbles. No head, no lace, comewhat thick looking. Smells of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and wood. Tastes of roasty, dark malts up front and then the bourbon and coffee and wood kick in. I don’t taste the big coffee flavors like in un-BA Speedway but the barrel flavors are not overpowering. Thick body with a few fizzies but no real carbonation.",4.2

9868,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thanks to Eyedrinkale for sharing this at Brewtopia ’04! Very few ""wants lists"" remain intact when Mike comes around!
Bottle #19.
This pours black with a weak attempt at forming a head as expected. A complex aroma rises from the surface carrying notes of chocolate, whiskey alcohol, and roast malt. The flavor is very intense and complex as well, playing back and forth between the sweetness and the bitterness from the roast malt. There is a slight whiskey bitterness/sharpness present. The alcohol content is well hidden and the alcohol flavor is pleasant coming from the barrel, not the malt in the beer. Overall, a very nicely done Imperial Stout but somewhat over hyped. Just the same, I’d have another one if it were available.

Pours an oily black with a small creamy light-brown head. Aroma has a good amount of bourbon barrel along with roasted malt, vanilla, chocolate and dark fruit -- if I had to nitpick I would say I’ve smelt this before in several other BA Impy Stouts, it’s not unique, but it’s still very nice. Flavour of bourbon, roasted malt, coffee, rich chocolate, vanilla and a bit of alcohol. Long roasty bitter finish. Oily / creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied. It’s all very well balanced and the BA isn’t overdone. Wow, this is absolute treat -- many thanks to garthicus and IrishBoy!",4.1
9568,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle saved from 2003 and shared by danielcurtis81 at his wedding reception. Pours pitch black with thin fading tan head. Nose contains some sweet chocolate and bourbon. The flavor is soft and smooth, a little sticky and creamy, not much to be said for carbonation but that just makes it taste more like a fine liquor. Very complex taste with bourbon, vanilla, sweet chocolate/cocoa, faint oak, caramel/nutty. Everything about this beer was simply amazing and it blew me away considering it was 6 years old. Best aged beer I have ever had...this is truly an example of how flavors improve with age.

Big bourbon thrust, too much at first but give this some air and it improves dramatically and the initial heavy handed strangulation tactic seemingly employed by the bourbon cask use starts to wane and this becomes a better stout altogether, though still not as good as the regular in my opinion. Good thrusty creaminess, vanilla, and lashings of chocolate infused with the fast retreating bourbon, its damn good!",4.0

9159,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,Bottle. An Imperial Stout on the heavy side (both texture- and taste wise). Complex taste with note of milk chocolate and coffee. Notes of salt in the aftertaste. Not as sweet and vanilla dominated as a lot of bourbon stouts tend to be.,4.2

9750,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thanks Abby for the chance to have a go at this beer!!  Shared at DLD.  I really wanted this one to blow my socks off and while it was excellent and a great imperial stout it was not everything I would have imagined.  The aroma was great  with vanilla, bourbon,chocolate, coffee, caramelized burnt wood and all sorts of other stuff as well.  The palate was incredibly smooth with the only notion of alcohol coming from the bourbon barrel not the actual beer.  And even then it melded really well and worked perfectly.  Alesmith really knows how to make the most completely balanced beers, and even when they experiment with barrel aging they still manage to make one the most balanced BA stouts, that is really tasty!  I guess I just had too high of hopes for this one that I was bound to be let down, but none the less it was still highly enjoyable and a real treat that I am so happy I was able to try.  Thanks Abby!!  Oh yeah I think it was bottle 89/228 from the 2004 batch",4.5

9531,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(Bottle, thanks to Westside Threat) Pours near black with a small brown head. The aroma is round and quite dry with a mild chocolate and coffee roast alongside typical vanilla, coconut, mint and light dill-like oak notes. The malt also brings tones of dark bread.  Lots of toffee. The dry/roasted profile plays extremely well with the round and light sweet oak. Light alcohol warmth present. The flavour holds a dry malt profile but the oak brigs some sweetness. Perfect, well-integrated bitterness alongside a tiny, tiny acidic whisper. Coffee beans and chocolate/black malt in perfect harmony. Vanilla, coconut and wood from the oak. Toffee and light hints of dried fruits. Maybe some blackberries. The mouthfeel is round, fat and soft with light carbonation. Roast, alcohol, mint and some earthy, light resinous hops on the finish. Full bodied. I was rather sceptical towards this beer - I am not a super fan of the regular Speedway Stout (don’t get me wrong it’s a good beer) and some of the other barrel aged beers from Ale Smith have been too oak-driven, but this is fantastic!",4.4

Was great to open this but too bad coffee stouts don’t age that well and this should have been served its justice many years ago.",3.5
9852,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"To me, this beer tasted like many of the other Imp stouts in the current US trend of ""bigger is better"" and barrel aging.  No matter who started it, there are a lot of them out there now.  And I do not have the stomach for these concoctions, I don’t mean that they make me ill or anything, but I hardly find them very enjoyable anymore.  They are simply too rich, and too much.  As far as this one, I honestly do not see all that much of a difference between it and many of the others.  It certainly is not a bad beer, but it is in no way the best beer in the world.  I absolutely would not want to drink this often, if at all.  And I do not like coffee!  Some may question the ""2"" for palate, since it is so thick; but I do not see thickness as a good beer characteristic - perhaps several years ago when it would have been a novelty, but after having several thick beers, I have come to the conclusion that syrup is best left for pancakes.

9554,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Had this from a growler of unknown origin.  Been looking forward to this for a long, long time. Speedway Stout is so awesome on its own that I couldn’t even imagine what would happen when they aged it in the -bals. The answer is that it became a ridiculously good beer, even among ridiculously good beers.  Pours a clear light golden color...no, scratch that, actually it’s pitch black. This is where photons go to die. Not much in the way of head, but then again it did come out of a growler. This is the beer’s only minor flaw, if it even is one.  Absolutely heavenly. High-quality chocolate and coffee (I’m talking weasel crap quality), roastiness, oak, and just a touch of bourbon.  Amazingly balanced, yet very intense awesomeness liquified. Lots of chocolate and vanilla, a little bourbon, sweet caramel malt, roasted malt, and oak. Coffee is definitely less dominant than in regular Speedway, as I hear aging will do to coffee flavor. This is a good thing, even though I like a strong coffee presence in a stout. When I drank this, I think a light might have shone down from the heavens and angels might have sang, but I’m not 100% sure.  Incredibly smooth, full, and creamy on the palate. Very soft carbonation.  I know this is a barrel aged imperial stout, but I could drink it ALL NIGHT LONG! I couldn’t imagine this beer really being any better unless they put weasel sh*t in it.",4.8

The ’standard’ Speedway’s coffee roastiness is mellowed into this and the oak and wood, the vanilla and a bourbon (is it bourbon barrel or just oak?) depth pour through.

DaSilky1 traded me the first bottle of this I had, but it was opened at the PP 12 hour fest, so Chris gave me this in replacement, what a guy!
Perfect appearance, as you’ve come to expect from AleSmith.  Bottle conditioned carbonation produces a large tan head that is very well-retained and laces quite well.  Dark, dark brown-black body has a medium clarity.
STRONG stuff, just like Speedway, of course, with coffee and vanilla beans in the nose, plentiful vinousness (very important) and dry roastiness on the finish.  No tacky caramel and chocolate sweetness and nicely attenuated, as is the regular beer.  Bourbon is very, very reserved in the nose, and only moderate wood dryness reaches the nose, on the finish, adding continued dryness.  Alcohol is lightly perceptible after warming, and adds more intimidating strength.
Spanish coffee and dry chocolate open up the flavor, with soft vanilla and light, dry toffee notes through the middle.  Lots of wood, but it’s not overly harsh and is offset by a very unfiltered, well-malted texture.  Coffee is dry and extremely tastefully added, lending a beany-like hardness that combines with some vinousness to provide that wonderful complexity in the base beer.  Very low bourbon character, one of the few Imperial Stouts to actually remain balanced in the bourbon department.  Dry wood, cocoa and some light fusels on the finish.  Love the attenuation level on this stuff.  Tightly carbonated as well, giving a very strong, nearly creamy texture.
I love regular Speedway, and the bourbon being correctly done is just the icing on the cake.  Not quite as good as the best bottles of Speedway I’ve had, but right up there.
Thanks Chris and Todd.",4.4

9702,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Vintage 2006, bottle 70/235; Sampled June 2008

A fairly vigorous pour produces a one-finger thick, darkly browned, tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is simply black as it sits in my glass and no amount of putting up to the light makes it anything but opaque.  The aroma has a tartness to it that is strongly influenced by Bourbon-like notes and likely coffee.  Roast coffee notes actually play a big role and mix with some fruity, burnt prune notes and lots of deeply toasted malt notes.  There is also a nice aroma of richly toasted coconut that still has a touch of sweetness of coconut meat.  It also seems to get just a touch musty at times, which mixes in with a lightly spicy oak character and a touch of estery alcohol aromas.

Thick and rich feeling as it firsts hits my tongue, creamy dark malt notes hint at lots of residual sugars, but don’t really contribute much sweetness to this beer.  A very light carbonation also contributes to the creamy feeling of this brew.  Towards the finish the beer thins out considerably while picking up acrid roast notes and sharp, burnt acid quality and a huge bitterness that seems just as much from burnt malt and roast coffee influenced as from the hops.  The dual roast influences of coffee and malt actually contribute a tartness that is noticeable throughout the flavor profile, not just the finish, but it is tempered a bit up front by the unctuous body.

As the beer warms up a bit it begins to lose a touch of the acrid character, but seems to pick up a bit more alcoholic heat.  This last seems to accent a note reminiscent of burnt prunes.  While rich and malty this is surprisingly dry tasting; the thick residual sugars seems to be so well balanced by the roast and barrel flavors that they are not really noticeable.  At most there is a noticeable chocolate / cocoa note here, but even this is pretty devoid of sweetness.  There is also a touch of almost salty, sort of peat like smokiness that is likely a combination of roast malt and barrel influences.  By my second pour the salty, peat-smoke like qualities of this brew are accented even a bit more.  This last, in combination with the rich, dark malt flavors really save this beer for me; though it still has an overwhelming bitter and acrid finish at times.

I do like that the barrel influence does not absolutely overwhelm this beer.  I am not sure if this is still too young or what, but the roasted grain notes really get overly acrid and bitter in the finish.  The barrel influence also contributes to an overall impression of this being unbalanced.  This is not nearly as unbalanced or undrinkable as the BA Old Numbskull though, and is even enjoyable in its own right.  I think that the complexity of the aged, base beer and the lightish influence of the barrel make this at the very least worth procuring for me.",3.2

An insignificant thing and perhaps only noticed becuase of the awesome quality of the aroma and flavor.  Ah, the flavor.  The rich complexity of the aroma fulfills itself in the flavor.  Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, molasses.  Some slight bitterness of roasted coffee, and truly barrel-aged.  A truly erotic, if not orgasmic beer experience.

The flavor was deliciously fudgy, nutty with great bourbon influences. Subdued vanilla, caramel and alcohol with a slightly noticeable astringency that I imagine comes from the coffee.

Un enchevêtrement de café, de chocolat, de bourbon caramélisé, de vanille, de noix de coco grillée et de sirop d’érable foncé comme un tout moléculaire qui me rappelle le parfum aphrodisiaque du sexe féminin. Siboire, ça sent les licornes et le sourire de Karen O, la voix de Mila Kunis, les jambes de Gisele, le cul de Bar Refaeli et la parfaite imperfection de Scarlett. Je sécrète subitement de la phényléthylamine. C’est peu dire. C’est comme une passion subite. Je pourrais passer des heures au-dessus de mon verre sans bouger, sans pouvoir arrêter de rêver, de parler et d’écrire. Mais bon, il faut y aller. Je trempe mes lèvres. Une véritable sensation de bien être et d’apaisement. Les jambes d’Emily Haines qui se lovent autour de ma langue. Jane Birkin qui a encore 26 ans. Debbie Harry qui rote son dernier bourbon. Iman qui défile à la cabane à sucre. Binoche qui postillonne du chocolat et moi qui ne s’étonne pas de cette concoction et de ses saveurs salaces qui s’évaporent de ma bouche lorsque je tape cette phrase sur le clavier de mon téléphone : «Chaque bière est un sexe. Y avez-vous pensé quand vous respirez dans mon verre?»",4.9
9603,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Rating # 300. 2007 bottle with huge thanks to ajm. Shared with TheRealBastard. I sereved this one in a 26oz. frosted mug. Pour is an oily pitch black with a 2 finger milkshake looking head. Powerful aromas of burbon, huge roasted malt, fresh brewed coffee, wood, and nice caramel in the back. Flavor is very intesense throughout. Right up front with roasty goodness, going right into a hit of burbon, and finishing with coffee and vanilla. Holy hell, this is one of the most amazing and complex impys that I have ever encountered. All I can say is Wow!",4.9
9699,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"750ml bottle, 2006 vintage, #34/235, with a HUGE THANK YOU to sfoley333 from over @ BeerAdvocate for the trade!  Pours a syrupy black with a late forming creamy tan head, minimal spotty lacing.  Aroma is bourbon, oak, milk chocolate, molasses and espresso in a near perfect harmony - deep, rich and enticing!  Flavor is a bit more over-charred oak than I’d hope, with a nice espresso bitterness also in the front, but the milk chocolate, molasses and even bourbon gets pushed to the background, making the flavor profile more one dimensional than I’d hope.  I wouldn’t call this a ""let down"" per se, but agree with others that it doesn’t top the regular Speedway Stout.  Thanks again Sean!",4.2
10891,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Tried a 2012 and 2014 side by side. Not that much different, preferred the 2012, seemed rounder and better balanced. A thick and creamy-feeling stout.

Aroma doesn’t get much better; if I wasn’t so excited to get this one I could have just sat and smelled this all night.   Lots of bourbon, dark roasted malts, espresso, creamy chocolate, and vanilla.  Flavor is fantastic as well and is everything you get out of the smell and more.  The sweetness of everything works so well with the bourbon.  This is extremely well balanced and everything seems to complement each other.  This one lives up to all the hype and then some!  I only hope I can get more of this sometime sooner rather than later.",4.4

Pours about as black as anything I’ve seen with a complimentary tan head.  Nose is heavy on the bourbon with lovely vanilla bean, chocolate, black cherry, toffee and lactose notes to back it up.  One thing that really stood out about this is that you can really distinguish the blend...their definitely was a nice hoppiness to the finish, leading me to believe that the Expy portion was fresh.  Flavor was mainly bourbon, vanilla, coffee bean and finished with a dry, oaky AND hoppy kick.  Wonderful stuff and I’m glad I had multiple opportunities to sample this by the pint.",4.7

Served at Stub and Herbs during their Black Friday event the day before Surly’s Darkness Day.  Our waitress was right on this one and did a great job securing a table of ratebeerians with a 7 oz sample of this brew.  Later on, I witnessed a beer being Factoed by an unnamed source, ha!  One of the smoothest palates of any beer I’ve put to my lips.  Tobacco, licorice, lactose, chocolate, bourbon...a lot going on here.  Well balanced, as none of the flavors overpower.  Fairly impressive, although I have to admit when it comes to impy stouts, this isn’t quite my bag of tea.  But I can see how some might be blown away by this beer.  I’m glad I got a chance to try.

Yihaa, this is some tasty shit. Quite complex indeed, with everything that’s supposed to be in an Impy stout. 
The taste is slightly sweet upfront, with a very well balanced roasted bitter end. Semi-full bodied, with a very pleasant semi-flat carbonation. Real smooth and slightly sticky.

11117,Bell's Black Note Stout,"One of the best, so I figured it would be a good place to start for my first rating! 

Had this one on tap at O’Rourke’s in South Bend,IN...part of the Oberon kick-off celebration.

Aroma: Bourbon up front, but hints of dark chocolates, roasted malts and subtle vanilla.

Appearance: Pitch black, thin head of mocha foam...little lacing. A swirl of a half-full glass will give a nice oily coating.

Taste: Extremely balanced beer. Bourbon and licorice up front with roasted malt,  chocolate and a creamy vanilla over the middle and a warming finish containing notes of coffee. The bourbon and licorice calm a bit after it warms, only giving it more balance. You start to get the bourbon being more pronounced in the finish, very warm!

Palate: Full-bodied beer. Creamy. Low-Carbonation. Resonates on your palate. A true sipper.

Overall: Excellence. My favorite beer. I wish all beers had this much flavor and balance!",4.8

11552,Bell's Black Note Stout,"draft at Trion tavern in New Haven, IN... they’re almost out  - Pours black with a thin tan head.  The aroma is big on the bourbon with oak notes and has some roast chocolate malt in the background.  The flavor is also full of bourbon and it’s good bourbon.  The roast malt takes a backseat, but it’s there.  There are also notes of oak, vanilla, and mocha.  It’s full bodied and lingers pleasantly on the palate with good bitterness coming through in the finish.  My only change would be to tone down the bourbon just a little so the other flavors can come out more.  That could drive this up to a 4.4 or higher for me.  I hear Indiana only got maybe three quarter casks, so it was great to try it.

Had it again on tap in Nov 2012 at Club Soda - Inky black, very small tan head, strong bourbon aroma. Big flavor of bourbon with massive roast malt. Very full bodied. Sweet. Undertones of vanilla and licorice. Finish is roasty, sweet, full of bourbon. Great sipper.",4.3
11612,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Words can not express my gratitude to Shigadeyo for sending me a hand bottle of this rare beer. Pours a viscous dark brown/  oil black with a dissipating brown head. Very complex aroma. On the initial pour, the aroma is vineous and roasty, but as it warms notes of molasses, oak, leather, and coffee emerge. Texture is creamy with soft carbonation. Initial flavor of vanilla and sweet dark chocolate that transitions to a middle that has flavors of dry oak and mild roast bitter coffee. Soft spicy  hop bitterness comes out on the finish, along with notes of dry red wine and some earthy graininess in the texture. The alcohol is there, but has melded into the beer quite nicely. I know this is a blend, but if you take out the barrel traits, this is like a Double Cream Stout on the front, and an Expedition Stout on the finish. Unlike some critics on this site, I think barrel aging is a great trend because it gives us the opportunity to see what other complexities that it can contribute to a beer. I am so appreciative of the opportunity to try this. Thanks Craig, I will try to refrain from calling you names for at least a day.",4.2
11237,Bell's Black Note Stout,on draft and one of the best beers i have had and every bit worth its rating. poured almost black with no head. the aroma of dark roasted malt and chocalate with touches of coffee..the flavor is boozy and chocolate nibs deep and rich with flavor. absolutely incredible. could i have had more..oh hell yea...pure bliss with this one and stout lovers will agree.,4.2

S- molasses is prominent, with sugary milk chocolate, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, wet pungent grains, licorice, cinnamon raisin bread, plums, pie crust and faintly musty oak. M- smooth and light body considering it is a barrel aged stout. Palate is medium and satisfying. Carbonation is underwhelming. T- molasses and grain are first, followed by the toffee and baked crust. Mineral water also mixes in. Vanilla, graham cracker, marshmallow, dry oak and caramel.

11562,Bell's Black Note Stout,"On tap at the Bell’s dinner at Brews.  Dark beer with a thin brown head that shank to a whispy film pretty quickly.  The bourbon barrel flavors are much more subtle in this mix then in the Third Coast Old Ale or the Java.  The bourbon is still a strong flavor, with oak, vanilla, coffee, some bitter chocolate and some dark juicey fruits as it warms.  This beer comes with a lot of hype and while it didn’t rock my world, for a beer with so many stong flavors everything balances and blends with finesse.   This is a great example of how a barrel and two beers can be combined to make an excellent drink.",4.2

11614,Bell's Black Note Stout,"6/19/2007:  Bell’s Bourbon Barrel Double Cream/Expedition Stout pours out in a ribbon of milk chocolate brown.  It seems a bit thin, but as always, looks can be deceiving.  In the glass it has a deep, dark mahogany brown color and is nearly opaque.  However, it is clean and clear when held up to intense light and tipped slightly.  There is also a nice, foamy brown head that doens’t last too long, but does leave a thin lasting crown.  The aroma and especially the flavor of this beer are very intense and insanely comlex.  I will do my best to describe them both, but like most high quality beers, sometimes words do not really adequately represent how awesome it is...  The aroma is a lustrous composition of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted and caramelized malts, vanilla, docile bourbon, alcohol-soaked oak, char, and sweet anise.  Very complex, hypnotic, and alluring!  The flavor is very much like the aroma, but even more sophisticated.  Again, I will do my best on describing what I can...  The first pass is sweet and reveals caramelized malts, vanilla, chocolate, and char.  There is some sort of faint nutty quality as well that tastes like walnut or suble black walnut.  Each sample reveals additional flavors and complexities:  One sip has rich, layered chocolate, and roasted malts,  The next is creamy vanilla, soft and mellow oak, mellow bourbon.  After that comes tobacco, sweet licorise, molasses, and char.  It really is very deep and truly complex, yet quite fluent and refined.  Here is my last attempt as describing the flavor which might be the closest:  Creamy and sweet, semi-sweet chocolate, bourbon soaked wood, deep char, sweet licorice, molasses, a hint of tobacco, and some gentle warming alcohol.  There is also a blast of smooth bourbon just before the finish that gives way to more wonderful semi-sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, sweet char and subtle licorice.  The alcohol is so well blended into the flavor; it is truly complimentary to everything else going on in this beer.  I also provides a pleasant warming sensation as well without being out of control or burning.  Amazingly, all of there intricate flavors are expertly melded together in a beer that isn’t overly thick like sludge or syrupy.  The body of the beer is medium to medium-full body.  The carbonation is very fine which helps produce an extremely smooth and silky texture.  It is milky on the palate and sticky on the lips!



Overall, Bell’s Bourbon Barrel Double Cream/Expedition Stout is very intense, yet so easy to drink.  It’s hard to hold back and just not drink the entire glass quickly, but it’s so awesome that it should be enjoyed slowly so that each drink can be savored and pondered.  This is truly an excellent beer and a phenomenal blend of two great beers.  Characteristics of both beers are present, but they are so beautifully melded together that this blended, barrel-aged beer is absolutely better than either one is by itself.  True synergy.  Not only that, it is also a fine example of how barrel-aging should be done.



Draught (growler fill) from Party Town in Florence, Kentucky.  This beer was well worth the drive and wait in line!  I should have made my wife go so that she could have bought a second growler for me (it was one fill per person since it was only a 1/4 barrel keg), but that really wouldn’t have been fair to everybody else there.  After all, a beer this good should be shared with friends (although deep down I really wish that I could horde it all for myself!).  I really hope that more of this excellent beer is made available in there area...",4.7

Unimpressive, but that’s what you get when you’re tasting a bunch of awesome beers with cool people and you don’t want to be typing away into your phone all night. Maybe I’ll come across one of these again and then I’ll sit down and take careful notes, but not tonight. Besides, does anybody even read these comments anyway?


 

I’ve had this a few times since, always been in the 4.1-4.3 range. Just had it as part of an imperial stout blind tasting, though, and am adding that + adjusting rating down slightly. Sample 4 of 13: Holy graham cracker. Super dark, clear, thick pour. Ruby highlights. Graham cracker and vanilla. Barrel-aged? Taste is drier than the last, and there’s some cardboard. Nutty/roasty, and much more balanced than the last. Chocolatey. Nice. Very pleasant. 8/4/7.5/4/15.5 = 3.9. As a result, dropping from 4.3 to 4.2.",4.2

A - Pours a pitch black body with two fingers worth of mocha foam. Settles out into a thin cap. Moderate lacing and retention. 

S - Starts off with the bourbon...oak, vanilla, and some char. Then some roasted malts and sweet cocoa powder. A touch of dark fruits too. No element really dominates here, just well integration of two base beers + a barrel.

T - Just all kinds of balance going on here. Smooth vanilla and oak, a bit of a bourbon butterscotch, lightly bitter coffee beans, and dry cocoa powder. A little bit of everything here. Finishes with a real faint but pleasant alcohol warmth.

M - Creamy, smooth, and decadent....thank you Double Cream stout! Surprisingly high drinkability compared to other BA stouts.

O - Perhaps the most balanced and easy drinking BA stout I have ever had. This is a damn impressive beer and I wish I somehow had year round access to this. Forever ISO, but I still prefer BCBS for its unrelenting bourbon element.",4.5

The aroma was incredible if you’re a BB lover.  Sweet vanilla, chocolate, oak, and of course, bourbon notes abound; could inhale this all night.  The taste was superb; roasted chocolate malt, vanilla, and oak blend so well with the bourbon that it just melts in the mouth.  Very smooth and creamy with a very slight hint of ABV; which is scary!

I’d say the selling point here is mouthfeel. One of the smoothest bourbon barrel beers I’ve had. It’s very good, but I don’t know that this thing is the best of the best.",4.1

11060,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Bottled February 28, 2012.

Appearance: The body is an opaque black with no head, only a thin tan ring with no presence of carbonation at all on the surface.

Aroma: Bourbon is on the forefront with coconut, chocolate and roasted malts backing it with a sweet creamer aroma, it reminds me of an Irish potato of sorts at times.

Taste: Coconut is heavy with a prominent creamer backing, reminding me of an Irish potato minus the cinnamon. Bourbon and chocolate is prevalent, very complex with hints of caramel also notable on the finish. Very nice.

Palate: Medium to thick with light carbonation.

Overall: This is an excellent beer, there’s a lot going on and it’s incredibly well balanced. I would drink this often if I could.",4.0

Can taste characteristics of both beers in here as well.  IMO a little disappointed given all the hype, but if it ages anything like Expedition Stout, this beer will only get better.

 I’m outside and am still assaulted by the aroma of bourbon, faint roasted malts, and chocolate, even though the glass is two feet away from me. 

Taste is of strong bourbon, some bittersweet chocolate, and some coffee. Very well balanced. Bourbon is powerful, but not overly so. Delicious. 

Smooth an silky on the mouth.

Long chocolate, bourbon and some barrel aftertaste. Amazing sipper.",4.5
10839,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Pours a viscous, black color, with a decent mohagony, bubbly head. It leaves back a thick, still bubbly lacing at the edge of the glass.

The nose reveals an astonishing balance between molasses, toffee, coconut, prunes and sweet milk chocolate on the one hand, and wooden, accentuating, slightly hot barrel qualities. The barrel is easily noteable on itself, while it hits the spot by supporting the malty aromas as well, in an outstanding, intriguing way.

Tastes earthier than the aromas revealed, with toasted, bready malts, accompanied by bakers chocolate and a decent amount of whipped cream. That creamy foundation then gets extended by cane sugar, big time toffee and molasses, which blend very well into the burning, wooden alcohol. Boozy Bourbon gets replaced by big chunks of wood, very chewy, with matured coffee beans, creating a pleasant balance, preventing this successfully from becoming too sweet and boozy.

The warmer the beer gets, the more present turns the Bourbon. It provides coconut and a hint of vanilla during the opening, while it becomes quite dominant, as the sweet malt qualities hit the tastebuds. Finishes with ash, scorched malts, slightly dry, while it remains its smooth, chocolate defined mouthfeel.",4.4

11505,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Nip handbottle from StFun. Pours black as night, ominous and dark, with a small head of dark brown foam. Organized, micro-spot lacing forms in bands that circle the glass. The aroma shows its Expedition roots, with notes of decadent, fudgy, chocolate cake, scorched caramel, espresso roast, and anise all showing strong. Peppery, toasted oak and subtle whiskey kick things up nicely, while lactic sugars and a milky element borrow from the Double Cream stout. licorice, figs, dates, and raisin lend incredible depth and complexity. Flavors basically mirror the nose, insanely chocolaty and bittersweet, with massive espresso roast and earthen hops for balance. Soft whiskey and woody vanilla are soothed and massaged by the creamy sugars, all coming together to form a creme brûlée and bourbon-soaked fruit finish. The palate is heavy and velvety, well carbonated but just a bit overly hot and sharp. One hell of a fireside slow sipper, this massive brew is  as decadent as they come. Delicious stuff.",4.5

11481,Bell's Black Note Stout,"On-tap at Stub N Herbs Pre-Darkness Day Party. Ordered two 7oz pours of this, because I wanted to make sure I had a couple before the keg blew.

A - Pours black with a thin tan head. Even though there’s only a small ring of head around the edge of the glass, there’s a good amount of lacing draped along the sides.

S - Sweet chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, light bourbon, some oak/wood. As it warmed up (and I made it to my second glass), things picked up even more.

T - Just outstanding! Lots of sweet milk chocolate mixed with the perfect amount of bourbon. Much like drinking chocolate syrup mixed with a kick of bourbon and some expresso beans.

M - Not quite as think as I was expecting, but doesn’t detract much at all from this beer. Very little carbonation, just right for the style.

D - Glad I was able to get two of these because who knows if I’ll ever have the chance to try this one again. Easy to drink for the style, but obviously I can only drink so many before I’d fall over.",4.3

25231,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"On tap at Cigar City

This beer is the standard Marshal Zhukov’s Imperial Stout kicked up a bit. Some chili were added along with a bit of vanilla and cocoa nibs.

A: Like all Cigar City stout’s this one is evil looking in the glass. As dark as night with a huge creamy brownish black head. The beer clings to the glass as if it is laced with oil. The head hangs around nice, and leaves big chunks of that dark brown goodness.

S: To say the aromas are bold would be an understatement. Huge charred malt aromas with strong notes of bitter chocolate. Light hints of roasted chili’s can be detected as well. The vanilla hides beneath all these bold aromas along with a bit of dark fruit and tobacco.

T: The roasted malt is the first thing you detect here. Coffee come next along wtih a blast of bitter chocolate and tobacco. A touch of vanilla can be picked up and then the chilis create a touch of warmth on the back of the tongue. Very complex and very unique.

M: Very full bodied, smooth, creamy with the chili’s creating a real depth.

D: Not as drinkable as some of the other Cigar City stouts, but it sure is tasty. A one of a kind treat.

Add a barrel and it becomes a perfect 5",4.9

Dark chocolate, vanilla, moderate roast and ample sweet caramel from the malt with no alcohol, even after warming.  Everything melds together so well and it's shocking to me that this is a mere 21 months in bottle.  Drinks like it's homogenized for 5 years.
Soft, malty, rich and yet wonderfully attenuated.  Near-perfect balance giving appropriately chewy, luxurious textures with no syrupy sweetness or any fatiguing sugar on the finish.  Cinnamon spiciness helps balance and vanilla is soft and flavorful.  Nothing jumps out and this is a study in balance and finesse.  Through all that, it's still pleasingly rich and satisfying.  No alcohol whatsoever.  Pretty crazy that I never got on the Cigar City train - just missed the boat.  Glad to finally try this and I see now why Cigar City hit it big.   Hard to believe they've created this much depth, complexity and balance without barrel aging. This puts many barrel aged stouts to shame, which is impressive. 9/4/9/5/19
2018 bottle drunk 2023.
3 years older than the sublime 2021 bottle I had recently and just a mess of cinnamon and other overdone adjunct. Thin flavors and textures with unrefined sugariness. So bad that it got dumped immediately. Wow, what's with the consistency issues with this beer?? 8/4/5/3/9",3.7
24232,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Pours a thick, oily pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is somewwhat subdued, pretty underwheming compared to the taste. Cinnamon is most noticeable, with a sort of odd earthy, musty aroma being pretty dominant as well. Perhaps a hint of coconut there. Taste is lots of chocolate and vanilla noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and chili coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Hardly any boozyness there at all. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. This is really nice for a non-BA stout, but I have to say that I would still prefer SN Narwhal or Kernel's Imperial Brown Stout. I do like chili, but all in all this does not seem perfectly balanced and frankly overrated.",4.1

Liquid coal pour produced only a whispy dark caramel cloud that floated on top of the body (hand bottle).  Bonus point for it staining the inside of the glass.  Aroma is pungent Godiva, molasses, roasted coffee, and vanilla.  Flavor is chocolate forward, but also delivers black licorice Jelly Bellies, burnt marshmallow, brown sugar, and balancing hops.  Although the pasillo & ancho chili peppers weren’t noticeable, the cinnamon definitely had a nice presence which added tremendous complexity to the beer.  A little sweet and couldn’t drink a ton (who am I kidding, of course I could), but this one was fantastic.",4.3

24905,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Pours as black and dark as a beer can get. Even the stream was opaque. It was slow to produce a head, fearing it was flat, I poured with a little more vigor. It started a thin, extremely dark brown ring of foam, which then puffed up a full 2 finger thick layer of brown cream, but it faded fast, leaving only modest lacing - though it does leave an oily brown film in the glass when you swirl it around. Aroma is surprisingly restrained, it shows quite a bit of roast, worcestershire sauce, maybe a little chocolate or vanilla. Flavor starts with a full roasty and chocolate sweet front, leads to a sweet and spicy finish, with distinct cinnamon tones lingering through the aftertaste. I liked this slightly better on draft at the brewery on release day, as it had a better palate with a soft push of creamy carbonation, like all of their impies had. But I didn’t otherwise have a rateable sample that day, this rating comes the bottle (2011 version). Over time in the glass, the aroma seems to liven up a little, shows more cinnamon and pepper spice. There is a light earthy fruitiness to this (aroma and flavor) that I think might come from the peppers. Last, for as big and complex as this is (its really big, and there’s alot going on) it is surprisingly balanced and each component has its place. Funny, if I was to give this a more technical BJCP style rating, I’d probably give it a perfect score - this may be a first for me where the hedonic score comes in a little lower. That is not to say its not pleasing, just maybe a little overwhelming.",4.3

The taste is where this separates itself from zhukov.  Taste is heavier on cinnamon, with small amounts of chocolate and vanilla.  Had I not known that it is aged on peppers I would have never noticed that slight burning sensation this produces in the throat long after each sip.

25244,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Appearance: Black, turbid body with a thin, bubbly, dark tan head.

Smell: Highly roasty nose with full notes of dark chocolate, black coffee, spices, a big pinch of Captain Black tobacco (white blend, natch), and a sharp, vegetal note from the chilies contained within.

Taste: A heady mixture of roasted maltiness, chocolate, and vanilla give you a sip of Kahlua garnished with a sprinkling of cinnamon. Before long the heat and spice from the peppers kick in, but it’s very well-integrated and complimentary to the overall flavor. A few careful drops of prune juice. More tobacco, which really is all too appropriate coming from a joint called Cigar city. Earthy hops with a modest amount of bitterness. Packed with flavor to the very end, there’s even a bit of persistent heat beyond the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-low carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Very nice. Beers with peppers have come a long, long way since the infamous Cave Creek Chili Beer, haven’t they? Without a doubt, I’m sure Crazy Ed is smiling down from heaven at Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout.",4.2
24950,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"In short: A full body chocolaty stout with (imho) exaggerated spiciness

How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed when about 6 months of age.  Winter 2009/2010 batch.  Bottle sent to me by CaptainCougar, thanks a lot Tom.  Split three-way

The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head with good retention

In long: The strong nose is disturbingly spicy (cinnamon, hot Mexican spices) over a nice layer of cacao.  Taste is more of the same.  Nice full cake-like body.  Lots of bakery black chocolate cake, cacao and friends.  But also lots of spices.  The cinnamon was annoying but it’s those hot Mexican-food type of spices that really ruined the beer for me.  It sometimes felt like cayenne pepper.  I know many people like the so-called Mayan Chocolate but I don’t.  I don’t like those spices in my chocolate and I don’t like it either in my chocolaty beer.  Also something about the whole mix added a sharp acidic bite at the end which also bothered me.  This rating is a personal subjective opinion.  I honestly think this is a well-brewed beer, but this is one that really doesn’t work for me.  We split my bottle three way and two of us didn’t finish our glass.  Granted the second one was my brother and we have the very same palate so we only count as one.

Tons of cinnamon and chili pepper heat mixes with smooth mocha, sweet vanilla bean, and some caramel notes.  Finishes somewhat dry with ashy bitterness.  Big beer.

24408,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Bottle from last year’s Hunahpu’s Day, an event organized by Cigar City to deliberately hype this beer, to the example of Three Floyds’ Dark Lord Day (it cannot be a coincidence, by the way, that the label states that ""Hunahpu was tricked by the Dark Lords of the Underworld"" - this is doubtlessly an ironic nod to Three Floyds...). Makes me very curious to find out if it is worth the hype. Opaque black colour (revealing itself to be a very dark mahogany in the end) with high degree of viscosity, under a crackling, moussy, deep brownish beige head, almost reddish brown initially, steadily receding but retaining a thin rim around the edges. Very powerful and very seductive aroma, utterly complex, refinedly sweet, roasted and subtly spiced, first almost a ’dame blanche’ of chocolate sauce made with cognac poured over home-made vanilla ice cream, coffee liqueur, marzipan, sweet dried chili peppers clearly there, burning pipe tobacco, milk chocolate bars and Belgian chocolates, vivid accent of cloves and (strongly) cinnamon rolls, kahlua, cappuccino, eucalyptus, refined bourbon-like alcohol, cashew nuts, allspice, candied dates and cherries, subtle touch of meat broth... The ’basic’ and dense malts, hops and alcohol bouquet releases ethereal, volatile and beguiling sweet spice accents whenever it feels like it. What a fascinating smell... I can sniff it for hours. I cannot wait to take a sip, and must conclude that the taste follows the aroma perfectly: the expected dense candied sweetness opens the palate and makes my mouth water, candied fruits, with an almost refreshingly minerally sourishness coming from carbonation, which may perhaps be a little bit stronger than usual for the style, but fits in perfectly here. A soft and beautiful vanilla sweetness is apparent already early on, even strongly so, but I love vanilla so this is, to say the least, a welcome surprise. Very creamy, velvety, viscous, oily mouthfeel and obviously very thick body, revealing an abyss of malts, very chocolatey, nutty and caramelly, with a strong mocha bitterness after the middle, lively and not just from roasted malts, but an actual, powdery and refined coffee beans flavour. Cinnamon comes up retronasally along with that wonderful vanilla flavour, and then the finish evolves, with a big and thick lingering malt and candy sweetness, cloying even, aided by peppery hop bitterishness and of course warming, but nonetheless very gentle, liqueur- or rhum-like alcohol; the cinnamon and coffee stick to the throat, as a mixture of sweet, bitter and umami flavours, but given the immense complexity of this beer, it is hard to tell which ingrediënt causes which aftertaste... The ancho and pasilla chili peppers, both rather mild varieties, are there, but provide just a subtle burning touch in the back of the mouth and throat, without disturbing the overall balance; I do get their earthy, smoky, sweetish, peppery flavour though, only adding further complexity. This brew is indeed hugely complex and consists of layer upon layer of flavour, absolutely divine. It takes a lot of concentration - and a large bottle - to try and grasp what is going on in this one, and this is again a reminder of what beer as a beverage is capable of. This kind of top quality beers of utmost complexity move me. Yes, this is clearly worth the hype; this is an awe-inspiring imperial stout, managing to respect all the qualities of its style and building upon them an own personality; I’m pretty sure I will recall this taste for the rest of my life. If it weren’t for the somewhat sticky, cloying effect in the back of the mouth and throat, I’d give it a perfect score, which would have made it my very best beer so far. For now: just one inch away from being perfect.  But then, considering my previous experiences with this brewery, I did have high hopes for this, admittedly.",4.8

Appearance: Pitch black body, very opaque.  Ther head is dark brown, like melted chocolate.   Texture is tiny bubbles with a few medium around the edges.   The head lingers atop the beer but stays very thin. 

Flavor:  Dark roasted malts, a touch of smoke from the roasted malts, and a rich creamy malt sugar flavor from the malts.   A low hop taste and a nice bit of bittering hops.  Balance is malty and the finish is chocolate, roasted malts and bittering from the Hops. 

Mouthfeel: Body is full, with medium/ high carbonation.   There is a strong alcohol warmth,  and the malt base provides a solid creamy mouthfeel that overshadows the level of carbonation.   There is astringency due to the bittering hops but more from the roasted malts.

S - Very pronounced chocolate, some chili spices (not overpowering though), vanilla, dark fruits.

T - Lots of chocolate on the palate. Very very chocolatey rich mixed in with some chili notes. Somehow, for me, the combo works. I’ve never had a stout with such a real pronounced chocolate notes. Sweet and spicy finish.

I mostly just sense the alcohol in the nose and get a bit of hops, and a little bit of the peppers. The taste is a mixed bag; sweet with a bit of alcohol warming the back-end; a little pepper bite on the tip of my tongue and that’s it for the spice; bit of chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Every now and then there is a slight burn in the back of my throat to remind me that there is peppers in this, but ever so slight. Very viscous and coats the tongue and mouth very nicely. Silky smooth. This is up there with the best in Imperial stouts, and a couple notches above DL.",4.6
24383,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Many thanks Al. Black color with a minimal and quickly diminishing beige head.

Flavor is slightly sweet, notes of coffee beans, where’s the alcohol?, OMG, awesome beer..., vanilla, roasty malts, light chili notes. The final is slightly sweet with roasty notes, notes of chili and ripe fruit. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel on palate. No doubt, one of my best beers I’ve ever tasted.",4.7

25108,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Thanks to drowland for this one, my 2000th rating. This immediately pours one of the most visually impressive brews I’ve ever seen, the color of tar and viscosity of oil with a turbid head the color of charred wood.  Nose is earthy and peppery, bakers chocolate, mild roast, molasses and a mild sweetness, coffee. Not nearly as forward or impressive as the flavor. Nice  pepper and bakers chocolate pairing in the flavor, coffee and roast, molasses, sweet, some grain bitterness, mild alcohol.

Pretty one-note and disappointing, given the gushing from previous rates over the smell. Taste is much better, with a bit of molasses sweetness up front, transitioning into some smoky roast, burnt charcoal, and a touch of peppery heat on the finish.

24961,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"750 ml bottle, courtesy of Bryan, thanks a lot!. An opaque pitch black beer with an averge sized, frothy, mostly lasting brown head. The aroma is moderately to heavily malty and lightly hoppy. There are notes of roasted grains, chocolate, caramel, dark fruits, berries, vanilla, peppers, chili and alcohol. The flavour is heavily sweet, lightly sour, lightly to moderately bitter. Heavily roasted malts, hot notes from peppers, with all the spices perfectly integrated in the beer, Creamy/thick mouthfeel, full body, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate to heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic. Wow, where to start? black viscous and impenetrable appearence, surprisingly long lasting foam, very seducing look. Awesomely balanced and complex flavour/palate, and above all original, peculiar, unusual, with the right amount of alcoholic feel and also quite dinkable for its strenght. I can’t thank enough Bryan for having sent me this jewel. I hope to taste again this beer in the future....




750 ml bottle, vintage 2011 (11,5% ABV). An absolutely opaque pitch black beer, with a large, frothy/creamy, lightly lacing, mostly lasting brown head. The aroma is heavily malty (roasted grain, chocolate/cocoa, maybe a touch of coffee), with notes of pepper/chili, vanilla, tobacco, dried dark fruits and alcohol. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/chewy/thick texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate bitterness, moderately alcoholic, moderately burning. Like a chocolate cake with chili, you can almost chew it. Perhaps even slightly better than the 2010, chili is rather noticeable, less is cinnamon, with vanilla in the middle. So far, along with Expedition, my favorite stout, and maybe American beer. Same rating of the 2010.",4.8

I can’t stop thinking about this one.  It really is that good.  I have had all the other top rated Imperial stouts, and this one DESTROYS them.  If you can get this one, do it.  Plan your next vacation around it.  The texture is mind boggling, the flavor so uncannily balanced, the subtle tingle of the pepper heat . . .

This beer is legendary.  And Cigar City will will be as well.  All their scores are totally legit and you need to drink the beers.",5.0
24385,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"From notes. 750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. 2014 vintage. The pour is a thick dirty motor oil black with a finger of dark mocha head that fades foam ring, leaving no lace behind. The aroma is beautiful. There is a ton of cinnamon in front of a light cocoa and a lot of vanilla. The chilies don't really dominate, but offer a good peppery spiciness that is incredibly well balanced. The cinnamon comes back and is delightful. I love the smell on this. The flavor is great. Copious amounts of cinnamon up front and they ease through a nice pepper transition into a soft cocoa and vanilla, before reentering the cinnamon realm. The fact that the chilies are reserved makes this so much better. The mouth feel is thick and viscous. Great carbonation help it just cling to the mouth in a never ending film. The aftertaste is all cinnamon and subtly it moves through a good chocolate and vanilla lingering finish. Damn good.

Not hard to tell the difference here, but both of them smell(s) amazing. Creamy as the smoothest cream with a lovely comfortable and spot on almost tingling carbonation level. Tons of espresso coffee and cocoa in the taste. And the chocolate is almost a bit to much for me (well, not really).

It/they end(s) with a clear stingy chili bite on the tongue(s?) as it’s/they’re gently gliding down the throat.

M: Huge body, sticky, oily.

Imperial Stout With Cacao & Spices Added. 50% Aged In Rum Barrels, 50% Aged In Apple Brandy Barrels.

Alkohol: 11% obj.

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy rozwścieczonego boga ognia Hun-Hunaphu

Piana: Beżowa, skromna o drobno ziarnistej strukturze. 
Głośno syczy i opada do niewielkiego paseczka. Na krawędziach TeKu pozostają punktowe plamki. 

Zapach: Jest miazga! Aromat rozpieprza na maksa. Na początek rum i rodzynki macerowane w tym szlachetnym trunku. Potem cała gamma suszonych owoców, kandyzowane jabłka, śliwki, morele i winogrona.
Zaraz po tym potworny cios prosto w twarz od ziaren kakaowca, gęstej mlecznej czekolady i belgijskich pralin. 
Knock out zapewnia szereg elementów toffi, kawy, rodzynek, cukru trzcinowego i przypraw korzennych.
Przepiękny bukiet!

Smak: Niewiarygodny beczkowy profil. Euforię smaków rozpoczyna szlachetny rum o jego mocnym i bezkompromisowym smaku, pełnym przypaw korzennych i drewna. Następnie wkracza z wielką werwą beczka po jabłkowej Brandy (czyli jak domniemam po Calvadosie) nadając trunkowi posmak pieczonej szarlotki.
Kolejne warstwy bukietu smaków to lawina czekolady, toffi, pralin belgijskich, trzciny cukrowej, drewna, rodzynek i toffi.
Ostatnia prosta należy z całą pewnością do przypraw z których najbardziej wyróżnia się chilli, stawiając kropeczkę nad „i”, poszczypując w gardle. 
Alkohol jest obecny, rozgrzewa, trochę mąci w głowie, ale na szczęście nie ma ciepłego, rozpuszczalnikowego charakteru i nie wychodzi przed szereg.
Ciała Double Barrel Hunaphu’s nie brakuje.
Dostojny, szlachetny charakter trunku zapewni wiele minut udanej, owocnej degustacji.

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

Nareszcie!! Hunahpu’s (kilka roczników) - NIE! Bourbon Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s - NIE!
I dopiero Double Barrel Hunahpu’s - zdecydowanie TAK! 

Przecudowne piweczko dające tyle radości i satysfakcji z degustacji!
Głęboki profil smakowy i zapachowy, oszałamiające beczki po Rumie i Calvadosie.
Balans, głębia, różnorodność, klasa i szyk.

Najlepsze piwo w dorobku Cigar City Brewing!

Double Barrel Hunahpu’s 2016

Bottle Share @ Browariat, Katowice (12.10.2019)

Wciąż fajne, złożone piweczo. Cynamon w połączeniu z papryczkami chilli daje mocno pikantny finisz. Trochę jabłka, drewna, brandy,wanilii. 

Trochę gorzej niż za pierwszym razem 4.3",4.6
6002,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Thanks to the reverend and Prazak. Apple brandy comes out great in the aroma. So tasty. The cinnamon in 2014 comes out great in the taste. Probably one of the best beers I have ever had. Lives up to the hype.,4.8
5913,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Poured from a bomber into a wine glass. Dark pour, but not motor oil like. Little head. Very boozy aroma (more of brandy than rum) with moderate soy saucey smell. Flavor is terrific, as expected. The beer is quite sweet, but not cloying or overwhelming like dark lord. The blended barrels work well, though I do think the brandy is much more prominent. The chilis are faded a little bit compared to regular Hunahpu but that is to be expected with so much going on. Despite the huge smith of flavors in this beer it has a unified coherent flavor. Really great stuff.",4.8

6005,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Thanks Geoff for cracking this open! Pours a dark, iodine coating the glass, brown black with a very slight mocha tan collar. Minimal carbonation. Heavy. Aroma is spice and somewhat reminds me of a holiday beer. Dark chocolate notes as well. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Lots going on, sweet start followed by the spice of chili and then transitions to a more earthy barrel note. 4oz was fine for me. Not sure I could drink a whole lot of this.",3.6

5982,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"> A total overhaul of Hunahpu creates Perennial BA Abraxas


[ Bottle ][ vacax ][ 750ml ][ 10K+OT Tasting ][ Stemless Wine Taster ][ 5/3/14 ]

>> Thanks Jake for this one! Pours ink like other Hunahpu’s with layer of weak, read foam. Stains the glass. Nose on this one is instantly the best of any Hunahpu variant: guajillo pepper, cinnamon, ancho chili, vanilla, graham cracker, rum raisin, dry rubbed skirt steak. Taste is also instantly the best of any Hunahpu by a long shot, in fact, this beer is so much better than previous Hunahpu’s that it is clear this is a complete recipe overhaul to transform this beer from an ashy, sour, thin mess to something 99% identical to Perennial Abraxas. Gone is that extreme sourness from over mashed black patent malt. Now there is rich, melted sea salted dark chocolate, assertive chili pepper deep heat from ancho chilis. Previous Hunahpu’s had near a smidgen of chili heat. Palate is rich and viscous instead of ashy and watery. This is a major overhaul and easily the best Hunahpu out there. Now the question is, why is this rated so much higher than BA Abraxas? I’ll give you one guess.


>!< what if CCB and another brewery made an identical beer? Would they be rated the same?",4.5
5779,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"750ml bottle shared with Ben, Seb, Jo and Edith. Aroma: anice, apples, spices, oak, light milk chocolate. App: dark brown, minimal brown head but good retention and nice lacing. Taste and palate: medium body, nice apple touch in mouth, great spicy and bitter finish. Overall: much prefer this version over the regular version. Really enjoy the apples and those spices burning my throat. This is really complex. Awesome!",4.4
6045,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Holy balls, best variant of hunahpu variant ever. Incrdidbly complex flavors. The port barrels plays so nice with the chocolate chili flavors of the base beer. Perfect chili stout.",4.9
6027,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle at the house by myself. Nose is big brandy and cinnamon notes with some dark chocolate. Flavor is brownies, cinnamon, rum and brandy. Pour is ridiculously thick and stains all glasses dark ass brown. A winner.",4.3
5985,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours black with low deep tan head. Aroma of muscovado, dates, prunes, liqeur, port barrel. Taste is big, bold barrel sweet, hints of cocos. Body is rich and sticky with soft carbonation.

5741,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Sample. Black, holographic red-brown lace. Extremely rich broad roast, chocolate, chilli, melted praline, peanuts.

5900,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"750 ml bottle to taster at NatiFest (BIG thanks to jstax!). Looks good; a viscous very dark cola with thin mocha head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells great; dark malt, molasses, and brandy with a bit of rum in the background. Tastes like it smells with even more of a cocoa presence. The expensive kind of cocoa that you’d expect to find in a gourmet chocolate store. A touch of dark coffee woven in. Exceptionally smooth. Fantastic stuff!",4.4
5830,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"#5000. BIG thanks to digita7693 who generously shared this @ Leuven Innovation Beer Festival. The perfect beer for 5000 – one of my biggest wants for 5000 actually – I never thought that I was going to actually try this one. Many thanks for all the great company & beers during the course of all the previous ratings, festivals, tastings etc. Back when I started out trying beers many years ago, I thought that didn’t like beer because all that I knew was pale lager & the occasional Duvel. Tired of always drinking pale lager I decided to try some other beers & for a long time I tried one or two new ones per week at a bar near the university. They had about 40 beers I thought that there must be only about 100 – 200 beers in the world and that outside of Belgium they were all pale lagers. I decided to try nearly all of the beers in the world, as time went on I realized just how wrong I was… Back when I realized just how many beers there were in the world, I thought that trying more like 5000 would be impossible for me over a lifetime,… Turns out I was very wrong. Anyway as for the beer itself…. Deep dark black, looks very viscous, some mocha bubbles but they are quickly gone. Nose is huge thick, spirit-like, huge rum & brandy I suppose, very spirit-like so maybe brandy dominates a big, thick chocolate sludge, warming, chocolate syrup, deep black chocolate, huge oak & spirit presence, almost hot,… Taste is surprisingly cinnamon forward, by far the most of the Hunahpu’s I have tried so far, rich spirit, chocolate syrupy, warming high quality alcohol, black chocolate, very viscous, light espresso, very thick brownie dough, hugely thick & viscous, creamy, warming, thick exotic sugar,… Insanely thick & high quality spirit lingers on afterwards. Impressive, Stranahan still probably remains my favourity. Very happy to have tried one of my biggest wants.",4.8
5972,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Tap @ CBC, 2014. Pours mega black with a creamy head. Cookies, crackers, fudge, spices and good coffee. Some rhuminraisin. Smooth and soft like velvet. Quite intense. Yes..",4.3

5790,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Sample at Denver Rare Beer Tasting VIII on 10/07/2016. Pitch black pour with a thin light brown head that recedes gradually to a film. Patchy lacing. Coffee, rum, malt and chocolate aroma. Full-bodied with flavors of rum, cinnamon-infused brandy, chocolate malt, vanilla and apple. Just a touch of chili pepper. The finish is spiced rum and chocolate. Very good all around.",4.4
5966,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,On tap at rustico. Pours thick black with low dark tan head. Aroma is big sweet booze roast with light spice. Taste is very rich roast and chocolate with big port barrel notes and a light cinnamon and pepper finish.,4.6
6021,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle shared with, and thanks to, the Great Damico. Bottle came as the result of some excellent reconnaissance at Hunahpu’s Day. Pours a dark black color with a thick chocolate head that breaks down quickly. The head retention is amazing for a barrel aged brew. Aroma of chocolate roast, dark fruit, apple, pepper, vanilla, and hints of breadiness. Really intoxicating. A sweet chocolate taste with notes of chili, vanilla, and slight cinnamon. A nice layer of heat from the pepper. Wow. It really is hard to say whether this or the base version is better. So much complexity. So much happening during the first 3 seconds on the tongue. Just another amazing brew that I likely will never be fortunate to drink again. Kudos to Redner and a big thanks to Damico.",4.9
5901,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"750ml bottle, thanks to jstax for sharing this at Natifest! Black color. Minimal ring of brown head. Wonderful nose... Apple brandy comes through nicely, plays well with the rest of the hunahpu flavors. Dark chocolate, cinnamon in the nose. I spent several minutes just smelling this. Bigger body. Good chewy thicker texture to this, slightly syrupy. Just a very light peppery kick in the finish. Moderate to bigger bitter taste. Some light heat to it. Moderate sweet. Fantastic tasty complex imperial stout. Great coffee in the aftertaste, and light pepper finish. Thanks for sharing this one Jeremy!",4.2
5870,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(Bottle) Pours black with a small dark brown head. The aroma holds heavy malt, chocolate, vanilla alongside well integrated tones from the the barrels. All spices are balanced as well. Quite meaty nose. The flavour is near heavily sweet, medium bitter and tiny acidic. Well balanced. The mouthfeel is fat and oily with a light carbonation. Meaty, vanilla-ish, chocolaty and barrel-drown finish. Full bodied.",4.5

5918,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Draught at CBC. Nose of sweet, dark chocolates and a significant smell of coconut. Solid black colour with a small brown head. Taste is sweet, dried fruits and again the very noticeable note of coconut. Palate is prefect. Lingers just enough to be pleasant and leaves you wishing for more. One of the best beer I’ve ever had.",4.8
6018,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pour from bottle at What the Funk!? 2014. Appearance is dark viscous car oil with a frothy brown head. Big rich dark chocolate, huge spice - vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon - brandy, sweet roasted toffee, oak, and coffee. Taste is again thick and rich dark cocoa, balanced by sweet vanilla, roast, and spice. Amazingly complex - with cinnamon and spice, light chili peppers, fudge brownies, espresso, and wood. Luscious, velvety mouthfeel with soft carbonation. No real heat from the peppers except on the back-end, that rounds it out beautifully. Every time I have Hunahpu or one of its variations I’m completely blown away and this beer is no exception. Delicious chocolate spice cake.",4.6
5962,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"12oz pour at Rustico Ballston. Pours a very inky black with a ring of red head. Nose has a ton of molasses, big cinnamon stick, black pepper, malt, heavy raisin, some booze, some burnt caramel, some caramel apple, dried cherry, port. Flavors are nice, super smooth and very well blended, sweet, sticky molasses, brown sugar, malt, Kahlua, some maple sap, soy, black pepper, some condensed cola, indiscriminate wood, mild sherry.

5854,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"750 ml bottle thanks to BoBoChamp! Pours jet black, slick, viscous. Barely any head. Low carbonation. Aroma is huge, bursting with chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, vanilla, dark rum, apple brandy, a bit burned, hint of peppers. Not too boozy. Flavour is tremendous. Sweet chocolate start with a cavalcade of flavours following. Notes of cinnamon, vanilla, smoked peppers, toasted oak, coconut, dark fruits, berries. Spices come through nicely but are not overpowering. Thick but silky mouthfeel. Probably too extreme for some, but right up my alley!",4.3
5831,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Courtesy of Martinus at Leuven Innovation Beer Festival the first time I had this, big thanks for this one. Almost no head, some loose beige bubbles which quickly disappear (probably because this precious bottle has been opened and resealed over and over again), colour a very dark burgundy, near black. Absolutely wonderful aroma of infinite complexity: a strong perfume of noble chocolate, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon, hint of dried soft chili pepper, espresso, soy sauce, bayleaf, candied dates, old port and old sherry, marzipan, banana liqueur... Truly incredible. Taste is equally amazing, a symphony of candied fruits, slight salty soy sauce accents, sweet marzipan and ’Bounty’ candy coconut plus chocolate, caramel and tons of chocolate fondant, all playing in a thick, heavy, profound texture; finish has more bitter chocolate and fine coffee in store, enriched with a vinous, warming alcohol effect of the finest brandy or single malt you can find, still a very faint hint of chili and peppery hops drying a bit and leaving you flabbergastered as if you just swallowed the most precious liquid ever made. This belongs to the most complex, most rewarding and most satisfying things I ever tasted.  I felt privileged enough being able to taste this whale the first time, but I had double luck in encountering it (from a younger and later batch) a second time at B.U.M.B.A. yesterday - this time adorned with a moussy, pale beige head and with a somewhat 'fresher' aroma, which was so incredibly stunning that I have no choice but to grant this a perfect score.  I cannot honestly see how a stout, or any top-fermented beer for that matter, could get any better than this...",5.0
5889,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle via unknown, bottle share at de Garde. Pours an evil looking thin brown, not much head.

5758,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Batch 2. Thanks Virby44 for sharing the bottle! Poured into a snifter showing pitch black with very thin translucent brown rims and very sparse latte colored foam. 

The nose shows strong rum influence with moderately intense fruit forward notes of apple and cinnamon. 

The palate is oily, slick, and well carbonated. Cinnamon forward spiciness with a strong rum background throughout. Mid-palate warms up with chilies, followed by light notes of baked apple, finished by more apple, cinnamon, and a moderate coffee bitterness to tie it off. Moderate spiciness throughout.",3.9
5875,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle shared with friends at GABF. Pitch black pour with dark mocha head. Nose of chocolate, barrel notes, cinnamon, and other spices. Taste follows the knows with a more subdued spice presence that has kept me from enjoying both the regular version and other BA versions. Not sure why. Maybe the Apple Brandy. Regardless, this beer is worthy of the hype and that is coming from someone who is not a fan of any variant I have had to date.

5726,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Batch 2 750ml bottle.  Pours a pitch black color that looks like thick motor oil and capped by a small tan layer of foam that shows good retention before settling into a thin film. Looks as menacing as ever like Hunaphu’s always did.  The aroma shows notes of dark chocolate, cinnamon, toasted nuts, and earthy chili peppers over a very dark roasted malt base with hints of old oak, and spicy rum notes.  I’m not getting much from the Apple brandy barrel.  The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon up front and backed up by the earthy chili peppers that adds some heat on the back end. The barrel presence is minimal and there is some oxidation from the age, but the alcohol is fairly restrained.  Full bodied and fairly smooth with subtle carbonation that leads to a dark chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy chili peppers on the finish with some lingering notes of rum and oak.  Interesting enough for sure and the Huna are all still there but the barrels don’t really bring everything together like I was hoping for and the barrel expression isn’t quite as pronounced as I would like.  Nowhere close to the greatness that was Batch 1, but still a good imperial stout that is worth trying if you can finda bottle.",4.1
5890,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottled. Pours pitch black with a small creamy, lacing tan head.

5849,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"An imperial stout which easily lives up to the stringent qualities ascribed to it. Deep, complex, a very broad, full mouthfeel.

Aroma of cinnamon, rum, almost a little nutty, some fruity notes and apple. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild bitterness. Lots of cinnamon, caramel, toffee, some chocolate and finishes with a moderate chili burn. You do get some rum barrel sweetness and just a hint of brandy.

5911,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle. Huge thanks to the local group for sharing this with me. Pours deep black, very dense. Very little head on the pour but still looks awesome. Aroma is ridiculously good. Can smell it from a couple feet away. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, berries, vanilla, cinnamon, soy, and marshmallow. Tastes just as incredible as the aroma. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, chocolate syrup, cinnamon, light smokey peppers, and a hint of dried dark fruit. Perfect mouthfeel as well. Very low carbonation makes this extremely smooth and allows the huge flavors to stand out. I’ve had a couple days to think about this beer and I’m convinced it’s the best beer I’ve ever had.

6038,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Huge thanks to DocJ007 for sharing this one with us tonight. Happy birthday buddy!!




A - Pours jet black with a small film of tan head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Pretty much dead flat almost instantly.




S - Smells of milk chocolate, chili spices, vanilla beans, cinnamon, spicy rum and fruity brandy warmth. Everything that should be present is there and shining brightly.




T - Starts off with a mix of cinnamon and chili spices quickly being joined by the milk chocolate, vanilla and toffee sweetness. The spicy rum and fruity brandy match perfectly with the base flavors. Finish is spicy sweet with some mild booze burn, lingering long after the finish.




M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. Slick, spicy feel with a bit of heat at the end of each sip. Just needs more carbonation and it would be amazing.




O - This is a pretty incredible beer. The two barrels blend very well together and complement the base flavors amazingly well. I would still take the Apple Brandy version over this one but it is closer than any of the other variants I have had to date.",4.5
6012,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle: Huge thanks to Travis & Tommy for splitting this with me. Black, black, black & oily as fuck, topped with a velvety, fine mocha cream that lasts exceedingly long for a stout. This beer is a bowl Cinnamon Toast Crunch & Teddy Grahams covered in vanilla drizzle, fudge, & sweet Apple Brandy sauce. Chocolate, roast, sweet brandy, vanilla, cinnamon, mild coffee, graham cracker.... Only thing I don’t get is the chili peppers, I’m guessing the barrels have swallowed them whole. I don’t mind, though, because they might interfere with the decadence of this brew. Thick, chewy, creamy; this is a very big beer on the palate. A dessert beer to the max, fantastic all around.



Update: After having this quite a few more times thanks to many generous BA’s, as well as some local tasting groups, I have to bump the score up. This just gets better & better. Molten  Chips Ahoy & Teddy Graham cookies with cinnamon graham cracker, apple brandy, vanilla bean chips & dark fudge drizzle. This is truly an excellent beer.",4.6

Leaves strong lacing and a boozy rim when stirred. Smells veryyyy strong. It hits me as I pour it out into the glass. Sweet barrel with spicy chilli peppers. Some spiced rum as well round it out. Some roast and dark chocolate notes and a boozy finish on the nose. Tastes extremely smooth. Hot and sweet chilli peppers with cinnamon all over. The barrel wood is pronounced and delicious. Rum sweetness and earthy roastiness. Spice, roast, booziness and a little sweet apple. The barrel finish is unreal. This body is second to none. So full and enveloping. Amazing. Love it.",4.6
6034,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"HMOG 2014. Was super exciting to get to try this one. And it did not let down. Out of all the beers on this day, this one was the most in your face, complex and over-the-top flavored. The spice is only mild, but the rum and brandy are separately noticeable. Vanilla, still a hint of coffee, but just a thick crazy barrel aging. This was just one of those wow beers.",4.6
5950,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Tap sample at CBC 2014. Jet black body, small caramel head. Aroma is cocoa, brown sugar, rum, mild brandy tones, coffee, vanilla, hints of baked bread, wood, nuts, mild burnt sugar, caramel and toffee. Taste is an amazing explosion of coffee, cocoa, vanilla, coconut, roasted apples, wood, licorice, dark chocolate, syrup and hints of chili, cinnamon and caramel. Wow. Breathtaking in conplexity and balance alike. Smooth, oily body, soft carbonation. A really amazing treat, glad I got to try this splendid masterpiece of an ale. :-)",4.8

Hard to understand how they can pack so much chocolate, licorice, barrel (not too much though) chili, vanilla and slight booze into a beer. There is some pretty noticable coffee and coconut in here too. It’s really rich this one. The mouthfeel is thick but manageable. The flavour is insane too. It’s like regular Hunahs beefed up big brother with some complex barrel character on the side. Please give this time to settle in the glass, open up and reveal itself, cause if you treat Hunah just right, it could give you a craftbeer boner! Fo realz. It’s dat gewd!",4.6
14050,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Happily shared at Choice City in Fort Collins. Beer poured a medium, hazy caramel brown without a head to really speak of. The first impression on the nose: sweet, warm, caramel apple lovies on toast, yet so much more. One of a handfull of beers I’ve ever had that create a transcendant experience of beauty. The kind where the sum of the parts combine to create a divine whole that overwhelms and makes the world fall away with the sound of a down comforter being dropped to the ground. The aroma was malty with moderate toasted grain, heavy, warm, sticky, drippy caramel, moderate-to-heavy cookie notes; Hoppy with mellow moderate herb note, trace note of resin and pine and a light note of lemon zest; Yeasty with moderate funky notes of attic and cellar, light cookie doughiness; Moderate-to-heavy green apple peel and simmered apple, vanilla-heavy oak,moderate warm, spicy alcohol, lightly vinous on the back of a deep inhale. The flavor was heavily sweet (not sticky or cloying in the least), lightly to moderately acidic, warm and  lightly bitter. The finish was warm, moderately sweet, lightly bitter. ABV cloaked in the sweet, warm folds. The body was full, the texture was velvety/syrupy and the carbonation was soft.  Thanks for sharing this BeerandBlues2, Mrs. BeerandBlues2 and Ernest. This experience was all the better for having good friends beaming back the same shit-eating grin over this treasure.",5.0

Massive caramel, dark fruit, nectar fruit, dough, grapes, maple syrup, brown sugar, plum, and fig. The alcohol simply isn’t noticeable. The palate is perfect- massively viscous with a sticky coating mouthfeel that doesn’t ever quit. Absolutely divine.",4.8
14156,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottled, 2000 version.

Pours thick and deep amber with no head. The aroma is heavenly and arousing. It strikes like a fina muscat wine, there's notes of wood and cherry and so much else I couldn't keep track on. As it warms it becomes more port like and developed peppery notes. There is loads of malt to balance it, and the body is firm and dense and with tremendous depth. It is sweet, sure, but never strikes me as syrupy or sticky just perfectly balanced. The finish is velvetty and oaky. This is as close to perfection as it goes, and this is arguably the best beer I've ever sampled.",4.9
14146,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Much clearer than I would have anticipated. Sweet cherry, cane sugar, vanilla, oak and very much like a thinnish barleywine. High alcohol apparent everywhere. If it wasn't for the finish, I couldn't give it as strong a score...I love the melting finish of sweetness, the bordeaux cask comes through strongly, and there is fantastic stinging pepper. I owe a great debt of gratitude to a RateBeerian who picked this up for me, making an extra trip in the process. The finish is amazing...let this guy warm up and you have a liquid mix of a wonderful red wine, cane sugar, and sharp, focused white pepper. Outstanding. But pretty sweet.......Also the strongest beer I have had in a great great while. One glass and you will be reeeeeeling.",4.1

14132,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Glassy light bronze.  Pasty white foam of tiny bubbles.  Vinous cherry tinge, juicy crystal malt, candied grape skin, medicine, and leather, atop a trace of earth and musty wood.  Light acidic feel up front.  Soft, lightly velverty carbonation; full bodied.  Beautiful, sweet plummy malt profile, followed by leather and grape skin.  Mildly bitter prune notes.  Lingering spicy medicinal cherry flavors alongside soft notes of wood, plum, leather, and intertwined rich nutty/bready malts.  Semi-coarse alcoholic textures and a mild, tingly sourness brush the back of throat.  Perfect level of acidity to counter the trademark Stille Nacht sweetness.  This showcases some of the most delicous malt flavors I've experienced.  The 12% abv is masterfully hidden.",4.5

14098,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerpen, Belgium. I thought this beer seemed a little expensive, at 20 euros for the 750 mL bottle, but regardless I had to try it. 

Golden. 

Very pleasant nose. Complex. Dryness and fruitiness of the bordeaux barrels along with notes of pears, apples and various cane sugars.

Everything I was hoping it would be. Fruity throughout. Front is melon and pears. Mid-palate is full of notes of lemon. The finish is lovely, finishing with various sugars, cinnamon and oak.",4.3
13985,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Probably the best bonus ever. Honestly, are you kidding? Oteyj, jblauvs, and I are about to enjoy this to the absolute fullest. Pours a murky, brownish orange with a small bubbly head, nice lacing that renews incredibly well considering how old this stuff is. Aroma is incredible: tons of nectar fruit like apricot and nectarine, great sweet vinous notes, wood from the barrel aging, raisin and other dark fruits, and some angel food cake and Belgian yeast. Flavor is absolutely freakish. Huge notes of maple candy, nectarine, grape, caramel, brown sugar, plum, raisin, and wine-- so sweet, but so unbelievably good. Palate is obscenely smooth; 12% ABV what? This beer left my mouth agape, my jaw on the floor, and my love of Belgian beers renewed. Could be my favorite beer ever.",4.8
14020,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Huge thanks to hopdog for the bottle, Rating #2000!!  Poured clear, fiery medium orange initially (progressively more hazy with subsequent pours).. loose dusting and larger bubbles of off-white head around the edges. 

 The aroma was just exquisite.. definitely a solid dose of Bordeaux influence over a sweet, supple base.. the underlying beer mellowed out considerably, leaving sweet caramel, toffee, and a delicate bouquet of light fruits (peaches, apricots, and some vinous influence).. deeper oak and Bordeaux undertones as well.. almost a sweet bourbon in there too. 

 The flavor begain with an array of sweet lighter fruits, sour oak, and grape skins, followed by warm caramel and toffee on the middle (accented by warm clove and other Christmas-ey spices).. warm back-end with a touch of oak and a bunch more vinous.. very long, warm, sweet and complex finish. 

 Warm and entirely fulfilling on the palate with great balance between sweet fruits, sour barrel influence and grapes, and alcohol warmth.  This was entirely what I needed.  Thank you Steve!!",4.6
14006,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Orange color, slight head rims the glass. Aroma similiar to sherry mixed with a yeasty bread.

Excellent!",4.0

Quite a lot of flavors packed in the taste. Sweet and tingly. Taste has sweet grain, brown sugar. Lots of Belgian grain and some aged fruits. Most definitely a sipper and wonderfully enjoyed.",4.7

14113,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Poured out of 750 mL bottle, shared with friends at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel, CA, 10/15/03.  Unbelievable.  Probably the best beer I've ever had, and sure to remain one of the truly great beers that I'll ever have.  Pours to a mostly transparent golden brown apple cider colour with a medium head that mostly fades and leaves little lacing.  Nose is of heaven.  Meaning of oak, oak, malt, oak, some fruit, candy, and a little oak.  Taste is of sweet stinging malt, incredible bright oak, light and fruity, like a sweet delicious juicy cork.  Absolutely fantastic.  Notes of walnut and pecan from the oak and sweet candy sugar after years of aging.  Smooth and wonderfully balanced, velvety and long-finishing.  I liked the regular Stille Nacht a whole lot, but this stuff is absolutely out-of-this-world.  If I could ever get my hands on another bottle, I'd love it like it was a sweet virgin.",4.9
14082,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle at the 4/17/2005 Montreal tasting, shared with Rastacouere, Muzzlehatch, Tiggmtl, MartinT, Beerbuzzmontreal, Olivier and Simon.  Sipped while cooincidentally listening to the Beatles’ ""I want you"".  Aroma bursts forth from the bottle a full, intense and divine creation of sensory stimulants.  So good, the bottle was passed around and people waited in line to get ""seconds"" of smelling the bottle.  I described the aroma as ""just pure goodness"" but I will try to elaborate on that.  Fully rounded, never sharp notes of soft oak woodiness, red berries, soft grapes, caramel, toffee, sweet cherries, marzipan, maple, vanilla, subtle yet strong Belgian yeast, touches of light dough/honey and a bit of drying tannins for balance.  Wow.  Appearance is a thick-looking vibrant auburn-copper-amber color, with lacing as the small white head quickly recedes (no doubt 5 years in the cellar, oak aging, and a high alcohol).  Can the flavor live up to the aroma? It’s possible, I dare to think.  And to some extent, it does.  The flavor of a beer, in my mind, is a much more difficult beast to control and perfect, having to meld balance, mouthfeel and actual taste altogether perfectly.  Perhaps I am just an easier judge of aroma, but it seems easier to imagine a perfect aroma than a perfect flavor.  That being said, there was a little less intensity to the flavor than the aroma, some very light oxidation, a touch of dryness where it dosent belong and maybe a slight receding of firm, thick maltiness.  But this is criticism the beer brings upon itself.  I think near-perfect beers are easier to find faults with, being so close to perfect.  It is easy to hold them to a higher level, created by their sheer magnificence.  The malt is nonetheless, thick, rich, creamy and filling.  Candied apples, soft notes of smoked cinnamon, vanilla, syrupy cherry liqueur of the finest variety.  Bits of dry barley, light maple, playful Bordeaux wine fruitiness and light oak, never overdone, on the finish.  Distinct Belgian nuances from the yeast, light raisins, dates, plums and delicate brown sugar.  Perfect mouthfeel, full and not thin ever, but yet so easily drinkable for me.  Alcohol gives some warmth as it goes down, but does not show anywhere near 12%.  A most treasured experience, drinking this beer, and hopefully, with some luck, one I will have again.  Score is very difficult to give on this as far as flavor and overall,  I could easily justify a perfect score, especially taking in to account the graceful way this has aged.  But I will discount the flavor a point, and see what I think next time I have it.",4.9
14042,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"750ml - one of only 1920 bottles produced and aged in Saint Julien Bordeaux casks, thereafter bottled in 2002.  Heady aroma fills the nose with a rich, sugary, honeyish malt sweetness, various tangy, tropical and citrus fruits including pineapple, white grape, orange and juicy green apple, along with some earthy, lightly dusty, woody and herbal tones, dried flowers, a slightly musty and estery yeast presence and a certain peppery alcoholic spiciness, all atop a lightly vinous backdrop that does give betray some notion of the aging vessel and the impetus behind the idea.  Gorgeous deep rosy amber color, slightly hazy, with coppery highlights and a lasting, fine, creamy head accompanied by some fairly intricate lacing.  Flavor profile is equally complex and satisfyingly powerful, with suggestions of candied pears, golden raisin and apricot jam, followed by a light amount of spicy bitterness and warming alcohol, finishing with a degree of drying acidity, a blend of peppery spices and some lingering, fairly strong winey touches here and there.  Silky smooth and lightly sticky on the palate with a hugely full body to support the gratifying palette of flavors found here.  Many thanks to Murph who supplied me with this particular bottle back in the summer of 2003. This has been cellared since that time and of course, had been annually in danger of being consumed, however after tasting it certainly seems able to endure a far longer slumber.",4.3

14079,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"05.22.05  750 shared at jimmack04 invitational.  The third time I’ve had this brew and each time is better than the first.  This beer, each time I enjoy it, produces another one of those magical beer moments where it’s almost impossible to pick up the pen to write any notes.  The first two times I’ve had it, I didn’t even bother, this time I knocked off at least something to make it official...This beer is a 30 year old wood aged port in disguise.  In fact, nothing from Bordeaux has ever come close to what De Dolle managed to extract from this wood.  Honey colored and wonderfully viscous with an unfortunately sudsy, sort of soapy head, but at least it still shows some carbonation despite its age and size.  Color and clarity are gorgeous.  The body is pure silk.  Forget every other time I said a brew had a velvet or silken palate.  I was an idiot.  This brew glides on Apollo’s wings across the palate, pure love.  The flavor embodies all that is ancient wooded port, hints of sherry, dry spices.  It’s a Christmas vigil with the fireworks of the 4th of July.  It’s sweet, savory, and deep, while its still making a sweet case for attention.  Hell, it’s too good to deal with the pen in my hands; it takes two hands to control this snifter.",5.0

Tasting Notes

Aroma: Doughy, fruity, hint of vinegar and honey.

Appearance: Cloudy gold color.

Flavor: This is a truly complex beer.  Everything is so subtle and well-blended.  Amazing flavor that is very difficult to describe.  Light caramel and honey sweetness, bread, sour apples and some vinegar, hint of wood complexity. 

Palate: Medium-full body.  Creamy and milky texture.

Overall: Spectacular beer.  I really wish I could get my hands on a bottle of stuff!  It is so intense and complex and would be prefect to sit and enjoy for hours!",4.4

Maple frosting. Flavor is a nice, fully synergized fusion of caramel, purple grape juice, overripe apricot, sweet red Napa zinfandel. Nice gooey viscosity.

Bottle poured fast as expected, thanks fully Denim Dave, found me in the bathroom and I got to try a quite small taste out of his glass.  Thats more of this beer than most people will ever get to try and that makes me happy.  Pour is orange with a bright white ring.  Nose is sweet.  Taste is sweet, rich with lots of dark fruits, EPIC!!!!!!",4.7

14047,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"[Bottled, Akkurat in Stockholm charged 896 SEK]
Hazy charneol colour, big airy head. Big, breathtaking aroma from mouldy cheese, fruits, berries, milk chocolate, oranges and candied sugar. Thick, concentrated flavour profile, light woody, good sweetness as always with De Dolle, raisins, plum, berries, cheeses, dried fruits. Vineous. Well hidden abv. Smooth mouthfeel. Fantastic beer.",4.5

13993,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"bottle provided by bu11zeye.  as soon as this was opened you could smell the aroma fill the room.  there was a long silence right after opened that i felt the need to break by asking a dumb question.  i think the silence occured 44 minutes into the tasting.  this poured a murky amberish/orange with somewhat of a white head and when swirled could see the legs standing along the glass.  aroma was a fruit basket with pear and orange followed by some honey, fingernail polish, and cinnamon.  flavor was honey, pear, little citrus, and some alcohol was apparent.  body was full with low carbonation and some slickness.  very nice indeed and glad to of had the opportunity to try it.",4.0
13983,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Rating #2000 Original rating from about 2 years ago. I was lucky to have this again just recently thanks to chrisq, but sadly that bottle just hadn’t quite held up nearly as well. It was a bit more oxidized and seemed rather muted. 

 Bottle shared with 3/4 and kmweaver. Sweet vinous nose, lots of candied red fruits, toffee and caramel in abundance, light oxidation. Sweetness is upfront on the taste, but it’s not overwhelming, alcohol is there, but kept in check. Caramel and toffee is lightly oxidized producing a sherry note along with a bit of figs and raisins. The red fruits are still very bright and vibrant. Finish is oaky and tannic with a bit of vanilla.  An amazing treat. Thanks for sharing guys!",4.2
13945,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"@ A day to sink all seasheppards. Thnx for sharing, everyone !! Pours unclear amber, not much head. Smell is very complex. oak up first. Than some yoghurty aspects, followed by some oxidation. taste is very full, sharp, sour notes. Over an oaky, fruity, barrelfunk, yoghurty taste. Aftertaste is very light ( for the age ) oxidation. Veyr nice indeed !",4.3
14036,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"I’ve had this beer saved for 3 years and finally decided to drink it for #1000. Opaque red color with a small off-white head. Aromas of vanilla, fruit, wood, yeast, sweetness and sour. Flavor is very fruity, with some sweetness and sour. More complex than I can describe, but all the flavors are well balanced.",4.6
14022,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,This generously provided bottled brew from Mike Sprinkle on Dark Lord Day poured a head of frothy fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a hazy uncarbonated orange brown colored body. The strong aroma was spicy and malt hop. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish. The complex yummy flavor contained notes of mild spice and malt hop. Delicious and one I would certainly like to drink again but will probably never get trhe chance to sample this sought after brew again.,4.1
14004,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"I normally don’t post, but this is to brag.  Had this tonight, and it was amazing.  Has a great, Chardonnay like aroma and flavor, which is probably due to the oak aging, and 8 years.  Very different from the 05 reserva, but in my opinion better.  It doesn’t have the hotness that I remember from the 05 and is very smooth.  It also had a very slight tartness to it that was very refreshing.  The bottle I drank this from is now a very nice trophy for me!  If you can try this, I would highly recommend it.",4.8
14139,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"I dont remember much of last night..but i do remember being warmed by this big, bold, enormous, gigantic, colossal beer...It poured golden, almost clear, and sporting a thin halo of suds along the edge of the glass..an aroma of apples, sourness, alcohol, orange peel, and cider vinegar lifted from the glass as flavors of apple spice, yeast, cinnamon, and sugary sweetness played around the enormous alcohol heat...",3.9
14021,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Not my favorite from De Dolle.  But like their other brews, this is totally original.  Sweet?  Crazy intensely sweet.  Definitely good idea to put a couple of year on the Stille Nacht.",4.2
14116,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Thick, almost syrupy, lots of ethanol.  A very strong wine profile is present here.  Nose is sweet with cotton candy aromas.  The beer finishes sweet like a dessert wine.  Alcohol noticeable in the finish, as are estery notes of apples and pears.  Im glad this beer had a few years to cellar or it would definitely be too sweet I think.",4.1
13953,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,Bottle at Madmitch 20k tasting. Hazy amber. Some white bubbles. Some sherry tawny port. Stands up very well. Good port fruit. Some sweetness some dryness. Touch of tobacco. Interesting.,3.8

Very happy to have had a chance to try this one..",4.4
14072,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"750 ml bottle. It’s been a few years since I tasted this one, but the memory of it is crystal clear, so I’ll rate it anyway (and of course I have my tasting notes to support it as well). Sampled at the 24Uhr festival in Antwerp in 2002. 
Pours a dark brown with a fine lasting head. The glass is exploding with light chocolate and dried figs, dates and raisins. Loads of oriental spices and vanilla. In fact this beer is a liquid version of an English Christmas Cake. The mouthfeel is one of an extremely fullbodied beer with a lot of sweetness that is yet perfectly balanced by the afterburn of alcohol. This is an exceptional beer!!!! No doubt one of the 1-2 best beers I’ve ever had, which is why I managed to taste it 4 times during the festival with consistent tasting notes. So yes, my rating will be a clean-cut no-nonsense 5.0, but that is only because the scale stops there..........",5.0
14041,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Courtesy of Tom Peiters at Monk’s Cafe, thanks Tom! Vibrant aroma of candied fruits, white pepper, vintage port blended with moscato, yeast, licorice and vanilla. Also subtle hints of raisins, incredibly sweet malts, dry hickory,  the bottling floor at Domaine De La Romanee Conti. Taste is utterly magnificent. Honey, icing from an oreo ice cream cake, spicy relleno and pear/apricot jellies. Also lingering tastes of bread, anise, molasses, candy sugar. Sourness is as pleasant as I’ve found in an aged Belgian. Finish is absolutely monstrous, ten miles long, holding my palate hostage without a ransom in sight. So complex, so worth the wait, so fun to drink, so fun to watch the look of disgust on my girlfriend’s face when she tries it. Kick ass.",4.3

14065,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottled (2000 vintage) at Kulminator. Hazy orange coloured, nice head. Very, very complex aroma of malts, flowers, sherry, alcohol and lots more. Complex flavour as well, on the sweet side, malts, fruit, wood, everything. But the real magic of this beer is probaly the balance, of all the many flavours nothing really dominates, but instead it’s in perfect harmony. One of the beers i think i could drink all evening. Superb!",4.7
14150,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,The 'Stille Nacht Reserva 2000'. Clear light amber coloured beer. Port wine aroma and taste. The alcohol is obvious but not disturbing. My favourite kind of beer.,4.6

14106,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"This is a gorgeous beer! Hazy auburn color that just reeks of clovey tanginess. So much different than the regular Still Nacht - the flavor here is just  so big and complex, like a musky flemish red that isn't sour but coats the mouth perfectly. Fruity cloves, tangy but very smooth, such a complex beer. If I didn't know better, I'd almost call this a Trappist Belgian Red.",4.5
14088,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Shared this one with Carlo (lachesis) at Kulminator in Antwerp - thanks a lot my friend!!!!
Pours hazy copper colored with a foamy tan head. The aroma is just amazing, very full and complex and one you can sniff for hours. Fruity, caramelly with tones of prunes, raisins, cookie, yoghourt and a tone of alcohol. Woody hints as well. The flavor leaves nothing behind from the aroma. Sweet fruit, yoghourt again, raisins, brown sugar. Soft still dry in the mouth, thick and creamy almost like syrup. Just amazing! An awesome beer enjoyed at an awesome bar with awesome company!!!!Rerate, tasted 25th of June 2005 at Kulminator.
I feel very fortunate to be able to taste this beer again within less than two month thanks to an amazing bar owner who was clever enough to stock a bunch of these fine beers. Unfortunately it looks like he too will be running out soon but rumours say that a new batch has just been poured into barrels and will be released in 2007...!!! Anyway, I’m no longer in doubt, this beer is perfect in all aspects and I CAN NOT thing of anything in the whole wide world beeing greater! My first (and only) 5.0. Thank you Kris and De Dolle for putting heaven into a bottle!",5.0

14052,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Anything above 4 is a great beer, this one is excellent but I prefer their oerbier.  Great for a winter night, unfortunately I drank this in mid-summer Atlanta - maybe I would have rated it better in Wisconsin.",4.2
14043,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle: Pale gold, nice head and lacing. Nose of plum, cherry, dry port, sweet malts. The flavor is fucking nice and balanced. Subtley sweet and salty/woody with an herbalness and fruity sweet grape taste. Finishes with some honey notes and a tasty cake on the side. Like the richness of Jadwiga. Tons of the good umami in this. I like that the clean bordeaux notes have faded into something completely different over time.",4.3
14141,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Like all De Dolle beers, the cork couldn't wait to get away from the bottle. Smells like a port wine: over ripe fruits and oak. I wonder how long the Bordeaux barrels were used with wine. Airating the beer will make the alcohol come to life so unless you like that intense burn, I wouldn't recommend it. For the price, I was a bit let down but then, we have to pay the price to travel the world, don't we?",4.0
13943,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle shared at A Day To Sink All Sea Shepards tasting. Very hazy orange to light brown with no head.

[17-09-2016]",4.3
14051,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Again, this was shared moments after our De Dolle Special Brouwsel with Ernest, luckygirl and my wife at Choice City Butcher and Deli in Ft. Collins, Colorado.  Pours a effervescent light copper with a patchy white film.  Aroma is huge; buttery caramel malt, sweet brown sugar, alcohol, oak and apple.  Butterscotch flavor, caramel malt and apples, moderately acidity creates some spice, creamy maltiness in the middle and near the end, alcohol notes and dryness at the end.  Full bodied and warm, creamy palate but dry and spicy-fizzy finish.",5.0
14025,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Big thanks to Mike for bringing this to DLD--a very generous gesture for certain.  The pour was a nice, slightly hazy golden color.  Small head.  The aroma is lively, with tons going on--green grapes, sour apples, light caramel, honey, light brown sugar and light breadiness.  The flavor matches, with more malt to balance out perfectly the sour tastes and the light fruit flavors.  12% shows up nowhere in the flavor at this point.  Really happy I was able to sample this along with so many others at a great event.",4.6
14073,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"This is one of the 5 best beers in the world hands down.  Went to Brugge on Feb 11 2005 and bought 4 bottles to enjoy.  Great Aroma, excellent Flavor, and overall beautiful Ale.  Brent Smith July 2005",4.7
14138,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Light brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty, honey and orange. Malty and somewhat thick. Texture is thick and somewhat oily. It very reminiscent of Grand Marnier. Very smooth. Very sweet and orangish. Great sipping beer. The 12% alcohol is evident with it oiliness and it tummy warming, but it not harsh at all.  VERY nice. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.",4.3
14005,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"a great opportunity to try this beer thanks to the rb comunity.  this beer was a bit like watching and old athlete in a come back fight.  still good but past its prime.  great balance and strong fruit presence, a little to mellow in body vs. a newer non reserva.  surprisingly there was some alcohol in the nose along with yeast and  light spice.   i did learn something, don’t hold on to long to the jewels in your collection.",4.1
14094,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Aroma is cider, caramel, and vanilla. Flavor of smooth vanilla, a mild barnyard, mild spice, and some cider. Extrordinarily drinkable for such a huge beer.",4.0
13958,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle. Murky orange-copper pour with no head. Aroma is packed with candi sugar and raisin. Moderate cardboard oxidation, light caramel, and some red fruit. Taste is sugary sweet. Candi sugar, fruit juice, caramel, toffee, port wine, and raisin. I’m guessing this tasted a lot different years ago. Thankful to try this whale but it’s not worth seeking out anymore.",3.4
14076,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Ah The coveted Stille De Nacht Reserva.  A Big thanks to Willblake for having this at Jim’s.  Being a big Port wine Fan this was great.  Its like a great aged  Port with some carbonation.  Finishes clean, dry, and very smooth.",4.8
14002,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Murky amber pour with a nice sized white head.  Aroma is very boozy with some plums,  caramel,  and chocolate.  I’ve written raisins a bunch for flavor in my reviews,  but my god!  This is a raisin bomb.  It has a nice sherry style flavor as well.  Finish was boozy.  Not really my thing but fun to try.",3.4
14149,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Clear orange amber with small head that leaves right after the pour.  Aroma is sweet, raisin, some yeast, and red wine alcohol.  Taste is moderately sweet, raisin, anise.  Bordeaux is evident, at times dominant.  Light carbonation.  The alcohol is fairly strong, and leaves a medium burn.  Definitely a sipping beer.",3.9
14059,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Beautiful hazy straw in color.  Light head and very slight lace.  Sweet, malty,yeasty, biscuty and wineish nose.  Rich mouthfeel, light carmel apples, slight dried apricots and honey with a little woodyness in the back.  Wine like, alot of finesse like a refined wine, tannins are like silk over your tongue with a great maltiness and a perfect tartness that complement each other to a T! ’00 vintage",4.7
14001,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Huge thanks to pepsican, badbeer, and iowaherkeye. Alcoholic, caramelly nose, raisin. Slightly metallic. finishes nicely-tons of honey-tastes like raw unrefined honey-cigary. Very nice dry character. Probably a little past its prime, but nevertheless very nice.",4.2
14016,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,What a freaking amazing beer.  I found it even more crazy that i purchased it at a bar for $15.  They claimed the single bottle had been sitting in the cellar untouched for years.  What an amazing use of bordeaux casks which imparted a very nice subdued flavor.  Where is the 12%?  It drank like 7 or 8%.  This is probably the best belgian beer i’ve ever had.,4.8
14019,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Thanks Ughsmash for sharing this gem.  The first pour is a glowing reddish amber body.  What I had with fourth pour was a hazy glowing amber body with out the redness.  A foamy white head with spotty lacing sits on top.  The aroma was very vinous Bordeaux with some pineapple, cinnamon, and toffee rounding out the beer.  It was amazingly aromatic, strong, and yet very balanced.  The flavor is sweet quad yeasts with pineapple, toffee, aged malts, light oak, cinnamon, and some very subtle Bordeaux.  Nicely balanced and very nice tasting.  The palate was sweet, slick, warming with no alcohol noticeable to me, and nicely textured.  This beer held up really nicely.",4.4
14131,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,Amber colored with a too short foam. Very good aroma of alcohol and raisins. In the tast you can fell the sorageing on bourdoux barrels.,4.2
14086,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle-conditioned, obtained thanks to my newest great buddy sprinkle (the holy grail! Finally!): cloudy dark orangey amber. Minimal lacing on disappearing head. Woah that nose! This has to be one of the best smells ever. Extremely vinous and potent. The Bordeaux wood really comes through, basking its glory into an already capable beer. I’ll sound like I’m just enumerating, but this is an equilibrium, trust me, everything at the right place and everything does include a lot of things! Sharp cookie dough flavours, cinnamon powder, vanilla, maple, barley sugar, bananas, oranges, pancakes, nutmeg, pears, nuts.. lots and lots of flavours. Complexity layer over complexity layer. It somehow manages to remain diplomatic, begs to be sipped while forcing you to take your time through pure transcendence and force. WOAH! Yeast overload in mouth, this is more than doughy, it’s a pure French toast. Vinous dates, sweet desserty liquor, a big liquid cake. I’ve no idea how so many flavours can be balanced, no idea. It’s almost a case of name as many flavours as you can and have fun finding them in here. Magnetic sheer polar extremes. Velvet mouthfeel, silky full body, soft carbonation, venerable in that aspect. Evolving flavors, complex, elegant, what more do you want? Decadent stuff. If a beer has ever lived up to the hype, this is it, I’d dare even find it underrated as a matter of fact ;-) That this was possibly not the best bottle of this tasting I consider as the best I’ve been part of is an indication of how good my dreams will be in the next few days.",4.8
14111,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Poured a golden color with an orange hue and a white head with beautiful lacing.  Vanilla, vinous (certainly from the bordeaux casks).  Oak, and bordeaux are present in the taste accompanied by a tongue biting warming alcohol.

[Update 8/05] Drank this again for my third time last night, and i’m noticed some butterscotch in both the aroma and flavor. 

[Update 1/07] That was one bad bottle with diactyl...we had another one last night and it was pretty darn nice.",4.8
14070,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Thanks to Jeffin7 for sharing this one. Wow. Pours a nice clear amber with a white head. Beautiful aroma of oak, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is just glorious; toasted malt, wood, bourbon, port, dark fruit, plum, raisin, pear and a hint of chcolate. Deliciously sweet with a nice, warming alcohol presence. Very full, round and creamy on the palate with moderate carbonation. Just outstanding! I had to update this rating because I’ve had a few more oak/barrel beers since this one and it made me realize what a masterpiece this one is.",4.7
13948,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle at Kenny’s 20K. Huge thanks for Kenny busting out this whale! It pour clear golden - amber with a small white head. The nose is rich, juicy, port wine, vinous, dried fruits, glacé cherry, plum, fig pudding marzipan, rice pudding, ice-wine and wood. The taste is rich, bitter - sweet, oily, dried fruits, port, vinous, wood, chewy, honeyed fruits, oily, stewed apple, warming alcohol, plum, fig, touch of spice, redcurrant and tangy red wine with a slick, dry finish. Medium + body, fine carbonation and oily mouth-feel. Great depth of flavour and balance. Has held up brilliantly. Exceptional..",4.4
14044,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Pours an elegant golden amber with a subtle fire tinge and an even layer of white head.  This beer has everything going on in the aroma - light fruits, dark fruits, spice, vinous character, it just goes on and on.  The first thing to grab my attention are the succulent figs and prunes that decorate the bouquet.  Thoughts of a fine barleywine float through my head before fleeting, being replaced with a distinctly Belgian layer of cinnimony yeasty spice.  Soft, ripened pears and sugary muscat grapes also float gently to my nose, blending artistically with the dark fruity spice.  Rich, full body - lightly syrupy, but at the same time well carbonated mouthfeel.  This is a big beer that hasn’t lost any balance or succumbed to the effects of age.  More fruits flood my tongue.  I continue to be amazed how hoards of figs, prunes, raisins, peaches, apricots, caramel, and spice can coexist together so beautifully.  Each taste is savored carefully, revealing more new fruit sensations before culminating in a subtly woody, majestic finish.  This beer is one of those gems that is truly worth all the praise it receives.  Big thanks to Chris for giving me the chance to try this fabulous beer.",4.6
14127,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Thin cloud whips streak through the night sky, Stars twinkle, but only the brightest can contend with the bright moon that turns what would be complete blackness into a red amber.  The air is cold, clean and perfectly fresh . . . I recline on a grassy hill to take a big breath of the still fresh air - sweet wine, fresh baked banana bread, and candied hay, mix with the moist air from a icy, slow moving creek from below. . . from over the hill apple blossoms waft into the air as well.  I open my picinc basket for a midnight snack, I find fresh green apples to go with some bitter cheese, bits of bread complete a wonderful treat.  In addition I dig out some great fruits: strawberries, cantalope, and honey dew.  Ah, if this night could last forever. . .",4.6
14103,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"This beer just keeps getting better everytime I try it. The first time I had a large sample of it was June ’03 at the Hopleaf in Chicago. Before and since I have only had a small sample.   I will take what ever I can get of this nectar.
Gorgeous orange. Small head. Very complex nose. Oak, fruit, nutty. It has all those tastes in the body plus a nice funkiness. A slight lactic bite. Then a nice alcohol warming.
A friend described it to me like this. It is like a flower blooming. As time passes it opens up into something new. I agree.",4.6
14023,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Golden coloured beer with a white fluffy head. Aroma is filled with lots of swee candy like notes. Caramel sweetness in the flavour, some doughyness, a bit of woodyness - not like oak, but not far off either. There is a bit of grape in there as well.",4.3
13957,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle. Opaque copper pour with a fleeting white head. Wonderful vinous and caramel malt bouquet. Amazed after all the bad reports, that I don’t detect any oxidation. All kinds of caramel malts, with tasty Bordeaux, vanilla, and oak highlights. For being 15 years old this beer is really solid. I imagine the red wine notes were more present back in the day. That being said, this is such a treat and is damn good. Kudos to my guy who properly cellared this bottle for the past 10 years. Above average body and mouthfeel.",4.4
13959,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate apple, oxidation, candi sugar, and a touch of Belgian yeast. It pours a lightly hazy amber with a small beige head that quickly fades to a minimal film outlined by a very fine ring. The flavor starts with moderate sweet apple, caramel, and light Belgian yeast. The finish has light-moderate port, banana, and a touch of spice. It’s medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall, it’s solid, but I’m sure it was much better in its prime.",3.6

Strong beer.",4.7
14129,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Foxy-orange. Very slight, white head. Vineous nose, complex, like very old sherry, acetic acid, fruit. Taste is vineous again, esterish. Dried apricots and nuts. Some Brettanomyces too, 't would seem. After some time, a lactic component. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Dry. Alcohol- and acidburn. A bit nutty aftertaste, that and the esters keep flavour going for a long time. Complex is too shallow a word. Very old fortified wine procures similar flavours, similar impressions. Truly superb realisation.",4.5

A: pours black with brown hedging. A gaudy mocha top slowly falls to a solid sheet of lighter mocha. Spotty lace. Pretty beer.
S: Getting the bourbon, not getting the maple so much. Smells malty, dark, with hints of coffee. Smells really good....After a few more minutes, the maple starts to come out and reminds me of maple butternut ice cream.
T: Dark chocolate ice cream, hints of sweet bourbon, flecks of toffee, coffee and not really much maple. Then when I swallow on the subsequent exhalation, I get a really nice rush of the maple. There is just the slightest heat from the alcohol here.
M: Viciously sticky with a full feel and just perfect carbonation. The finish is lasting and combative with my preferred reservation to savor this beer rather than gulp it. This beer has perfectly matched feel for the profile. Only other beer with such a profoundly matched mouthfeel I’ve had is Hunahpu’s.
O: Well, this beer is really really good. The maple tones are subdued with initial tastes, and then initiate their subtle bellicose intents to compel my idle hands to guzzle. Good shit, I expected it to be sweeter, and was pleasantly surprised. I am grateful to have been able to try this one. I would love to have again, and wouldn’t pass up an opportunity. A perfect dessert for this accompaniment would be a hot fudge sundae with peanut brittle bits mixed into a rich, high quality vanilla bean ice cream...After which I would probably be sick to my stomach from such a degree of extravagance.

13326,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.

Appearance: Pure black (obviously) with decent brown head and some intricate lacing.

Aroma: Roasted malt aroma of chocolate, molasses and coffee. There is a sharp note from the barrels, with oak, bourbon, and I guess that odd sweetness is maple.

Taste: And there it is. Wow. The barrels really take center stage with maple, oak, vanilla, bourbon and coconut. There is definitely a highly roasted Imperial Stout underneath with nice notes of chocolate and coffee, but the barrel-aging is what sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.

Palate: Ridiculously smooth and creamy. Obviously full-bodied, with low carbonation and a highly warming finish. Feel it burn!

Overall: This is quite simply barrel-aging at its finest. Not sure if this or The Abyss is my favorite Imperial Stout - Abyss is more about the Stout backbone, while CBS is all about the barrels. A side-by-side would be fun, but very unlikely to ever happen.",4.9

Even this tiny taster glass has a very strong smell of bourbon and maple syrup. A somewhat stiff tan head that took a while to dwindle, leaving some legs behind.
The taste is full and sugary. Like the current KBS, it packs 11.7% abv, but the actual alcohol doesn't show itself after the first few sniffs. The texture is lighter than how I remember the KBS, but there is a distinct note of maple, too. After the first few sips, it comes across like a bourbon with a maple chaser.

This being my first maple bourbon barrel aged experience, I’m really focusing on the maple.  My snifter is filled with black ale that is topped by a minimal tan head that quickly vanishes. Tasting yields initial sweetness that gives way light bitterness and a little alcohol on the finish.  The only flaw with this ale is the medium body that is somewhat thin in texture and not aided by the soft/flat carbonation.

Pours jet black color with a steady thick beige head. Lots of coffee on the nose, roasted malts, some syrupy notes, caramel, dark chocolate and subtle hops. Flavor is roasted malty with a bitter bite, sweet chocolate and syrup, caramel and faint vanilla on the background, coffee comes through mostly on the aftertaste. Quite nice balance despite the strong sweetness but deceptively quaffable, alcohol peaks through eventually. Heavy, complex and tasty, maybe slightly over-hyped though.

13174,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Shared this bottle at the UFC tasting. We did the Founders horizontal leading up to this guy (Imperial Stout, Breakfast Stout and KBS). I had this on tap at Founders at the release day and after having it out of the bottle I figure it deserves a proper review. Poured out of a 750 ml bottle into a Deschutes snifter.

A: Pours a jet black with a great mocha colored head that lingers for a bit and resides to brown swirls and nice ring around the edge. 

S: The maple syrup and the barrel really shine in the smell. Nice roasted coffee with a sweet vanilla and chocolate. 

T: The coffee is more prevalent in the taste and is backed by a nice chocolate. Sweet vanilla mixes with the maple syrup and really makes the barrel shine. There is a little booze kick at the end to remind you that it’s there. Everything is integrated so beautifully. Really fucking good.

M: Heavy bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Wonderfully carbonated to keep you stimulated. I could drink this every day.

O: This beer lived up to the hype and more for me. It’s a shame that everyone is making this a whale, but I know I’ll be able to have it again soon.

Flavor is upfront with more fresh espresso- creamy macchiato, slight char, licorice, then warms to get a real nice moderate maple sweetness and light leathery earth.  Finishes off real smooth with a light lingering maple sweetness.  This worked out real well I thought.",4.1

13244,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"From notes.  First reviewed 1/10/2011.  Served on tap in a stange at the Haymarket Founders event. Batch from this past Spring.

CBS is pitch black, with ruby edges. A small greedy tan head fades due to the ABV, leaving just a little bit of lace on the glass.

Although I have not had a fresh sample, I am guessing the maple has faded a bit since I get a fairly nuanced maple aroma. A load of roasted malt dark chocolate, lots of coffee, and a bit of vanilla, maple syrup, and oak.

In the flavor, a quick dash of maple syrup and some molasses come with lots of dark roasted malts. Bam - coffee. More than I expected. Chocolate malt unfolds, and the bitter coffee flavor drives to the end. A little sweetness sneaks back in right at the finish. Delicious.

There is a noticeable smoothness from the oats. Full bodied to say the least, this is a viscous mother. Creamy carbonation that is almost crushed by the thickness of the body. 

Although there is not as much maple as I was expecting, and the coffee sort of took over, this is still an awesome beer. I would still really like to have a fresh glass to see how it compares, whether the maple is stepped up even more.

From notes.  Reviewed 10/16/2011.  Fresh 2011 batch, poured from a 64 oz. growler into a snifter.

Unfortunately either the keg was light on the carbonation or it lost a bit in the growler. My pour has a minimal tan head that fades to nothing quickly. The color is a ebony with just a bit of ruby in the edges.

The aroma is pretty fantastic, I can tell that I am in for a serious bourbon barrel beer. Dark semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, and roasted malt dominate what aroma I assign to the base beer. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, and a nice dash of maple are from the barrel aging process.

The flavors all make themselves known immediately, with little or no progression. A dark Belgian chocolate flavor blends with sweet molasses and some dark roasted malts. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak all bracket the taste and add further complexity, with the maple simply serving as a way to push the flavor over the edge. Fantastic. There is a soft coffee bitterness at the end that is much more noticeable as it warms.

The lack of carbonation accounts for me knocking it down a notch. Other than that, the body is luxuriously thick and creamy. A bourbon bite lurks, but the creaminess is just right. There is a bit of carbonation and a touch of alcohol bite as well. 

The difference between trying this fresh and trying a batch that is almost a year old is like night and day. The bourbon, molasses, and maple flavors are so much better defined, while the beer is full and viscous enough to make it drinkable. Truly a phenomenal beer. One day I will get to try a full carbonated fresh batch and it will probably be a near perfect score.",4.3

13351,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"I split a 750ml bottle with a friend. I poured my share into a balloon goblet. 

Appearance: Opaque black body with a large frothy/creamy dark brown head. It retains and laces the glass perfectly. 

Smell: Massive coffee and bourbon aroma. Huge vanilla syrup and sweet smokiness. Extremely inviting.

Taste: Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout (or just ""CBS"" as the bottle indicates) is begins with the same or very similar base brew as Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout (KBS). It’s then aged in barrels that were previously used to age maple syrup which were previously used to age bourbon. Right off the bat that makes for a very interesting palate, and since I’ve already been fortunate enough to try the KBS, I couldn’t help but wonder how the CBS could possibly top its forefather.

But that’s the thing about this beer - I don’t think it’s meant to surpass the KBS as much as it’s meant to be a different approach to the same beer. Taste-wise, the palates are very similar. It begins with a sweet imperial stout taste, then coffee flavor and bitterness through the middle. The ending is the best part - huge vanilla and bourbon flavors appear out of nowhere and leave just a trace of smoke in their wake. This is a flavor and sensation commonly found in oak-aged imperial stouts, but I’ve never encountered so much vanilla before. It almost seems confectionary, as if it’s a vanilla flavoring or if the beer were aged in spiced rum barrels. 

The energy level is high all around from beginning to end with a perfect balance of coffee taste and bitterness with vanilla and wood sweetness. It doesn’t have quite the roasty flavor as the KBS forbearer, making it seem actually kind of, dare I say, mild, in comparison. Whatever the case may be, Founders CBS is still a delicious brew.

Mouthfeel: Thick, soft, tepid, full-bodied. Coats the mouth, but finishes cleaner than you think. 

Drinkability: You know a beer is highly drinkable when it weighs in at 10.6% ABV, has tons of flavor, and is so easy to drink you have to remember to savor it. That’s what happened to me with Founders CBS. I nearly guzzled my serving down as if there was an unlimited supply (I certainly wish there was!). What’s so impressive is that it is such a big beer and so smooth. There’s a little bit of alcohol warmth in the throat, but it’s easily tolerable. The aftertaste is quite clean with mild sweetness that’s never dry or cloying.

Overall, Founders CBS is a fantastic beer that probably lives up to the hype.",4.5

Give this another go, my initial rating was based on a two year old bottle, which didnt hold up very well.

13026,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"[I’ve had this on tap on two occasions. This is a review from notes to be revised next time I have some ... should I be so lucky]. 

A - a dark black color with a typical tan head

S&T - very complex, with an amazing series of flavors as one savors a sip. Coffee, oatmeal, bourbon are among main components of taste and aroma. Maple syrup used in aging makes a subtle but significant contribution to this wonderful drink. Long-lasting taste and well-balanced taste components, if a trifle sweet. 

M - full bodied with adequate carbonation. 

This is the best stout/porter I’ve ever had! I tried Founders KBS at the same time. The taste, balance and complexity of the CBS were clearly superior, but then I am not a fan of bourbon which is a bit more pronounced flavor component in the KBS",4.6

Smooth, lighter, creamy carbonation. Very nice chewy texture to it. Kind of dry in the finish. Dark chocolate, whipped cream, coffee, and some nice maple syrup still. Just light hints of oxidization. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, just a very light acidic bite - not sure if that’s the coffee or the age, giving that light bit of bitter acidity. Definitely getting way better as this warms up, holy shit. Super creamy, velvety smooth texture to this. Big chewy oat character coming out a ton. Awesome vanilla coffee notes, good oats, maple. Wow. Glad I got a bigger sample of this, just so much complexity and awesome flavors playing together. Maple syrup way more now. Looks very good for an aged imperial stout, I’m tempted to raise appearance to a 5. Incredible stuff, wow. Wasn’t expecting to rate this so highly (especially for a not fresh example - though it was stored cool), but it really is incredibly impressive. Looking for criticisms, maybe just some very light hints of molasses, but I have to look for them.",4.3

Full bodied and still very drinkable for a big, high abv beer, I really enjoyed it.",4.2

28228,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Bottle. 12 oz. Pour is straight, deep, jet black with a one-finger, amber, lacy head. Aroma of cocoa, dark chocolate, honey, freshly ground coffee beans, caramel, roast, sweet malts, bourbon, and hints of cream. Full bodied with a lusciously velvety, rich, luxuriously complex bitter-sweet palate. Not a trace of alcohol in the flavor, but an amazingly smooth warming in the back of the throat as it finishes. Overall, one of the best stouts, Imperial or otherwise, that I have ever tasted. Outstandingly crafted and executed brew. Awesome.",4.2

28749,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"What better way to top off Derby Day 2008 than with a KBS.  Pours oil slick black with a dense one-finger brown head that dissipates almost immediately leaving very good lacing.  Roasted coffee dominates the nose with a definite bourbon aroma that is underpinned by a faint malt aroma with a vanilla and dark fruit sweetness (very faint).  Wow, the taste is massive!  It starts with a huge roasted/burnt coffee flavor with a heavy dose of chocolately malts, bourbon and wood.  Then there is all kind of other things bouncing around the taste buds - caramel, dark fruits, vanilla - tough to identify all of it.  Bitterness of the coffee taste lingers for...days.  Medium body yet very creamy and smooth mouthfeel.  Despite the massive nature of this brew, I found it tough to put down.  This is, without a doubt, one of the most unique beers I have tasted and I hope to get my hands on some more of it.",4.3

Re-rate! Draught @ BAJT. Had two glasses of this and could probably have sat there all day getting insanely drunk if I hadn’t had other things to do. Perfectly balanced between the malts, coffee and barrel treatment. Insanely tasty and just insane to see this on tap in Sweden...",4.4

28482,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),12oz bottle (2009) into a snifter.  Rating #1300!  Pours deep black with shimmering brown when held to the light. The small head is dark leather brown and dissipates quickly into a small ringlet.  The aroma is honestly comprised of mostly a big dose of fresh roasted coffee.  Underneath this is a small helping of nice bourbon and oak characteristics including a lot of vanilla and a touch of wood.  The sweet aroma of whiskey touches through but not much.  A drink taken in while inhaling starts quite sweet and flows into wood and vanilla mixed with a touch of citrus.  The mid is all added coffee and this is definitely what lingers with undertones of very dark chocolate.  As it warms the chocolate comes out more and more.  There is a nice carbonation that mingles perfectly with the silky mouthfeel.  This is honestly good but I was expecting more bourbon stout and less breakfast stout.,4.5

Subtle chocolate malt entry and smooth caramel flavor leads into a coffee middle followed by a sharp roasted malt flavor that is a bit abrasive.

I get mostly the same aromas I would get from any other bourbon county variant. Sweet bourbon , vanilla oak, brownie chocolate batter and roasted barley. As far as the mouthfeel goes it was a bit more oily and slick then other variations of BCS. They served us a coconut macaroon with this sample and it pair really damn nice with it. But I feel like I got more coconut from the desert then I did from this stout. The brew master also stated that aging this variant would not be a good idea since the coconut was sure to fade. They had to experiment it get this nuance in the stout in the first place so with that being said drink this young. Don’t hoard it or try to trade half your beer cellar for it. It’s really great just like all the BCS variation but nothing to break your neck over. And of course I’m going to try it again just in case my palate was on bourbon overload.",4.1
11719,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle - Pours a thick black w/ very little head. Boozy, oak, sweetness, and a bit of coconut in the nose. The taste was a slight bit of coconut, dark chocolate, more booze, and sweetness. Not the best from Goose Island.",3.8
11847,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"draft at Stout, Chicago. Pours slick black with very small head around the rim. The first thing I noticed is that I can’t smell coconut anywhere, had to search long and hard and for the most part, didn’t pick it up. What it did smell like was some of the best regular BCS ever, great balance between chocolate and oak-bourbon notes. Flavor again was hard pressed to find coconut, the closest I got was getting a bit more marshmallowy goodness with perhaps a faint toasted coconut here, again it tasted right, good body to this, fairly thick with lots of charred barrel, chocolate, and some roast. Some of the tightest BCS I’ve had but overall it’s a fail because they put the word coconut in the description and you might not have guessed it otherwise. I’ll have to see if the bottles have a bigger coconut presence. Coconut explosion? Really? Maybe the bottles are different.

1/22/14, out of the bottle. Smelled a bit more coconut here but the taste was much bigger coconut, awesome beer, bits of coconut flake at the end of the bottle were really good! 4.5",4.5

11648,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"One of the most sought after versions of BCBS, vintage of 2013; my bottle says 14.1% ABV instead of the 13.9% ABV given above. I taste this special treat from an old port wine snifter at near room temperature. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, near to black but not entirely so; only in the last remnants of the liquid, a cloudy brown appearance reveals itself, with tiny bits of dead yeast and proteins lining the glass wall.  The head is thin, beautifully deep beige and a bit coarse, but is sadly reduced to an irregular, wafer-thin rim around the glass in instants. I passionately fall in love with the aroma: what a divine bouquet rises up from the bottle... I could sniff this for hours on end: deep dark chocolate sauce, raisins, candied figs, vanilla-like oaky tannins, Islay whisky, liquorice, old sherry, soy sauce, candied orange, eucalyptus syrup, espresso, cocoa powder, cedar wood, pear syrup, Worcestershire sauce, some cooked meat or fried eggs far away but not disturbing at all, and indeed a faint hint of coconut, though I suspect this volatile aroma has faded considerably in the course of almost two years. The taste amazes me even more: a complex and baffling experience indeed, starting off with a very dense, pointy, refined, concentrated, candied sweetness, cloying a bit to the lips, candied oranges, pear, dried dates and indeed a hint of dry coconut meat; a tinge of carbonation pierces through, as well as subtle sourish and salty accents (red berries and soy sauce). Then a profound chocolate maltiness unfolds in all its glory, bitter chocolate with caramel and cashew nuts, spreading over the tongue and mouth cavity, with a fat, oily mouthfeel; a wonderful symphony of sweet versus bitter, with a lively, almost faintly clove- and cinnamon-like spiciness to it (perhaps the rye whisky already speaking?). Bitter wins in the end, as - almost unexpectedly - a tangy yet still mellow roasted coffee ’blackness’ appears, almost cappuccino-like in combination with the bittersweet chocolate, warming and filling the back of the mouth. Even before I swallow the first sip, it is clear to me that this beer increases in complexity as it makes its way through the palate; the finish beautifully recaptures the whole taste trail from beginning to end, blending the candied sweetness, the bittersweet chocolate malts and the softly roasted coffee bitterness into one concentrated ’ball’ of taste, which is finally confronted with a big wave of warming, whisky-like alcohol which also remains on the tip of the tongue after swallowing but somehow manages to remain gentle in all its force; a clear, drying, tannin-like woodiness ensues, as well as a background hint of peppery, leafy, noble hops adding a subtle, double bass-like structure to the whole. The complexity and richness of the malts, including a warm sense of high quality, aromatic coffee and again the woody tannins, linger for hours after swallowing and the alcohol warms the heart... Things just keep happening here, no matter how many sips you’ve taken.  Though I have to admit I expected more coconut presence, this is still one of the most noble stouts I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I particularly appreciate the follow-up of tastes in this one, sweet and bitter and bitter and sweet all make their appearance one by one only to lead to a resolving climax, as in a classical drama, though I did find the alcohol and the cloying sweetness perhaps a tad over the top - I had the same experience with AleSmith’s Speedway Bourbon Barrel Aged, and like in the case of the latter, this is the only thing keeping me from giving both stouts a perfect score.  Obviously, in view of this beer’s complexity and greatness, this is only the slightest form of criticism, if any; both remain unforgettable and both surely belong to the best beers I ever tasted.  This one, too, is a slow sipper for sure, to be treated with graciousness, dignity and respect. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into this beer; it is as if the malts were selected especially to fit in with the spirit of the barrel in which it has aged (and frankly, I would not be surprised if this is indeed deliberate). Fantastic example of the style, definitely worth the money (which was quite considerable, needless to say...). A world-class masterpiece, that is beyond doubt. I will remember this for the rest of my existence and I will keep the empty bottle in my cellar, only to look at it every now and then with a feeling of nostalgia...",4.6

11803,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"My Bottom Line:

Coconut thrives through this fun dessert of an Imperial Stout, swimming around chocolate and caramel flavours in an otherwise heavily sweet, complacent mouthfeel.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-There is no head of foam atop the darkness.

-The sweetness is prevalent and can get on your nerves quickly. Glad I got to split this bomber with a few likeminded aficionados.

-When the coconut subsides, this beer might reach better cohesion. For now, flavours are harmonious, but the flavour profile is not nearly as tight as it should be.

-The flatness and utter dominance of the coconut make this much less compelling than the ratings suggest.

5378,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle #11755

Opened with an ’08 next to it (courtesy of Rob, thanks dude!) It is amazing to compare side by side what the barrel and time did in this beer.

Opened on a Wednesday, just because. Pours a nice dark leather with no discernable carbonation - which suits this beer. When I dive into the beer I experience a nose only similar to on other beer I’ve had - ORF 2009. The Pappy 23 barrels DO actually impart a unique nose and it’s minerally, rich, dessert like and difficult for me to describe. Flavor follows and is quite rich. A really fine, nearly empty carbonation allows the medium on heavy beer to roll over the tongue slowly and results in a long finish. 

There are some things here that are interesting - no carb really, resulting in a less than desirable mouthfeel and appearance. That’s a standard feeling, but here I am making concessions, as the beer is still lovely and feels very, very nice. I don’t know if it was intentional, but these two characteristics match the personality of the beer outstandingly.

5626,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"5 oz pour.

It pours a dense black with a fizzy head that dissipates before I even get it.

The smell here is richer and smoother than the average BCS. This is partially due to the extra aging, but also the bourbon barrels used. It has all of the traditional BCS traits: thick bourbon, barrel, chocolate, and roast. However, there is an added almost woodsy-spiciness that is unique to this version.

The flavor follows. It has that hint of spiciness that takes regular BCS to a different level. It is smoother, and richer. The aging has allowed it to mature to perfection. The drinkability here is much greater than the average BCS.

This one is overpriced, but it is a great experience. An outstanding beer.

Cheers All! 
The beer pours black with a small head that goes away quickly, The aroma is particularly pungent with some spice cake, loads of bourbon, vanilla and cherry. There is a nice dark dried fruit character to the aroma that I don’t really get as strongly in the original version of this beer particularly raisin. The aroma really has a very limited alcohol character and is particularly appetizing. The flavor is nicely sweet with loads of bourbon. I wrote ""refined bourbon"" in my lil’ notebook... I guess by that I mean that the bourbon character is well rounded and the beer honestly tastes like it was aged with a higher grade of bourbon than we usually get in bourbon barrel aged beers. There is not a ton of harsh alcohol or woodiness but instead the vanilla and mild spiciness are much more prevalent in this one. Flavors of cherry and maple syrup provide a nice compliment to the vanilla and sweetness of the beer while a subdued but ever-present roastiness brings some coffee like flavors to the table. This just has an enormous depth of flavor, it took all of us forever to finish our glass (in a good way). The palate is that thick mouth coating sensation that anyone who has had any of the Bourbon County lineup of beers knows so well. Maybe if I’m lucky I’ll get to try this again some day.",4.5

A - Pours pitch black, not quite as oily as I thought it would be, minimal head with almost no lacing. Appeared mostly flat



S - Licorice, Vanilla, Plums, Coconut and charred oak were the biggest notes. Smell was something bigger though, something I couldn’t quite place my finger on but it smells fantastic.



T - Very little sweetness, Lots of flavors going on, very big but yet well integrated bourbon notes. After drinking a lot of Pappy and other wheated bourbons lately, this tastes just like Pappy 20 at least as far as the bourbon notes go. Not too oaky, loaded with vanilla, some plums, brown sugar, candy corns, not too sweet at the finish and NOT boozy. 



M - Oily, slick and heavy. Not fudge-like or thick but smooth and just a bit thinner than ’10 BCBS in a 12oz format



O - It’s amazing how drinking half of this bomber was so easy not because it was tasteless but because it was so refined and not boozy at all. BCBS Rare is not the king any more though.

5617,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz bottle (courtesy of Headbanger) poured into a Snifter at 42°.  This pours like used oil, its thick and black, carbonation is low with very little head (I have just a brown ring on the edge of my glass).  Aroma  is rich with roasted malt  and oak.  The full body has a rich yet crisp mouth feel.  flavor is bold with the oak standing out in front giving a bright vanilla flavor reminiscent of bourbon then the taste of raisins soaked in brandy. After taste lets the dried fruits stand out with the oak building a bit more and the alcohol shows a bit.  overall its a wonderful brew but the there vanilla seemed to be a little more complex.",3.8
5462,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle on the RBSG 2012 bus. Pours black with amber highlights. Aroma is pretty solid, nothing spectacular, coffee grounds and dry dark malts. The flavor is out of this world though. Vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut explode on the palate, tons of sweet luxurious malt flavors, velvety mouthfeel. Great barrel influence, just a rich complex sweetness and rustic oakiness with very little coconut (which I can’t stand). It’s hard to describe how much better this is than your garden variety BA imperial stout. It’s just a whole other stratum.",4.3

5552,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Thanks Paul!  This one pours black with little to no head formation.  Lovely aroma on the nose with vanilla, coffee, caramel, toffee, cinnamon, chocolate, bourbon, oak, earth, a bit of booze as well.  Extremely complex aroma that is typical of well done bourbon beers but with a bit more of an earthy edge to it than what’s usual.  On the palate, the beer is immediately sweet and rich with flavors of copious amounts of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, anise, bourbon, and oak.  Dark fruits of raisins and dates on the tongue give this a rich decadent quality but this quickly disappears as there is an interesting raw edge in the finish.  Not quite as smooth as what’s usual in these types of beers but adds a nice quality to this and reinforces that this is indeed a beer.  Very nice beer.",4.3

The aroma is molasses, nuts, cocoa, some wood, and vanilla. Huge bourbon notes. The flavor is sweet caramel, nuts, fudge, vanilla, and a little wood in the finish. Super thick and syrupy on the palate. The alcohol is massively strong, but the beer is such a tasty dessert-like pleasure that it doesn’t matter. This should be the poster boy for bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts (I guess it kind of is!) A little s’mores in there as well. Overall, it’s super rich with a beautiful barrel character, but only in smaller doses.",4.2

Aroma is absolutely loaded with vanilla, bourbon, chocolate covered cherry, roast, sweet wood, almond, and chestnut; divine. Flavor is completely insane! Tons of bourbon, wood, nut, dark fruit, boozy heat, and a touch of dark chocolate bitterness. The oak character starts, then moves to the alcohol presence (which some people knock but I think is awesome), and the chocolate and dark fruit hit at the finish for me. The palate is out of control; perfect amount of carbonation that supply massage the tongue. Rich and massive, but so smooth. World class.",4.7

5562,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"A: The pour is thick and black with a finger of tan head.

S: Wonderful bourbon and vanilla aromas with lots of rich, dark chocolate.  Solid amounts of roasted malts with more chocolate and bourbon.  A bit of molasses, caramel, and maple syrup, and oak.

T: Decadent is a good way to describe this beer.  Fantastic bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate flavors throughout.  Wood and roasted malts with a bit of caramel and molasses.  Nowhere near as boozy as regular Bourbon County, which is a big plus.

M: Full in body with a smooth, silky feel on the tongue.

O: I had put off looking to try this beer due to the cost (still don’t think it’s worth $45), but it is a really great one.",4.2
5309,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"THANK YOU Martinus! 650 ml. bottle sampled @ RBBWG V. Pours a sludgy motor-oil black, only a very thin layer of mocha bubbles on the sides, close to zero head. Nose is warming molasses, syrup, thick chocolate bourbon, vanilla, brambleberries, blueberries, chocolate, astonishing. Taste is rich thick molasses, coated in chocolate, blueberries, brambleberries, molasses, sugar, bourbon, dates, vanilla, sweet chocolate, thick sludge, coffee. Very thick & chewy body. Wow this is good, ridiculous. The thing that kept the regular one from reaching perfection was that it was a small touch too boozy, this one isn’t, it has more elegance, more nuances. Not sure if age is the reason here, I have never had the regular one 5 years old or whether this beer had these qualities back when it was young. Either way, this is close to 5 with a bigger pour I might have upped it to a 5. This is astonishing, I feel like I might need to try more in order to fully explore it but I am happy surprised that I even managed to try it at all. Thanks a lot. The price of this one is another discussion.",4.9

5537,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle #1287, shared with zep9865 to celebrate my recent engagement. I’ve had this before but this is the proper time to sit down to review and reflect upon this masterpiece.

It pours a lifeless midnight black in color with no head or carbonation. It looks like an ’08 Bourbon County, perfectly oily and overly viscous. The aromas consist of sweet bourbon, vanilla, molasses, oak, chocolates, and syrupy goodness. You can tell it’s had plenty of time to age and let it’s intricate qualities intermingle. I would like a little more PVW but it’s fine. The beer is already over two and a half years old at this point. The flavors are just wow. You get the silkiest, smoothest chocolates, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, caramel, and earthiness that a beer drinker could ask for. It is so soft and perfect for your palate. It just fits. I don’t think I’ve ever had a beer with a body so perfect. This beer is a masterpiece, a real spectacle to be hold. Well done Goose, well done.",4.8
5316,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle #1448

Pours viscous, pitch black and completely opaque with a half finger mocha head that immediately disappears. No lacing left behind but it does have lasting legs that coat the glass in a muddy film. 

Barrel character is really strong in the nose but it seems nicely integrated into aroma. Lots of spicy bourbon but it’s not overpowering with dry oak, toasted coconut and vanilla bean notes. Sweet, slightly roasted malt backbone with sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, coffee bean, baker’s chocolate and subtle roast/burnt malt. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with subtle viscosity and an excellent barrel character that’s perfectly integrated into the base beer. Spicy bourbon barrel with toasted coconut, marshmallow, vanilla and a wonderful spicy PVW flavor. Subtle boozy heat but not fiery, harsh or overpowering. Tastes just like the spirit without obliterating the base beer. Sure, there’s some sweet booze and heat lingering throughout but the other barrel notes and malt backbone counter things nicely. Fudge-y chocolate goodness with fudge, caramel, molasses and toffee give it a sweet and dessert like quality but it’s not one-note. There’s some roast with hints of dark chocolate, roasted gourmet coffee bean, burnt toast and oatmeal. The high ABV is extremely well masked making this delicious, complex beer dangerously drinkable. The flavor of this beer is close to perfect.",4.4
5470,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz bottle brought to a tasting by me, via trade from Tweety. In my cellar since 2010. Consumed 6-16, reviewed from notes.

A: I’m shocked. This is deep black. I great a really nice mocha head from my pour, though, and the legs stick to the glass. Perfect presentation.

N: We drank this after running through an 06-11 vertical, and the nose is definitely PvW. It has a deep oakiness which I’ve only experienced when drinking the bourbon straight. The caramel, vanilla, and coconut also have some extra heft. Chocolate, espresso. 

T: Dark fruits (prunes and raisins) Chocolate. Dismayed by the lack of roast/coffee. Caramel/vanilla. Some residual heat, but it’s gotten to the point of being a nice touch. 

M: Smooth, silky and viscous. 

O: This is really very good when viewed outside of the ridiculous value-inflation of the beer. However, I dare say I’d take the 2009 BCS and the BCS Vanilla over it. The PvW 23 is great to taste in the blend, and it is a deeper flavor, but it’s not a religious experience, either.",4.5

5549,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"On tap at GTMW (2011)



Despite the higher score I think this was a draw with the Neapolitan version. What sets it apart with a slightly higher score is its focus. This is pure coffee and bourbon in a way that I’ve never experienced since vanilla bean Dark Lord. Oozing around the glass like used motor oil this beer is thick, heavy, and just as chewy as it looks. I doubt I would pay $50.00 for a bottle but as a unique experience I am glad I got some (without waiting in line to boot).",4.6

5689,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz. bomber, #3,760, with thanks to dgugliuzza from over on BA, and selfishly shared with no one on my own little New Years Eve Eve party by myself.  Pours a nice dark black with a minimal brown head that quickly disappears leaving a still surface.  Aroma is lovely, with lots of barrel notes, oak, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, chocolate, and ripe dark fruits.  There is a definite initial note of alcohol that dissipates as it has a chance to breathe, and other than needing a little time found this quickly went away.  Flavor is equally up to the task, with more rich vanilla, oak, molasses, chocolate and a blend of ripe dark fruits.  The carbonation is just a touch higher than I’d hope, with some prickliness, but retains a smooth and coating finish.  A fine beer, but not quite at the level of something like FiftyFifty’s PVW Eclipse.  Embarrassed at how much this costs, but for a one bottle, one time kind of thing there are no regrets.  Thanks again Danny!",4.2

5388,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Tasted blind at a horizontal including Vanilla, Rare, Cherry Rye, Bramble Rye, Coffee ’12 and an ’09 Bomber. Poured into a snifter at approx 55 degrees. Reviewed from blind tasting notes. 5/6 in the lineup. 

A- The lowest carbonation of the bunch, essentially no head formation whatsoever upon pouring. Thick, blackest of black, motor oil appearance. 

S- Tons of barrel on the nose as well as bourbon. Some sweetness, almost like a port-like oxidation. In addition, some vanilla. 

T- Tons of vanilla, barrel and bourbon. The vanilla is very rich and the most apparent note. Tastes absolutely fantastic. 

M- Thick, rich, and lingering. Not much more to be said. Simply fantastic from start to finish. Minimal carb. 

O- We actually misidentified this as the ’09 bomber, and the ’09 bomber as this. To be honest, we all enjoyed the ’09 more, although this was the close second out of our ratings by just 1 or 2 total points. We should have been able to guess by the very low levels of carbonation. Either way, this is a fantastic beer, but I think it may have peaked. When I had this back in May, it definitely had a bit more oomph than this bottle.",4.7

Thick and strong on the nostrils, rich and creamy, sweet yet roasty, deep barrel presence. Initial is rich and creamy, roasty malts, dark chocolate, brownies and cookies, caramel, coffee grounds, bigger vanilla tannins, rich barrel presence, warming as it goes down. Wet oak, thick bodied with legs, coats the palate well as raisin and dark fruit, touches of plum and dark black cherries really grow and give this beer it’s character. Vanilla, rich bakers chocolate, coating malts and warming barrel, a little hot, but a big luscious body supports it. Incredible, if not a bit hot. Truly a good display of the barrel, and special ones at that. Finish is warming, loads of vanilla tannins with roasty bitter malts, cocoa, and coffee running the gambit and warming spirit, touches of dark fruit, anise, biscuits, nice. Overall, it IS BCS.. With some added complexity hauled out from special barrels. I do think it’s great.. But at that price.. Is regular more worth it?? Pure judgment call.",4.5

Big respect to Tom for doing this properly and freezing it first. This is ice cider. Bright orange and very thick. Very very special indeed. Incredible apple aroma. Spice a plenty, sweet as hell and loads of fruit. Those apples are just amazing. Amazing toffee notes in the flavour. Ok you piss taking set of bastards (Tom & Sim) I mean candy apple. Lashings of custard. This is, as Tom describes, like apple pie and custard without the pastry. Big tarty apple bite with plenty of sharp acidty that rather than lingering in the background is brought rushing to the front carried by the alcohol. Darker than the Neige and like a bigger badder brother. A bloody amazing experience that brings back all the fantasticness of last time I tried this stunning nectar.",4.4

The flavor is syrupy sweet and smooth but it works oh so well. It has rich apple sweetness and tart character at the same time. The natural sugars are sweet and delicious and the finish is pleasantly warming. Remarkable. As it turns out, it happens to get the same total rating as the previous La Face ice cider that I rated.

10320,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Wow, thanks for sharing Argo0!  Bottle says #2127 of 6133.  The aroma has...apple?...hah...but almost something like pear and plastic as well, definitely intense and fresh, some spice.  Very sweet.  So sweet you just have to confront it and either embrace it or tolerate it.  And I love sweet drinks like port.  For all of its sweetness, the palate is thick but not sticky, somehow.  How does this make me rethink ciders?  It eliminates a lot of the sourness and acidity associated with good quality ciders (esp. English ciders, e.g.)--it is obviously a distant stylistic cousin to English farmhouse cider--while retaining and concentrating the flavors.  But I wish it didn’t have to bring the sugars to such concentrations.  Clear but a still yellow appearance.",3.8

Flavor is just like warm apple juice or baked apples.  Covers the tongue and lingers in the mouth for quite awhile.  Slight alcoholic/warm aftertaste.  My first cider!",4.0

10303,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"5/4/07.  Poured out of 375 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with Olivier_MTL on RateBeer 12/3/05.  2003 Vintage.  Pours a deep amber-gold color with good clarity and a bold, beautiful depth of autumn color.  The oily legs on this cider are much broader and slower than those of its brother, the Neige-- tilt the glass and there are times that the high edge of residue takes literally several minutes to droop, like the wax from a freshly-lit candle.  The aroma here is much richer and more succulent also-- some overripe apples and fresh apple sauce (complete with cinnamon accompaniment), as well as soft caramel and a captivating, warming, sweet-liqueur aura.  First taste is decadently sweet with a lightly leathery, lightly waxy tart apple outline.  The finish drops most of the soft tartness that balanced the initial taste and leaves a homemade soft-and-syrupy cinnamon apples and a slight apple pie doughy flavor.  Some zesty alcohol rounds out the mouthfeel, sort of a funny way to balance the gripping sweetness.  This is even more indulgent than its companion, lacking most of the tartness of crisp fresh apples but replacing it with an intoxicating medley of apple desserts that rival the best restaurant creations I’ve ever sampled.",4.5
10104,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Bottle, vintage 2012. Pours shiny amber. Cooked sweet apples, caramel. Intense and heavy, but nicely acidic and balanced. Slightly boozy, but not at fault. Good stuff.",4.4
10276,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Courtesy TheCheeseMan.  Huge thanks for sharing this rare and expensive little gem. The still body is a thick, viscous, golden-orange honey color.  The aroma is that of pure apple essence, as condensed and concentrated as can possibly be.  It can only be described as the freshest apple juice you have ever encountered, painstakingly reduced to the nth degree.  The flavor is inconceivably perfect, like a million fresh apples that have been crushed in the dead of winter, in the middle of the unadulterated wilderness, and somehow crammed into a tiny package.  A thick, oily body glides over the tongue, effortlessly delivering the sweet apple goodness to each and every corner of the mouth.  Finishes long and sweet, with the absolutely perfect amount of alcoholic heat. This represents the absolute pinnacle of the ice cider classification, and perhaps the dessert beverage genre as a whole.  Simply outstanding!",4.6

10333,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Deepest cider gold, still, very honest viscous legs coating the glass. Strong applesauce aroma, even more decadent than the pomelle I believe if less powerful and alcoholic. Elegant whole apples, juicy like no other. Red apples, pears, pancakes, toasty, baked nature. Greenish toward the end as it develops the mildest acidity. Incredibly controlled flavours. In mouth, this is one of those sensory overloads, immediate and cutting, one that makes you forget the world exists and take everyone of your concerns away to leave only you, your bubble, the glass, the cider and an ecstatic moment, one that cuts a bit short as you realise you’re holding a pen and must express your emotions one way or another. Thickest applesauce palate, as thick as a JW Lees, the dark lord of ciders if you will, cinnamon undertones, slick, only slightly boozy goodness. Almost fuelic and in a good way this time. Greenish tea finish, long and powerful.

Apricot, puree, high-brix honey, molasses, maple, fresh figs, black cherry pit notes in moderation, mild spiciness, white flowers undefined, vanilla, the mildest lavender essence, clove liqueur all hold my attention as long as they please. This aroma is pure, it is dew-scented, it is utterly magnificent. In the flavor, at first, medium-high acidity seems out of place and overdrawn. Sweetness is very high but it’s not as intense as expected, actually less than the Neige ice cider from the same ciderie, mostly due to relatively high acidity. Bold tropical fruit notes now include pineapple and mango, as well as lesser kiwi. Notes of woodgrain trickle in and back out again.

A very thick and viscous mouthfeel coates the entire palate with the apple sweetness.

Deep gold and syruppy. Lightly sparkling with a slightly rose hue. Lots of legs. Aroma of apples, peach, wood, alcohol. There was an odd but welcome truffle-like aroma that carried over to the flavour. Could have been from the wooden barrel. Excellent balance of sweet and tart.

634,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 vintage courtesy of the unbelievable generosity of Ughsmash.  Many thanks for knocking out the last of the beers I most sought out.

Ah, Kaggen - how you have eluded me all this time.  So many perfect scores have been bestowed on you.  So many arguments have been fought over whether you are the best beer in the world.  Finally my time has come to evaluate all the hype and praise.

In a nutshell, if falls far short of expectations.  The aroma was very nice.  The excellence of barrel-aging was very evident in both the aroma and flavour.  This alone allows me to appreciate the high degree of skill that was involved in this process.  However, there was a stark lack of balance here with each flavour component seeming a bit disjointed from the others.  The body was also a tremendous letdown for me as I was expecting something quite....well, ""imperial"" in nature.  I got very ordinary and run-of-the-mill.  Nothing huge in regards to the viscosity.  Which is fine if there’s a multitude of complexity and refinement in the flavour as was evident in the original batch of black hole from Mikkeller, for example.  However, while there were some interesting vinous notes along with some nice use of specialty grains, it was all rather uninspiring.",3.9
591,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,Bottle at Pikkulintu. Very dark brown. Nose is more dominated by chocolates than the ’normal’ version. This is an extraordinary brew; significantly rounder and more balanced as well as more sophisticated than the normal Stormaktsporter (which is a fantastic brew as such).

683,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle shared with extreme generosity by jjpm74.  Poured dark brown with light ruby highlites and a small creamy brown head.  Already much lighter than what I expected from what was purported to be an imperial stout.  Rich sweet aroma of dark bittersweet chocolate, butterscotch, and brown sugar.  Taste is sweet chocolate, a bit of woodiness, and some floral essences in alcohol, finishing more towards roasted coffee.  Although the alcohol is present, this does not taste like a 10% beer at all, as the flavors and the body almost have a delicate feel to them.  Very nice combination of bitter and sweet leads me to think that this would be an excellent dessert beer.  What Dark Lord gets right in being big, this beer does in being refined.  Though I could not call it a stout, I would say it is arguably the finest porter I’ve ever tasted.

320,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"[Bottle] purchased at the football pub in Rome. Pours a clear black with a creamy tan head that slowly dissipates. The aroma has a surprising amount of crystallized, floral honey, light roast, very light barrel, and chalky malt. The flavor has a little more balance. The honey is strong still, lots of floral notes, stronger barrel character than you would think on the aroma, toasty on the back end, and the finish lingers with a little bit of everything there. Nicely complex, but the main thing about this beer is the balance. the aroma is a little less so, but the flavor is stunning. The palate is a touch thin, especially for an imperial, but the alcohol only makes a very light appearance.

713,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle version 2006. Special thanks to Jack Pano from Sweden for bringing me this gift from the brewer. Pours a blacker than black beer with a solid brown to darkbrown head. The aroma is roasty with vanilla oak, coffee and fine chocolate and some notes of apples too. The appearance is simply superb with nice lacing. Flavour of slight peated malts, dark chocolate, coffe mokka, raisin bread and a hint of honey leaves this beer in a perfect balance. The use of noble hops comes out just enough in the taste but not overwhelming. The slight bitter aftertaste with notes of basterd sugar keeps on talking while some alocohol is well noticable but not attacking. N° 1, IMO a well deserved place and certainly not overrated at all and after all a superb brew and some left to stash away for quite some time :-) Nice to notice too that I am the 100rd RBian who rates this excellent beer!",5.0

Aroma starts out as a bouquet of floral and orange blossoms and warms into a bitter chocolate, vanilla, caramel. Taste is very bitter chocolate, cocoa powder on the finish, boozy, some citrus. It’s a little less robust than I was expecting. Palate is a bit oily, a bit thinner than I expected, but that doesn’t really detract. Really like this one.",3.8

361,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Black body, 1 inch of brown head.

Aroma has a beautiful smoke and dark chocolate/coffee mixture. Heavily roasted malts and some ashiness. Barrel comes through very well. Charred oak and light caramel.

The barrel is upfront in the flavor. It hides a lot of the depth and complexity that the base beer had. I don’t get as much of the sweetness and the ashy flavor is a little toned down. The alcohol cuts through that and leaves an acidic heavily roasted malt/coffee flavor on the palate. Lots of dark cocoa charred oak and light caramel. Creamy mouth feel with low-medium carbonation.",4.0

Huge tarry nose with lots of licorice/anisette boozy notes, but smooth. Salty dark chocolate is evident as well. Slick and peppery on the palate. Boozy and warming but not sweet or cloying. Has a a lot of licorice flavors and anisette-like qualities, but not overly sweet. Some molasses notes and peppery phenolics come through with a piny character (not piny as in hops) and lots of rich smooth coffee roast later on. There’s also a burnt marshmallow flavor which describes the smooth tasty sweetness and charred character. Unique and tasty. Has some subtleties that make it stand out from other barrel-aged giants. Nice stuff.",4.2

644,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Take every flavour you have experienced in a imperial stout before, blend it perfectly and put it in a small 25cl bottle. There you go. Besides the huge array of flavours in this imperial stout one of the most impressive aspects is the mouthfeel wich is creamy yet vinous, slightly oily, thick and slick. I don’t want to come of as patriotic because that has nothing to do with it, this is simply the best imperial stout I have ever had.",4.7
756,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Alright, I had the chance to get a sample of that (2005)  in Copenhagen, then I tried the new 2007 version at Oliver twist a few weeks later and retried, some days after, the 2005 thanks to my very generous Göteborg hosts: Marsiblursi. First off, the regular Stormaktsporter is an excellent imperial stout and rather tough to beat in complexity. I don’t quite understand the purpose of setting it in a barrel. It is apparently a rather short journey that it takes (2,5months), yet the effect is considerable as bourbon is obvious in the nose, but the low duration has allowed the body to keep most of its thickness, silkiness and richness. 
 So what do I think about it? Well, first off, I prefered the 2005 version which is 1% lighter and more developped and rounded around the edges at this point. The 2007 is still a fair bit boozy. The 2005’s complexity is more obvious and the concentrated fruitiness from the regular comes across more naturally. Appearance-wise, they both wear a fair diminishing dark beige head. Totally opaque, oily body, pitch black. The 2007 actually left legs on the glass. Gentle alcohol flavours, rum-soaked grapes, heady nose with wild leather smokiness, mint, vanilla (strong), chocolate roastiness and hard to pick up single fruits. Complex nuances, age-worthy, silky full body with honeyed and brown sugar tones. Very creamy, smooth carbonation. it manages to feel quite vinous at the same time, full on truffles, earth mushrooms powderiness and growing date square undertones. You can eventually all kinds of little nuances, which is the sign of a great beer. Still, at the end, I’m not convinced I prefer the barrel version and remain unconvinced that the rarity does not make me try harder to pick out stuff. Certainly a fine experience though. I’ll just give both Stormakts the same score.. but it is a sipper and I’m less into those that I once was.",4.1

Цвет черный, угольный, пенка кофейная, тонкая. Вкус не сложный но при этом сбалансированный.

188,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the ""best beers of the world"" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny.",4.8
514,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle at the Bishops Arms in Malmö. Business trips can be so nice! Dark beer with a very thin deep brown head. The aroma had first something smokey, afterwards dark fruit, coffee and chocolate came through. Thanks to the very low carbonation, the same flavours came in very strong. A kind of chocolate bitterness at the end. Excellent balance and for sure one of the best beers I ever drunk.",4.5
416,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Draught @BBF 2010. 2009 Version. This is quite possibly, the finest Imp Stout I’ve ever had. Well balanced coco/coffee/roast with a great lingering aftertaste. Ridiculous.",4.8

774,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"From a 25cL Bottle, Vintage 2005.  
Pours an incredibly dense chocolatey black color, inpenetrable by light, with a silky foam of caramelized marshmellow floating lightly on top.  A gentle swirl leaves some nice lacing streaks on the sides of my snifter glass and is enough to keep the chocolate island atop alive and healthy.  To be honest, my meditations on the appearance of this brew were distracted by a sneak preview of the aroma, which immediately blew me away, making me feel all giddy while at the same time forgetting completely about the appearance of the beer.  For one who diligently tries to capture the art of every beer consumed by photograph, this was quite a feat, although sadly, I wish I had a picture now to remember this experience by.  Onward.  Thick, intoxicatingly rich bouquet thats brimming over with bourbon soaked prunes that have been flambeed with a decadent caramel crust. Some softer fruits linger as well, almost like banana (although not the phenolic kind) crusted with some flaked coconut and sticky wildflower honey.  Some very mild vanilla bean and gentle chocolate fudge rounds out the bouquet nicely.  Like with the non-barrel aged version, I find it exciting to be tasting a beer that relies mostly on the intricacies of its malt profile to form the complexity, rather than relying on the polarizing roast, char, and alpha hops characters that so many of the other highly rated beers on this site use to set themselves apart from their categorical peers.  On that same note, the barrel character seems to be playing a supporting role in this cast, rather than the lead.  Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  A massive wave of complexity confronts my taste buds as soon as palate contact is made.  It starts ot with an incredible dry chocolate base thats enhanced by the caramelly bourbon  notes without getting too hot.  There’s a smooth transition where some dark, chewy, leathery characters begin to come out, and these are accented by a touch of tartness taking the form of prune skin tannins.  The finish is a remarkable display of balance, as the toasty, oaky characters come through strong by dancing on the edge of roastiness.  The palate is exceptionally long and clean, with all alcohols clearly masked; excellent example of extracting the great barrel traits without leeching out any of the negative.  A masterpiece.  Thanks for sharing, Chris!",4.5

This intensified more and more as I drank this.  The alcohol is quite warm at time and the chocolate picks up at the end.  Initially I really didn’t care all that much for this.  My initial rating was a 3.6 but the more I drank this the more flavours came out.  Lots of smoke started to come out as did some oak.  The body starts to intensify as it warms as well and the mouthfeel became really silky.  Very good, world class.

702,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Secret Santa hooked this one up!!!  The dilemma is this, I have convinced myself that this is indeed going to be the singular greatest beer I have yet to consume, causing me to ponder if this will actually live up to the billing.  Upon pouring, my heart races a bit.  A nearly completely light obliterating black, the only glimmer of color is the faintest brown, trying to escape around the edges.  The aromas coming forth are an opus of complexity, the likes of which are rarely attained.  Oak, vanilla, roasted malts, smoke, Valhrona Chocolate, the sugar crust of a creme brulee, Black Mission Figs, date syrup, plums all make their presence known.  Waves of olfactory pleasure engulf my psyche, pulling in more inward into a contemplative state.  I continue to inhale, wondering how this is possible.  The flavor is other worldly.  The roasted flavor is the first to makes its presence known.  As I continue, a light brown caramel teases the senses, sublimely yielding to a playful balance of oak, vanilla and Italian meringue, though ever so slightly.  The warming alcohol finishes what in essence is the brewer’s tour de force.  Perhaps it is not simply brewing, but is rather alchemy, transforming simple ingredients into a master piece.",4.8

Excellent sipping beer, not for glugging, that’s for sure. Looks like it’s been made to taste of whisky rather than to taste of wood that’s been steeped in whisky, or even to simply age itself.

804,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Re-rate bottled at Akkurat and at SMÖF.  The flavours are now more mature and balanced. The silkyness of teh regular Stormaktsporter now combines well with all the attractive barrel induced flavours.  It has grown one step further on bottles.


[Draught at Oliver Twist, Stockholm]  Intransparently black, small pale brown head. Rich aroma of licorice and wood. Sweet with full body and concentrated flavour of coffee, tar, oak and whiskey. Salty finish with vanilla and chocolate as well as a fair amount of bitterness. The barrel character does not overpower the other flavours, making it more balanced than many other barrel aged beers.",4.3

Smooth butterscotchy aroma with sweet molasses and honey. Plenty of oak that is balanced by toasty malt. Opaque dark red-brown with a wispy light brown top. Heavenly oak balanced by lots of chocolate and toast. Bubblegum dark malt as well with nutty toasty biscuit. Full body, moderate carbonation, smooth. Complex yet excellently balanced.",4.6
298,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 bottle, from trade with GTH. At last! One of the really big White Whales and a very appropriate selection for my 3000th entry here on Ratebeer - what a ride it has been! :-) Pours a tar black body with a medium light beige head. Nose is coffee, deep malty tones, leather, tar, honey, hints of wood, alcohol, licorice and vanilla. Very elegant and bourbon-like, despite not having touched any such barrels. Taste is burnt toast, licorice, coffee, leather, dark chocolate, dark malts, honey and hints of cellar must and alcohol. Medium body, soft carbonation. Very nicely balanced and well brewed, but times have certainly changed and while Kaggen might have been the top dog some years ago it’s no longer rare to encounter world-class imp stouts like this anymore. Regardless, this beer is still a beauty. Hats of to Närke for their accomplishments, and my toast to all the wonderful, cooky, funny, knowledgeable, geeky, hospitable and cheerful beer geeks here on the site. Chin chin for you all! :-)",4.2
802,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Sat down with the brewers from Närke on Friday October 24, 2008 at the SMÖF 2008 festival. We teamed up the 05 vs 06 vs 07. Didn’t take notes, but it was truly special!

Had this again now on Christmas Eve, shared a bottle with my wife just because I had the chance, did it at The Rover, Göteborg.
Excellent nice dark black color. Rich nose and taste, close to perfect!

First and second ratings.
Draught, sampled at the brewery. It’s like their """"""""Stormaktsporter"""""""" but bigger and better. More body, more taste, more powerful. Vanilla and oak in the scent and taste, as well as coffee. Pitch black look to it. Very nice, but something you might not drink too much of I guess, due to the high alcohol level.

Also tried as bottle on RBESG 2006, aged some, still great.

Third rating.
(25 cl bottle at The Rover, Göteborg)
Bought a bottle for myself, I wanted to re-rate and really enjoy this one. Screw the price!
Black look with a thick brown head. No transparency at all! Totally pitch black and gourgeous.
Sweet oily thick scent. Alcohol, some vanilla and bourbon whiskey smell as well. The vanilla and bourbon scent becomes more intense when the glass becomes emptier and the brew is warmed up and oxygenized. Smooth velvet mouthfeel. Smooth initial taste, transforming via tar and smoke towards rubber and warming alcohol. Taste is also chocolate and coffee when warmer, mostly chocolate though. Medium high bitterness. Long nice lasting aftertaste.
Extremely smooth, nice and friendly, too bad it’s fairly expensive and rare...
It’s worth it to buy a bottle to enjoy yourself though.
9/5/9/5/19=4.7

Fifth or so sample.
Shared a bottle with a friend at The Rover, Göteborg.
Pitch black color, rich brown head. Sweet rich raissin and coffee scent. Also scome alcohol, still very soft and very nice. Smell is also a touch of smoke and rubber, mixed with vanilla. I spent roughly 3 minutes looking at the beer and perhaps 10 smelling it before I even let the glass near my mouth, it’s just amazing, fantastic and all the big words together! Extremely big, large, huge, all of it, full rich palate, smooth and oily, best ever! Long chocolate and smoke aftertaste. Sweet sirupy taste, coffee and chocolate, smoke and rubber, also vanilla taste. This beer grows even better every time I drink it, and I can honestly say it’s the best beer I’ve ever had. I don’t like the use of 5.0 for a beer, what happens when you try something better? re-rate? But this one is truly worth it! A shame it’s almost gone. Luckily the new one is coming...

Last(?) rating: 
I had a bottle stored at The Rover in Göteborg, waiting for a special occasion. Then my favourite ice hockey team won gold in the Swedish Championships about 2 weeks back, so now the bottle is gone. I was quite sober though, only high on adrenalin, so it didn’t go to waste, I fully enjoyed every last drop of it.



First rating of the 2006 version
(Bottle at The Rover, Göteborg)
10%
Pitch black color, big brown head, lovely! Oak and vanilla scent, also some salt and the northern Swedish ocean/Baltic sea at fall smell. Smell is also sweet, grains and alcohol. Honey and heather in there as well, though the oak is rather dominant. Chocolate, roasted, sweet malt, melted vnilla ice-cream, coffee taste. Roasted, sweet coffee aftertaste. Thick, oily, smooth mouthfeel, medium high bitterness. Very, very nice, though I want it to age perhaps 6 months or so to mellow out and improve even more. Close to perfection!

Tried this the other day at the brewery, 2006 version.
Serious vanilla/oak nose to begin with, more than I have sensed before.
Nice long chocolate finish after it has warmed for a while.
I think it’s lovely just to sit down and enjoy it!


New rating, 2006 version from a pub in Göteborg

If you’re buying one that is 2006 vintage, as you should have. It’s the best. Bought my on Akkurat Bar in Stockholm. 345 SEK cost a bottle. Clearly worth it!

433,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"I can’t thank Jan enough for getting me this one, 2008 bottle, side by side with the regular 2008 Stormaktsporter.

Pours just like the regular version, pitch black with a thick tan head that recedes ever so slowly to a clumpy cap and leaves very good lacing.

Oh man, the smell on this one is wonderful.  It takes the chocolate sweetness and the fruity esters from the base beer and layers on a hefty dose of earthy leather notes and some spicy oak.  Espresso and honey as well.  Whoa.

The taste has an initial spicy kick from the oak and earthy sweetness from the honey.  The heavily roasted malts hang out underneath as well as the chocolate, which really takes a back seat compared to the regular version where it steals the show.  The finish is completely different as well with a hefty alcohol burn coating the throat.

Mouthfeel, much like the regular version, is stunning.  Just completely coats the mouth, so smooth with just the right carbonation.

This was definitely an interesting comparison to the normal Stormaktsporter and they differed more than I expected.  This beer is probably more complex and definitely has an earthier, oakier character.  Definitely one of the better beers I’ve ever had and marginally better than the normal version.  Very different beers though...",4.5

447,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 edition.  


Huge thanks to a very generous BA for the chance to finally taste this one. 

Pours jet black with a mocha head and a tad bit of lacing as it makes its way down. The smell is incredibly complex and quite forceful--I could actually get a pretty good whiff of it upon opening the bottle even before pouring it into my glass. Nose consisted of nearly every imperial stout adjective imaginable with great notes of chocolate fudge, vanilla, espresso, burnt dark fruits, roasted malt, and a bit of barrel characteristics. The taste brought things forward even more, really just layering the complexities in a very intense manner. 

The chocolate fudge really stood out to me at time, but in all honesty it was really difficult to pick out individual throughout, as everything was just so well integrated. In essence, all I can really say is that this is exactly what an imperial stout should taste like. I would say that for a beer with this incredible amount of flavor, the feel was a bit thin. However, the carbonation was really nice and let the flavors shine through. Drinkability was just out of this world. I can’t wait until the day when I get to try this again.",4.6
271,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle @ New Years Tasting. 2008 & 2009 vintages tasted side by side. Both poured a pitch black beer with a small tanned head on top. Aroma of both are epic, but there are differences. Aroma of 08 has more of the base beer shining trough, molasses, honey and overall very malty, while 09 has more iodine, medicinal and stronger characters shining trough. Flavors match both aromas perfectly, one being soft and gentle while the other one is powerful and strong. Both are boozy and sweet and very well balanced and rounded off. Surely getting the legendary status of this beer here. Great stuff, world class, even after all these years.",4.4

This beer will however conclude my RB postings from the CBF07. Ah well the beer :) : From 25 cL bottle. Pours completely black with  thick brown head, very creamy. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and slight tobacco. A vague dried fruity note too. Flavour is first chocolate, then toffee sweet and this becomes a strong liqourice dominans. A soft bitterness lingering into the finish. Clear presence of alcohol, but only reasonable. It does give the beer an initial edge. Very thick, very fullbodied.10-5-9-5-18",4.7

324,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks a lot, Brad! Served alongside Stormaktsporter.

2009 vintage

The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter.

A distinctly European aroma. It seems to me that Närke, Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, etc. possess distinctive characteristics not found in American stouts. Hooray for diversity and the unique aspects found in beers throughout the world. Anyhow...the beer smells terrific. Roast, chocolate, barrels, a touch of booze.

The flavor does not disappoint. Thick, chewy, viscous stout that coats the palate and melts in your mouth. The barrel character is outstanding. Present, but not overbearing. Beautifully balanced. Dark fruits, chocolate, roast, malt, barrels blending together in harmony.

Highly recommended, should you have the good fortune to sample this.",4.6

244,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Imperial Stout z dodatkiem miodu wrzosowego uwarzony 26 października 2016. Leżakował przez 3 miesiące w dębowych beczka po bourbonie. 

💣2-gi najlepszy RIS na świecie!!
Tuż za słynnym KBBS z Toppling Goliath Brewing Co.!!💣

Alkohol: 12% obj.

Kolor: Czarny, nieprzejrzysty.

Piana: Ciemnokremowa, nietrwała, złożona z drobnych oczek. Początkowy, wąski pasek piany szybko zniknął z pola widzenia. Zero zdobień szkła.

Zapach: Aromat jest śliczny, ale stonowany. Nie jest sztuczny i przesadzony w żadną stronę.
Czuć od groma ciemnych owoców, karmel, śliwki, czekoladę mleczną i wanilię. Po chwili otwiera się jak kwiat, aby wydobyć z siebie nuty dębiny, drewna,melasy i miodu wrzosowego.
Tylko przez chwilę powiało słodami palonymi i delikatną kawą.
Aromat jest krzyżówką nut, które znam z Imperialnych Stoutów oraz Barley Wine.

Smak: To co mnie najbardziej interesuje w tym piwie, to oczywiście smak.
Trzeba dać mu trochę szansę. Początek wcale nie jest łatwy. 
Ot taki uniwersalny Imperial Stout bogaty w nuty czekolady, kawy z dodatkiem mleka, melasy, ciemnych owoców i orzechów migdałowych.
Po znacznym ogrzaniu trunku, zaczynają się pojawiać ciekawe elementy: miód wrzosowy, przyprawy korzenne, zioła, dębina i wanilia.
Szlachetny alkohol rozgrzewa w klatce piersiowej. Tekstura Kaggen’a jest jedynie umiarkowania, na próżno można szukać tutaj gęstych, zawiesistych niuansów.
Pełnia zmienia się wraz z czasem, zmierzając do półwytrawnego finiszu.
Alkohol dobrze zakryty. 

Wysycenie: Średnie do niskiego.

Podsumowanie:

Närke Kulturbryggeri Kaggen Stomaktsporter 2016 - no cóż legenda, legendą, ale na kimś kto wypił już trochę wysoko ocenianych Imperialnych Stoutów w swoim życiu, nie zrobi to piwo większego wrażenia.
Należy mu oddać jednak honor za ciekawy profil smakowy, niestandardowy dodatek (miód wrzosowy), interesujące nuty beczkowe i gładki odbiór.

Z całym szacunkiem dla moich szwedzkich kolegów, którzy nakręcają spiralę wokół tego piwa - nie jest warte swojej ceny 😉

Nie ma się co zabijać dla tych 25 centylitrów.
Jest wiele ciekawszych i tańszych piw i to nawet w Europie.

763,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2/8/07.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with omhper on RateBeer 12/11/06.  2005 Vintage.  I hate my glass.  Somehow it manages to present an entirely different (and worse) aroma of this beer than the delicious treat my friends’ glasses have shown.  So I’m combining the two into some sort of amalgam.  Starts briefly with a very raw acetone nose, some grapey and intense black rum-cake notes as well.  Fudge liqueur, boozier than the regular Stormaktsporter, and with some tangy wood-solvent in the nose that fades later.  Flavor is amazing, with rich ash-rum and black raisiny chewiness and some almost overpowering sweetness that just drops out with perfect elegance into a deep, dry, ashen and faintly cocoa-flavored trail-- grainy like a black-and-white, low-light photograph.  The flavor depth that these elite Scandinavian breweries somehow routinely extract from their malt bills is absolutely astounding.  Somewhat thinner, drier mouthfeel than its silky sister; fluffier and slightly more scratchy carbonation.  Tobacco all over the finish.  This is a fabulous beer and deserving of all the praise, but I still prefer it in its more drinkable state, untainted by the funnel of whiskey saturation.  Thanks so much, Per!",4.4

13849,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Served on-tap at Bainbridge Street Barrel House during their 1st anniversary party. Reviewed from notes.




A - Pours black with a nice one and a half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small trails of lace down the sides of the glass.




S - Smells of warm bourbon, strong chili heat, room temperature chocolate, vanilla beans, fresh ground cinnamon and a bit of light booze. Was really hard to finish my glass because it smelled so incredible.




T - Starts off with a quick hit of chocolate, caramel and vanilla sweetness quickly being joined by hints of cinnamon, chillies, drying oak and smooth bourbon burn. Finish is pretty sweet with some heat, lingering for quite awhile. Not as intoxicating as the nose but still really damn good.




M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Despite the big, roasty body it was still really smooth, only a bit of booze creeping in at the end of each sip.




O - This might be the best chili stout I have ever had. It packs all of the flavors I enjoyed in the base beer and the bourbon was strong but not over the top. I really loved the choice of rye barrels for this one, really brought it all together. I would love to have this again in the future.",4.5

Pour is brown/black with a medium sized tan head.  Aroma is...woah...cinnamon forward - but there’s a lot else in there...sweet malt, chocolate, toffee, vanilla, smooth whiskey in the background - this stuff is pretty solid and definitely different!  Flavor is very intriguing and original as well - the cinnamon is still very prevalent, but there’s a healthy dose of chocolate, spice, vanilla, roasted malt, and after a while, some gentle heat kicks in - I loved this aspect of the beer - the chile was there, but it didn’t try to steal the show.  Barrel aging seemed to smooth things out in general, and the rye whiskey is also there, but not forward.  Palate seemed appropriate for the drink.  This one impressed - very solid beer and one I’d LOVE to try again to appreciate it further!",4.2

But this beer is every bit Hunahpus equal, but also distinctly different. Nose is big on chili and cinnamon mixed with chocolate the effect is almost peanut butter like. This beer is just silly with chocolate. Its prominant in the nose but its all over the flavor. The mouthfeel like Hunanpus is huge and thick. Silky Smooth on the palate and scarily drinkable. Finish with a flash of chocolate and lingering chili and cinnamon. One of the best beers I’ve had in some time.

13888,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Bottle (750 ml). From Mark, huge thanks for this one! Tasted a couple of beers after the regular Abraxas. Reddish black with a small dark reddish-brown head that leaves little to no lacing. Aroma is as described: lot of cinnamon, ancho chile, cacao, vanilla, whiskey and wood. Taste is about the same with the ancho chile being more present. At first, the bourbon and cinnamon are more present, then the dark chocolate and spices/chile take most of the place. Warming/spicy finish. Hot. Full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Oily mouthfeel. Very complex and absolutely unique. The balance is only average (quite good considering everything going on in there), but so much better than in the regular one. The barrel treatment really enhance this beer and make it multi-layered compared to the completely unidimensional regular Abraxas. More hot than Hunhapu, and probably even more complex, but harder to drink. We split the bottle 6-ways and there was still 5+ oz left in the bottle that we weren’t able to finish.",4.0

Body brings out immediate silky melted dark chocolate, powerful bourbon but no white alcohol or tomato paste. The back end gives tremendous chili heat, cinnamon, dessert spices, bourbon warming. Heating, face flushing back end. Rich, well integrated. This is essentially a redux of Cigar City Hunahpu without the lemon acid and thin tea body. Very delicious and worth the hype.

13765,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Thanks to Matt and Kevin, shared with my family on Christmas Eve.

Pours a viscous black color, with a small, fluffy, dark brown head, leaving back a perfect, thin lacing at the side of the glass.

Smells of sweetened cinnamon on top of earthy malts, bakers chocolate and a gentle amount of coffee. The Bourbon qualities aren’t too present on their own, but blend very well into the chili spices, adding heat and wood to the nose. Notes of molasses provide a sweetness to the brew, which gets supported by the omnipresent cinnamon spiciness outstandingly well. 

Begins with rich cinnamon flavors straight from the beginning, while earthy, toasted malts, as well as slightly bitter coffee build the foundation of this beer. The cinnamon gets a bit sticky and dusty, while it turns pretty intense on the palate, with molasses and toffee adding a lot of sweetness to its dominant spiciness. The Bourbon barrel, mirroring the nose, doesn’t turn very present on its own, while it interacts perfectly well with the chilies, leaving the spicy cinnamon with an interesting, hot and complex touch on the palate. The sweetness gets balanced by a wooden Bourbon bite, which got a semi dry, bitter aspect to it, highlighting the earthy malts. 

Finishes with a sublte, spicy burn, while coffee becomes more present, still with a slick sweetness detectable, which is now calmed by the wooden maltiness, while the Bourbon shines through in its wooden, vanilla qualities, with a peppery bite. Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, with a hot burn in the end. The beers body is incredible full and quite different to the normal version, while providing less coffee, way more cinnamon and the proper sweetness.",4.6

I think I like the regular Abraxas a touch more.",4.4

Pours incredibly black, inky, viscous, and ends up with a finger and a half of dark brown head, creamy looking, too. Incredible aroma of sweet chocolate and cinnamon, spicy rye whiskey, very very faint peppers, vanilla, roasted marshmallows. It’s like cinnamon s’mores with whiskey, though the whiskey supports rather than overpowers the smell. Flavor follows with awesome cocoa powder and cinnamon, vanilla whiskey notes, ever so slight spice and warmth that lingers from a combination of the peppers and the alcohol. Thick and viscous, though not syrupy, low carbonation but enough bubbles to keep things thick, and very rich with a slightly roasty dry finish. I was expecting more whiskey on this one, but it melds into the beer so well. Seems very much worth the hype here. Incredible beer, though still takes a back seat to DB Huna for me.",4.8

Nice aromas of cocoa, pepper spice, vanilla with a mild oak and alcohol. Taste is nicely balanced as you would expect from the nose. Nothing is jumping out and dominating the palate, but each ingredient makes it;s presence known. Nice cocoa and vanilla sweetness that cuts the pepper heat and barrel character nicely. Just wishing it was a bit more ""bold"" in terms of body and character. Typical gluttonous expectations. Finishes a bit ""hot"", but fairly balanced. I get more of the sweetness in the back end where I was hoping for some dry cocoa to harmonize with the alcohol. All in all, a great beer that I look forward to trying again!",4.1

Flavor was pale malt, some caramel, slightly mellifluous, then predominantly piney acidogenic hops, citrus, cantaloupe and grapefruit, then alcohol.

 Pours hazy golden and a creamy off-white head. Extremely well-balanced hoppy aroma with a pleasant sweetness from the malt in the background. Caramel, nut and grass notes. Flavor is bitter hoppy, but also with a strong note of cookie and cake that gives a good sweetness. Caramel, apricot and fruit in there as well. Extreme bitter dry end. No sign of the high ABV. Very nice specially considering it is hand bottled and send across the ocean!",4.1
7402,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"A very pleasant IPA to drink. Aroma of fresh hops, citrus and stone fruit. Some pine. Flavor is similar. The malt is a bit recessed but not weak. I thought the fruity flavors really come forth and there is a LONG bitter finish. That 10.2% is completely masked. Not very sticky or oily for a triple IPA. This is a bit hyped but it is also very good and up there with the best.",4.1
7687,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Growler shared by alexsdad06. Poured clear bright copper color with a large frothy off-white head that was lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy complex sour citrus hop and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with dry slick texture and soft carbonation. Heavy smooth bitter citrus flavor with a heavy bitter finish of long duration with a small alcohol burn as it warms. This is a standout beer. Thanks Brad.,4.4
8008,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Najas. Holy schnikes this is powerful. It’s akin to a barleywine to my buds. I like it, but it’s hard to have more than one. I prefer The Elder. The flavor is incredibly complex, has all the flavor ingredients to it, but perhaps I prefer the DIPA’s to the TIPA’s. 

Rerated- 4/27/08: Had a few of these at Luck Baldwins Barleywine festival. It was so delicious I went back for more. Huge hop aroma and taste. Amazing beer. 

Rerated again on June 20, 2009. My first ever 5. This beer is perfect for me in every possible way. It is the ultimate maven of all IPA beers.",5.0
7953,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Handbottle from MrBendo.  Aroma:  Pretty similar to the Elder but with a bit with less sweetness and a more resinous character.      Strong citrus, resin and pine, and a light floral note.  Appearance:  Light amber in color and slightly hazed.  Off-white head was small and foamy with decent retention.  Fair lacing.  Flavor:  Lightly sweet malt with a touch of honey.  Hops kick in with a strong pine and resin notes, grapefruit and mango, and some light floral and grass into the finish.  Bitterness is much more aggressive than the Elder, but not unpleasant.  Dry finish with hop flavors and bitterness carrying over.  Alcohol comes out stronger as it warms.  Palate:  Mediu-full bodied.  Moderate carbonation.  Some light alcohol warming in back of the mouth.  Overall:  It’s hard to decide which of the Plinys I like more.  This one is definitely more over the top with hop flavor and bitterness.",4.1
7352,Russian River Pliny the Younger,This beer smells of pine with a beautiful golden orange color. It is very hop forward with a lot of pine and a bit of floral in the follow through. It feels heavier on the palate than most IPAs do. An outstanding beer.,4.5

7490,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Massively hopped! Pine and fresh hops; almost woody aroma. Malt in the base, but honestly not as much as I'd expect for an 11% Triple IPA.

Big hop presence desperately balanced by the malt profile. Finishes slightly boozy with hop resin as it descends, though it doesn't bite with bitterness like its underlings might.

Really tasty overall; *significantly* better than Elder. In a world of Alpine, Kern, and Hill Farmstead, Younger proves Russian River is still relevant.",3.9

Light malt elements held the sticky, super hoppy body together all the way through the long citrus/bitter finish. Outstanding brew.",4.6
8076,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Hand bottled:  Courtesy of Crosling via trade.  Great grapefruit hop aroma.  Pours a transparent golden-orange with a insignificant head.

7551,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On draft at Hollingshead in Orange. Sorry people, this is not all as cracked up as it is. Probably the most overrated beer I have ever had. Clear, orange pour with a decent head. Some resemblance of hops and citrus in the aroma. But not much punch in the flavor. It seemed watered down in my opinion. Nothing like 90 minute, Hopslam, or Dreadnaught IPA. Could hardly sense any hops for a so called ""Triple IPA."" Could it have been a bad keg? I hope so, but definitely not worth waiting in line for hours upon hours when I feel there are better Imperial IPA’s out there (lucky for me I did not wait in line).",3.7

7973,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Ross VERY generously shared this rare handbottled beer from Irishboy, Thank You both! OK, this beer pours out a beautiful orange with a thin white head more of a lacing because of the handbotteling. As soon as Ross handed me the glass I could smell wonderful citrus grapefruit aroma and flower nectar. First swallow is amazing the beer is rediculously smooth with all the hops, grapefruit, and nectar forming into a sweet yet piney bitter taste that is just out of this world. AMAZING beer.",4.7
8004,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Toronado. I had this a few months ago, and just found my notes. Seems to be hopped a lot more than the Elder, but it has a big crisp citrus flavor. This brew is more balanced than one would expect, given the hop content.",3.8

Malt is absent and hops are slightly sharp.  Mouthfeel is very delicate and light, perhaps a bit oily from the hops.  Mild carbonation.  Great DIPA.  Resinous hops throughout the taste.  Perhaps a bit of harsh bitterness compared to past years.  Alcohol noticeable on finish after about half of the glass.",4.0
7536,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Old review of last years Pliny, this years was lacking. On draft at Monk’s for Pliny the Younger Day and at St Stephens. Poured into a wine glass and janded to us as we walked in the door. The beers sits tangerine shimmering, glowing orange with a half-finger silky smooth laced out off-white head. Aroma of honey, nectarine, orange, juicy hop resin, grapefruit, soft soil, lemon zest, and very slight notes of soap sups and pine. Very dry, yet soft and inviting nose. Pure grapefruit, nectarine, and even peachy bitterness. The body and mouthfeel of this beer intertwine in a dance of pure hoppy citrus flavor and juicy, supportive soft stickiness. This is the best balanced IPA I have ever tasted. Of course this beer could never live up to the outrageous hype, but it comes pretty goddamn close. This is a truly unique, rewarding beer experience. Cheers!",4.3
7440,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Multiple pours at Falling Rock, Sunday release. Side by side with Pliny the Elder. Golden and clear with an average white head.

Medium body with a lasting, bitter finish. About as good as IPA’s can get.",4.3
7850,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler courtesy of my hero tpd975. Wow! I finally get to try this. Thanks Greg. Pours crystral clear deep gold with nice off white head. The aroma is huge with tangelo, apricot, mango and sweet orange citrus like hops that demand another whiff. There’s also a nice foundation of smooth sweet malts from which the huge hop aromatics have been erected. The taste is much the same with tangelo, apricot and mango all seemingly oozing with pure perfectly ripe citrus-like juices. The very late addition hop flavors slowly give way to evenly smooth yet decidedly bold hop bitterness that grows right to the finish. Even with a solid slick sweet malty backbone the full force hop flavor and bitterness don’t let up until deep into the after taste. Simply amazing. This one is bangin’ on all cylinders and more than lives up to what I was expecting.",4.6

7677,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at the brewery on 2010 release day.  OK, I have been waiting a long time to get this and after not being able to get any last year, made it a mission.  My eldest son and I flew to San Fran to begin our Cali beer quest on Thursday, the day before the release.  Drove up in a rental car and got to the brewery around 1:00PM.  Was worried because the line was long and not moving.  Apparently, everyone that got in around opening at 11:00 were still inside having a good time.  After a two-hour wait, we made it into the pub and got a table.  First off, we ordered glasses of Younger.  The anticipation and hype were so high, I was hoping I wouldn’t be disappointed.  We weren’t.  This brew is magical.  Simply heavenly.  It pours a beautiful golden with a thin white head.  The nose was of grass and pine and just about perfect.  The taste.  Well, the taste was perfect.  It was of pine and grass and I could have drank it all day.  Lovely.  The mouthfeel was fantastic too.  It was creamy, yet tingly with a mouth-grabbing bitterness and bite to it.  I could drink this all the time and never get tired of it.  This was a beautiful beer-drinking experience.  One of my top-five of all time.  Luckily, i was able to get three growlers, two of which I traded and one for myself and the Houston RBers.  Wish I could get this every year.",4.7
7472,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draft at Monks (now 3 years running, and the line keeps getting longer.) Usually the place is too crowded for the event to even attempt a live rating. So pulling a bit from memory here. I think what makes the Younger extraordinary is that it is both amazingly high hopped and very high in alcohol yet the finished product is so smooth and delicious that it feels impossibly drinkable. Simply like a very exact and refined sweet gentle IPA. Yet wait 10 minutes and the alcohol kicks in. Like a magic trick. On top of that it has a perfect looking gold pour. Clearly a lot of time and work went into making this beer appear effortless.",4.6

PtY pours a nearly clear golden orange color with active carbonation creating a ring of white head and ample lacing. Aroma is overall floral with a sweet fruity complexity, and slightly dank. Flavor is amazing: resinous, sweet and bitter all at the same time. Notes of tropical fruit, pine, malt and floral complexity combine to make this triple IPA worthy of the hype. For an 11% beer, the alcohol is very well masked. A memorable event to be able to try this.",5.0

7836,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Draft at Toronado. Very nice gold/orange color. Wonderful hop and fruit combo swirling in this baby with a little bong hit resin thrown in for good measure.,4.2
8077,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Yellow gold. Tight, small white bubbles struggle to the surface. Orange marmalade, pine needles, chamomile, hopsack, and peach fuzz aromas. Decadently thick, but it’s much fuzzier than it is creamy. Initially gooey with palate-hugging resins and a gentler underlay of juicy hops. Resinous viscosity delays the inevitable hop bludgeon, but that’s not to say the oils haven’t already inflicted substantial damage to the taste buds. Sappy sweetness is overwhelming, yet the hops do retain a significant level of juicy brightness. Hops discharge a strapping sting of tannins as they climax, but the bitterness remains secondary to the explosive hop flavors. Merely a light brush of dusty malts. Odd aspirin notes dull the overall brightness and add to the disagreeable mixture of spent tealeaves and a hint of overripe tropical fruit acidity. Finishes oversweet and mushy with a citrus marmalade and honey drenched pale malt fusion as melon seeds and tangerines linger. The aroma suffers from being  one-dimensionally hoppy (once again, Amarillo is likely the culprit), and beneath that, there’s some unpleasant meatiness. Flavorwise, Vinnie’s done a marvelous job at extracting every drop of hop flavor imagineable, but the resinous goo largely overshadows the brighter hop traits. Soidly done.",3.8

The hop attack is intense and it’s blended somehow with this tasty citrusy fruit that is just awesome. The 11% ABV is sooo misleading, because you can’t even tell it’s there. Completely drinkable, completely enjoyable...one of the best 3x IPA’s I’ve had. Thanks aspidites!""",4.6

7740,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Ahh, the elusive Younger. Was it worth the wait? Quite possibly.  But that is not to say that a good pint of PtE isn’t just as good, with a tenth of the amount of trouble to get.  Aroma is hugely hoppy, lots of grapefruit, tropical fruits, lemon zest, wonderful.  Mouthfeel is fairly full as far as DIPAs go, almost a bit oily.  Flavor starts and finishes with the most rounded, balanced yet assertive hop assault I’ve ever tasted.  Alcohol adds heft to this beer, but is not intrusive. Excellent, but as a complete drinker I’ll give the edge to Elder overall.",4.5

Ah, at last! The Younger. I don’t even want to go on and on about the rate, so just some rough impressions: big lovely juice nose, apricot and all the expected citrus,  more fruity and less herbal than the elder brother, gorgeous flavor like drinking some kind of crazy hop liqueur  that could have been a 37% eau de vie of hops what for all the flavor intensity but drank like a 9% IIPA on the tongue.

It bitter, without being too biter. LOTS of fruit flavors as well. No alcohol bite at 11%. This beer will assault you with flavors, yet it still nicely balanced and smooth.

7498,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"It’s been a couple of hours since I had a 10oz pour at the Russian River Brewpub on Valentine’s Day, last day of the Younger.  I’m going to compare this to the Elder, because if you’ve had the Younger, you’ve probably had the Elder.
There’s no doubt that the Younger beats the bottled Elder hands down, but Elder on tap is a different story.  The bouquets are very similar, but the Younger is a little more hoppy and a little drier in the finish.
Personally, I think I prefer the Elder (just barely).  It strikes me as more balanced and a little more drinkable (which could be a bad thing).  Either way, it’s a damn fine beer you should not hesitate to try if given the chance.",4.5

7861,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler sent down by Taverner.  This beer is THE definition of the term ""hop bomb.""  The instant that the growler is cracked, a rush of monster pine and citrus hop aroma explodes from within.  I can smell this sucker from 3 feet away.  I would swear that there were whole, freshly picked hops dripping with resin floating within if I did not know better.  Grapefruit, orange, mango, and dank, sticky pine resin are as potent as I’ve ever encountered, and that is a major feat considering the heft of the underlying, smooth toffee malt base.

Visually, this brew looks every bit the part of a monster IPA.  Virtually clear and shining orange-amber in color, the body is crowned by a dense, foamy, off-white head that lasts.  A sticky wash leaves sugary legging and micro-spot lacing behind.

Flavors are as bold as the nose suggests, palate crushing bitterness stemming from the insane avalanche of fresh grapefruit and pine resin hops.  As bitter as it is, this is surprisingly easy to drink due to the excellent balance that the toffee malt offers.  Quite simply put, this stuff is delicious.

The body is huge and viscous, appropriately sticky but finishing much cleaner than the 11% ABV suggests.  Bitter hop resin lingers for hours, yes....hours, after the finish.  Knowing that I would pay for it the next morning, I couldn’t help but drink about 1/3 of a growler on my own.  I sniffed the empty growler the next morning before work just to remember how special this world class beer is.  Fantastic!",4.5

The flavor was pretty crisp, the hops were quite abundant as expected.  More piney than fruity i’d say overall although there were semblances of both in the flavor.

7739,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"a special thanks to Wavers1 for this growler.  please, beleive the hype, this beer is makes me want to do flips.  popping the top off the growler sends an immediate bouquet of dank and hops and piney resin.  the appearance is beautiful with a head that lasts forever.  the aromas are wonderful piney, a little citrus and throw in the best dank your medicinal provider can give you.  the tastes lingers forever and the alcohol is well hidden.  i will do everything to get another growler of this next year.",5.0
7506,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Amazingly complex but still rounded and balanced. Seems to be a little more harsh on the palate than last year. Also maybe a bit more on the grapefruit flavors. It still really doesn't taste like a 10% beer. Worth the 90 minute wait.

7932,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Sllightly hazy orangish-gold color with small head. Sharp grapefruit and citrus aroma with a hint of the alcohol to come. Taste is sweet with a subtle, but obvious, alcohol burn. It’s not the biggest hop bomb ever, but is balanced oh so nicely. The sugary sweetness and alcohol are never too far behind the hops. Even this hand bottle session was quite fizzy, and the bitterness is bearable.",4.1
7586,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Tap on Day 2 of the 2012 release at the brewery.  Honey golden pour with a minimal white head that remains a thing ring around the glass.  Negligible lacing.  Just a few tiny bubbles in the glass.  Aroma of grassy hops and grapefruit rind.  Huge hoppiness flavor.  I was told by staff that this years batch is hoppier than previous.  Warm and hoppy in the mouth, there’s no other way to describe it.  Not the syrupy, full mouthed texture I was expecting but a legendary hop bomb.  I’m side-by- side tasting it with Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder and it makes both of those beers seem small.",4.2
7432,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Tap at West End. Pours clear, bright copper orange with quickly settling white head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is huge citrus and piney hops, resinous, floral. Flavor is big citrus, juicy, tangerine, spruce hops with a citrus, pine finish and lingering aftertaste. Crisp and clean. Moderate carbonation, medium body.",4.3
7886,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Here we go, the one I was waiting for!  On tap at Obriens Russian River night before all the TION beers went on.  Pours a hazy copper golden with a thin off white head.  Aroma is really a hop masterpiece,  pungent and fresh beyond belief.  Super fresh hops,  Floral and citrusy, leafy and earthy.  Flavor is hoppy as hell.  Again floral and citrusy, plenty of pine as well, resiny.  A sweet caramel malt backbone manages to balance out the huge bitterness quite well.  Big and chewy with medium carbonation.  Pure hop goodness.  I need more.",4.7
7906,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Hand bottle shared graciously the day after arrival by slob. Pour was a little flat, so the appearance was a bit off for the style, but certainly acceptable (head not as big, not as many bubbles rising in the body). Full orange and citrus in the nose. The flavor followed the aroma, rich orangey citrus above all else, nice bitter finish, just really drinkable, great stuff. Can’t imagine this on draft. Thanks, Bert, sorry I drank half of your one bottle :).",4.5
7294,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Got it on tap at Tustin Brewing Company (raced over when I saw they'd put it on tap).  My first impression is that this tastes a *lot* like Pliny the Elder with more bitterness in the finish.  It looks like that beer with a clear light amber body but almost no head at all.  The bitterness has some citrus rind but it's quite vegetal in nature although not overpowering like some IPAs.  It reminds me a bit of the hop flavor in Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum.   Good balancing sweetness and it's very drinkable at 10.25% ABV.  The hops really dig in all the way around the tongue and stay put long after the sip is over.  A great ""triple"" IPA that I would definitely make an effort to try again, but I wouldn't go through some of the ridiculous efforts that I've heard others have to go through to get it.",4.2
7883,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draft. Damn this was a spectacular eff’n beer. Poured a hazy orange with a white head. Super floral aroma, some orange citrusy as well, just smelled awesome. Super smooth flavor, very drinkable for 11%, very well balanced and overall one of the finest beers I have ever had.",5.0
7958,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at O’Briens.Aroma of pine, citrus, banana, peach, and floral accents. Color is transparent golden with a slight cloudiness, Smooth on the palate and the flavor was superb. Full body of hop bitterness and nice fruit and pine. Good depth and with not a strong alcohol presence. Only till you are into the pint do you feel the alcohol man! Awesome Brew!",4.2
7939,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Stone.  Beautiful clear golden amber with small fluffy head.  Aroma of pine, rosemary, and honey.  Thick syrupy palate.  Sweet malty some what fruity initial taste transitioning to a good bitter bite and finishing with a great lingering floral hoppy taste.",4.7
7830,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler shared by tertons, thank you Nelson!  This was my breakfast in bed at EBF, as i laid in bed with the covers half on inhaling the sweet nectar aroma of this delicious IPA, it was an incredible start to an awesome festival.  Pours a honey amber body.  I could smell this all day like the elder.  A brilliant grapefruit, citrus aromatic character with hints of pine and alcohol.  Fragrant floral hoppiness, citrus and pear and no disgusting caramel malt bill, just beautiful bouquet of hoppiness.  A mild etoh warming puts this one a hair away from perfection.  Amazing ipa!",4.6
7898,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Thanks to Iowaherkeye for the chance to try this.  Handbottle.  Didn’t know if I would get the chance.  Poured a light gold color into the glass.  Aroma was all tropical fruit.  Papaya, mango, sweet and awesome.  Taste was huge tropical notes as well, piney as well with malt character that doesn’t get in the way.  Not quite as crazy as I expected, actually, this is up there for one of the most drinkable big beers out there.  I can’t think of anything that beats it.  At 11%, this stuff is very dangerous.  I can’t even imagine it on tap.  Wow, I wish I had a keg of this for the summer.",4.1
7743,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"[Growler] with a huge thanks to kmweaver! Thanks again, Ken! Pours a hazy vibrant copper color with a moderate off-white head. Initial whiffs give loads of resinous hops - tons of grapefruit, pine sap and needles, peach, mango, orange, and there’s also a bit of malt in the background there. Flavor is remarkably hoppy with citrus, pine, some metallic character from the alcohol, and a huge bitterness at the end with the malt just barely keeping it together. This beer is huge and abrasive - not terribly drinkable, but immensely enjoyable. The quintessential west coast hop bomb.",4.2
7689,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at the Falling Rock in Denver and out of a kick ass growler thanks to Bill. Both times the experience was the same. Pours a crystal clear, golden body with a creamy, finger-width, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a veil of lacing throughout the session. The aroma is incredible. Tons of fresh, dank, oily hops. Resiny pines, sweet citrus, passion fruit, mango, florals, dense earth, herbs, and melons with a touch of caramel. A fantastic aroma. Flavor is a hop explosion as well and fairly sweet. Tons of bright, piney, grassy citruses, wet and dank earth, flowery tropical fruits, resins, a touch of honey, and a decent amount of caramel. Finishes dry and bitter with a very lengthy, oily, and resiny aftertaste. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Not a bad balance at all for such an explosion of hops and no hint of alcohol until a slight warmth shows up in the throat. Overall, this definitely lives up to the hype. Hoppy as shit with an outstanding aroma. A pleasure both from the tap and the growler. Awesome DIPA.",4.3
7832,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at the Falling Rock $7 per 1/2 pint, wow. Served in a wine glass, nice orange color, smells amazingly hoppy like Pliny the Elder. Tastes bitter, hoppy, stronger. Honestly I think the Elder is better. This didn’t seem to add hoppy value, only alcohol. A delicious IPA but the elder is better as far as I’m concerned.

7728,Russian River Pliny the Younger,100th rating and it had to be special. Finally!! I got my half pint from Falling Rock. Well worth the wait and if they can up production I dare say this could become the new standard in the IIPA world. Great overall balance much different from PTE as far as hop flavors go. Mainly pineapple with a splash of grapefruit and a soft semi dry finish. While they may share the same title PTE and PTY are very different and depending on your preferance for hop flavors will be what draws you one way or the other IMO. I can say however without a doubt that I prefer PTY and it is at the moment my favorite IPA/IIPA hands down.,4.3

7733,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Huge thanks to Baker(wavers1) for being so kind, and sending this along with so many awesome brews.  Took this to our local Tuesday get together to share.  From the growler pours a slightly hazy bright gold with a medium off white head.  Aroma is all over the hop spectrum.  Pine resin, some spruce tip, light citrus notes.  Flavor is full on hop.  I don’t think it’s entirely one sided, there is enough light doughy malt to balance, but it’s more or less a blank canvass for the hops to shine on.  Strong bitter dry hop finish with pine dominating.  So good and not a trace of the 11 percent until I felt drunk 5 mins later.  Thanks again Baker!",4.4

Been wanting to try the Younger for a while and it certainly lives up to expectations. Blam! Nice glowing pour of dark orange, with a stick head. Extremely dank aroma, almost daring you to dive into the nicely sticky beer. Piney and resinous, just as you’d want, with malt balance perfectly achieved. Without wanting to shift philosophical categories too much, perhaps the Platonic form of a DIPA?",4.2
7605,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"I had this at Uber. To tell you the truth, I think this beer is a LITTLE overrated. Overall, it’s great,
but I don’t think it’s ""waiting in line for any amount of time"" great. It had a nice haze-orange appearance.
The little bit of head that was actually produced, faded away. Looks like a hazier version of the Elder, to me. 
It has an awesome citrus hop aroma. Tons of fresh orange and citrus hop just blast my olfactories. In terms of aroma,
this is amazing. Wow, this has an extremely pungent aroma. I thought it would be a bit maltier, that is - slightly more
nuanced, but it was to the point, which I’m happy about. Considering its aroma, I’d have to say this is pretty amazing.
I was expecting a bit more of a hop blast on my taste buds, but, quite honestly, this isn’t that much better than
the Elder, considering the overall flavor. It is very delicious, and has a wonderful fresh squeezed orange juice
flavor, with a lovely citrus hop flavor that just impresses the hell out of me. The texture is a bit more oily than
the Elder, which is great. Overall, I’m very happy to have tried this, but to me, the hype is a little ridiculous.
I’ll stick to my every-once-in-a-while fresh Elder.",4.2

7032,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Tiny snifter at Floyds on Dark Lord Day. Solid black well of souls lurks under  a tiny rim of foam, which has given up in its attempt to brighten up this evil brew and now clings panting for its last breath to the side of the glass. A dizzying smell of coffee, maple, vanilla and molasses. Taste... um, um, Thick. Heady. Oaky. Slides down the throat like an oily serpent marinated in Kahlua and vanilla extract. Smooth alcohol nonetheless goes right to my forebrain and shuts off higher functions. Complexity… um… just starting to be known. Notes of cola… wintergreen… cherries. Rough on the back of the throat, but not astringent like other strong stouts. The dividing line between this and a truly fine liquer is… um…

7034,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Sipping a big goblet full of this black, oily, hazy topped berzerker, I pondered the whole madness surrounding the recent Dark Lord release fiasco.  The forum threads had a circus-like atmosphere with ugly attitudes and greedy tones that made me feel like I was reading a forum completely foreign to me.  I wanted a case of Dark Lord and I wanted to try this barrel aged beer, which contains every bit of chocolatey, rough espresso edged goodness I expected, delivered in a malty, oaky, alcoholic envelope of teeth clenching bourbon., warming my stomach and sticking like glue to the sides of my tongue.   Personally, I’d rather not stand in line for $180 worth of beer that I used to get in $20 growlers, but I completely understand supply and demand (I often spend $250 on an urban vinyl toy that sold-out for $100 just minutes before).  I rather enjoy when the pub is filled up and rowdy, too, almost as much as I enjoy it’s quiter moments, but the thought of seeing the people who had recently caused such goofy fury on the forums and being directly associated with that forum made me rethink the reasons why I’ve been a member of ratebeer for the last 50 months.  For the first time I didn’t want to go to Three Floyds directly because of my association to Ratebeer!  Rating beer was a lot of fun, meeting people was tenfold the fun but now I feel that the ratings and racking of numbers and boorish forum behavior has cheapened the experience for me.  I can honestly say that I didn’t want to be a part of the Ratebeer group that rallied at the Pub last weekend.  I value many of you as friends on an individual basis, so I hope I’m not coming off sounding elitist or rude. I have met a ton of great people because of Ratebeer and will continue to keep in touch with many of the people here, but through emails and other routes.  I also found myself using Ratebeer forums as an outlet for my own grumpiness sometimes and that’s not what this site is supposed to be about.  I’m not putting anybody down here, these are my personal thoughts and nobody is being singled out.  I will move along through the World of new beers on my own, with fond memories of the great times here at Ratebeer.  Joe & Admins, keep up the great work and I’ll continue to point people to this site, like I have for over 4 years now.  I’ll buy you all pints when I run into you!

7013,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"on tap at DLD ’06, pour was amazing looking.  oily black color and consistency, tight layer of chocolate brown head that faded but left a ring around the inside of the glass ( i transferred mine from the plastic cup they gave it to us in to my glass snifter) bourbon and burnt malts dominate the front end of the flavor, and a very sweet milk chocolate taste comes in late to balance things out.  i thought the chocolate was more pronouced than the regular DL, and enjoyed that fact considerable.  The bourbon was there, no doubting it, but it didnt overwhelm every other flavor like some of the other BB aged beers i had that weekend.  the body was beyond thick, it was so viscous and chewy that i think a stirring straw could have stood up straight in the middle.  i managed to drink 2 cups of this, and dont think i could have handled any more, its one of those beers that is very very good, but there is too much of a good thing if this were bottled.",4.3
7044,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Draught, 2005 version – sampled after a year in the barrel: darkly opaque black garnet with a strong and full, chocolate head.  Fairly complex aroma: burnt coffee bitterness, dark chocolate, vanilla and molasses soaked in alcohol and exuding bourbon sweetness.  A year in the wood has created an incredibly soft, smooth and velvety textured liquid.  On the tongue, a significant amount of the high-alcohol harshness has been retained, along with underlying charred malts and some residual hop bitterness.  Light sour cherries mix with vanilla and bourbon sweetness.  Pretty impressive that a beer can actually hold up this well for a whole year in a whisky barrel, but if anything could….very enjoyable, but I do like the regular Dark Lord a bit better…",4.0

A: Thick and black. You could use it to lube up an old engine. Slowly dissipating, tan head. Legs like a supermodel.

S: Nice balance of bourbon, malt sweetness and a little coffee hiding in the background.

T: Wonderful balance of all things awesome. Bourbon most certainly played a supporting role in this one. Far less angular that non-BBA 2010, it doesn’t have the eccentric bitter bite that it’s little brother has. Nice boozy warmth and plenty of fig, coffee and toffee. Delicious.

M: Thick enough to brush your teeth with. Very low carbonation. The time in the barrel and this being a year old now make it nice and smooth.

O: I’m very impressed with this one. I was lucky enough to be at the brew pub right when they opened the day after DLD. It allowed me to really dissect this one without the craziness of the previous day’s festivities surrounding me.

Taste is thick sticky molasses, pure chocolate brownies, rum cake, huge bourbon, incredible amounts of wood vanilla which is basically the great thing about bourbon, I am still astonish as to just how much wood vanilla fine bourbon can have on its own, it is a flavour I never fully picked up or got the description until I tried decent bourbon, thick syrup, even more huge bourbon, very thick syrupy dark fruits, creamy milk chocolate, very creamy, dark fruit syrup, toffee, plums, sweet, sweetness covers the huge alcohol, towards the end I did feel the alcohol burn my throat, I still didn’t taste it, if you really warm up the beer, you can smell some alcohol. If you take a Big sip, you get some light bitter roasted malts in the back, otherwise just this uniform brilliant sweetness. Very silky, smooth, creamy syrupy mouthfeel with pretty much no carbonation. People can say what the like about these huge boozy sweet RIS being rated so highly & I do really, really understand them most of the time but this is simply divine. The taste is very uniform, sweet combo of the previously mentioned flavors. Now this is a rare beer I really wish I could easily get hold of, unavailability is the only downside.

Podsumowanie:

Długo poszukiwałem Bourbon Dark Lord’a w USA. Przemierzałem bezkresne tereny amerykańskich prerii, pustyń, lasów, jezior i oceanów, aby nareszcie odnaleźć swój mały „piwny gral”.

Cieszę się, że to akurat wersje z 2017 udało mi się zdobyć.
Podstawka z tego właśnie roku zrobiła na mnie kolosalne wrażenie. 
Beczka po bourbonie, a raczej blend różnych beczek po bourbonie (m.in. Woodford Reserve i Heaven Hill) wyniosła ten trunek na niesamowicie wysoki poziom. Intensywność beczkowej wanilii oraz kokosu jest niebywała.
Różnorodność składowych to kolejny pierwszorzędny atut tego trunku.
„Cukry Florydy” mogą się mierzyć ze słodyczą tego trunku.

Appearance:  Like the names says...DARK, with a wonderful brown foam head.
Taste: Sweet and surprisingly well balanced for its aggressive ingredients. The cocoa/caramel top notes from the aroma give way to vanilla and licorice and dark fruit before an aged, oak-y bourbon finish
Palate: Full and smooth. Wonderfully dense and complete.  The alcohol doesn’t overpower.  
Overall: Find it and drink it at every possible opportunity. Savor it.",4.7
6876,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Hand bottle provided by gunhaver.

A: Pours as dark as night, flat pitch black with only a bubble or two for a head. The beer is thick, dense, it literally coats the glass.

S: Huge vanilla aromas, from the wood I guess. Nothing artifical about the vanilla though, it is like creamy buttery vanilla. The wood component is huge as well. Like fresh cut oak. Strong roasty notes are there along with hints of molasses and chocolate.

T: Holy Hell! There is nothing like this beer. It is the king of barrel aged beers in my mind without a doubt. Fudge like chocolate up front along with a big blast of roast. The oak component is huge and so enjoyable. Vanilla manages to push through with hints of bourbon. A slight milky coco puffs flavor can be picked up as well. Simple flavors that seem to just meld together perfectly. Really is a perfect beer.

M: Full bodied, lacks carbonation from the hand bottling, but it really don’t suffer. I like lower levels of carbonation on RIS’ anyway.

D: Wonderful, would love to drink all night until I pass out. Reason enough to make a trip to Dark Lord Day.",5.0

2007 vintage. ’07 was an extremely sweet vintage of DL so the oak aged version turned out too sweet as well. lots of honey and molasses and bourbon. flavor is huge and over the top sweet honey, molasses, and chocolate. extremely full mouth feel especially for a barrel aged beer and no alcohol was hidden. it’s just too sweet to drink a lot of. a few ounces is perfect but its one intense, sticky sweet BA imperial stout. delicious and I wish I could have some of this more than a few times a year..4.2.",4.2

splited it at home ( as part of my 2 day - during doomsday-drink ( some pretty insane stuff, just becouse why not ! ) with 77 ships ( and another guy, dont know if he’s on rb) 
it pours black , no visual foam
the smell is bourbon, sweetness ( damn even sweeter than the basebeer) 
taste is ... sweetness ( sugary from the dark lord) bourbon ( damn much of it ! ) vanilla, caramel, syrupy comes to mind, even though i dont think this is very thick in substance, its just very heavy in the stomach ( to me that it, maybe i shouldnt have drank this after so many other goodies) 
the alcohol is definetly there, but not TOO much. carbo is very low ( gotta love that) overall a very sweet, maximized bourbon taste kind of beer. not realy my thing ( as expected ) yet i stil REALY wanted to try this ( the fuzz thats going on, and lets face it, i can no longer denie i like to hunt a whale now and than :p ) it kinda lives up to my expectations, but its also nothing more than that.

i would like to thank bobochamp very very much for this beer , i otherwise would have been searching for god knows how long. and now i dont have to give up 3 testikles for it !

Mouthfeel was full, a tad biting and oily. Taste was the highlight, as it took all the scents of the nose and blended them into a very complex taste where every sip seemed to accentuate a different aspect.

6981,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"After a day of drinking so many mind numbingly incredible barrel-aged beers this was the only one to rise above them all and stand victorious in my opinion.  Take a base of one of the most brilliant imperial stouts and do a masterful job of bourbon-barrel aging.  The bourbon doesn’t overpower, but rather compliments.  Layer upon layer of complexities slowly reveal themselves from the first sip to minutes after the final drops have left your palate.  The brilliance lies in the fact that each flavour component does not outshine the other.  Hops stand up to balance out the malt backbone.  The bourbon makes an appearance to lend a hand complimenting the oily viscosity on the palate.  The finish is left with vanilla, oak and a residual stickiness that allows one to enjoy the experience well after the fact.",4.7

6889,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"On tap at DLD ’09. Pours a black body with virtually no head. Just a slight brown lacing on the edge with some nice, soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma is quite similar to the regular DL, but with much more of a bourbon woodiness than vanilla. The vanilla is still clearly evident, but its much more subdued. Some silky chocolate and woody hops with a mild citrus bite. The flavor is very mellow from the barrel aging. Nice, smooth wood-bourbon, rich chocolate (although not nearly as rich as the regular DL), some mild background roastiness, and a light to moderate amount of bittering hops balance this out nicely. Never gets extremely bitter. Good amount of molasses, but not nearly as big of a flavor compared to the regular DL. I also found the fig stood out a little more in this one. The flavors stay bold and balanced without approaching an over-the-top status. Full bodied with a slow, drying finish. Much softer than the other two DL’s. Lingering aftertaste of very rich wood, bourbon, and vanilla-cocoa. Overall, a very solid beer.

The aroma is slightly hot, oaky, with a lot of roast and a nice smoothness to it. Very liquor. Hints of vanilla, very subtle.

Beer is full bodied and completely coats the mouth. Surprisingly smooth for such a high alcohol beer with such a strong aroma. The woodsiness of the beer mellows out the heat a lot. Lots of roast in the back palate. Drinkability good.

How: 2 x 6oz sample at Dark-Lord-Day 2008

In long: Bourbon is overwhelming and kills all the complexity that the regular Dark Lord has.  Gone are the rich fruity flavours, chocolate and all.  All I was left with was some kind of lifeless port wine with a shot of expresso.  Very flat carbonation.  Alcohol more apparent than in the regular Dark Lord.  One hour later I even got myself a second 6oz sample thinking there was something wrong with my first sample.  Nope, same simple brutal “beer” (and I use the term “beer” very loosely).  This is yet another case of rarity creates make-believe quality.  So let me be the first to say “The Oak Aged Dark Lord is all hype”.

Maybe I was a little drunk when I had this (ok, let’s change that ""maybe"" to a ""definitely""), but this one really stopped me in my tracks and made me appreciate just what the hell I was drinking: one of the greatest beers of all time!

Pours as black as the BeerAdvocate website background, and as thick as Aunt Jemima syrup. A well-formed brown head sits on top and leaves some lacing on the glass...er...plastic cup.

The nose on this one is out of this world. So much going on. It smells like a rich chocolate cake, along with coffee, roastiness, candied fruits, oak, and bourbon. Even puts regular Dark Lord to shame here.

Flavor is similarly amazing. The sweetness of Dark Lord really mellows out with the oak aging. Lots of milk and dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, brown sugar, and candied plums and raisins. Oak and bourbon blend seamlessly and do not overwhelm in the least bit.

Incredibly full-bodied and rich on the palate. Carbonation level is medium-low, exactly as appropriate for a beer like this.

Overall, wow, this is unbelievably good. I’ll knock it down a half-point on the drinkability just because it’s so overwhelming, but as drunk and full as I was, I had no problem taking down the 6oz pour. (Wish it hadn’t been so easy!)

Initial is smooth, emphasizing sweetness and coffee much like regular Dark Lord, but pushing some nice vanilla, oak, and whiskey.

6973,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"So... my wife was doing a bit of fall cleaning and came upon my GTMW tasting booklet.  Upon perusing, I discovered that this is the only rating that I hadn’t entered from the festival. So, here we  go... tasting note verbatim: Lots of the same characteristics of the original. Rich, thick, chewy, sweet and dry malt. I think the barrel aging adds a bit of alcoholic hotness/sour/tart imbalance. Still phenomenal though. Definite whiskey presence.  Rich, viscous  and perfect on the palate. Would love to try more. 



Re-rate. GTMW 2008. Too much tannic, wet wood and an off-putting metallic taste that really takes away from the original beer.",3.9

6985,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Rating #666...


Date: 4/28/2007

Event: DarkLord Day 2007

Location: Three Floyds Brewing Co. Brewpub

Serving: 6 oz (?) draught sample in a plastic cup.


Tasting Notes

Aroma: BOURBON, sweet anise, chicory, slight oakiness, alcohol...  I can’t wait to try this stuff!

Appearance: BLACK, no head at all.  Thick and syrupy.  It looks like it would stick to anything and is doing a pretty good job coating the entire inside of the cup!

Flavor: WOW!  Instense and complex all the way...  Roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, chicory/coffee, anise, vanilla, wood, a hint of smoke.  Mild bitterness level.  The finish has a very dark chocolate flavor and is a bit more dry than expected, but still wonderful and it helps to balance out the initial sweetness.

Palate: FULL bodied.  It is as thick as it looks with an oily texture that really does cling to everything.  Needless to say, it coats the mouth nicely for a lingering flavor and long-lasting enjoyment.

Overall: AMAZING!  Truly phenomenal and well worth the drive, standing in line, and the cost!  This is a MUST try for all beer aficionados!",4.9
6895,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"On tap at DLD. Here we go again. I first had this hand-bottled (or Facto’d, you might say) two years ago, and though I enjoyed it, it was clearly unrateable. I’ve finally had a chance to try it for real and was actually less impressed than from the hand-bottle.



Let’s get something straight here. I really, really want to like this beer. I want to love this beer. I’d be happy with it in my top 10, because Dark Lord remains one of my favorites to this day, and this has every opportunity to make it better.



But it doesn’t, of course. In fact, it makes it much, much worse. It nearly ruins it. Complexity is not normally a word you throw around with 14% imperial stouts, but after tasting this you will recognize that the unaged version is indeed complex, if only because this is so utterly dominant in boozy and bourbon characteristics in both flavor and aroma that almost nothing else can be sensed. A bit of sweetness, perhaps. A touch of roast. But that’s about it. This is as strong, harsh, and brutal as they come, unforgiving and ruined by the barrel. 



I guess it is to be expected that an unrestrained beer would have a barrel treatment as unrestrained as the initial brew, but it doesn’t change my opinion that no matter how big the beer, going light on the bourbon barrel does far more good than using a heavy hand.",3.3
7027,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Sampled a few times on DL day and even a few drops found their way onto my notepad for historical keeping: Maybe since I missed the chance to taste BA Speedway I was too hyped for the release of this beer and got grumpy waiting in line for my bottles of the ""regular"" DL 2006 release, but no matter I did not seem to enjoy this as much as I hoped.  That said, this beer is far from bad with it’s black hole opaque vision and beautiful oily cling to my snifter. The nose detected black strap molasses, vanilla and almond extract, french oak, raspberry, salty and mineral vapors with of the Dark Lord character of bakers chocolate and espresso.  The flavor is rich on mocha components blended with the high octane bourbon overtones. Just some of the flavors found were vanilla, walnut, snappy hops and charred espresso beans. Lots of alcohol too, perhaps too much which seemed to take away from the wonderful lingering aftertaste I have associated with DL. It seems to have thinned out the palate as well. That was Dark Lord domain, over-the-top lushness and oily sticky coating. Now it just seems like a good imperial, not all that.  Yes, a disappointment, if only all of life’s disappointments were so good.",4.1

This may be the best Dark Lord I've had considering the circumstances as well as how it wasn't as thick as the Malort aged but was way more potent and burning, and more flavorful to boot. Really, this one was a treat and I'm lucky to have stuck around to try this rare brew. Would have again but probably won't have again.",4.9

The mouthfeel is as thick as a solution can be.  The flavors are as to be expected, insane.  Basically just like I imagined, only with more oak, and not as  screwed up as I thought it would be.  This is an actual improvement to Dark Lord!  Splendid.",4.4
8220,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Bomber (many thanks, dustbunny, for opening this gem). A super-heavy dark chocolate tone dominates the aroma and is joined by sweet vanilla, boozy bourbon, cocoa buttercream frosting, a slight touch of phenols (wet campfire), and a balsamic whisper. Pours very dark brown with nearly no head. The taste is wonderfully smooth and layered, with rich vanilla, decedent chocolate, toffee, hot booze, caramel, and a slightly earthy bitterness. The flavors complement each other perfectly. Beyond smooth texture (almost slick); very hot and dry finish. A whale that exceeds the hype; I like it even better than the port barrel version, which recently wowed me.",4.4
8435,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"I got to taste a couple of sample pours while standing in line at DLD thanks to the friendly folks in Columbus who were able to get a couple of full cups out of the brewpub. Re-poured into a 4 ounce tasting glass.
Milky off black color. Beer still had a thin brown collar around the rim.
Tons of Vanilla, boozy alcohol and very sweet syrupy aromas. I took a couple of whiffs of this -- very pleasant on the nose. This tasted like a frozen ice cream drink with creme de cacao (such as a Brandy Alexander) that had melted. 
Very thick and rich, low carbonation. Mouthfeel was very much like melted milkshake -- certainly interesting but not what I want in a beer. Very chalky, chocolate finish. I realize drinkability is not the same as availability, but how drinkable can a beer be that’s only available at one place for about 45 minutes a year, and then only in 3 ounce pours? I consider this a gimmicky beer -- if it were more readily available it would be something you would want to try once, but then move on to something that taste more like beer than a vanilla milkshake.",2.6

8414,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Every once in a while I look around and think, ""I am seriously drinking this?"" Last night was like that for about 6 hours. Thanks ___, for this, you know who you are.

Served side by side with DL 2009 and Oak aged DL 2010. Served in a tulip. Beer is about as you’d expect a DL to look but this version had no head or lacing. The beer left some legs on the glass, pitch black, even at the corners. Beer coats the glass as I swirl. Super thick and pitch black. Amazing.

This beer has the most obvious aroma of any beer I’ve had in a long long time. STRONG vanilla, like baking vanilla. Some chocolate, strong, complex aroma.

Mouthfeel on this beer is huge and thick but the sweetness of the vanilla (super sweet) makes it seem lighter some how. This is an aggressively awesome beer -- my favorite out of the three by a lot. It tastes like a vanilla cake...or flan...or some kind of dessert with fudge and vanilla. I couldn’t drink much of it without my insulin spiking but I can’t wait for DL day 2011.

Serving type: growler",4.4
8563,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap at DLD 08. Pours black with little to no head. Aroma is vanilla, coffee, oak and molasses. Flavor is very sweet from vanilla buth vinishes smooth. Not as good as the regular BA Darkloard but still good stuff.",4.3
8346,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"09 vanilla darklord.  On tap at darklord day 2013.  Black as night no head thick as used motor oil.  The vanilla and barrel were extremely subtile. Perfect amount of sweetness. But there was something else about this, so much fuller and more amazing than the regular, could just be the age.





14 on draft at DLD 14.  I was in the right place at the right time. Got my 2 rather small pours, tastiest $10 you can spend on beer.  The vanilla doesn’t stand out in this amazing mix of sweet syrupy smooth bourbon amazement. 





5.1.15 12-14 at my dick lord tasting. 12 - liquid marshmellow. Everything else is completely blended perfectly. This was amazing.  My favorite of the bunch. And possibly my top beer ever. 13 and 14 were very similar lots of vanilla.  I’m talking BCS vanilla amounts of vanilla. 13 was sweeter, probably because of the sweeter base beer.  Overall, all 3 amazing. But the 12 really shined. 



5.19.15 2015 bottle fresh. Crazy vanilla heavy. Sweet syrupy. Very good. But needs to sit for about 2 years.





12.31.16. Happy new year to me. 2015 bottle. Very sweet, cane sugar, molasses, Unami sweetness. Barrel and vanilla are there bit light.  This bottle is has the most dark lord come through of all that I’ve had.",4.8
8433,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Draft sample at Dark Lord Day 2010.  I was crestfallen a little earlier when I had heard that the Vanilla Dark Lord was gone; my only goal of the day besides getting my bottles and having fun with my pals was to try this.  Then someone nearby pointed out a guy who had a little bit left.  It was good timing because I had my Kate the Great bottle cracked open to share, so I ran over and bullied the guy into trading a pour for a pour.  He instead gave me what was left in the glass (maybe 2-3 ounces) and said he couldn’t finish it and didn’t care for any KTG.  Fine by me!  Granted, the bottom of his plastic cup sample wasn’t ideal, but still a fantastic beer emerged.  Dark, opaque brown, with remnants of a brown head.  Big vanilla notes on top of the Dark Lord’s coffee, milk and dark chocolate, dark fruits, earthy notes, and molasses.  I’m an absolute sucker for vanilla aromas but the flavor doesn’t always match the sweet goodness; this was the case here, though not by a ton.  Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a smooth, rich, sticky mouthfeel.  I thought the sweet vanilla detracted a little bit from the normal (and very sweet) Dark Lord, whereas the oak version adds a special element to it.  Don’t get me wrong, this is amazing and needs to be tried; it just doesn’t match the others. Re-Rate: Downgrading this a little bit after trying 347/934 of the 2012 series, the most sober I’ve been when I tried it. It had a very sweet candy note on the nose above vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Flavor of chocolate-covered cherries, vanilla, oak, caramel, and molasses. Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, smooth mouthfeel. Great, but not as good as I remembered.",4.4

The Vanilla was very present up front and was noticeable immediately from the first sip. There was a thick mouth feel,very thick almost the consistency of drinking thick pear juice..Pitch black ,over due motor oil change black with a small dark tan quickly dissipated almost non existent head..The taste was awesome to say the least..I have never had anything like it and probably never will again. Surprisingly easy to drink ,but this one is a sipper for sure, just goes down leaving you wanting another. I did notice the pours coming from the bar were getting a little bigger as other cups and glassware came out..They started with 4-5oz pours and quickly started going to 6-8oz pours so I grabbed 2 to go for my buddies in line outside and shared with them

Zero head from the pour.  Black.  A dark wood colored outer ring with some small stagnant carbonation bubbles.  As thick as it gets, and rather mysterious looking.  But really, upon sipping, how can a beer this big, be so smooth? A really unbelievable feel, super thick, leaving flavor everywhere.  Just great for sipping.  Aroma really did not lie about how this one would taste.  Quite similar actually, as the flavors feed off the aroma very well.  Vanilla syrup, roasted bourbon cream, the best black malts I’ve ever had, a thick woody bitter to back up the sweetness of minor 3fs herbal and citrus.  The hop backing fits in with everything so well, making this a very well balanced beer.  Other notes of warm cocoa and roasted black coffee.

The smell is the best of both an imperial stout and a barley wine. Pours dark brown with sable head. Looks like melted chocolate. Delicious taste features vanilla and a lot of oak in addition to the world-class imperial stout taste of standard Dark Lord. Full body; thick. Soft and silky in the palate. I love this beer! It was the best of the fest and, yes, better (slightly) than regular Dark Lord. I just wish I had better notes on it, but it was late in the day after a lot of big beers.

8465,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Hand bottle provided by Gunhaver

A: Pours as dark as they come, a very evil flat black. No real head to speak of loss of carbonation due to the hand bottling. It is a very thick beer that literally stains the glass.

S: Nice real vanilla notes. Roasted malt, coco puffs, and subtle wood from the barrel.

T: Loads of real vanilla bean right from the start. Rich dark chocolate and roasted chocolate malt. Darkened brown sugar, and hints of oak.

M: Very full in body, lacks carbonation which you don’t even seem to miss with this beer.

D: Insane. It was a nip bottle shared between a few. Really wish I had more. It is reason enough to go to Dark Lord day!

Pint in a plastic glass at darklord day. Dark thick black pour with a ruby tinge and a brown head. I had this one after the oak aged and it was much better - the vanilla cut the booze and oak so that at least initially the beer had a great aroma. Upon first taste you still got the typical huge mouthfeel but even sweeter then normal and the booze was somewhat hidden. Things just seemed more smooth and more balanced with this one, almost like the vanilla cut through the oak and almost brought out coffee and some chocolate. Long lasting finish that didn’t kill the palate. Very good.",4.0

8432,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Another big thank you to Adrian, for all the effort he put in to obtain a small sample of this Dark Lord Day-only gem.  Aroma of vanilla cake and toffee.  Tastes a bit too much like vanilla extract, but it was still superb.  I could taste whiskey cake, grains, sharp hops, rye.  It coats the mouth like velour - there is no other beer that has the thickness and texture of Dark Lord!  Very powerful, sharp, and potent stuff - it is hard to think of something that compares with it.

The flavor is very much like the aroma.  It is very sweet with caramel, vanilla, and a pretty high level of alcohol and just a hint of bourbon.  It has a mellow and milky texture and goes down smooth, but sticks to everything else.  Overall, this beer is really, really good, but almost too sweet.

Okay, so my tasting conditions were not ideal. I had very little to drink during the day, but I had a raging sinus infection so I kept having to clear out my nose before each quick sniff and taste.  
Here is what I got most out of the beer:
Under-attenuation.  Wow, this is so milky and thick.  I am pretty unimpressed with the body.  Anyone can under-attenuate a beer, and this seems almost sickly.  
Taste:
Okay, so the taste is amazing.  Thick chocolate milk, loads of creamy vanilla, dark chocolate.  This is overwhelmingly flavorful.  It works, but only so much.
Appearance is still and murky brown-deep black.
Aroma, sweet vanilla, alcohol.  Rich and decadent.  I love the aroma on this.

This beer was black as night with no head at all. A very small, dark brown ring of foam lined the glass. This smells incredible, coffee and chocolate with a great vanilla smell taking over everything.

8542,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On draft at the brewpub, on DLD ’08; courtesy of csbosox. Pours jet black with virtually no head and an oily surface. The aroma is of big vanilla bean and moderate bourbon up front with chocolate, roast and alcohol behind. Full-bodied and chewy with a syrupy sweet finish and some alcohol warming in your chest. Sweet, roasted, chocolaty malt dances with a nice mellowing vanilla note that ties everything together. Again, it’s quite ""warming"" but in a great way.

8422,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Handbottle, courtesy juiceisloose.  2009 brew released in 2010.  As expected, the pour yields an abyss-like black body with glints of mahogany at the outer edges.  Though there’s very little head, the dense, oily liquid leaves a thick, lingering staining effect on the glass.  It looks simply menacing.  The nose is as rich and decadent as anything I’ve ever encountered in my culinary experience.  Lush notes of chocolate syrup, vanilla sponge cake, toasted marshmallows, and crème brûlée are sweet, smooth, and very dessert-like.  The bourbon is hardly detectable, having seemingly been drowned out by the intense vanilla.  Flavors are just as over-the-top.  Insanely sweet chocolate and vanilla-marshmallow dominate, with virtually none of the Dark Lord roast showing.  The barrel comes through a little more than it does on the nose, but remains tertiary to the chocolate and sweet, scorched sugars.  In typical fashion, the mouthfeel is round, oily, and viscous, coating the mouth fully and leaving behind a lip smacking film.  Overall, this beer is tasty as hell.....in small doses.....when you’re in the mood for dessert.  Hedonistically, it ranks way up there.  However, it’s not something I’d ever contemplate drinking more than a few ounces of.  Ahhhh....the great conundrum of rating beer.",4.0

This black, molassesy, still stout sports zero head. Beautifully full bouquet of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, black biscuits, and roasty malts. It’s one of those beers where one sip crushes everything else you once thought considered elite. Everything from the nose is here in force, with vanilla and chocolate shining the brightest. Bourbon up front, followed quickly by chocolate-covered marshmallows. Massively viscous body delivers all of these flavors to my palate with its sticky, stubborn body.

That out of the way, I’d like to say that I think this beer symbolizes a lot of what is wrong with certain elements of craft beer today.  It smells fucking divine, vanilla beans for miles and miles and some hot cocoa swirled in and a touch of bourbon.  But the taste is pure sugar, under-attenuated as all hell and almost impossible to keep down in more than the tiniest sips.  There’s extreme, and then there’s over-the-top, and VB DL strikes me as more of the latter.  I’m giving it a 3.0 because it would make a great candle wax or Febreeze.

Du sirop d’érable, de la tire d’érable sur la neige, de la pâte à biscuits aux pépites de chocolat non cuite... De la véritable folie! Une fois dans mon verre cependant, les arômes s’estompent curieusement rapidement. De mon verre s’échappent beaucoup plus de vapeurs d’érable que du verre de Marc-André. Je ressens encore beaucoup de chocolat mais surtout du café. Une base cependant verte me fait sourciller car cette dernière était la dernière chose à laquelle je m’attendais. Le café demeure tout de même au centre de toute l’action - au nez comme ne bouche. Des arômes de grains de café éthiopiens chauffés accentués par des brisures de chocolat au lait de qualité exceptionnelle. Et cette texture!!! Le liquide est léger comme une plume, voire aérien. Une légèreté satinée, moelleuse comme je n’en ai jamais ressentie de semblable. L’érable me salue en passant en guise de rappel en laissant le chocolat et le café se disputer le premier rôle.

Moderate bitter taste, moderate sweet, good mild warmth, nothing bothersome at all. Wow, love that maple, and dark chocolate, and coffee roast. Hint of smoke. Oh my goodness, I love this aroma. Wow wow wow wow. Totally my style. Best stout I’ve had since the 1st stout that blew my mind, FBS. Such good shit here. Hint of savory smoke even. a little bit of a maple syrup covered sausage patty factor here. holy shit, so good.",4.5
6304,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"From memory from The Great Taste Of The Midwest in Madison. On tap poured a dark brown with a strong maple syrup aroma and brown head. Taste is strong maple syrup and coffee. I don’t like coffee and the maple flavor tames the coffee flavor, and the coffee tames the maple flavor, than throw in some stout and there you go. I remember thinking where are the pancakes, but it isn’t really thick enough for that. That was the best beer I have ever had, period.",4.8

6222,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,650ml bottle. Black with short head. Incredible maple and coffee aroma. The tastes moves through sweeter chocolate and maple flavours before a bitter coffee onslaught. Very good but a bit below what I’d hoped for.,4.1

6375,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Sample at STL craft beer week event at Perennial. Pour is black with almost no had. Aroma is like an espresso bean covered in English toffee: huge espresso, buttery brown sugar, maple syrup, and lightly roasty. One of the best aromas I have encountered. Flavor is also really solid but not as impressive as the aroma. More coffee in the flavor with roasted malt, light maple, and light vanilla.  Update 4/20/14 - Larger sample this time - just amazing.  Much better than I remember. So rich and velvety.  Just amazing.",4.7

6267,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Sampled from bottle (shared with Joes, Dutchdrebus and Koen) @ ""Het is allemaal de schuld van Koen"" tasting. Opaque pitch black color, medium to full sized dark brown head that diminishes fairly quickly. Aroma is malts, dark chocolate, creme brulee, some (Dutch) ""hopjesvla"" which -unfortunately- I really dislike. Taste malts, dark chocolate, liquorice bitterness, coffee roast, again (Dutch) ""hopjesvla"", sweet maple syrup, bitter finish. Medium body and carbonation. Unfortunately not my kind of beer as I don’t like the sweet maple syrup and hopjesvla flavor.",3.4
6161,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Pours like motor oil. Very viscous, with dark brown head. Once the bottle opens, Maple fills up the room. Massive cold coffee, vanilla, maple, dark chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt in the nose that is bloody amazing. Low carbonation, thick syrupy mouth, tons of coffee, maple syrup, roasted malt and dark chocolate. Very full bodied. Very rich. A sample is enough. It’s a great beer and alcohol well hidden. It’s fantastic. Worth the price or the high rating, I don’t think so.",4.2
6132,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Bottle (thanks martjoobolut). Pitch black color. Small size, brown head, stays. Maple syrup, sweet, woody, oily, cold pressed coffee in aroma and in taste. Solid brew.",3.4
6174,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"12 oz batch 4 bottle opened during Wakefest weekend. Pours nearly pitch black in color and topped by a thin, tan layer of foam that settles in quickly and rejoins the body below and leaves some sudsy lace behind. The aroma shows notes of dark chocolate, huge maple syrup, dark, over roasted coffee, espresso, toasted caramel, and hints of vanilla. The flavor follows suit the dark chocolate and over roasted coffee right up front which turns into a green pepper flavor from over roasting the coffee beans, and then followed by notes of sweet maple, toasted vanilla, and caramel. The maple component isn't as prevalent in the flavor and its hard to get the green pepper flavors from the coffee. Medium bodied and smooth with soft carbonation that leads to a dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and sweet maple finish that lingers on for a bit. I was really excited to try this, but this unfortunately fell way short of the hype and my expectations. Maybe one day I'll get to try an earlier batch that everyone raves about.",3.7

Thick and dark body. Nose is distinctly maple, with some tomato sweetness, and chewy and bitter coffee and cocoa. Moderately thick sip, doesn’t feel too hot, with a nice chewy bitterness at the end to cut up he sweetness. Coffee, cocoa, maple. Lots of dark caramel and Hersey’s syrup. Sticky edges. Tastes well aged. Tomato like notes are the only spoiler, but this is rather tasty overall. Lingering bitter finish is fantastic.

Aroma knocks your socks off - coffee, roasted malts, maple all intermingle into a wonderful bocquet. Taste is the same, medium sweet but far from cloying, chocolate notes, well cut with a nice coffee bitterness that lingers through the finish. What an amazing fusion - the maple sweetness is perfectly balanced by the bitterness of the roast. Full bodied, syrupy creamy mouth coating palate. I wish I had a case of this at home! Yay to Toppling Goliath, my new favorite brewery!",5.0

6204,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"So here we are then: one of these hugely hyped Toppling Goliath stouts and the third highest ranking beer on this website at the time of writing this review, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. American-style imperial stout with coffee and maple syrup, 2016 vintage. Yellowish beige, creamy head, thin and open in the middle but retaining around the edge, on a black beer with warm mahogany edges. Very intense, concentrated, beguiling bouquet of chocolate fondant, chocolate liqueur, strong maple syrup, dried figs drenched in whisky, cappuccino and coffee liqueur, fudge, toasted chestnuts, dry leather, toffee, cognac, hazelnut oil, madera, subtle but clear glue-ish and solvent-like effects. The mouthwatering promises made by the aroma are perfectly met by the flavour, kicking off with thick sweet maple syrup embellished with dried fruit notes and a thin sourish accent, blending in well with the caramelly, toffeeish and profoundly nutty, big, oily malt body, perfectly (i.e. softly) carbonated fit for this style. The nuttiness shifts colours to a darker, bitter black 'chocolateness', bitterly toasty yet not overly roasted: the creaminess of the maple syrup lies a perfectly measured layer of soothing sweetness on top of it, and the no doubt copious amounts of coffee that went in here, provide delightful retronasal aromas and a refined, spicy, delicate and warm roastedness that is more expressive and vivid than the actual roasted barley. Ends with vanilla- and cinnamon-like accents, very rich, a coffee dessert with alcohol - which takes on a long, heating, brandy-like quality, yet at the same time completely avoids obnoxious wryness. Tasted this next to a 2015 vintage as well, which was just as rich and ravishingly beautiful, yet a tad softer and more rounded, a bit less sharp in terms of solvents and a little bit less aromatically coffee-ish - but these were 'microscopic' differences due to age alone, presumably. Well, now that I finally had a taste of this nectar of the gods: not sure if this is the single best stout I ever had - but it comes very, very close. Then again, the whole hype surrounding this beer, one of these artificially mystified beers (admittedly largely due to geeks like ourselves here, ironically perhaps), should not matter in judging this: any experienced taster with a basic technical knowledge will be able to assess that this is a work of great beauty, class and craftmanship. A huge, detailed and completely flawless construction of flavours, the essence of American-style RIS with maple syrup and coffee dosed in such a way that they actually accentuate the features of this beer in a tastefully balanced way rather than overpowering them.  Unforgettable, and I was over the moon when given the chance to sample it again - from tap - at Billie's Craft Beer Fest 2023, when it was oddly much smoother, more caramelly and more milk-chocolatey - yet still utterly delicious.  My rating here is an average of both encounters with this highly coveted stout.",4.7
6150,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,Bardzo  przyjemny aromat kawy i syropu klonowego który od razu działa na zmysły. nutki orzechów goryczy dodaje całości aromatu i unikalnego smaku. Zdecydowanie polecam bo smakuje wręcz wybornie,4.6

Very dark brown pour with a brown head. Aroma has maple, chocolate, and roast. Strong, super smoothly blended, with very solid identifiable contributors. Taste is of sweet maple, dark chocolate, sweet malts, a barrel component, and roast. This leans sweet, with the roast just not being enough to battle all that sweet. Smooth. Very tasty. Just sweet. About full bodied, with a subtle alcohol presence, the blend is very, very good. Finishes to the sweet side, with the bitter parts losing the balance battle.

6187,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Toppling Goliath Brewing Co. - Mornin' Delight b4 (2017) 
Imperial Stout Brewed With Maple Syrup & Coffee.  


 Alkohol:  12% obj. 


 IBU:  50 


 Kolor:  Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. 


 Piana:  Nie można się do niczego tutaj przyczepić. Beżowa, wysoka, bujna, zwarta piana.
Długi czas stoi jak zaczarowna w miejscu. 
Po opróżnieniu szkła wciąż pozostaje na jego ściankach. 


 Zapach:  Aromat jest masywny! Roztacza się szerokim łukiem nad całym pomieszczeniem i wypełnia je swoją intensywnością.
Nie musisz wcale przykładać nosa do butelki, aby poczuć gigantyczną woń syropu klonowego wspieranego przez najlepszej jakości kawę.
Tylko minimalna paloność połączona z nutami pralinek belgijskich, karmelu i wiodącej wanilii.
Pomimo, że piwo jest klasycznym Imperialem aromat miażdży większość najlepszych beczkowych RIS-ów jakie piłem.
Myślę, że właśnie dla takich piw jak to powinni wymyślać dodatkową skalę zapachową.
Poezja! 


 Smak:  Na języku dominuje przyjemny syrop klonowy.
Gęsty, pachnący, świeży.
Przywołuje skojarzenia z najlepszymi naleśnikami oblanymi syropem klonowym jakie jadłem kiedyś w Las Vegas w 
jednym z amerykańskich barów śniadaniowych. 
Po chwili dochodzi do tego kawa, która już po drugim łyku zaczyna dominować.
Lekka paloność i niski stopień kwaskowatości z miejsca ustawia to piwo w gronie najlepszych kawowych RIS-ów w moim portfolio. 
Smak uzupełniają akcenty gorzkiej i mlecznej czekolady, melasy, wanilii, pralinek belgijskich, karmelu, cynamonu i marcepanu.
Gęsta, oleista i ubita jak budyń tekstura.
Procenty po mistrzowsku zamiecione pod dywan.
Na języku pełne, słodkie, jedwabiste i kremowe. Pod koniec degustacji, po solidnym ogrzaniu w dłoniach, na końcu języka pojawia się minimalna kawowa kwaskowatość. W żadnym stopniu nie wpływa to na finalny odbiór trunku.
Doskonała robota! 
 

 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 

 Podsumowanie:  
 

Mornin' Delight - piwo z którym wkraczam w 2018 rok. 

2-gi najlepszy Imperial Stout na świecie.

Perfekcja, doskonałość i mistrzowskie zrozumienie tematu.
To jest prawdziwie w 100-ach oddający klimat amarykański Imperial Stout.
Dodatki dorzucone do piwa: syrop klonowy i kawa perfekcyjnie podkreślają to co dla Amerykanów jest ważnym elementem ich życia.
Balans poszczególnych składowych jest jest wręcz niebywały.
Dopieszczony do granic możliwości, od opakowania, przez wygląd, a na smaku skończywszy.
Bogaty, wielowarstwowy, na długo pozostanie w mojej pamięci.
Nie jest to co prawda mój No 1, 
ale na bank znajdzie się w Top10 moich Imperiali.

6149,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Wspaniały intensywny aromat. Z butelki dominuje mix syropu klonowego i kawy plus nuty palone, czekolada, karmel, orzechy, suszone owoce. Z snifera najwięcej czuć kawę w tle pozostałe nuty. Po 
nalaniu ciemnobrunatnej, praktycznie czarnej cieczy tworzy się niezbyt wysoka ciemnobeżowa pianą, która powoli opada niezdobiąc szkła. Smak intensywny w którym dominuje esencjonalna kawa, w tle praliny, susz, trochę syropu klonowego, oczywiście czuć palone słody. Finisz wytrawny, kawowy, przyjemny.

Perfectly lets out little pockets of sweet maple syrup.  Flavor is the real deal.  Again, huge, huge fresh coffee flavor.  Very earthy.  Sweet sticky maple syrup, roasted malt, and brown sugar.  Coffee and light maple sweetness lingers and lingers.  No real acidity from the coffee.  Semi-gritty and chewy, but in the best possible way.  Thick on the palate.  Sweet enough to be enticing, but not sweet enough to be detracting.  Unbelievably good.  This is my perfect beer.  Period.",5.0

After settling down it poured nicely with a beautiful head, that disappeared a little too fast for my liking (30 seconds, and no sign of any head left). Very deep, dark colour. The aroma was unbelievable; Very heavy with notes of roasted malt, chocolate, banana, caramel and alcohol. Ditto taste. Texture: Creamy, full bodied. I very much like this one, though I feel it will result in a massive hangover, if not handled with care!
Rerate 2018: Same year (2006). After 12 years this one is definately still drinkable. Carbonation is a little less (but still very much present), and basement flavours have entered. Overall the beer has mellowed, and in some ways, the years have actually improved upon it.",4.4

The smell is spicy yet somewhat has some sweet cherries, a little tartness comes through and some booziness. The taste is mainly spicy sweet booze, cherries become more of an undertone to the flavoring, big boozy aftertaste, and a dry spicy finish. On the palate, its about a medium to heavy, not sessionable - sipper (why am I having this at this time of year... I dunno), carbonation seems to be good for the style and good for me.

Silky mouthfeel as I take my first sip.  Taste is interesting, a lot going on.  The fruits are there, but not as prevelant as I would’ve thought.  Very earthy, some dark chocolate, caramel, spice, bitterness and the plums come back at the end.  A little bit of smoke coming through too.  Bitterness and plums linger for a little while.  Alcohol is well hidden in the aroma and taste.  Full bodied and oily.  I enjoy this more with each sip, too bad the price tag is too high to enjoy this regularly.",4.4

Not my first foray with this fine Trappist ale, however never actually got around to rating it - 1200th rate seems an apt occasion!
It’s a mysterious, somewhat sinister looking brew - deep, murky burgundy holding a small but thickly textured beige head.
The aroma is seductive, alluring, yet somewhat familiar & homely. Rich dark sugars, certainly an earthy candy sugar of sorts in there, which adds its own complexities of roast beetroot & rumminess, but that’s merely the tip of the iceberg - chocolate pudding, black cherry & plum, and maybe even prunes, and why not some raisins! There’s some spice in there too; clove, black pepper, nutmeg - phenolically derived, one would have to assume.
There’s something about the weight of this beer, that just seems right. Yeah, sure, 11 or so percent, more than double strength, up there with wine, rah rah, but it just sits so nicely on the palate - velvety, thick, luscious, welcoming, friendly, warming, tremendously persistent in the best way possible. No other beer seems to be able to emulate the texture of this beer.
HOOK IT TO MY VEINS! Ahhhh... There are very few beverages in the world that compare to the refined complexity of this ale - perhaps the finest old Port or aged Bordeaux - there’s something special going on here; chocolate, treacle, rum, raisin - starting to sound like a dessert! Vinous plums, and cherries, and black raspberries, and some other berry I don’t know the name of, and then there’s dried fruits too, and spices, and some leafy hop character, and some yeasty breadiness. What starts sweet soon dries out, a tickled of bitterness provides balance, and it just lingers with a cheek pinkening warmth, and begs oh so politely for another sip, and before you know it you realise you were foolish for only purchasing JUST ONE BOTTLE!
So in conclusion: what have we learnt? Many choose to make parallels between this and its fabled (and exceedingly rare) Trappist brother, the Westvleteren 12. And this is a fair comparison, and shall probably be hotly debated until the end of time. Would personally love to do a side-by-side tasting; some day. Until then, my favourite will be this beer, based on two points - yes, the Westy is amazing, and has some intrinsic qualities not seen in ANY other beers, but it lacks just a bit of body compared to the Rochefort, and, of course, obviously, there’s the simple fact it is just so hard to come by (without forking out exorbitant quantities of cash). So hail to the king...baby",4.6

Had this multiple times since the first rating, but have never quite managed to reproduce the experience.

This pours very dark brown from its iconic bottle crowned with a dense brownish head. The aroma is boozy and reminiscent of sherry.

3231,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a beautiful dark brown with a white head on it. A little fizzy actually. The nose is gorgeous wheat bread, yeast, malts, and toasted sugars. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but it is a little over-carbonated and has a fizzy feel on your tongue that irritates me when I’m letting it sit to get the flavor. The flavor is very complex, so much going on. You get the initial hit of dark malts, and then flavors of wood, caramel, wheat bread, dried fruits, and then finishes with a nice touch of raw sugar. Brilliant effort. The taste hangs around and it sticks to your mouth for a while. I am tasting this one for days. Holy cow. This one had a lot of hype, and it certainly didn’t disappoint. It was well worth the $40, but I’ll probably end up getting my second highest rated beer for $6 a bottle on a more regular basis! :) Such a pleasure to try this one.",4.7
3511,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, 8 years ago from an offie in Slough, and more recently - BIG thanks to Mes. Well it wouldn’t be Number 1 on RB if it didn’t seriously kick ass, and this undoubtedly does that - in abundance.  Dense vivid dark brown colour with a liberal tan cuff. The nose makes you sit up and take notice from the off, and it kicks in that you have something pretty special sitting in your glass. Forest pine, dark fruit, marzipan, booze, malt, spices. Breath deeeeeply and inhale its a 10 - no dizzle. Slides down wonderfully well - warming with a gently prickly alco-burn that soothes like a warm blanket on a cold night.  Lord (and the monks) only knows how they have sculpted this concoction of spices, fruits, malt and yeast so seamlessly. Worthy of all the plaudits. Sublime beer.",4.6
1987,Westvleteren 12,"330ml bottle share with anstei. So I finally get to try this legendary beer. Dark brown color with small crisp head that disappears quickly. Aroma immediately gives candied sugar and dark fruits, forest strawberry, but also a maltiness there. The maltiness doesn’t go away, can’t be unseen now... Taste is rich, candied sugary, dark fruits, spices. Finish is heavy and sweet, with a nice hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is extremely crispy-foamy. Spices, berries maybe, sugar Liquorice and a bit boozy. More balanced than the Rochefort 10, but not as balanced as Bernardus. Interesting that these three Champions League beers of the Quadrupel style are all so different in their characteristics. A superb beer, but this maltiness in the aroma... Besides that, a fantastic brew, but really not worth the hassle to get it. A good choice for the 100th brewery I’m rating :)

UPDATE: Enjoyed a vertical with vintages 2002, 2014, 2015 shared with jonas, jfb, MoritzF, and Ritzn in June 2016. The 14 year old one has a lot of Pedro Ximenez Sherry aromas, some old rubber (but the first pours did not have as much of it - the later pours had too much dead yeast in there), and hardly any carbonation left. The 2 year old one was quite edgy, a bit phenolic, really good, and the one year old one was smooth and balanced. Very interesting!",4.5

3384,Westvleteren 12,"To finish a great day and evening of few nice beers after sauna, why not crack one of these, too. Pours murky mahogany brown into my Trappist glass with some sediment. Nice brown small bubbly head. Aroma is very nice with alcohol, malts, fidges, raisins, dades and sweet caramel but not as full bodied as I had expected. Flavor then. Wow, aroma was a bit ""low"" but the taste! Full bodied fruity and sweet, not too much though but just enough and a little bit more. Very lean mouth feel, you feel the alcohol but as a complementary part of the flavor and round enjoyable maltyness. Fantastic good! Palate feel is perfect blend of acidyness and sweetness, truly full bodied and creamy. Finish is amazingl; first alcohol and sweet fruityness turning into great bitter bite which lasts so long.",4.8

2756,Westvleteren 12,"I could easily have passed through life without ever tasting this magnificent beer, but fortune let some come to me.

This beer is one of mankind’s great achievements. It should be drunk in a deconsecrated cathedral, with the organ playing and sunlight streaming through the stained glass. 

Is it better than Trappist Rochefort 10? I’m not sure. Is Bach better than Beethoven? If anyone wants to send me a bottle of each I’ll be glad to run another comparison.

2019 update: I had the privilege of visiting them in Belgium. Had one at the store and bought a six-pack to share with brother-in-law. After drinking four of these magnificent beasts in a week, I am now sure that this is the Everest of beers. Others come close, and are certainly easier to acquire, but if you are ever near Ypres, go find them.",5.0

Trappist Westvleteren 12 – bottling date 02.12.2014 – Best Before 02.12.2017

Appearance: Dark brown, almost black, slightly off white head. Excellent head retention. Head is very creamy and made up of tightly packed bubbles. Some lacing that has dried out on side of glass as I am taking my time to drink this thick, sticky brew.

Aroma: Port wine and malt.

Taste: Brown bread. Long lasting sweet, malty Horlicks aftertaste. All bran with warm milk taste is quite strong. Port in the middle. What really stands out is just how long the taste lasts after swallowing. 

Mouth feel: Smooth, creamy and dry at the end.

Overall: I was extremely tired when reviewing this and unfortunately was unable to pick out the aromas as I would have liked. Will revisit. Prefer this over the Rochefort 10 that I had last night, but this is a little older and IF the Rochefort 10 is anything like the 8, it tastes much better with a little longer behind it, once the yeast has settled down.",4.8
4125,Westvleteren 12,"#500, and coincidentally, my six month RB anniversary.  Cap code 09.05.10.  Pours a dark, murky brown body that lets just the slightest bit of light shine through.  A large, frothy, cream colored head settles to a thin but dense blanket of foam.  Random patches of microfilm lace are strewn about the glass.  The nose is intensely aromatic, and almost indescribably inviting.  Sweet caramel meets rum soaked figs, prunes, and raisons.  Scents of root beer, maple, cocoa, heavy cream, and Tahitian vanilla beans foreshadow the decadent flavors that are surely to follow.  The flavor is just downright epic.  Its sweet up front, with caramel and maple showing strong.  It then transitions seamlessly to the complimentary flavors of figs, raisons, and vanilla.  Surprisingly bitter floral hops tickle the roof of the mouth on the back end, providing punch and balance.  The body is medium-full, with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel that ends up just a bit too sticky.  Sweet and sour dry fruits linger on the palate for ages.  This is a truly fantastic beer that lives up to the hype.  I couldn’t have chosen a better candidate for #500.",4.4

Generally I’m not the biggest fan of the the trappist ales because of the amount of sweetness most of them possess. This one is nothing short of perfect, however. It has a hint of saltiness that’s reminiscent of Burgundy-style belgian ales (bourgogne ales), yet the character and the body is that of the best trappist ales I’ve tried with heavy, murky head.

Small flat head and very dark brown-almost opaque. Nose is a bit alcoholly, chocolates, caramel.  Thick, syrupy mouth. Alcohol is present but tons of syrup, chocolate, raisins, prune. The flavors stick to the palate as the warmth creates more flavoring.  Still, I would believe this is a beer best drank fresh at the brewery (or across the street).  The 8 was almost perfect.

hazy auburn brown pour with a monstrous tan head. cinnamon cream colored yeast hits last and creates little designs in the fluff.

very vinous aroma changes every time i go back for another sniff... white wine, brown sugar, milk chocolate, malt powder and vanilla all show up. 

the palate is quite spicy and has a ton of yeasty bitterness... earthy, woody, real maple syrup, concentrated malt powder and lots of chocolate chip cookie dough flavors. pleasant perfume before the dry spicy finish. it*s only mildly sweet though dry at the same time. medium body seems a bit thin considering how much is going on, the abv% and how NOT sweet it is. creamy texture is rich in the mouth but not heavy.

3385,Westvleteren 12,"For my 500th ranking, I chose the one and only Westvleteren 12. This is also beer #2 in my Trappist tasting tonight. Will it live up to the hype? That’s why I’m drinking Rochefort 10 right beside it and will be drinking three more Trappist beers afterward. Then I’ll be able to decide if it truly is the greatest beer in the world. 33 cl botle poured into Trappist glass. Pours a murky brownish orange with a nice bone-white head that retains itself for a long time; when it collapses, it leaves a fine blanket of foam and some nice lace. Not nearly as much sediment as the Rochefort. Better looking than the other beer. Aroma is spicy, bananas, ripe plums, earth, cooked black beans, some funk. Equal in the aroma department to the Rochefort, but they are very different. Taste is sweet with no bitterness (towards the end of the bottle a little bitterness shows up in the finish); almost Eisbock sweet. Some apple pie in the flavor. Crisper than the Rochefort; meaty. Body is full; carbonation is soft; mouthfeel is creamy. Overall, better than the Rochefort. Although a fine beer, I’ve had way better. I think it is hyped up a bit.",4.3

I actually have a bit of allergies left, so my nose is not as good as it should be.  Nevertheless, it smells like honeyed sweet-dough biscuits and cream, like raisins and apples and passion fruits, grapes and apricots.  Also alcohol.  The fruity smells were most apparent, I was hard pressed to get any non-ester malt smells.  Looks supremely confident of itself in its shimmering dark brown translucency.  Taste is like a sticky bun full of cinnamon, rum, apricots, dates.  Sweet muffin dough malts and just a little bit of yeastiness.  Finish is chewy and long.  This is way more complex than I was up for tonight, but I DO intend to try it again (har, har) and will probably adjust my description.

Sweet apple/fruit aromas and flavours with hints of brown sugar. 12-9-02:  My second westy 12 sampling.  Nice red burgundy colour.  Extreme vinous, black currant aroma.

Several intermingling aromas arise from this beer; yeast, cherry, grape, raisin, fig, cappucino, dark malt, spices, molasses, and so much more. To enumerate every note in this beer’s aroma would take the nose of a bloodhound and the vocabulary of a thesaurus. 

The flavor is just as complex as the smell. Plum, rum, chocolate, fresh bread, grape, pepper, vanilla, again I can’t possibly do this justice. Unrivaled.

Tasty aromas of plums and ripe raisin with a light caramel, anise medicinal, herbal, spicy rum-like alcohol, and just a great sweet maltiness.

Good, even, steady carbonation and a crisp, dry, sipping velvety smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel, pretty close to perfect.

Delicious quadrupel taste, caramel maltiness that is followed by a plum fruitiness and Belgian candied sugar, clove and a good light spiciness, softly herbal, a dirty yeastiness, the alcohol is warming in the palate, a bit sweet and spicy as well, and a dry yeasty, malty finish with a lingering spicy alcohol presence.

Sabor ligeramente más intenso, en la línea del aroma empezamos con sensaciones vinosas y madera ligeramente ahumada, pasamos por regaliz y ligeras frutas oscuras y terminamos con notas especiadas y muy levemente licorosas, final medio, frutal y ligero amargor herbal, alcohol ligeramente presente aunque muy bien integrado.

Jan 2015 - Bottle, Dec 2013 vintage.  Very dark red brown, very big foamy beige head.  Aroma is biscuity and sweet.  Body is medium, foamy, low carb.  Taste is sweet pungent toffee malt, lots of spice, tangy rhubarb, gluey. Bigger flavour than the last couple of bottles. (3.6)


Feb 2016 - Vintage Oct 2012.  Taste is raisins, cherry cola, peppery spice, some dry booze, wood, aged malts, some tawny port.  I mean, this is a good and interesting beer.  But I really can’t say it’s one of the best in the world. (3.7)  


October 2017 - Bottle share at Magic Dave's Leaving Tea Party.  Side-by-side of St Bernardus 12 (2013), Westvleteren 12 (2012) and Rochefort 10 (2013).  Spicy, nutty, robust.  Little harsh.  Lacks the drinkability of Bernardus and the complexity of Rochefort. (7-4-6-4-15=3.6)",3.8
3715,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle  Pours a murky brown with tan head.  The head lasts well.  The head laces well.  Has a great aroma of fruits, spices, cocoa, and vanilla.  Has perfect carbination and an awesome mouthfeel.  I waited a long time to get one of these and it is great.  The flavors are very complex, tastes dance on your tongue.  Has a medium to heavy body.  A thick texture.  The Finish is smooth and perfect.  This truely is an awesome beer.  The balance is perfect.  I can’t think of any bad part of this.",4.6
4624,Westvleteren 12,"Shared a bottle at Bar Volo. Thanks to Ralph! Pours a beautiful murky reddish brown with a creamy head. Great aroma of fruit, malt, chocolate and a variety of other great scents. The taste: WOW! Pepper and other spices, malt, chocolate, plum, hops and so much more. Every sip is different. Just fantastic. One of the top 5 beers I’ve ever had.",4.8
2471,Westvleteren 12,"12-oz. bottle. Dark copper pour with a good deal of suspended yeast globs and a pillowy, latte-colored head. Aroma of brown sugar, dates, dark stone fruit, banana bread, and subtle Belgian esters. Incredibly rich flavor with heavy bready malt (almost like a märzen) being the dominant tone early, along with some raisin, a touch of brown sugar, and a surprising bit of almost spicy, boozy heat. As it warms, the breadiness takes a back seat to a sweeter Belgian yeast/candi sugar note. It’s not as complex as past bottles, but still quite layered. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with a tangy, lingering finish. A delightful beer, but it doesn’t quite live up to its extremely lofty hype.",4.2

4398,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle via Belgian Shop.  Very complex beer, but the best beer in the world?  I don’t agree.  Good, but not great.  Definitely not worth $25/bottle + shipping from Belgium.",4.0
4864,Westvleteren 12,"I saved my 100th rating for the beer most everyone hails as supreme.It poured an exquisite brown red color, the aroma was malty sweet, with a little bit of citrus,not as wonderful as I thought. The taste was sraight malt citrus, with a hint of cherry. A very nice brew, but not the elexiar I was led to believe.I read one report that the new brew is a little raw and may take a couple years to peak, so I bought another bottle and will let it sit.",4.6
3355,Westvleteren 12,"Tasted from a 11.2 oz bottle.  Pours a pretty dark brown, cloudy body with a cream/brown head.  Head is dark candy sugar, yeast, caramel, toffee, dark fruity, plum, light barnyard aroma.  Very rich candy sugar, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, plum, fig, Belgian yeasty, dark chocolate, rich malty flavor. Very nice, easy drinking, rich and sweet malty beer. I really enjoy this beer, but for my money, I got to go with Rochefort 10.",4.4
1316,Westvleteren 12,"The best beer so far! taste a bit sweet with a hint of caramel, chocolate and fruits. Considering the ABV content, this is very much easy to drink for anyone.",5.0
4213,Westvleteren 12,"Rerate: 1996 bottle, courtesy Papsoe, shared with folks at Oldsmar Tap House. Pours a cloudy murky caramel color. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is full of delicious aroma and some butterscotch and gorgeous, nostril-filling fruity esters. Divine. Flavor is chock full of gorgeous, mouth-savoring notes, including caramel, dark candy, plum, rich fruits, brown sugar...amazing. Extremely drinkable and as good as a beer as I’ve ever had. We had it side by side with an ’07 Westy 12, and this one destroyed the latter. Amazing.

Huge thanks to my dear friend peabody for this one. Looks beautiful. The smell doesn’t hit me as well as the Westy 8. The taste is amazing and so smooth for a 10% beer. Best in the world? Tough call. I think I like the Westy 8 more. Still, a fantastic brew here.",4.9

4649,Westvleteren 12,"Wow!  I decided that i would wait to crack this beauty until i set a personal best in the pole vault.  well, friday i jumped 17’1"" and today i just finished my bottle of westy 12.  the cap was best by 10.03.07 meaning march 10, 2007 so, this was just over a year old.  this was amazing. It poured into my westy glass a pleasing brown, with lots of floaties and an ample sized head that fades a bit while a thin layer exists until the end leaving some nice lace on the sides of the glass.  the smell just said ""drink me"".  it was sweet and yeasty.  the first sip made me want to just suck down the entire glass, but i restrained myself and enjoyed the rest over the next 40 minutes.  the taste included a bread, candy, and fruit.  there was a distinct tartness in the middle and a nice bitterness toward the end rounding out all the wonderful flavors.  alcohol was not present hardly in the taste, but the warming in the finish was very welcome.  if you have not tried this yet, somehow acquire a bottle--mail order, trade, you should try this.  that being said, this may be the best beer i have tried to date.  not one that i would drink every day, too expensive now hard to get(and probably too heavy) to be a favorite, but this is so artful.  as satisfying as a 7 course meal.  i am glad that i got to try westy 12.  and i look forward to someday drinking a beer that will surpass this in quality if that is possible.",4.6

4223,Westvleteren 12,"My first ratebeer rating.  Bottle dated 06-12-09.  Tasted at near room tempature out of large brandy snifter.  Appearance dark caramel color with little head and beautifal lacing.  Some yeasties..  Complex aroma but difficult to pick out individual aromas (muted).  Tasted dates,cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, molasses and slight caramel. Overall taste reminds me of a fine cognac in complexity.  Pallatte is soft and silky yet thick with very, very, very long finish.  I was still tasting aspects of it after having a sausage, bacon and pineapple deep dish pizza.  How do I get more of this?",4.5
4777,Westvleteren 12,"Finally got my hands on some Westy 12’s. Auburn with a creamy tan head.
Aroma of dried fruit and molasses.
Tastes of yeasty bread, figs, raisins,
molasses. Every sip I taste something different. Extremely full bodied. Like a meal in a glass. Finishes surprisingly dry.",4.2

4786,Westvleteren 12,"duvel tulip glass, cellar temp. to room temp., (cap # 26.08.06): the bottle is uncapped with a loud fizz. immediately i smell a bakery of tasty pastries from breakfast to dessert. i pour the bottle into my glass and listen and watch. the body is a dark and hazy brown while the head comes out sparkly, cremey, slightly rocky, and light tan. the lacing seems average. the palate is very smooth and it is also lively. the flavors are much like the aroma and both are complex. there’s HOW much alcohol in this? what else can be said... read the numbers and read the ratings. this is fantastic. the best belgian brew i've ever had...",4.6
