8864,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Blind tasting: Amber gold. Ornate tiny-bubbled white head is rocky and extremely persistent. Mesmerizing nose of peaches and lactobacillus. Equally proportionate hints of clay, iron, horseblanket and musty minerals and oak. Vigorous swirls unveil an astonishingly lustrous fruitiness as well as some band-aid phenols. Fine carbonation massages the palate. Slickly bodied. Tongue-buckling acidity slowly yields to an explosively juicy, flavorsome and bright peach-fuzz acidity. Unbelievably polished from the get-go. Harsh phenols take a backseat to the supple fruitiness. Oak is clean and artfully restrained, allowing the dizzying array of nuances to fully bloom.  Oak tugs on the palate and dries things out, beautifully contrasting with the fruity esters which coat and gently embrace the tongue. Fusion of oak and hay-like malt is in perfect harmony as are the seamlessly interwoven slick fruitiness and cleansing dryness. Finishes with a gorgeous flash of acetic acid which is adorned with clean oak and bouncy notes of nutty and hay-like malt. World-class stuff all the way. Easily one of the most well-rounded and extravagant beers I’ve ever experienced. Thanks for sharing, cquiroga!",4.6
8890,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"75 cL bottle. Pours hazy orange with a huge white head. Slight sweaty aroma, citric to acidic, calssic lambic yet more softened off. Very wellbalanced acidic flavour with a slight sweetness. Wow.",4.2
8942,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,(labelled as Drie Fonteinen Akkurats Gold Geuze 50/50) hazy orange colour. White fluffy head. Frresh aroma of hay and grapefruit. Grapefruit and lemon-peels in flavour with a strong barnyard character. Fruity dry finish of grapefruit and hay.,3.9

8927,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"two bottles shared in june 2006, purchased from Heeren van Lindekerke 



Much more funk in the nose compared to the Roze... some rich, stinky cheese, and starchy sour cream.  Much more lively carbonation as well, very active on the tongue, peppy.  Creamy acidity, flavor is a little subdued (but I had allergies this day).  Rich and sweet tasting, with some really funky, cheese-like funky flavors of horseblanket, lemons, hay and wheat.  Aroma is amazingly rich and ""funked"", more so than any other gueuze I’ve had.  Really a different animal than most old gueuze, over-funked, over-cheesed, fresh and lively, simply amazing.




third sample from may 2010: chewy, fatty bile, soft and thick like dough.  pungent mold and pork fat bile... easily the best of the night up against roze, crianza helena, 07 3F and 06 hanssens.",4.2
8710,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,Bottle thanks to MaltoMeal and shared for his 1000th rating at the May tasting Pours a cloudy orange with a small off white head that diminishes quickly. The aroma is fruit and ester and floral. Sour fruit flavor with citrus and a nice lingering tart finish. Really enjoyed this impressive Gueuze from 3 Fonteinen.,4.4
8777,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle courtesy of Brad at the first DC tasting of 2010 - thanks Brad!
Slightly cloudy straw colored with a large white fizzy head that clears quickly to reveal nice lacing.  Amazing carbonation for a 6+ year old brew.  Aroma of sour grapefruit, pepper, and moderate funk.  Flavor is musty, citrusy, dry and acidic.  Highly complex, and has the best body of any 3F I’ve tasted.  Superb.",4.7
8830,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Poured a hazy golden color with a large white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of brett, leather, funky cheese, horsey, and green apple.  Taste was bretty, with green apple, and lemon peel, and a sharp, sour finish which didn’t seem to come together as nicely as the Roze.  Thanks to Steve for sharing these!",4.5
8787,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"From a 750ml bottle at The Lion’s Pride - thanks Chris!  Pours a light bright golden colour with a significant pure white head.  Aromas of funky white grapes, pink peppercorns, citrus, and a pleasant earthiness.  The flavour is gueuze at its absolute best: more funky, clean white grapes, citrus, and an ethereal slightly earthy sour finish.  The balance and refinement achieved here are nothing short of spectacular.  This is as close to perfection as I have ever tasted.",4.9
8788,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"This beer is freakin’ elegant!  Great carbonation and head retention - this beer is still going strong.  Intense aroma of Meyer lemons and funk, but the funk plays second fiddle to the pure fruit character.  Glorious.",4.9
8812,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,Many thanks to Skyview for sharing!A spectacular sour funky nose on this one.  Gold with massive head.  Hay and horse crap in the best way possible.  Faint cheese in the incredibly sour body as well.  The yeast shot off one of these things must be incredible.,4.7
8735,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"A: The pour is orange/amber in color with a towering white head and a staggering level of carbonation.

S: Seems to be a bit more composed than the Roos. Lots of wet oak, hay, lemon, green apple, and grass. There’s a nice acidity to the nose along with plenty of ""green"" funk.

T: The lemon, green apple, and lactic acidity is more pronounced on the palate than the nose lets on. Plenty of must, oak, along with hay and grass. A definite funkiness that I would put under the ""barnyard"" umbrella.

M: The body is medium with a high level of carbonation and a bone dry finish.

D: Again, the better of the two (Roos and Blauw), but one that I wish I had a bit more frame of reference on (meaning, I wish I’d tried them when they were younger). Still, a really great gueuze.",4.0
8886,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle. Cloudy golden colour with a little head. Sour and acid aroma, also flavour of sourness and acidity. hard to drink much of this sour beer, but very tasty endeed.",3.1
8761,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottled sample, consumed at De Heeren van Liedekercke. Tarnished gold in colour with very strong carbonation. Loads of leathery barnyard funk, sharp fragrant lemon, and earthy old wood on the nose. The funk and citrus dominate the palate with a spicy exotic wood note coming through on the finish. Delicate body, but full of flavour and acidic zip. A very special beer.",4.5
8624,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle @ Heeren Liederkerke. Pours a slight hazy orange amber beer with a big creamy white head on top. Aroma is great, grainy, hay, barnyard, cheese, dank cellar funk, codwebs. Flavor is very smooth and tart. Medium sour funk going on here, great dry, woody presences in there as well and an awesome balance. Acetate
Aftertaste is medium tart, dry finish. Great stuff.",4.3
8762,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Drank next to the ’02 Vintage. Cork blasted off but there was only the smallest amount lost before pouring a rich gold body with large, unshakable fluffy white head. “Funk” is a vague word, but it best describes perhaps the most complex nose I’ve sniffed in a geuze, the first 6-7 swirls each giving a new element: mushroom, earth, leaves and grass, lemon, lime, leather. The flavor keeps this up, trading element after element in a funky earth way that never compromises yet never breaks from the balance. Like Mingus leading a 10-piece band, this is at once chaotic and sublime while simultaneously tight as all hell and brooding like sin. The massive funk rules out any easy fruit acidity or pale malt as havens to run for when expecting a traditional lambic. By my experience, this is geuze at its most hardcore and earthy. I could imagine studying this one for a lifetime, that is if I could get another bottle.",4.9
8695,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"75cl, as J&J Oude Gueuze (blue label), retired exclusive brew, from De Heeren van Liedekercke Denderleeuw, complex sour brew, sour/woody and slightly fruity, very balanced, cloudy, rocky head, very good brew, yet very expensive!",3.9
8868,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"2007 PP SAF Bottle brought by JohnC, many thanks! : Cloudy golden hue with a fluffy head and spotty lace. The aroma is wonderfully funky and herbal with sour apple and tangerine esters, catty and oaky vapours as well. The taste displays tart fruit, chewy yeast, earthy herbal pungent notes with woody and light spice finish. The mouth feel is sprite, lively and quite refreshing with a dry finish. A ROCKING BREW that is not overpowering like some other guezes. Surprisingly ""balanced"" and even Tomme dug it! Thanks again John!!",4.3
8623,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle at Ryan’s. Huge courtesy of Ryan! Damn Dad! Pours a light Amber body with huge thick creamy white head.

8679,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle at Mikkeller Bar. My jaw totally dropped upon seeing the bottle. Hazy amber liquid with huge off-white head. Aroma is nicely funky and sour with notes of funk, apples, funk, wheat, funk, lemons, barnyard and sweat. Extremely well balanced with huge amounts of funk. Best lambic aroma I’ve ever experienced. Taste is dry and medium sour with notes of apples and lemons. Also very balanced and super drinkable even though it has a nice sourness. Medium bodied with high carbonation and really thirst quenching mouthfeel. This beer is just a perfect as a gueuze could be. Totally worth the hype, 100 times over.",4.9
8901,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Birthday Beer #2. 750mL bottle split with artusory, courtesy of fonefan. Thanks, Jan!  Pours a hazy, effervescent orangish-golden color; sturdy off-white head with great retention and lacing that stays affixed to the sides of the glass.  Relaxed, oak-tinged sourness in the aroma; horseblanket and funk, with a chewy citrus presence holding things together; grapefruit and hints of vanilla.    Lively, champagne-like carbonation in a medium-to-full mouthfeel; not fizzy, but textured and very alive on the palate; excellent, mouthwatering acidity; citrus, toasty oak, and cobwebby funk; much lighter acidity and toned-down citrus presence compared to the Roze, and softer on the palate overall; generous, intense funk with a dense tangerine (thanks, Ryan) fruit character.  Just an amazing gueuze.  Lengthy, cobwebby and mildly tart fruit finish; slightly dusty.",4.6
8745,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Sample (about 6 ounces) at De Heeren van Liedekerke for about 3 euro (yep!). Pours a cloudy copper color with a huge white head. The aroma is sour barrels, huge wood, yeast. The flavor is wonderful; a tart acidic attack is fought off by oak and dry yeast. Some fruity and somehow lots of all the flavors. Wonderful. A treat. A vibrant palate.",4.1
8845,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Glorious.
Gold, maybe a hint of cloudiness.  Head is as dense as would be expected on a Heife - looks like it should be atop an ice cream float.  Nose is lemon, dusty green apple, mustyness I haven’t gotten from a geuze in a long time.  Flavor is a sublime combination of bitterness, acidity & sweetness.  Lemon pits, pepperiness.  Some malt that in no way invades on the acid.  Wood.  Probably the most drinkable geuze I’ve never had.",4.5
8795,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle@home. The bottle looks really great, the beer in the glass also. Starts complex-sourish with woody notes, not too intense. Strong, modest dry in the background. Sourish taste turns almost spicy in the finish. Very well balanced, great warming aftertaste. A masterpiece!",4.5

I was soo taen back by this beer i didnt infact rate it by words. However it is possibly the most awsome gueuze ever only misses perfection by over carbonation.",4.9
8903,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottled. Hazy orange colour, big creamy white head. Aroma is big sourness and earth along with some wooden hints. Flavour is very sour along with wooden hints. Big sourness in aftertaste. Really pleasant and lovely thing.",4.3
8772,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Had a pour at 2010 DC tasting, thanks Brad!   Cloudy amber pour with a thin head.  Smells of sour, peppery yeast.  Tastes like herbs, grapefruit peel, is sour with light acidity and citrus finish.  Incredibly smooth.  By far the best Gueuze I’ve had, so complex and balanced.",4.6
8658,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle @ THE Sour and Saison Tasting. The pour’s deep, hazy gold with a massive white head. Lively indeed. The nose is sharp lemon peel, sweaty sock, dank basement and a bit of dusty cork. Very earthy, musty aromas. The taste is more musty dust and buggy wood. Some light sweet lactic lemon cake. Barnyard yeastiness, hints of meaty grapefruit and lemon pith. A bit of cheddar cheese. Soft, complex flavors. Wonderful, but the taste is a bit muted and lacks some of the vitality I was expecting. Smooth and very drinkable. Active carbonation on the palate. Overall, a very pleasant experience. This bottle felt like it was starting its decline. Still, very good.",4.1
8828,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle, bottled on 6 May 2003, enjoyed at De Heeren van Liedekercke. Pours cloudy amber with a surprisingly thick (for a geuze) yellow head. Intensively acidic and woody nose. Oak is noticeable among the lemony lambik aromas. Complex woody and lemony flavours. The wood stays all the way, blending perfectly with the lemons flavours. Acidic dryness that make you cry out for another glass. Medium body, good carbonation. Near perfection as expected when De Heeren van Liedekercke teams up with Drie Fonteinen.",4.6
8746,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"- The cork pops out loudly and we were are a little surprised by the bottle gushing. This beer is almost 7 years old and still has plenty of carbonation. Pours copper gold with a pillowy white head that leaves a web and decent lacing.

S - Blauw brings the funk, a soaking wet horse rolling on a blue cheese blanket in a barn. The citric aroma of lemon peel is there with a light oak.

T - A perfect balance is what describes the taste. Not as funky as the nose, nice lemon, oak, white grapes, with a tannic finish.

M/D - high carbonation, tannic dry finish, with decent acidity that does not wear on the palate. The only reason I stopped sipping on this beer was to enjoy the assortment of funky cheeses.

A beautiful blend of lambics that has easily stood up to 7 years, and my favorite gueuze to date.",4.8
8786,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"[Bottle] shared with tytoanderso with a HUGE thanks to yespr! Pours a hazy gold with a massive khaki head. Aroma has tons of barnyard and brett, loads of lactic acid, as it warms, tons of bitter grapefruit peel come forward. Really a rich and full aroma with a surprising amount of sweetness still evident. Flavor is quite tart and sour, but not nearly the most sour I’ve had. Somehow the beer manages to be dry and sweet at the same time. The flavor has lots of bitter grapefruit peel, various citric fruit rinds, funk, and lots of other citric juciness. Full mouthfeel and surprisingly smooth and creamy. The yeast pour doesn’t change the beer a whole lot other than to add a little more citrus to the nose and a little more creaminess to the mouthfeel. Very nice beer and I’m happy to be able to check this white whale off my list. Thanks again yespr!",4.3

Pours a hazy orange with beautiful white spongy head that leaves a lacing on the glass as thick as the head was once it settled down. Aroma is citrus sourness, straw, hay and brett barnyard funk. Flavor is amazingly complex: perfectly balanced sourness with notes of citrus (grapefruit, lemons) and mild wood. One of the best sours I’ve ever had - everything about this beer is appealing. The mouthfeel, balance of flavors, carbonation, finish, all make this an outstanding beer.

8667,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle, 75cl corked. A rather oily pour leaves a lightly unclear, headless beer in my glass. Doesn’t look impressive in any way, but rustic and sort of sexy anyway. Lightly dusty on the nose, with some vinegar hints, overall more intense than the Roze, especially on the funky side. More lemon, more barnyard, but without the rubbery touch from the female of the two. Intensely tart and dry on the palate, with lemony, funky flavors lasting for a good while. Even though there was a slightly unpleasant rubbery note in the Roze, I prefer that one. Both are certainly good beers, but I also think they’re overrated, probably due to the rare-factor.

8740,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Courtesy cheeseman. Pours a hazy, orange color and topped by a thick, pillowy head of off white foam that slowly recedes and leaves thick rings of lacing around the glass. The aroma is really nice and funky showing notes of sour citrus fruit and acidity from the likes of orange, grapefruit, and lemons. The musty, horse blanket barnyard yeast lends a funky, spicy, earthy quality as well. The oak barrel imparts some vanilla that smooths out the citric acidity. The flavor follows with the intense sour citrus acidity with the lemons, grapefruits, and some soft peach pushing their way through. Some white grapes and tannins from the oak come next and seem to balance out the intense sourness. The funky, barnyard yeast really shines though and lends some earthiness to it all. The oaky vanilla adds a touch sweetness as well. Medium bodied, with perfect carbonation and a tart citrus finish. This is an amazingly complex beer, and an awesome lambic. Definitely a world class beer.",4.3

The acidic, acetic and funky aroma is a holy union of white pepper, earth, resin, dried flowers, canvas, damp straw, sawdust, herbs and sharp, well-aged cheese. Intense! The flavor provides a perfect balance of moderate initial, pale malt sweetness; medium spicy, floral bitterness and restrained funk and acidity. Medium to full-bodied and creamy with modest carbonation. Bitter, acidic finish. Complex beyond belief! A forty year vertical might be necessary to find this beer at its precise prime.

Unclear orange with a medium diminishing white head that leave’s a small forever lasting white head and superb lacing. Beautiful beer!  Aroma is lemony with herbal/floral notes and mild Gueuze aroma characteristics. Taste is incredibly smooth and wonderfully complex. Fruits (lemon, grapefruit, apple, pineapple), wood, barnyard and leather. Dry and citric mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Except for the aroma that could have been a little more complex (probably mellowed with age though), there’s no flaws in this beer. Perfect balance, amazing complexity and great drinkability . It’s the nearest thing from a perfect Gueuze (and beer) that I’ve drank so far. The saddest things about this beer is that it would be the perfect ""go to"" gueuze but it’s rarer than Pope’s sh**.  

Updated: Bottle (750 ml). Tasted again at De Heeren van Liedekercke on April 20th 2014 just before Roze and Heerengueuze. My rating stay the same as the one up here. It was a little less bright and fresh (probably because of the bottle variation more than the age because there was no other sign of age in this one), but still one of the most amazing gueuze ever made. Near perfection.",4.7

8799,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"I originally had a nice big sample of this at De Heeren back on September, 5 years from the date this beer was bottled. I was lucky enough to share a full bottle of this with my cousin (krkearney), my brother and other family on Christmas Day. In addition to what I note below, I think the taste of the blauw is a bit more tart than the roze but it works very well in this fantastic beer. 

I was hoping to find a bottle of this on a recent trip to De Heeren but was suprised to find it available there for sample at a beer fest they were having behind the restaurant. Wow! For the price of about $3 a got a nice sample of about 6 oz or so. 

The beer poured a slightly hazy golden color with a nice thick bubbly head. The nose was a bit sour and citrus, funk. The taste was tart and funky with some definite yeast notes. There was also a nice wood character to the beer and overall this was one refreshing and beer worth savoring.",4.6

25546,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Sampled alongside a ’99 and Millennium at a recent tasting with sideshowe, callmemickey and his wife Marie.

Pours a dark golden yellow color with pale golden straw colored hues and a two finger soapy white head. Good retention, slowly fading into a lasting cap that leaves sporadic spots of lace in it’s wake.

Earthy, musty aroma that isn’t overly funky with barrel/wood character as well as some barnyard/horsey notes, crisp light fruit and subtle citrus.

Medium bodied with a soft, earthy funkiness that isn’t harsh, solvent-like or overpowering allowing the citrus notes and vinegary acetic acids to shine through. Very clean, complex and smooth with a well balanced flavor profile that makes it very easy too drink. This beer has aged very gracefully, retaining it’s puckering, funky character while remaining clean and quaffable. It became more funky as it warmed and we came back to it, with hints of puckering citrus/lemon and a lingering vinegary, dry finish that left me salivating for more.

This beer is pretty amazing at this stage and is worth seeking out. Highly recommended!",4.7
25541,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle generously shared by Destructo at his 3 Fonteinen vertical dinner.   After working our way backwards from the 2010 vintage, this bottle was just a little disappointing.  It had many of the acidic citrusy notes that I love about 3F, but it also had a ""chemical taint"" or off flavor.  Would like to revisit this one because it might have to do with the way it was cellared..
Re-rate I have to change my original rating of 3.9.  I shared a bottle received from a friend whose cellar conditions cannot be questioned.  This version was much dryer with champaign characteristics.  The tartness and sourness were almost non-existent.  I believe this to be closer to the Armand’s intentions.",4.1

25621,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Courtesy of Captain Cougar, DL ’06. Hazy golden orange, frothy head, lasts quite awhile. Strange aroma, very sour/tart lemonlike, but not mouth puckering like most. Faint horsey/grassy background notes. Dry woody notes as well. Flavor a tad woodier than aroma suggests. Lots of tannins, sourness is subdued. Finishes very clean and dry. Forever in debt for the chance to try this. Thanks Tom!!",4.5
25627,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Cloudy golden body with bright white and orange outlying hues, very bold looking, like it’s awake. Moderate white foamy head is slow to recede, never fully doing so. Lacing is thick and intricately webbed and fully covering, to the last sip. Quite vibrant for a beer of this age. A gently caressing nose is very expressive, even in its mellowed state. Notes of must and dust peel back slowly to reveal a blend of citrus fruits, sour barnyard, wheat, minerals, tart cherries, apples and ascorbic acid(chewable vitamin C), grassy notes and a full-on assault of yeast. What an experience. Flavor is mildly acidic and heavily fruity. Sweetness is just apparent enough to provide a sense of balance. Bitterness sets in late and with a full coating near the finish. Medium to medium-full bodied mouthfeel, zesty and refined at once. The palate is perfectly wrought, an intense maze of carbonation and yeasty particulates, with a dab of lemon juice acidity for good measure. Spicy and warming, the swallow leads to a finish of neverending complexity, lengthy and sublime. Light bitterness counterbalances a marauding sweetness that builds with each sip. An absolute knockout, as per the usual with this most graceful brewery.",4.5

25512,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle at Mikkeler Bar SF.
Aroma is nice and complex with an amazing earthiness and herbal note to it. Light citric acidity to compliment the beer. Musty hay and barnyard notes to compliment. Almost no acetic note. Herbal character is a touch minty. 
Pours a fairly clear pale golden color with a fairly big, light pillowy head that recedes until it is just a film along the top and edges. The film persists for quite some time. 
Flavor has a bit more citrus than the aroma and has a touch less barnyard character. Flavor still has quite a bit of that earthy, herbal note. Really pleasant balance of acidity and funk. The moderate acidic note is clean and citrusy while very smooth and not in your face. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Such a nice silkiness to this beer which is shocking for an acidic beer. 
Overall an amazingly complex beer with so much nice earthy notes, barnyard notes, some hay and really light, pleasant acidity. The two most noticeable things are the clean acidity and the herbal note. The acidity works so well and the herbal note is slightly minty and refreshing for a geuze.",4.7

25540,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle coordinated by Glouglouburp and freud at the Hill Farmstead Winter Beer Event. Thanks, guys!



We were all ready with glasses for the rush, so it was a pleasant surprise when this beer opened with a healthy pop and no explosion. Pour is a golden orangey straw with a fluffy but not quite rocky white head that fades to half a finger. Aroma is classic farmyard brett-dominated, with musty floral and vitamin notes. Taste is much more balanced than expected -- no bitterness, but incredibly dry. Tart cherry and citrus flavors initially dominate, and as it warms it becomes more floral/grassy and distinctly mineral. Carbonation is high but not overpowering, and mouthfeel is surprisingly rich. Zero astringency.

25461,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"The legendary special blend made in 1998 for the fiftieth anniversary of the Drie Fonteinen blendery, released in 2000 as a one-off, and the first to bear Felix De Boeck's ""Nightlights"" (a Flemish 1977 painting) on its label, later reused on the Oude Geuze Vintage. Never thought I would ever get the chance to taste this legend, but Akkurat had a few bottles left apparently and I was more than happy to pay the 1295 SEK they charged per bottle - considering the skyrocketing prices whales like this generate on the black market, it seemed proportionally very reasonable. Fun to see how nervous the waiter was when he had to open the bottle, quite a solemn moment really. And after twenty years, this geuze was still very much alive: some gushing was apparently inevitable but with minimal loss (not more than, say, 5 SEK or so…). Thick and very frothy, off-white, lightly lacing and slowly opening but largely stable head on a misty straw blonde robe with warm peachy tinge and lively sparkling - looking like a bottle of no more than a year old. Ancient damp cellar and decades old wine from said cellar cover the original profile like an ornamental blanket, a profile consisting of ripe peaches, sour apple, oxidized white wine, haystack, very old dry sherry, moldy lemon peel, moist jute cloth, green plum peel, sour grapes, old artisanal cider, barnyard, faint hint of chlorine - all the fine elements I am looking for in a top quality 'oude' geuze. Softly and complexely estery onset, wryness of grape and plum peel soaked in gooseberry and crabapple sourness with a softer pear- and peach-like edge, yet nowhere descending into a harshly burning acidity and enlivened by a perfectly measured, cava-like sparkling on the tongue. A soft, bready 'soil' carries the esters onwards with pear and gooseberry remaining the most prominent impressions, towards a 'brut', highly complex, dense but still refreshing finish in which the musty cellar and very old wine notes are accompanied by hayish and leathery Brettanomyces effects on top and wet wood tannins below, the latter quite long-stretched and eventually bittered by a dim, structurally essential and perfectly positioned, very late hop bitter touch. The tartness carries on, adorned by the woody effects and the noble effects of elegant aging. I have held this producer in very high esteem ever since I first put a Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze to my lips a couple of decades ago, but this absolute masterpiece of a geuze was a real honour to taste, all the more so because age has not demolished its basic structure: on the contrary, the ancient wine and musty cellar merely oversee the funky, estery complexity with great care and nobility. Underneath these charming old age aspects still lies a perfectly refreshing, perfectly solid, complex and bright geuze, internally untouched by age, like the roguishly twinkling blue eyes of a weather-beaten old man's face still betraying his soul's eternal youth. Before I get even more lyrical: among the most masterful geuzes I ever had the pleasure to taste, one I had been dreaming of for a long time, and one to reverentially bow one's head for when it happens to cross one's path.

25559,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),Typical drie Fonteinen oude geuze pour with a lively white frothy head. The aroma is an orgasmic and delightful combination of must and vibrant acidity that is never overpowering. Lemon zest and basement abound. The balance on this blend is utterly impeccable. I think my palate will stay dry forever. A nearly perfect example of what geuze should be.,4.8
25529,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle at the DC Lambic & Sour Tasting on April 14, 2012. Served in an old-school Drie Fonteinen fountains gueuze tumbler. Huge thanks to Brad for this one.

Pours a clear golden color with a bit of a tawny hue to the background. The head is white and small, falling somewhat quickly and leaving behind some sparse lacing as it lays down in a thin collar.

The nose brings some heavy earth and funk with lightly-oxidized malt. Some interesting light herbal characteristics in the background that I’ve never gotten from a Drie Fonteinen gueuze before.

The flavor is much more complex and integrated, with the funk, earth, and light herbal character headed to the next level. Average flavor duration with light acidity and moderate funk through the finish.

The body is medium and slightly-chewy with light carbonation. Really great feel and complexity.

We had this side-by-side with the Oude Geuze 1999 blend (supposedly one of Armand’s favorites) and Millennium, and both of those quite handily beat out this bottle. With that said, this beer was still very, very good.",4.0
25523,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"This was easily in the top 2-3 bottles I’ve always wanted to try, and to come upon it as a surprise is really neat.  Pours bright orange with a medium head.  Nose is super refined cheesy funk, completely reminiscent of the best Drie Fonteinen blends from the early 2000’s.  Pungent and tight.  Mouth is refined to perfection, just a lovely collage of dry champagne, cheesy funk, floral and herbal qualities on the finish.  A bit unique not only in its superb integration but in the herbal, minty finish that’s actually quite bright.  This might be my favorite Drie Font ever, which is a huge compliment.",4.8

Smell is intense and sour with gooseberries, horse blanket, barnyard, lemon juice, dusty oxidation, old hay, resinous wood, dry soil and hints of grapefruit juice, unripe berries and grapefruit rind. Taste is sweet and tiny fruityish sweet with resinous oak, grapefruit juice, lemon zest, hay, dry dusty barnyard, leather, brett, grape zest, lemon juice, horse blanket, gooseberries and currants.

The nose has a rindy cheese to it, light dusty paper quality as fruits are unfolded.  Lemon rind, hint of mint, bright ripe tangerine and peach notes.  The taste has slightly less chessy find and a touch more dusty paper, the fruit flavors are even more bright and take stronger hold on the presence of the beer.  more peaches with a little less of the tart lemon than I anticipated as the sourness takes hold and adds to the overall awesomeness and complexity of this beer.

I don’t feel so bad about leaving my 2004 Speedway behind now. Once again Clark’s review is much more detailed that mine but I will add my two cents to a rating of this brew:  Poured surprisingly clean and was topped by a big foamy white head and had excellent strings of lace work upon the glass. The nose detected lots of barnyard and brett yeast character along with fleeting vapors of floral meadows and lemongrass. There was also a strange corky and steel nature to the nose that shows some damage in aging.  The flavors are very rustic and farmyard up front with some lingering acidic fruit. I too found the metallic finish but unlike Clark, Chris and Mike (sorry guys you are wrong) I did not seem to mind it as much as my rating proves. The mouth feel is soft yet does have a crisp around the edge bite to keep things interesting. I loved this beer and would truly freak out for another chance to try it.

Taste : Awesome brett with notes of exotics fruits. Lively carbonation but not harsh at all. Light tannic and lactic notes on the finish. Awesome green apples tartness. Very dry and sharp. Light wood on finish. Very fruity.

Awesome fruity notes on finish. Very well balanced and very drinkable. Much more complex than the Millenium Geuze, same type of carbonation (that I really appreciated).

25684,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Hazy pale yellow. Tightly-woven sticky foam with some rockiness. Alluringly aromatic nose of cedar and must. Swirl of the glass yields lemon, oak, and airy elements. Creamy with a well-rounded softness. Initially firm with musty oak and a brett-laced blast of lactic acidity and vinegar. Soft bodied, yet remarkably brisk at the same time, with a staunch foundation of crushed minerals. Rich toasty oakiness thwarts much of the irony tartness, while the brett virtually fades into a mere afterthought. Vague sparkle of perfume and husky Pils malt. Less tongue-grippingly tart, though, showing trace peach acidity and tannins, which are shortened by the body’s softness. Ends woodily firm and dry, but insistently soft and seemingly low-attenuated, with a muted mix of white grapes and honeyed malt. It’s undoubtedly on the oaky end of the Lambic spectrum, which you gotta love, but it needs a lengthier malt character and certainly more influence from the acidity and brett, to be flawless.",4.2

Light in body with soft but lively carbonation. Almost perfecly balanced with a light sweetness and a mild but firm acidity.,4.4
25679,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"The_Beer_God is one of my personal heros for bringing this beer to jeffc666’s party: Aroma is musty cheese, cider, and a slight fresh tart apple with a fair noseful of sourness. Flavor is not as sour as the aroma. In fact is a very restrained sourness that lets in an underlying layer of sweet peaches and cherries. The musty cheese and slight cider from the aroma are also present. This is the type of beer that I want to be drinking while gazing out the window of a Belgian pub. It is a restrianed beer, but the subtlies of it are absolutely amazing.",4.0
25575,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle thanks to Andrew at the First Annual Chicago Sour Tasting. Wow, what a treat. Great caramally golden pour with a juicy white blooming head. Aroma is wonderful. Sour wood, sweet melon, gentle and elegant. Flavor is very mellowed and somewhat simple. Very dry, mild tartness, strong wood character, mild green grapes. What puts this beer above almost every other is its body. Silky smooth with a cloud like fluffiness.",4.5
25500,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle @ Mikkeller Bar in San Francisco. One of the last few bottled 3F beer I have yet to track down. Flipped my crap when i saw this on the shelf. $180 for a 75CL bottles split 1 way with me, myself and I and like all good Lambic, savored for 3 hours. Delicious. I believe it was around 50F temp when served.



A - First pour was a burnt dark orange / gold appearance. The cork had a HUGE pop exploding but not gushing. GREAT SIGN! First pour was a 5 finger solid white huge bubbly head. Subsequent pours got more cloudy obviously. Dregs were dark brown w/ hints of red.



S - Nose is a mix of blue cheese, cardboard basement musk and funk with a lot of wood, mold and more cheese the 3F funk with lemon nose is there but super subdued. Reminds of the same funky moldy basement funk that I got from Blauw.



T - a know what....taste is pretty freaking awesome. Yes a lot of cardboard and shoe polish. A lot of leather and wood and moldy grapes. But it’s incredibly tart and well done. Lots of lemon, cloth aged old cheddar and funk classic 3 F. Tart overall. 



M - Bursting classic 3F mouthfeel. Bubbly, filling and huge.



O - Great beer. Like all 10+ year old Gueuze, it’s not wonderful as super fresh stuff but it’s still fantastic. I’m happy having had the chance to try this delicious beer.",4.2

25591,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"RBSG 2008. What a treat. Dry and acidic, citrusy and tropical floral notes in the funkiness. The sourness and acidity were very relaxed, the aging mellowed this out very well leaving behind a beautiful mellow cloudy orange brew.",4.2

25587,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Big ups to AtlAggie for sharing this one and big ups for passing the bar as well. Poured an opaque orange with a big bubbly white head.  The aroma wafted from about a foot away and had a bit of citrus and some some funky stinky cheese aspects.  Each sip was totally different with this beer. The first one exploded with some tasty citrus fruit, the second went a little more to the sour side of my palate.  Third sip I got a bit of the dirty malt profile. Incredibly complex beer that I will reminisce about for a while.",4.7
25606,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),Bottle shared with very good friends (drank in 2008): Poured a light orangey color gueuze with a huge pure white bubbly head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of funky barnyard notes mix with some well balance tart/sour notes. Light touch of oak is noticeable as well. Taste is a wonderful mix between some funky barnyard –like notes with some medium sour notes with light oak. Easily drinkable with almost no acidity and some great carbonation. Very well balance overall and it is aged gracefully but I can’t help tot hint that it is slightly less gracious then the 1999 vintage drank a year or two ago.,4.7

16743,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bottle, rating 1300. Pours near black with a chocolate brown head. Roasted malt aroma, with molasses, loads of coffee and a bit of dark chocolate sweetness. The first sip is intense, coffee, roasted malts, and chocolate. Mellows as it warms and your palate gets acclimated, and notes of molasses, dark chocolate and caramel peek through. A nice roasty and lightly hoppy bitterness lingers. Certainly an outstanding beer, and although it isn’t one of my top imp. stouts, I can see why it’s rated so high.",4.1
15401,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Smells a little acidic at first, but that soon gives way to dark fruit and malt sweetness. The coffee and dark chocolate make an appearance in the aroma, but are not nearly as strong as I would have thought. Smells more like a Belgian beer than a stout. It doesn’t pour out thick like some big Imperial Stouts, but it is completely black with a light brown ring of foam. Tastes slightly bitter with good coffee undertones and some booze heat in the aftertaste. The plum/raisin flavor is also present throughout each sip. Palate is a little watery. Overall a very solid stout; it would be good aged.",3.8

Plus the flavor in this thing is delicious i sampled the whole 750 ml by myself with a pound of Port Salut. I never wanted it to end like a great movie, it keeps you wanting more even though your noticing your tounge going numb you cant stop! Ive never been to partial on stouts (that wet cigar finish and the smoke filled mouth is not my thing) but this one is diffrent. I am a fan and its the highest rated beer on my list so far. The commercial description tells exactly what the stout is. The only downer is its little to no head and its overwhelming warming as it warms.",4.5
15330,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Intense aromas of black coffee, black licorice and black plum. Dark and rich, with an ultrasoft mouthfeel that opens with dark chocolate and mocha notes before evolving into black fruit notes of licorice, fig and plum, lingering on a well-balanced hop note.

17491,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"I had this next to DL, so maybe my taste buds were biased, but it was definitely a few notches below DL, but excellent nonetheless.  I just need to get some BA Speedway now. 



750 mL bottle.  Thanks to OhioDad via Jonathan.  Pours with a deep deep black with a thick dark brown head.  Left considerable lacing.  Aroma was absolutely dominated with espresso coffee though plenty of roasted malt and caramel made it’s way through though chocolate was supressed from the big coffee presence.  In the flavor, chocolate was able to be perceived, though the coffee was still big in the profile.  Some slight crystal malt sweetness come through along with roasted malt and some douginess.  Flavor was fairly dry for an Imperial Stout, especially in the finish.  Hops made its way through the ruckus both in flavor and bitterness though a considerable amount of that bitterness was from roasted malts I believe.  Alcohol was there, but not overpowering with just a bit of warmth in the finish.  Mouthfeel was a notch below DL, but still considerably thick and smooth but not as coating as DL.  Great beer, but no 5.",4.6

17632,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Rating for Alesmith ""The Shit"" from RBSG 2008. Looks like Speedway, that black mass, but the aroma has an extra kick of coffee. I don’t know much about coffee, but what this added gave a beautiful nose. Adding a smooth coffee icecream flavor over the original speedway’s coffee bliss, just built this to be floral all around.  Thanks Peter for building this one. 9/5/9/5/18


Pours a thick black with a small brown head. Strong coffee aroma really gets this thing in a league of its own. Flavor is very rich and malty. Smooth and thick with tons of roasty coffee flavor and caramel. Very amazing brew that rivals the best imperial stouts.",4.4
17727,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Potent, complex aroma of chocolate truffle, malt, ripe fruit, toffee, coffee, and alcohol.  Pours opaque black, thin wispy head is all I could get from violent pouring.  Flavor has all the complexity of the aroma, and is simultaneously intensely sweet and bitter.  I can feel the sugars scorching my tongue at first, but it finishes with a strong roasty and hop bitterness.  Body is as full as they come, and it has some warming from the alcohol.  This beer lives up to the hype.  Outstanding!",4.7
16873,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Jet balck little head.  Toasted coffee chocolate aroma layered with vanilla, deep roasted malts with a piney bittering quality.  There is some caramel figgy scents dancing with a fruit alcohol infused smell and a peaty earthy smokiness.  Decent aroma but the flavor made me step back and say ""damn b thats some full flavored brew.""  A complex and encompassing full palate pleasing with reaching flavor rolls over the tounge and gives hearty complex flavors of a fruity mocha coffee infused with a caramel vanilla peaty earthy smoky piney woodsy bittering brew.   Smoked meats, brothy.  Tastey. Alcohol present in the warmth and the exhale.  Dman tastey beer",4.1

Overall : Another great product from AleSmith.",4.3
17617,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"My second visit to this fine beer, which I believe is the same vintage 5 months later, was somewhat more fruitful a venture... Literally, the strong coffee flavor were backed up magnificently by a fruity raisin and dark chocolate backbone. Much more complex and even more drinkable. My compliments to this beer still stand. My criticism does not.

Original: So here it is, direct from Hi-Times wines mail order, the legendary Speedway Stout. Though, I find myself questioning why it’s so  legendary. Yes, it’s huge. Yes, it’s loaded with coffee and good old fashioned imperial stout flavor. It’s quality sipper for sure--big, warming, well-covered alcohol, silky smooth mouthfeel, well-balanced--an expertly brewed beer. Trouble is: there’s just not much going aside from coffee and a little bit more coffee. It’s an excellent beer but it leaves me in a bit of a bind to rate it as it’s a bit--for the lack of a better word--boring. Ok. Simple might be better. Really, how much you like this beer is gonna depend on how much you like coffee. I like coffee a lot but I like beer better. High marks but not top marks. Good day.",4.4

17661,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"A beer I had really looked forward to taste! Thanks to Jacob Lövenlund for sharing!
Pours a tar black body with nice brown head - nothing less than beautiful! Aroma hits you instantly with a very strong and delightful odour of chocolate. Also coffee, sweet dark roasted malt, mocha and a fine balance of alcohol. Yummi! Flavor is just as delicious. Extremely soft, complex and full-bodied with notes of chocolate, fruit, malt, hops and lots of coffee (espresso). A thick mouthful but not as cloying as Dark Lord. Strong and warming and simply EXCELLENT!! One of the best beers I have ever tasted!!",4.8

16273,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"This is a great coffee like stout. The head pours a nice rich dark down that trickles down the snifter. Very sexy oil like pour which smells of a deep, dark, molasses and coffee. Unlike a stout such as the Black Tuesday, this guy has more of a strong coffee sugary body vs the chocolate body. Either way a great beer. 2011 vintage.",4.5
15482,AleSmith Speedway Stout,Very good Stout. Smells and tastes fantastic. This one is my number one when it comes to stouts,4.8
16716,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Rating 100! Woo! Thanks to bitbucket for getting this to me in time for it to be Rating 100! Bottle. Pours an inky black, with a retroactive head: the beer pours without a head, then the head rises up of its own volition. Very cool! Great lacing as well. Held up to the light, it remains equally black, light does not penetrate this beer. Nose is milk chocolate, coffee of many shades, fruit, a certain vinous character. Not as complex as say Struise Black Albert, but huge and immensely pleasing. The palate is so much better than the nose, good as it was. Coffee beans, milk chocolate, espresso, malt, roast, mouthcoating, very well-ntegrated hops. This beer transistions from swet to bitter, then sweet and bitter. Covers a huge range of flavors, and is overall a great big fantastic bastard, without showing more than a trace of alcohol.",4.7
17494,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"An 05 vintage

Flavor is a nice sweet malty coffee flavor lots of coffee in this brew there is also some vanilla bean in it and a light bitter swallow as well as a nice warm sensation.  This is some GOOD stuff.

Sampled this on tap now at The Liars Club.  Wow.. yeah.. it just went from an 8->10 in flavor.  Stuff is amazing fresh the flavors all just pop out.",4.8

Flavour of potent espresso, roasted malts, burnt caramel and light velvety chocolate undertones. Wonderfully rich and thick texture. Most delicious stuff. Rating: 4.4/5 



Single Variety Speedway at AleSmith for Speedway Grand Prix 2013. On tap at AleSmith, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma brings out potent coffee and heavy roast. Flavour brings out complex coffee notes, a little bit of spice, and roast. Very complex and coffee-dominated. Very little residual sweetness, with a very roasted and coffee centric finish. Excellent stuff.  Rating: 4.4/5 11/9/2013. 


Hammerhead Speedway at AleSmith for Speedway Grand Prix 2013. On tap at AleSmith, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma brings out loads of coffee, and subtler roast - quite potent coffee but not as much as the Kopi Luwak version. Flavour isn’t as roasted as the other alternate coffee versions of Speedway, but is more spicy and earthy coffee. Great stuff, but inferior to the other coffee Speedways, including the regular. Rating: 3.8/5 11/9/2013.",4.4
17085,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Finally decided to crack open one of my bottles.  2006 (I think - possibly early 07) 750ml - 55 degrees, Black pour with a nice looking tan head.  Aroma has an incredible creamy essence with lots of rich coffee, chocolate, and a nice roastiness.  Flavor is fantastic - coffee, chocolate, cream, vanilla, finely roasted malts, just a hint of hops and alcohol - this is great even at a younger age!  Mouthfeel is simply incredible, ranging from silky smooth to tingly.  Just about perfect - The best use of coffee in a beer by far.  Alcohol is barely noticeable and the experience is fantastic.  What a beer!",4.8

Decent tingling effervescence.  Sticky and bitter finish.  This is a great beer!",4.3

14748,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"2016 vintage. Appearance: deep dark brown/Black, opaque, with a low lying khaki head and nice lacing
Aroma: All malt, with rich dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, and light roast
Taste: Rich dark chocolate with a light toffee and roast. Beautifully balanced with just enough bitterness to balance
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a light creaminess and a light carbonation 
Finish: Roasted malt and bitterness lingers on the finish with a touch of dark chocolate 
Overall: Beautifully balanced for an imperial story with coffee. Profile is insanely smooth throughout, from aroma thru the finish. Dark chocolate and toffee are most prevalent, but a lightly roasted coffee note balances while remaining smooth. A light creaminess tonthe body helps blend the flavors together. This beer has 2 years of age, and stands upbas a top notch imperial stout",4.3

16794,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Big thanks to kpresley77 for this gem. Pours dark as night, with a half-inch thick light brown dense head. Aroma is intoxicating in itself, a pot of melted chocolate, with a strong alcohol aroma that fits in perfectly, strong espresso coffee, and candy sugars. Wonderful nose. The texture and flavors of the beer coat your palate and don’t let go. Oily, and dense as the alcohol and hops initially bits your tongue, next the dark roast  flavors sooth you mouth and make you want to drink this all night. Neither bitter nor very sweet, just perfect middle ground. Hated when this was coming to an end, but blessed to have experienced this work of art.",4.1

16663,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"750 ml bottle.  Pours blacker than a thousand midnights.  Like a black hole devouring all light that attempts to pass through.  A thin, small but creamy head forms slowly.  At the onset the aroma is so obviously coffee, but then it begins to divide itself into many different coffees.  Dark roast, espresso, even  mild.  Hints of chocolate?  Can the taste ever live up to its bouquet?  As I slowly tip the glass I’m at first leery, and fearful of disappointment.  But then I’m taken away and actually get chills across my shoulders and back.  All the complexity and wonderful diversity of the aroma is maintained … no … surpassed as I get near giddy at the sheer joy of the experience.  All the while, that wonderful coffee presence at its core.  Soft carbonation, a bit sticky, it leaves me smacking and licking my lips wanting to make sure that I don’t miss a single opportunity for pleasure.  I bought this about a month ago, and it states right on the bottle that it’s best if aged 6 to 24 months.  Bottled on 8/4/2009 would have meant I’d have to wait until around March of 2010!  Alas … I wasn’t strong enough.  Then again, if waiting meant it could be even better, I’m not sure I could have survived the experience.",4.7
17251,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Much thanks to Joebrew for sharing this excellent beer.  Very comparable to Peche Mortel.  Aroma is strong with coffee and roasted malt.  A black beer, very little head and lightly carbonated.  Flavor has a lot more coffee, but also bitter chocolate and sweet fermenting fruit flavors including raisin.  The palate is excellent and makes the good flavors that much better.",4.2

17701,AleSmith Speedway Stout,Pours like motor oil with a really high viscosity. Only way to get a head is to pour really fast and the head is dark brown. Aroma of coffee and burnt nuts. The flavor is of coffee and some chocolate but somethings missing. No rum-raisin flavors. Never would guess that this is 12% either. A great brew but might be a little over the top as far as body. I prefer Rogue's Chocolate Imperial as well as DFH's WWS.,4.0

17743,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Color pours out a typical leathery brown to settle a thickly burnt black with a purply-brown plum-like hint in tone, absolutely no head produced, just a few bubbles from a vigorous pour, no real lace either. Aroma is absolutely lovely! Lots of deep dark chocolate, freshly baked chocolate cake, buttery, moist, and chocolately with a nice little espresso on top. Just loved the smell of this, so chocolatey and absolutely yummy on the nose. Makes your mouth water - so time to quench! Taste starts with a smooth chocolate tone thats very dark and rich, stays mellow for a good portion of its stand, oh then the finish, oh the finish! Everything is noted here starting strong with espresso and some hoppy bitterness. Then gets quite complex with warming alcohol, molasses, tangy dark roastyness thats bittering deep and long; turning to a slightly burnt chocolate cake with espresso and chocolatey drying lately lingering for a good while. Absolutely amazing great finish! Feel is full and hefty, good little help of creamyness with some major finishing of both a strong chocolatey dryness and some espresso/coffee bittering, souring sweetness on the tongue. This is some amazing sh*t! A major sipper all the way and extremely enjoyable to the fullest.",4.5
16140,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Finally getting around to raring this one. Pours black. Nose is heavy dark dried fruits and chocolate mixed with chocolate.

Oh man, silky smooth, INTENSE flavors of bittersweet chocolate caramel ,alcohol, coffee beans and cocoa powder. Full, rich, intense and sharp. Nice long bitter finish, a bit drying as well. I didnt notice many burnt fruit impressions, notably some raisons and plums. This is a HUGE beer and one not to be taken lightly.  I feel it may need some time to age so it can mellow and meld a bit.

16494,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"400th rating, had to be something special, so I kept this bottle for some months away, and today at the start of my birthday (30 years, here it was 00u passed at the 26th) It was time to open this bottle and enjoy it together with my wife. Poured it at a ""gulden draak"" glass, so think that is ok. Thanx to NoiZe for sending this beer to me. Pours out like expected, black with a good head. The head is even very big, and sticks nice to the glass. Medium dark brown coloured, and holds pretty good. Smell is coffee, but with a bit of something unpleasant inside. Roastiness, coffee, some chocolate and hops, and something that goes slightly sour (not overwhelming, but its there slightly). Taste is roasted coffee, an oily body, but less then expected. Some weird, even a bit unpleasant ""sourish""- berry’s comes up, that changes to a bitter coffee-chocolate aftertaste. Lots of chocolate at the aftertaste also, maybe some nespresso? It’s not completely the beer I hoped for, I’ve tasted better imperial stouts for sure. In my opinion it’s overrated, but it’s still a very decent beer. But to buy it again... specially at this price... no... A bit of a disappointment. It gets a bit better while warming up, but still...  Edit: Need to re-taste one day, maybe my bottle was not 100% ok...",3.8
16053,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bottle in snifter.  Very thick viscous pour.  Jet black in color with a pretty big brown head that fades quickly.  Big lacing on the glass.  Huge fresh coffee aroma to go with toasted malt and dark chocolate.  Taste is rich coffee and chocolate up front, mildly sweet.  Slight bitterness hits in the middle along with big toasty malts.  Finish adds thick caramel to the flavors.  Somewhat dry finish.  Coffee and caramel linger on the tongue for a very long time.  Big thick and chewy mouthfeel.  Very slight alcohol warming.  This is a great Imperial Stout.  Glad I finally got to try.  One of my new favorites.  Re-rate 3/21/13 - Love this stuff and want to bump it up a little.  I still feel like the nose could be just a tad better but the taste and mouthfeel are top notch.  As it warms, some tobacco and soy sauce tastes come out but they’re always balance out by fresh coffee and caramel.  Definitely one of my favorite Imperial Stouts.",4.4

The chalky dry chocolate smell drinks like creamy rich indulgence and the finish is clean, strong and begs you to go back for more.  No alcohol presence at all, nice full mouthfeel, truly inspiring beer.",4.5
16991,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"750ml Bottle

Recieved this from Taynor a couple months back, thanks Dana! Speedway Stout is black as night when poured into my snifter letting no light pass through whatsoever. A short but dense one finger beige head formed on the pour, quickly falling to a skimming with a thick ring around the glass. Leaves respectable lacing after each tip of the glass.

The aroma hits hard with big doses of roasty malt and anise. I didn’t expect so much anise in a coffee stout. There’s more creaminess than coffee in this particular bottle and a some dark berriness wafts through the more pronounced aromas. All this makes for an inviting stout but I was hoping to get a little more coffee. A mild boozy spiciness brings up the backend creating a bit more depth in the aroma.

Now this is a tasty stout! Roasty malts are quickly followed by mild bittersweet coffee, anise, and a pleasant spicy alcohol that brings some of that peppery berriness. There’s still not a great deal of coffee involved but this is a top shelf stout without it. The finish is a perfect comcination of bitter coffee, dark berries, and roasty malts creating a bit more bitterness. I love my stouts with a bitter finish and this one brings it.

The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of the spectrum. This is just my picky side but it could use a touch more creaminess. Leaves some residue, without being sticky, that helps the flavor linger.

As big as this stout is the drinkability is up toward the top of the ladder. The lack of creaminess actually helps the the drinkability. 

This is, without a doubt, an excellent stout! I just don’t think it’s a World beater! I would like to get my paws on another bottle for more extensive testing but as it stands I feel there’s better examples out there.

Aroma of heavily roasted coffee, burnt caramel malt, plums, semi-sweet chocolate and general roastiness.  Initial flavors of roast coffee, bitter chocolate and balanced malt sweetness.  Secondary flavors of stone fruits, red wine sour and lingering coffee/mild hop bitterness--No ""bite,"" just a nice smooth, clinging aftertaste.  Very slick/creamy, oily mouthfeel that leaves a slight coating on the palate.  Ultra fine carbonation with a medium body.  High ABV is well concealed and results in an almost subconcious warming when sipped over a period of time.  I’m glad we have three more of these!",4.5

14205,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Tap at AleSmith Brewery Tap Room

Aroma: well rounded roasted aroma, caramel, coffee. But this beer really have a great balanced flavor. The coffee, malt and bourbon scents are all there and very distinct. High definition, and great smell. Usually, a stout will have multiple levels of smells and they would be blended together, but this stout have all scents and they are very easy to pick out. And it's the authentic coffee, authentic roasty smell. 4.6/5

Appearance: At a certain stage when everything is correct, I look for the corners. This beer hits all the marks, and what I have to say is the lace. Truly beautiful. Great lace retention. 4.6/5

Flavor: again, very similar to the aroma, this beer is great on all flavors, and the barrel aging just make all the flavors more balanced and all rounded. I can clearly take the bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coffee, malt. I would say this is indeed THE BEST STOUT I have tried so far. 4.75/5

Mouthfeel: smooth, thick, full body, but with all the good sides on bourbon. 4.5/5

Overall: The reason why I love this beer is because it just brings all the designed flavors in a very great way. Since they have another blue mountain coffee stout version, and this Vietnamese coffee is just a bit better. I don't wanna give it a 10/10 since you never know if there are more good stuff outta there. 18/20.",4.5

Fading to a ring, with some swirls of lace. Aromas are bold with coffee wafting out immediately. The barrel character makes itself known, but does not smell hot....lingering sweetness of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate and a final dose of heavy roast. Taste is delicate, yet bold. Nice medley of coffee and chocolate out of the gate. Simmers into oak, vanilla and fudge....and then the bourbon creeps in to take the sweetness of the edges. Great mouthfeel, thick but not chewy...seems the barrel thinned this out in comparison to the non-BA Vietnamese version I had. Still, this body holds up nicely against the backbone and never tasted ""hot"". Finish was very oily and gave a great bitter coffee splash with more chocolate, vanilla to compliment the oak/bourbon.

The pour is a nice oily black with a thin head of dark khaki that falls to a ring, leaving no lace. The aroma is a huge chocolate bomb. It’s awesome. There is such a big chocolate malt presence. There is a strong barrel character as well. The bourbon is big and it does offer a nice addition of vanilla. The coffee is quite subdued, which I’m not that much of a fan of. The flavor is good, but lightly disappointing. The coffee again is lacking. The chocolate is big once more and the bourbon is nice. There is a strong woodiness to it that I just don’t care too much for. The head and chocolate balance well though. The mouth feel is a little light. It’s viscous, but you have to work the carbonation out and I’m not crazy about that. This one is good, but it’s not quite as good as some of the other BA variants. The aftertaste is chocolatey and malty and carries a little bourbon to it. It’s tasty",4.3

Drinks outstandingly smooth, very soft on the tongue with an intense barrel infusion, creating a hot bite during the finish, together with bitter coffee.

Tastes of sweeter fudge, immediately coated up by earthy, silk coffee with a faint berry quality to it. This foundation gets joined by a prominent, vanilla heavy, warming barrel, adding smoky oak, camp fire warmth, resin and a whiff of hazelnuts to the taste.

Nie spodziewałem się, że ten dzień tak szybko nadejdzie i w dość szybkim tempie dojdę do tego poziomu.
Ba! Nie zamierzam się nawet wycofać i dalej podążam w poszukiwaniu tzw. beer whalez. 
Zostało już ich na prawdę niewiele (oczywiście mowa o tych nieodhaczonych w Top50 RB;). Niektóre będą niezwykle ciężkie do zdobycia, ale wierzę, że uda mi się kiedyś wypełnić ranking powiedzmy do poziomu 45/50.
Cheers!🍻

Alkohol: 12% obj.

Wersja: 2016

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy diabła. Kompletny brak przejrzystości.

Piana: Trudna do zidentyfikowania, ponieważ po odkapslowaniu pojawił się mocny gushing. Beżowy kolor i struktura składająca się z małych, beżowych oczek. 
Szybko skurczyła się do obrączki pozostawiając ładne krążki na ściankach. 

Zapach: Niezapomniany, wszechobecny aromat.
Jest tutaj wiele warstw wtajemniczenia.
Beczka po bourbonie wnosi intensywną woń czekolady, cukierków Kukułek, wanilii i przypalonego karmelu.
Tuż za nią podąża aromatyczna, mocno palona kawa.
Kroku również dotrzymują akcenty lodów śmietankowych, kakao, marcepanu i mokrej dębiny. Na ostatniej prostej dobiega cukier trzcinowy i melasa.
Zapach układa się w poszczególne warstwy i otwiera się z czasem jak kwiat.

Smak: Na języku, gładziutkie, jedwabiste już od pierwszego łyka.
W ustach rozpływa się mleczna czekolada, kakao, orzechy migdałowe, Nutella i przypalony karmel. Kawa ma słodki profil i umiarkowany stopień nut palonych.
Słodycz wafelków kokosowych, drewna dębowego oraz beczkowej wanilii wypełnia i głaszcze podniebienie.
Posmak cukierków Kopiko oraz Kukułek wypełnionych chrupiącym karmelem i czekoladą, przez długi czas utrzymuje się w ustach. Piwo chociaż ma wysoką pełnię i jest niezmiernie syte i treściwe, charakteryzuje się dość wyraźnym palonym finiszem.
Tekstura jak wcześniej już wspomniałem jest gęsta jak olej silnikowy.
Ukrycie procentów - arcymistrzowskie. 
Sama radość! Sztosiwo warte swojego hajpu! 

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

BBVSS uwodzi smakiem i powala aromatem. 
Kryje w sobie bogactwo różnorodnych nut smakowo-zapachowych. 
Profil beczkowy jest niezapomniany, chociaż kawa nie jest aż tak esencjonalna, jakbym się tego spodziewał. 
Balans i wielowarstwowość to dwie najważniejsze cechy tego trunku. 
Prawdopodobnie najlepsze piwo AleSmith i w 100%-ch najlepsze z serii Speedway Stout.",4.5

This was pretty much my most sought after beer. Absolutely loved the regular Vietnamese Coffee version (4.53) and expect this one to be the best beer I ever tried. That good. Was lucky enough to get a free pour while going to Emily’s birthday party. A huge thanks to Chris and Lesley for probably a huge tab. Rushed this, but here’s to heaven.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head when I got it. Very serene setting underneath the chaos. Excellent spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled smooth buttery bourbon, milk chocolate syrup, cocoa, some malt chocolate, creamy espresso, vanilla, toffee and sweet caramel. (Smell - 4.75)

Wow on the taste. Still than milky chocolate syrup, malt chocolate, smooth bourbon, creamy vanilla, touch of oak, espresso, lactose and coffee creamer. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Just as awesome as I hoped it would be. So glad I got the chance to have it. Unfortunately I feel like I slightly overrated it a tad. (Overall - 4.75)

The flavor follows suit with the notes of rich dark chocolate and darkly roasted coffee and earthy bitterness up front and backed up nicely by the burnt caramel and the dark roasted malt base. As it warms the bourbon and oak laden vanilla really shine along with a nice nutty character. Really nice balance between the rich and roasty coffee and the bourbon barrel.

Taste and palate: full body, so so smooth, medium high sweetness, soft carbonation, light to moderate high bitter and alcohol finish probably coming from the coffee. Overall: this is so well made.

Overall: This is an amazing variation on Speedway Stout. One of the most balanced barrel aged versions I’ve had as well.

Very complex taste with bourbon, vanilla, sweet chocolate/cocoa, faint oak, caramel/nutty. Everything about this beer was simply amazing and it blew me away considering it was 6 years old.

9258,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle thanks to boutip, 2009 vintage. Appearance is a nice full black with decent brown mocha head. Aroma is quite straightforward with bourbon, vanilla, the usual Alesmith divine caramel and molasses. You can definitly feel the high alcohol content which brings the ripe fruits upfront along with bourbon and caramel notes. Flavors are hard to describe as they aren’t amazingly complex but so well integrated and intense. Bourbon and age seem to have completly taken over coffee from the regular version. As much as I like the regular version, BA speedway lifts this one to a new level without being over the top. Exactly what I expect from a bourbon barrel version.

Side-by-side with Black Note with BA speedway being a close winner. Although I prefered Black Note’s palate and aroma, BA speedway’s flavors were out of this world. My favorite stout aside from BCS Rare.",4.6
9467,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"A Mes rate. 2007 bottle no. 236/447 thanks hugely to Thomas. Legend.
I’ve had a sip of this a few years back and was bloody impressed, I’ve been close to trying this a few times since but it’s always missed me for one reason or another. Now it’s here, I was worried I’d built it up to something too big in my head. One sniff made me think that wouldn’t be the case. One taste made me sure. It’s bloody excellent. Hugely wooden, like some bourbon and calvados soaked wood chips. Superb coffee character as always but it gels really well with the coconut. It has a hint of posh coffee accented dessert about it. Slight rubber in the nose holds it back a little if I’m going to be picky but not much. Glorious sour barrelly hints in the finish work beautifully. Slight marmite, not a full bodied as I was expecting. Excellent wood and caramel and coconut. God I’m loving this one. Can feel plenty boozy little worms making their way into my belly too. Ace ace ace. Worthy of the hype. At least, this bottle certainly is. All that said, it’s just too boozy to really enjoy.",3.9
9683,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2008-08-15. Pitch black body with a nice creamy chocolate mild coloured head that does not last long. Aroma is pretty boozy, dusty roast malt, bourbon barrel. (7+) Flavour is also fairly alcoholic, dry lightly acidic roast, sweet malt undertones. Average to medium palate is lightly carbonated, and is lighter on the tongue than expected. I like that it has a lot less coffee than the regular Speedway, but there doesn’t seem to be enough malt to stand up to the booze and barrel character for my liking. Pretty good. 2006 vintage bottle #57/235, shared by Garthicus

Heavy vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate and coffee in the nose.  Oily black pour.  Flavor is burnt coffee and bourbon, alcohol is definitely present, fig, and dark chocolate.  The best part of the beer, imo, is the finish.  Nice texture, roasted chocolate malts, coffee, rush of chocolate, and an oaky dryness that really compliments the bourbon.  YUM!!",4.3

2007 vintage. Bottle number 205 of 447. This was sampled side-by-side with a regular Speedway Stout. The beer pours dark brown to black with a brown head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is awesome. I get bourbon, oak, semi-sweet chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla. The oak and tannic notes are very tart or bitter, giving the beer an almost sour quality. The coffee has completely faded. Medium-thick mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation. Not sure which I liked the best out of this and the non barrel-aged version because they are both awesome. Very happy I got to try this.",4.1
9515,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2006 bottle shared by shawnm213 and tried side-by-side with my 2009 Speedway stout. Thanks, Shawn! Pours a deep, dark brown, mostly opaque but not black by any means. Small brown head. Really nice barrel notes complement the regular Speedway notes; vanilla, bourbon, and oak go nicely with the cocoa, coffee, herbal hops, and earth. The flavor is also a smooth balance of those notes, and I’m liking that the hops aren’t completely buried by the barrel notes. Full-bodied and smooth, with fairly minimal carbonation and a thick mouthfeel. It’s not quite as oily, slick, or dark as the regular. I absolutely loved this, and it’s a notch above the normal Speedway. Re-Rate, 11/1/11: 2009 vintage. Just as good as I remembered. Blew the regular Speedway Stout next to it away. Great barrel notes.

Chances are he won’t make it to the end of the year, so I’ll be drinking several of my prized beers over the next several weeks.  Anyways....This beer doesn’t have much of a head or lacing.  The aroma is fantastic.  The flavor has your typical strong barrel aging presence like the other Alesmith BA beers.

Draught at MBCC 2018, green session. 
Pitch black body, with a medium, creamy, coffee-colored head.
Aroma of bourbon, wood, tobacco, cocoa powder, liquorice, dark chocolate, some soy sauce. 
Tastes similar, very creamy, with more chocolate. 
Medium, creamy mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finishes medium boozy, moderate sweet, a bit roasty, with cocoa powder, chocolate, tobacco, wood, bourbon, some liquorice. 

Very tasty! Quite smooth for the strength, with very well integrated bourbon barrel and a creamy character throughout. Alcohol is noticeable, but well moderated. Really lovely stuff, while I have to say, after trying a couple of variants now, the straight, regular Speedway Stout clearly remains my favourite one.",4.2
9897,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Original Sample from Bottle 102 out of 115 (2002): This stout pours with a black as night body topped by a thin to medium thick brown head witha good amount of lacing. Wow, what a different aroma.  The aroma is slightly sweet yet bitter and full of alcohol.  A slightly smokey, woody character shows throuhg reminding me of a nice bourbon.  The flavor is equally unique.  It starts out slightly sweet and malty with a slight alcohol note and turns woody, smokey and roasty with a more prevelent alcohol note.  After drinking half the bottle, the vanilla and licorice notes start showing through.  This is a great beer.  It’s full bodied, slightly tingly and warming.  Definately a great beer to celebrate Christmas with.

I have had this brew several times since this initial sampling and it keeps getting better and better with age.  I’ve also had the pleasure of trying some of the upcoming releases of it and was again blown away.",4.9

I’d been drinking all day and this was the beast that lay at the end of the path. It’s one sexy looking beer, silky and black with a thin tan lace. The ’standard’ Speedway’s coffee roastiness is mellowed into this and the oak and wood, the vanilla and a bourbon (is it bourbon barrel or just oak?) depth pour through.

This beer pours a rich, deep black with a dark tan head. Plenty of carbonation left in this gem. This aroma is not subtle. Bourbon and rich roasted malt, with a slight alcohol note emit huge scents I can detect from a few feet away. The beer is absolutely fabulous. Although it is very strong and forward, it drinks very smoothly. It definitely has some heat to it, but it only serves to add a little warmth in the finish.

We waited 2 months to open the first bottle, and here it was... thick like a milkshake, but with no head. Kind of bitter and you can smell as well as taste the alcohol. It wasn’t very carbonated.

A thick, prickly, spirited flavor.  Lots of bitterness and peppery alcohol, skimming the deep chocolate and creamy sweet flavors with rough strokes.  Sharply warm and borderline hot for me, in amaretto and even kahlua flavors.  The combination of the acrid, oxygenated coffee flavors with the spirit flavors is pretty unpleasant to me, but thankfully it sits deeply enough underneath the ocean of chocolate and molasses and extraneous sweetness that it doesn’t ruin the beer.



Palate is full and oily; certainly hot in the finish, with a peppery singe.  And a little bit of chocolate covered coffee beans lingers long after the finish.  There’s a lot of positive qualities here but I can’t appreciate the expired coffee flavors or the heavy heat.",3.7

Aroma of roasted coffee and heavy whiskey.  Flavor is predominantly whiskey, with coffee hanging around backstage, reemerging with greater intensity towards the finish.  Slick oily body.

Flavor: complex and rich as aroma or even more: prevailing notes of coffee, bourbon, dark malts, hops...they takes on all ingredients, which I mentioned by aroma, but they are perfectly blended in one unit. Body is full,  thick, texture silky smooth, carbonation is low to moderate. Finish is slightly sticky, dry, slightly bitter. Alcohol warmth is gentle noticeable, bourbon slightly boozy Incredible!

9360,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"I had the 2011 just a few weeks ago with another friend of mine. We both agreed that the beer is an awesome beer and well worth the ranking it recieves. The bourbon smell hits you first and as you sip the beer the vanilla and coffee aromas become more detectable. This beer is very complex and considering the alcohol content I do not detect it in the mouth, instead I got it as a slight burn down deep in the throat. The beer is silky smooth in the mouth and each time you taste you can focus on a new flavor. The bourbon gives you a bite upfront but then quickly disapates so you can taste the caramel, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate in the beer.

What i really liked about this one is the massive cloying coffee in the regular speedway is consumed by a light bourbon malty vanilla flavor.  Much better then its predecessor, my favorite of the BA alesmiths.",4.2
9524,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2008 growler courtesy Daknole at RBWG. This one pours a very dark mahogany brown color almost black topped by a small, bubbly tan colored head that dissipates quickly leaving smally spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is really nice showing notes of dark roasted coffee, semi sweet dark chocolate, caramel malts, and dark fruits. A subtle bourbon twang finishes things off. The flavor follows suit and the fig and stewed raisins come out a little better to go with the cocoa and caramel malts. The coffee roast is noticed through out along with some earthy hop bitterness. Vanilla and bourbon from the oak smooth things out and add even more depth to the flavor. The bourbon presence is almost perfect without any added alcohol heat. Full bodied and silky smooth with subtle carbonation that leads to a roasted cocoa and bourbon finish. The depth of flavors and the use of the barrel really seperate this beer from others. This is a truly world class beer.",4.4

Pendant cette longue dégustation, les mots prononcés furent rares et les orgasmes papillaires nombreux. Est-ce le meilleur stout impérial que j’ai bu de ma vie? Peut-être pas, mais il trône fièrement sur l’immense podium de la formidabilité! La bière noire assombri soudainement la terrasse en ce jour précis d’éclipse lunaire. Le liquide est surmonté d’une magnifique et légère mousse blanche que je ne me lasse de contempler. Des dentelles, lacings, formes géométriques diverses et irrégulières... Une Grande complexité au nez où tous ces arômes sont savamment balancés: anis, bourbon, café, mélasse, cassonade brûlée au chalumeau, vanille et noix de pécan rôties. C’est prodigieux! Les signes d’un subtil vieillissement se font sentir mais peu-importe, c’est merveilleux! Texture laiteuse; alcool brun et chaud. Le liquide coule le long de ma langue avec une sensualité à peine ponctuée par une faible pétillance me rappelant qu’il s’agit ici d’une bière. Je passe du massepain à la crème pâtissière en passant par l’éclair au chocolat. Longueur admirable et mesurée laissant les saveurs caramélisées s’étirer longuement et doucement.

9906,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2002 Vintage - Bottle #44 of 115:  Sampled from 53 deg F to 61 deg F.
I shared this bottle with my wife, flutetokill. Pitch black color with a small light brown head. The aroma was very decadent...sweet bourbon, licorice, dark chocolate, cherry. The flavor was huge (like everything else about this beer) with tons of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, sweet fruits, and licorice. The aftertaste is a strong licorice tone with warming alcohol in the throat. The feel was very soft, smooth, thick, oily, and sticky. One of the biggest differences between this and the regular Speedway Stout is that you don't have that crispness here...it works much better. This is the first beer that I've had that seemed perfectly complete, well thought out, and masterfully crafted. It was a completely pleasurable experience. Yee-Haw!!!!",5.0
9351,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Review #650. 750 ml bottle served in a CCB snifter. 2012 vintage

A: Pours a very dark black color with a tan head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to thin ring that leave some minor sploches of lace behind.

S: Bourbon up fron couple with some figs and various dark fruit. Sweet barrel presence with some caraml and light vanilla. A little stone fruit sweetness with some roasted malts and chocolate.

T: The barrel is upfront with some oak and smooth bourbon. Bakers chocolate and some milk chocolate with heavy roast. I’m missing the coffee flavors from this guy, but it’s still really good.

M: Silky smooth mouthfeel, medium to heavy bodied. Medium carbonation level.

O: This is definitely in the upper echelon of BA stouts. Having more coffee notes would have definitely set it apart. Still a very delicious brew that I’d love to have again.

9483,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thanks again Brad, long time want.

2007 vintage bottle #212. Poured into a tulip. Beer is black with a thin brown head that breaks and clings to the glass. Some (very little) lacing left on the glass and the carbonation is apparently low.

There is a woody / liquor sweet aroma to this beer. Smells great. Not a lot of alcohol but some sweetness and a hint of roasted malt.

Beer is really really smooth. Medium to full bodied, sweetness up front with an ever so slight amount of heat behind it. Oddly there is almost a late tartness to this beer. Its not lactic or acetic, the beer isn’t going bad but there is a strong almost tannic character to the whole beer. I suppose this the result of the wood aging process. It is unexpected but does not interrupt the flow of the flavors in the mouth. Bitterness at the back is low but good. Overall a really good beer. I’d still like to do the side-by-side with the regular.

Aroma is strong bourbon at first with coffee, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and dark fruit.  It smells like some kind of rich dessert.  Flavor is dark chocolate and coffee with a nice compliment of bourbon and oak that is a big player but not overpowering.  Sweet dark fruits as well.  It finishes with a little alcohol warmth, which is actually pleasant and doesn’t reflect the 12%.  The mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I expected and very smooth.

Unfortunately I didn’t get to taste this alongside the regular version (that had to wait until late in the evening when I remember sitting with bottles of Speedway, Dark Lord and Apis Jadwiga in front of me that nobody was fighting over) but perhaps the coffee is a little less intense. Although that could be as much the extra age (don’t know how old the regular version I tasted was) as the barrel aging. There’s a little vanilla from the barrel age but its such a big beer that its going to resist too much influence (which is no bad thing). To be honest, I’m not sure that the barrel-aging improves the beer too much. Otherwise, not really much point in repeating what others have said many times before. Big and heavy. Loads of coffee.

Overall, this much age isn't good for this beer. I have had it plenty of times fresh or with a couple years and it's much better than this old bottle. But as I was drinking this bottle I went to check my rating and realized I never rated this before. I'd say it's best to drink within 2 or 3 years of bottling.

9813,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pre-Great Taste sampling at 1FastSti’s house


The capstone of the night, this was the whole reason we were doing a tasting.
   Blake’s bottle was #13 of 240.  I’ll have to open my bottle of regular
   Speedway to compare, but this was definitely a well crafted well though out
   beer that belongs in the Top 10.  If you ever get the chance to try it savor
   every last drop.
Aroma / Appearance - Oak, vanilla, coffee, black cherry, graham
   crackers and toasted marshmellows dominate a complex and rich nose.  With a
   larger sample I might have picked up even more.  The bourbon notes are evident
   but they do not take over.  The body remains midnight black; no light escapes
   this black hole of a liquid.
Flavor / Palate - There is a creamy mouthfeel that permeates through
   the entire beer.  It starts off as a combination of bourbon, cherry, vanilla
   and alcohol.  Next it forms coffee, raisins, plums and blueberries.  As if
   that was not enough there is a textured velvet before it finally decides to
   reveal the coffee flavors one last time.  This is a very dense beer though
   well balanced.  Each of the tastes feels like it belongs; nothing here feels
   out of place or strange.  The finish has a lingering caramel and raspberry
   texture.  I had to sit for a few minutes when the glass was done admiring it
   because it sticks around for a long time.",4.4

9591,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"In short: An bourbon aged coffee stout that spent too much time in the bourbon barrel.  Excellent but I prefer the regular Speedway.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Sent to me by many people (doubleO, hophead84, kegbear, more…).  This rating for a 2007 vintage (from kegbear I think).

The look: Black body topped by a short lived small tan head

In long: Drank a full bottle next to on of the regular Speedway that WeeHeavySD brought to me over a year ago.  So both beer are about the same age.  No need to describe the BA beer, better to describe the difference between the regular Speedway that we all know and love.  The nose of the BA has moderate bourbon, some vanilla and very little coffee.  Overall the nose is a lot less roasted and less coffee than the regular Speedway.  The taste is overloaded with vanilla (that the regular Speedway doesn’t have), light roasted level (less than regular Speedway), quite a bit of black liquorice (a lot more than in the regular Speedway), some bourbon (less than I expected), some port-wine (something the regular speedway didn’t have).  The carbonation is softer than in the regular Speedway.  The alcohol is a little apparent (more apparent than in the regular Speedway).  Overall the bourbon barrel aging is so over-done that the beer barely feels like a coffee stout.  Barely any coffee notes.  I’ve had chocolate stouts that had more coffee flavours than this one.  This really is a very good brew, going through a 750ml by myself was a pleasure, something I cannot say about most of 12%+ beers.  However I cannot believe that some people can genuinely find the BA better than the regular Speedway.  Hey, I just had this great idea, why not use Bourbon Barrels to make scotch!!!",4.0

Its a 2006 BA speedway.

A - Pours a nice deeply black with little light penetrating the thickness of it.

S- It has some bourbon on the front end with big dark fruit prunes especially.

T - Once the bourbon clears you get coffee then chocolate with a very smooth silky finish.

Drinkability is very easy on this. The other guys were saying they may still prefer the regular speedway over the BA version. I like both versions and would but this everyday if it were available to me.

9182,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Three year old bottle, but with black neckfoil (the print on the bottle says ""with coffee and aged in bourbon barrels"", so I assume it is the same thing). One of the most expensive beers I ever bought, delivered to me by my dear former colleague Maaike. I taste this a little above cellar temperature from an old port wine snifter. Black colour (but in fact an extremely dark ochre brown), thin deep beige head, a little more ’loose’ than I had expected and breaking open after a short while but retaining well around the edges, with a delicate, silky lacing. The aroma is heavenly: a dense, thick, strong and intoxicating perfume of all the good things you would expect in a big stout, and more. Impressions of freshly roasted coffee beans, kahlua, orange liqueur, warm chocolate sauce, cognac, liquorice, vanilla beans, peat, leather, oaky tannins and even moist wood, gingerbread, hints of soy sauce, cooked meat, cloves and butterscotch. This liquid commands respect, nothing in the nose reveals even the faintest flaw; I’m beginning to understand why this beer scores so high on this site. Taste is... well, intense, to say the least: an overpowering symphony of candied fruits, espresso beans, fondant chocolate, vanilla, oak, candi syrup, dried orange peel... Difficult to point out which comes first. Carbonation is sharpish, even a bit fizzy at first; mouthfeel is thick and smooth, somewhat cloyingly sweet at first but drying more and more towards the end, over a big yet refined, oily, multi-layered maltiness. Spiciness, bitterness and intensity increase in the finish, where a strong bourbon presence takes the lead along with strong woody tannins, with a drying, even somewhat burning effect which can be felt from the tip of the tongue till deep in the throat; peppery hops are quite strong as well, and so is the remaining syrupy maltiness. The bourbon alcohol and the strong, coffeeish roasted bitterness keep struggling for dominance but remain matched. How sweet the onset may have been, the ending of this complex ale is bone dry.  This is a powerful, demanding form of liquid gastronomy in which many things are happening at the same time. Still: this is, contrary to what I had expected, probably not quite the best stout I tasted so far - the alcohol burn is just a little bit too much over the top for me, the mouth and throat keep sticking a bit with the initial candied sugariness and it is, for this particular style, a bit overcarbonated. Nevertheless: hugely complex, hugely enjoyable, very impressive with a formidable balance between sweet and bitter, both present in their most ’compressed’ and intense form. Something to be reckoned with and enjoyed carefully, concentratedly - and sip by sip. Wow, what an experience... Big cheers to Maaike!",4.6

10687,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Disappointing one. Aroma is great, classic bourbony and woody. The texture is unfortunately watery, it reaaaaally lacks body. Some roast, some coffee but nothing exceptional. I am sad :(",3.9
10974,Bell's Black Note Stout,"12 oz. bottle 2012 vintage. Great appearance. Nose is fantastic. Light bourbon over day old coffee and cream, dark sweet chocolate and subtle vanilla oak. Snap!! This sat just long enough. No bourbon alcohol burn, just sweet and smooth all the way down. Of course need I mention the rich cocoa, dry roasted malts, brownie matter and subtle oak? Should I also explain the full body with an oily texture that screams take another sip? I like to age all my BBA stouts about a year in time. This has been one of the best examples I have tasted. The bourbon and roasted flavor linger ridiculously long after the sip. Down.... Right.... Bad.... Ass. Nothing else to state here.",4.5
11602,Bell's Black Note Stout,"2nd beer I tried at Indy Brewer’s Guild Fest.   (palate definitely not burnt out)  Impenetrable darkness with a dense enough tan head to make this look not just menacing, but like there’s some real substance to this beer.  Big bourbon nose over rich chocolate to molasses.  Oaky, but definitely under control.  Balanced, though exceedingly sweet.  I cannot smell the alcohol.  Velvety smooth in the mouth, I think this is truly the perfect mouthfeel, I can’t imagine better.  Sublte carbonation, delightful mouth warming.  Sweet creamy bourbony chocolatey roasty wonderfulness.  Really lovely.  Sweet enough to balance its big alcohol and bourbony oak.  Vanilla lingers long after the roasty finish.  This is a cannot miss, drive 2 two hours for a detour out of the way without question sort of beer.  I must find this again!",4.6

10943,Bell's Black Note Stout,"I’ve wanted to try this for years - I finally found it on local shelves. The appearance is an oily black with a lasting beige meringue head. No light passes through the glass when backlit, and appears still. The aroma is sweet bourbon booziness with slight chocolate bitterness, and a hint of freshly ground coffee beans. Taste - intense bourbon with notes of dark roasted coffee upfront, quickly fading to a freshly cut moist cigar on the back with lingering bourbon bite combined with the bite of bourbon left on the tongue. Palate - Viscosity of lowfat milk and smaller-sized CO2 bubbles make for a silky mouthfeel. Overall, an outstanding blend - I look forward to aging several of these. Doubtless this beer ages very well.

2014 Vintage",4.3
11077,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Drinking this beer is like the feeling of moving on to a higher plane of existence.  The aroma is rich and fudgey, full of plums and cocoa and hints of bourbon, never overbearing.  The taste is the same, on an oil slick palate that never feels burdensome.  A beer that is easy as hell to drink, that tastes like a bourbon barrel beer without tasting like bourbon, and that is a goddamn feat.  This is, without question, the finest BA stout I have ever tried.",5.0

10835,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Beer #4 of 13 in blind tasting. 
 2012 bottle, more than 2 years old This was the second beer in what was supposed to be an unadulterated imperial stout tasting. I have had this a few times and I never liked it. Fortunately, blinded I still did not like it. Poured headless and thinnest of the beers available. I thought this was oxidized, got lots of woody notes, and rather acidic. In hindsight, seems like I was pretty on without picking up bourbon.

Despite me having this as one of my worst beers, everyone else enjoyed it. For the aggregate it scored highest and strongly above average (0.55 standard deviation above). HOWEVER, usually a BA beer scores high in no BA imperial stout tastings. I don’t give these aggregate results much credence.",3.0

Aroma is chocolatety, with notes of coffee, vanilla, caramel, and a bit of bourbon. Mouthfeel is thick, and viscous. Very dense, and filling. Flavor is also chocolatety, with the same notes of coffee, vanilla, and toffee. Bourbon isn’t as pronounced as it usually is in BA stouts. Much more subtle, making this very drinkable. I absolutely loved this. Probably the best bourbon barrel aged stout I’ve ever had!",5.0
11329,Bell's Black Note Stout,"750mL courtesy of cavemanlawyer at a tasting. Big time thanks. Consumed on 6-16-12, reviewed from notes. 

A: Pitch black and all the poetry it implies. Aggressive poor yields some thin lacing, but not a great amount of head. Good carbonation bubbles.

N: Bourbon, honey, and some ethanol. Coconut, caramel, and vanilla. Really quite nice. 

T: Roasted coffee and malt. Bourbon is integrated well into the main body, leaving the normal descriptors of vanilla/caramel/oak. I’m getting plenty of chocolate and some molasses, licorice, and a mystery flavor which kscaldef jogged out of my head as candied pecans. There’s still some heat here, though. 

M: This is coating without being cloying. A very impressive example of what I want in my RIS. 

O: There were a couple of beers that I never thought would be bottled and would thus not make it to the PNW via trades. This was one, the other was CBS. CBS was a big letdown; this is not. Well worth seeking out.",4.4

11608,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Excellent beer.  Pours a very dark brown near black.  Viscous, moderate head that quickly dissipates.  Flavor is dominated by the Bells Expedition, soften slightly by Double Cream.  I’m not picking up as much barrel as I frequently do with many barrel-aged products.  Flavor is somewhat of molasses, currants, and figs.  Slightly tart(almost acidic) finish.",4.2
10784,Bell's Black Note Stout,"People have been talking and writing about this Imperial Stout for a long time, but you don’t really know what to expect until you try it yourself. This stuff is seriously classy. Black as starless night and a dark brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, charred malt, and a hint of cream. Flavor has more of the same but with some dark fruit (plum, currant) and spice (anise). The bourbon note is smooth and rich. Black Note’s feel is full but velvety soft. It’s hard to oversell this beer. Or recommend it enough.",4.9

11604,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Hand bottle from Growler. Big thanks to egajdis for sharing this hand bottle, this was truly a treat. Pours a deep, deep black body with thin head. Aroma was very complex - butter (not in a diactyl way, but in a bourbon/whisky way!), vanilla, bourbon, vinous. The aroma honestly changed everytime I took a sniff, well deserving of it’s ""10"" rating. Flavor is complex as well - caramel, vanilla, butter, very sweet. A few sips I noticed had an peanutbutter like taste. Being a bourbon barrel beer this is pretty smooth and I was surprised to find that the sweetness of the Double Cream was dominating the Expedition. This is one truly delicious beer and I NEED to have a bottle (or grolwer) all to myself at some point in time to truly appreciate this beer.",4.7
11058,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Pours an opaque very dark brown with a quickly vanishing, short khaki-brown head. The aroma is striking. Caramel, vanilla, and coconut. The mouthfeel is thick and a bit oily with just the slightest carbonation scrub on the rear of the palate. Flavors of coconut, wood, nut, bourbon barrel vanilla, and dark, ripe fruit. This is quite reminiscent of Parabola.",4.1
11423,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Pours near black with dark tan head. Aromas of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and light coffee. Flavors of bourbon, sweet vanilla, rich chocolate, and some faint coffee. Real nice bourbon flavor and base beer holds up well. Not the #6 beer in the world but hard to find anything I didn’t like about it.",4.2

Very good, worth all the praise, although I prefer my Imperial Stouts to have more than just sweet chocolate flavours.",4.4
11009,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Sampled at GABF 2013. Pours black with a short tan head. Aroma of dark fruit and espresso. Excellent flavor of coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, and a hint of ripe plums. Alcohol creeps up on the finish. Awesome and well worth the hype.",4.8
11593,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Opaque and black with a frothy tan head rising prophetically. Balanced vanilla beans and bourbon aromatically dance with chocolate and sweet mocha grinds while Madagascar vanilla and caramelized hazelnuts rhythmically fornicate through all nose sockets. Full bodied flavor strikes aggressively and splendidly balanced. Roasted espresso grinds titillate the tongue. Bourbon hides under the semi-sweet dark chocolate coating that encapsulates the espresso bean. Thick oily fluid ripples throughout as the mocha grind bitterness tittles at the tip of the tongue. Dark chocolate manifests more as we delve deeper into the glass. The no bake dark chocolate brownies provide an everlasting surplus in the finish, complimented by a tenderly sentimental vanilla, bourbon and mocha bean signature at the end. Glad I was able to thank Laura Bell with a hug when she brought this beer into my world in abundance at GTMW.",4.5

10957,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Draft at 3 Kings St. Louis. Nice amount of lacy rich brown head on top of a super black pour. Nose is an amazing sense of all things at once. Cocoa, Licorice, Coffee, Brown Sugar, Vanilla, Honey, Leather and Bourbon. Wow! Wonderfully rich but not sticky thick. Great roundness of cream and sweetness with just a hint of oaky grainyness. Perhaps the best BA Stout I’ve ever had. Just the right amount of everything Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Spice and Bourbon Barrel. The best part of this beer may be the lack of hot alcohol behind it to overpower it. I think it was listed as 11.something but it certainly doesn’t present the alcohol in a manner where you guess that. Crazy long bittersweet finish that has an almost bizarrely familiar Cake Box Tobacco edge. This beer is the most perfectly executed BA Stout I’ve ever found. Wow.",5.0

Je dirais même plus, que des arômes raisonnablement riches et cossus de chocolat, de caramel et de bourbon vanillé.  Sur les papilles, rien d’autre qu’une prodigieuse et délectable épopée de malts chocolatées, de bourbon enrobant et de mélasse fruitée.  En bouche, rien comme une grosse et féroce bête visqueuse.  Je dirais même plus: un corps qui est altéré par la barrique peut parfois être agréable.  En finale, rien comme une grosse chaleur.  Je dirais même plus que la douceur des malts chocolatés se transporte vers une amertume timidement établie par des notes de café.  En résumé, rien comme une proposition messianique.

The taste is a powerful onslaught of rich malts, ripe fruits, chocolate and espresso, anise and light charred barrel smoke. I get a touch of grassy hops towards the finish.

Pours basically black with a small but well retained head. 



The aroma is big & sweet with lots of fudge & bourbon notes. The alcohol is there in a pleasant bourbony kind of way, even fainter is a hint of smoke. 



The flavor is roasty and bitter, this is not without sweetness and lots of bourbon character, but this retains so much of what’s great about the big awesomeness that is Expedition Stout. Plenty of chocolate, both in the dark bitter variety and the sweet fudgy variety. Some black currant and cherry fruitiness become more and more pronounced along with the woody character of the beer as it warms.

11484,Bell's Black Note Stout,"FoBAB tasting. Listed as ""Black Note"" my first taste of the event. Poured a dark creamy chocolote brown, some head lingered. Aroma of vanilla, chocolate malts and bourbon. Taste is similar, well balanced and smooth. Aftertaste lingered quite a bit. For sure one of the many highlights of the event.",4.2
11024,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Ahh yes.. Cracked this open for my #600th rating... 
Pour is opaque black, with a small n’ quickly disappearing tan light mocha - brown head. This be looking beautiful.
Aroma has plenty of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, wood, slight leather, wood, slight banana n’ coconut, slight booze, oatmeal, some green notes, caramel, slight brownie fudge, slight roasted coffee beans. Yihaa, this is some tasty shit. Quite complex indeed, with everything that’s supposed to be in an Impy stout. 
The taste is slightly sweet upfront, with a very well balanced roasted bitter end. Semi-full bodied, with a very pleasant semi-flat carbonation. Real smooth and slightly sticky. This is the best beer I’ve had from Bells, and a huge shout-out to Jeff for sending me this. (This has an insanely long and delicious aftertaste, my kind of beer)",4.4
11558,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Part of our hotel room tasting, GABF 2007. Thanks to whoever brought it (might have been cquiroga, maybe Captain Cougar; there were so many generous benefactors, and all the beers were just chillin’ in the tub, it was impossible to keep track).  Smell:  wow.  Bourbon + imitation vanilla your mom uses for baking + liquid creamy chocolate; the bourbon is so nice and fruity, not dominated by oily alcohol aromas.  Pours pitch black like normal Expedition, with crumbling oily lacing.  Super full bodied.  Taste features a creamy lactic sweetness over full rich malts of toffee, chocolate; a bitter, dry, and musty finish is full of hops, but it’s layered and variable, it keeps changing: starts earthy and dusty, then becomes coffee-ish in the rich bitterness, then settles into a weird sour hops after effect, which was weird and soured me on the beer.  To bad it was the last impression.  This is a monster, but I think I might still just prefer regular Expedition.  I’m growing tired of barrel aging.",4.2
11123,Bell's Black Note Stout,"12oz bottled December 28, 2012.  Served at cellar temperature.  Always been a huge fan of Expedition and this is one I’ve sought for many years, excited to have a chance to try it (and thanks to Bell’s for the 12oz package and distribution!)



Pours black with a two finger brown head that settles to a light swirly creamy cap and foamy ring, leaves short-lived lacing behind.



Aroma is a big blast of bourbon, rich dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee, a bit of anise, hint of smoke.  Good to very good strength.



Flavor is rich and delicious.  Quite bourbon-forward, a lot of vanilla and serious chocolate, marshmallow, roasted malts, anise, some dark fruit, little caramel, rather sweet, minimal bitterness, decent alcohol bite, but fits for the style/size.  Really good!



Mouthfeel is full bodied, very creamy, smooth, sticky, low to moderate carbonation.



Fantastic beer.  Right up there with the big boys in the style.  A real treat and worth seeking out.",4.3
11502,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Hand bottle shared by largadeer on BA - thanks a lot for this rarity, Chris!  Yes, it is awesome.  Pours pitch black with a small, frothy brown head.  Amazing aroma of bourbon, vanilla, coffee and cream, and rich chocolate. Flavor is more of the same, lots of vanilla and bourbon balanced by an awesome, thick, intense base stout with loads of chocolate, and hint of anise, and some date and raisin notes.  Incredibly creamy, smooth, and full palate with soft carbonation.  This is definitely up near the top impy stouts I’ve ever had.",4.5

10622,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Apparence : Noire, léger col brun foncé, rétention faible, petites bulles moyennement actives, fine dentelle. 

Nez : Bourbon, malt rôti, chocolat, fudge, café. 

Goût : Fut de bourbon et chocolat dominants, malt grillé, finale bien distincte des arômes de café de qualité. Tout de même sucrée, légère amertume. 

Sensation : Corps moyen, bonne longueur, touche épicée sur la langue. 

Bref : Pour moi, cette bière a deux grandes qualités. D'abord, l'équilibre des notes maltées grillées, des apports aromatiques du fut, du sucre résiduel et de l'amertume. Une belle maîtrise. Ensuite, la transition entre les notes mentionnées et une finale bien distinctive sur le café est fort intéressante. Belle complexité.

11419,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Tap at Churchkey. Pours ink with a medium tan head leaving webby reddish lace. Nose is rich buttery bourbon with tropical notes like dried pineapple and dried papaya. Toasted coconut. Let it decant to cinnamon ganache and very subtle meat/umami character. Soft booziness, coffee liquor. So many rich subtleties makes this an incredible experience. Taste is similar to normal and Rare Bourbon County Stout. Super creamy, rich coconut oil mouthfeel. Feels less sharply bitter than normal Expy. Softer and easier to love than normal Expy. Superlative soft mouthfeel. Nice bitterness comes through to cut initial sweetness. Great mouthfeel- mild heat reminds of soft bourbon aging but softness is unreal. Roasty bitterness and coffee character hints that this is not BCS but something else. Very beautiful. Complexities are easier to fall in love with than normal Expedition which can be too aggressive  and powerful at times.

Had this one on tap at O’Rourke’s in South Bend,IN...part of the Oberon kick-off celebration.

Aroma: Bourbon up front, but hints of dark chocolates, roasted malts and subtle vanilla.

Appearance: Pitch black, thin head of mocha foam...little lacing. A swirl of a half-full glass will give a nice oily coating.

Taste: Extremely balanced beer. Bourbon and licorice up front with roasted malt,  chocolate and a creamy vanilla over the middle and a warming finish containing notes of coffee. The bourbon and licorice calm a bit after it warms, only giving it more balance. You start to get the bourbon being more pronounced in the finish, very warm!

Palate: Full-bodied beer. Creamy. Low-Carbonation. Resonates on your palate. A true sipper.

Overall: Excellence. My favorite beer. I wish all beers had this much flavor and balance!",4.8

11204,Bell's Black Note Stout,"2012 Vintage

Pours nearly pitch black - into a snifter. Surprisingly there is a dark brown head that sticks around for nearly the entire 50 minute duration of enjoyment. In the glass it is black as an eighth note (sorry). Gorgeous

The aroma is incredibly enticing, bringing you in with intensity and balance. Very prominent bourbon barrel characteristics - sweet vanilla and coconut, oak, and heat. Rich dark and milk chocolate and fresh coffee nearly dominate the dark fruits lying beneath. 

Tastes just as good as it smells. Big bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and sweet dark fruits. It is not a sweet bomb of a beer, there is some dryness. 

The mouthfeel is nearly full, soft carbonation and incredibly smooth. Very drinkable, do not feel the 11.8 abv at all, just a nice soothing warmth from the bourbon. 

This is a fantastic BA stout and well worth the effort to seek out a few 12oz bottles.",4.7

Aroma is similar to zhukov, so I’m a bit nervous that this may no longer have the hunahpu characteristics.  Licorice forward, with a touch of cinnamon and spice.  The taste is where this separates itself from zhukov.  Taste is heavier on cinnamon, with small amounts of chocolate and vanilla.  Had I not known that it is aged on peppers I would have never noticed that slight burning sensation this produces in the throat long after each sip.  Nice meadium heavy body, with great subtle carbonation.  Really interesting beer that sets itself apart from the base beer with how it tastes.  Looking forward to trying this one fresh.",4.1

Cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa all come thru individually & combine to create a toasted coconut scent as well. Peppers were not so evident in the nose.  Worth acquiring just to smell this beer. Taste follows suit with the addition of the pepper heat on the tail. Mouthfeel is full and oily slick. Finishes sweet w/ just a touch of heat from the peppers. Wonderful desert impy stout.",4.6

Received this bottle from Chairmissing and I can’t thank him enough!

A: The darkest, thickest beer I’ve seen to date. Decent carbonation.

S: Coffee, chocolate and vanilla.

T: Let me start by saying I came into this beer very skeptical. I never believe the hype behind beers but this left me speechless. I let the bottle sit for about 20 minutes after taking out of the fridge, poured into a snifter. The first taste was strong chocolate and alcohol with a interesting aftertaste. As it warmed the cinnamon and chili became quite apparent. The strong chocolate hits first then some malt and to finish it off the chili hits the back of the tongue simply amzing and this is now the most complex beer I’ve ever had.

O: Can’t describe how much I love this beer. There is no way I will miss the release next year. I wouldn’t trade away the cellar to try it but if you have a friend near the brewery or someone offering you a bottle for a decent trade definitely do it.",5.0

The alcohol shows nicely in the finish, along with the background hoppy bitterness. An atypical beer for me to love, but this is REALLY well done.

24966,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"split 3 ways, poured into a tulip and two snifters. Thanks ""Suitcase Jon"" (Capra12)

Pours insanely black, void of any light. Thick tar-like syrup. liquid/melted chocolate. I have never seena beer so thick. Dark Brown milk chocolate colored foam. i think a spoon would stand up in this. plenty of thick head a couple fingers deep. It stands still long enough for me to grab my camera and line it up for a few close-ups. I know this one is gonna be good.

Aroma is heavy laiden with roasted malt and burnt toast. some espresso and pepper spice. Loads of dark havy chocolate on the end of the first nose. Espresso and alcohol after a swirl and another smell. I just can’t help but stare at this liquid tar, are there preserved dinasaurs stuck in there?

Taking my first sip. insanely thick and heavy. First is the bitter roast bounding my taste buds with hints of coffee slipping through the heavy doses of dark chocolat. rolling around through the tongue out comes spice and smoke. so much chewy thick syrup coats my entire mouth. Chocolate rides all the way across the top with alcohol and vanilla that swarm in the creamy foam that happens as it rolls through my mouth. More sips bring some tobacco and leather to accompany the slight smoke, as it warms a bit more sweetness of chocolate and caramel come out along with more peppery notes, i can’t tell if its cinamon or peppers or both. The 8 or 9 ounces that I poured myself of this were definately all I needed.

when i rolled this around in the glass the foam just clung to the glass fighting for its life and reflecting light with glittering accents like little diamonds on the very outreaches of the head.

This is truly one very unique brew. Can’t say i’ve had an imperial stout this big, thick, and heavy. truly a great one. Thanks again Suticase Jon for hooking me up with this one.

This beer could swallow any food up that you throw at it. only the richest most crazy thick triple chocolate cake with chocolate fudge layers and tons of heavy chocolate and roasted coffee sauce drizzled all over it would ever come close to matching up or cutting through this beer. If i was going to die tomorrow, I would order this beer with that cake.

Nose: thick, tar, and char. Vanilla beans, raw chilies tickle the back of my nose. Burnt black cacao and espresso sludge. Wisp of melted cream. Cinnamon is a shadowy whisper here, there, and than none at all.


Palate: for such an intensely thick pour his mouthfeel is amazingly soft, velveteen, and creamy. Immediately coats lips in burnt caramels and cinnamon and black chocolate all melted into one. Long chocolate finish, thick and fudgy please. Heat tickles sides of cheeks with essence of chili without the pain. Ashen burnt black wood in the breath. Vanilla root flirts with massive hunks of decadent fudge. Interesting conflict of creamy velvety smooth mouthfeel which at the same time sucks all moisture from said mouth. Cinnamon not as prominent as expected, though a whisper peeks through here and there, mostly lost in the chilies and the burnt fudgy vanilla rooty goodness.

24385,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"From notes. 750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. 2014 vintage. The pour is a thick dirty motor oil black with a finger of dark mocha head that fades foam ring, leaving no lace behind. The aroma is beautiful. There is a ton of cinnamon in front of a light cocoa and a lot of vanilla. The chilies don't really dominate, but offer a good peppery spiciness that is incredibly well balanced. The cinnamon comes back and is delightful. I love the smell on this. The flavor is great. Copious amounts of cinnamon up front and they ease through a nice pepper transition into a soft cocoa and vanilla, before reentering the cinnamon realm. The fact that the chilies are reserved makes this so much better. The mouth feel is thick and viscous. Great carbonation help it just cling to the mouth in a never ending film. The aftertaste is all cinnamon and subtly it moves through a good chocolate and vanilla lingering finish. Damn good.

Deep black pour with that signature Cigar City imperial stout head. Just a  ridiculous shade of neon brown. Boozy roasty aroma, robust chocolate,  fresh coffee, light iodine. Massive dark chocolate flavor, light smokiness, cocoa, and a mild vanilla bean note. The chilies are pretty subdued at this point but they still impart a bit of flavor without any heat.

I think the base beer here, Zhukov, is one of my least favorite Imperial stouts. The Hunahpu treatment is a shoe in for an amazing beer, but the base beer is just so bad that you can’t hide from it.

24673,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2013 Bottle from Hunahpu Day poured a month later in an official Hunahpu glass. Pours like thick black syrup with a late forming dark brown head.

Very little carbonation. Finishes bittersweet, keeping it far from cloying. Chiles help too. But in any case it is dessert on its own.

Got a chance to try the 2014 version from a generous sharer in line at the Swamp Head Bottle Drop.  Thanks!  Pours as before, but this years really has more cinnamon, vanilla, and chile notes than the 2013.  I noted this in the DB Huna as well.

24185,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"750mL bottled 2/26/21, drunk 11/21/22, thanks Chalameuax!
Undetermined clarity, dark mahogany with deep burgundy highlights in the light.  Medium-sized, tan head shows moderate retention.
Nose is beautiful and well-aged.  None of the unfermented sugars and syrupy fudge that so many stouts have these days.  The adjuncts are done incredibly tastefully, as well with none of it jumping out or dominating.  Dark chocolate, vanilla, moderate roast and ample sweet caramel from the malt with no alcohol, even after warming.  Everything melds together so well and it's shocking to me that this is a mere 21 months in bottle.  Drinks like it's homogenized for 5 years.
Soft, malty, rich and yet wonderfully attenuated.  Near-perfect balance giving appropriately chewy, luxurious textures with no syrupy sweetness or any fatiguing sugar on the finish.  Cinnamon spiciness helps balance and vanilla is soft and flavorful.  Nothing jumps out and this is a study in balance and finesse.  Through all that, it's still pleasingly rich and satisfying.  No alcohol whatsoever.  Pretty crazy that I never got on the Cigar City train - just missed the boat.  Glad to finally try this and I see now why Cigar City hit it big.   Hard to believe they've created this much depth, complexity and balance without barrel aging. This puts many barrel aged stouts to shame, which is impressive. 9/4/9/5/19

En bouche je fus saisi par la proéminence des épices qu’il m’avait été impossible d’anticiper en humant la bière. Le mélange d’épices et étonnant et également très complexe et homogène. J’ai décèle du chili doux, du poivre, de la cardamome et de la coriandre moulue. Il faut absolument reconnaître l’habilité avec laquelle le brasseur a su ficeler ces saveurs entre-elles.

24408,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Bottle from last year’s Hunahpu’s Day, an event organized by Cigar City to deliberately hype this beer, to the example of Three Floyds’ Dark Lord Day (it cannot be a coincidence, by the way, that the label states that ""Hunahpu was tricked by the Dark Lords of the Underworld"" - this is doubtlessly an ironic nod to Three Floyds...). Makes me very curious to find out if it is worth the hype. Opaque black colour (revealing itself to be a very dark mahogany in the end) with high degree of viscosity, under a crackling, moussy, deep brownish beige head, almost reddish brown initially, steadily receding but retaining a thin rim around the edges. Very powerful and very seductive aroma, utterly complex, refinedly sweet, roasted and subtly spiced, first almost a ’dame blanche’ of chocolate sauce made with cognac poured over home-made vanilla ice cream, coffee liqueur, marzipan, sweet dried chili peppers clearly there, burning pipe tobacco, milk chocolate bars and Belgian chocolates, vivid accent of cloves and (strongly) cinnamon rolls, kahlua, cappuccino, eucalyptus, refined bourbon-like alcohol, cashew nuts, allspice, candied dates and cherries, subtle touch of meat broth... The ’basic’ and dense malts, hops and alcohol bouquet releases ethereal, volatile and beguiling sweet spice accents whenever it feels like it. What a fascinating smell... I can sniff it for hours. I cannot wait to take a sip, and must conclude that the taste follows the aroma perfectly: the expected dense candied sweetness opens the palate and makes my mouth water, candied fruits, with an almost refreshingly minerally sourishness coming from carbonation, which may perhaps be a little bit stronger than usual for the style, but fits in perfectly here. A soft and beautiful vanilla sweetness is apparent already early on, even strongly so, but I love vanilla so this is, to say the least, a welcome surprise. Very creamy, velvety, viscous, oily mouthfeel and obviously very thick body, revealing an abyss of malts, very chocolatey, nutty and caramelly, with a strong mocha bitterness after the middle, lively and not just from roasted malts, but an actual, powdery and refined coffee beans flavour. Cinnamon comes up retronasally along with that wonderful vanilla flavour, and then the finish evolves, with a big and thick lingering malt and candy sweetness, cloying even, aided by peppery hop bitterishness and of course warming, but nonetheless very gentle, liqueur- or rhum-like alcohol; the cinnamon and coffee stick to the throat, as a mixture of sweet, bitter and umami flavours, but given the immense complexity of this beer, it is hard to tell which ingrediënt causes which aftertaste... The ancho and pasilla chili peppers, both rather mild varieties, are there, but provide just a subtle burning touch in the back of the mouth and throat, without disturbing the overall balance; I do get their earthy, smoky, sweetish, peppery flavour though, only adding further complexity. This brew is indeed hugely complex and consists of layer upon layer of flavour, absolutely divine. It takes a lot of concentration - and a large bottle - to try and grasp what is going on in this one, and this is again a reminder of what beer as a beverage is capable of. This kind of top quality beers of utmost complexity move me. Yes, this is clearly worth the hype; this is an awe-inspiring imperial stout, managing to respect all the qualities of its style and building upon them an own personality; I’m pretty sure I will recall this taste for the rest of my life. If it weren’t for the somewhat sticky, cloying effect in the back of the mouth and throat, I’d give it a perfect score, which would have made it my very best beer so far. For now: just one inch away from being perfect.  But then, considering my previous experiences with this brewery, I did have high hopes for this, admittedly.",4.8

A hint of vanilla and roast round this one out to make it quite pleasing. I like how you can easily identify each element of flavor/aroma to this beer. Pour is jet black with that dark khaki head. Stains the glass...almost permanently haha. Taste wise this one is loaded with more cinnamon and vanilla flavors. Earthiness probably from the chiles.  Lots of nice chocolate and roast. Good stuff and very well rounded. One of the beers that deserves hype.",4.4

Flavor is big on the raisin, fig, dried dark chile, brown sugar, spices, a touch of earthiness, light tobacco, pears, peach, dried cherries, and the cinnamon comes out when the beer comes up to room temperature.  The chile throws a lasting tinge of spice in the back of your throat.  There’s also a lasting sweetness and a little dryness.",4.1

Appearance :Pitch black with small dark brown head.


Aroma : Big chocolate with hot peppers. Nice vanilla too. Very rich.


Taste : Hot peppers with chocolate, some coffee. Lots of hops. Finish is long, persistent and rather sweet. Lots of chocolate and coffee. Lots of hops also. Rather bitter also.


Overall : This is one big beer. Very sweet and very rich. Bitterness helps balancing out some of the sweetness but it’s still pretty sweet. We were only two on this and I had a hard time finishing it. Very nice mix of chocolate and hot peppers both on nose and taste. Only reason why I’m not rating this higher is because it’s a bit too sweet and it gets very cloying. I’ll always be very happy to snap a few ounces at tastings but I’m never going to open a bottle with only 2-3 people.

This has to be the most aromatic beer as far as spices go, the aroma is insanely intense. It feels like a dessert buffet: gingerbread, chocolate cake, vanilla, cinnamon bun, apple turnover. Moderate (well balanced) habanero notes to up these dessert spices even more (aroma and taste). Taste is very sweet (a little cloying) and the apple brandy barrels has a very nice presence. Palate is rather light for such a big beer. I’m not sure I enjoyed it that much but it was definitly an experience, even compared to the other very decadent versions I’ve had.",4.3

6012,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle: Huge thanks to Travis & Tommy for splitting this with me. Black, black, black & oily as fuck, topped with a velvety, fine mocha cream that lasts exceedingly long for a stout. This beer is a bowl Cinnamon Toast Crunch & Teddy Grahams covered in vanilla drizzle, fudge, & sweet Apple Brandy sauce. Chocolate, roast, sweet brandy, vanilla, cinnamon, mild coffee, graham cracker.... Only thing I don’t get is the chili peppers, I’m guessing the barrels have swallowed them whole. I don’t mind, though, because they might interfere with the decadence of this brew. Thick, chewy, creamy; this is a very big beer on the palate. A dessert beer to the max, fantastic all around.



Update: After having this quite a few more times thanks to many generous BA’s, as well as some local tasting groups, I have to bump the score up. This just gets better & better. Molten  Chips Ahoy & Teddy Graham cookies with cinnamon graham cracker, apple brandy, vanilla bean chips & dark fudge drizzle. This is truly an excellent beer.",4.6

Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, berries, vanilla, cinnamon, soy, and marshmallow. Tastes just as incredible as the aroma. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, chocolate syrup, cinnamon, light smokey peppers, and a hint of dried dark fruit. Perfect mouthfeel as well. Very low carbonation makes this extremely smooth and allows the huge flavors to stand out. I’ve had a couple days to think about this beer and I’m convinced it’s the best beer I’ve ever had.

Aroma of chocolate roast, dark fruit, apple, pepper, vanilla, and hints of breadiness. Really intoxicating. A sweet chocolate taste with notes of chili, vanilla, and slight cinnamon. A nice layer of heat from the pepper. Wow. It really is hard to say whether this or the base version is better. So much complexity. So much happening during the first 3 seconds on the tongue. Just another amazing brew that I likely will never be fortunate to drink again. Kudos to Redner and a big thanks to Damico.",4.9

Beautiful chocolate that lasts and lasts, coating the mouth with so much chocolate. Chili peppers and metal. Very sweet, but the peppery finish stops it just short of being cloying.

Solid inky black color with a creamy dark mocha head that slowly dissipates to wisps on top. My God that aroma is heavenly!

The flavor is rich chocolate spiced cake with hints of rum and molasses. The alcohol shows a bit of warming but is never harsh. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a slick syrupy sticky mouthfeel. Damn that is a great beer! Even the non beer geeks I shared this with enjoyed it.

Imperial Stout With Cacao & Spices Added. 50% Aged In Rum Barrels, 50% Aged In Apple Brandy Barrels.

Alkohol: 11% obj.

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy rozwścieczonego boga ognia Hun-Hunaphu

Piana: Beżowa, skromna o drobno ziarnistej strukturze. 
Głośno syczy i opada do niewielkiego paseczka. Na krawędziach TeKu pozostają punktowe plamki. 

Zapach: Jest miazga! Aromat rozpieprza na maksa. Na początek rum i rodzynki macerowane w tym szlachetnym trunku. Potem cała gamma suszonych owoców, kandyzowane jabłka, śliwki, morele i winogrona.
Zaraz po tym potworny cios prosto w twarz od ziaren kakaowca, gęstej mlecznej czekolady i belgijskich pralin. 
Knock out zapewnia szereg elementów toffi, kawy, rodzynek, cukru trzcinowego i przypraw korzennych.
Przepiękny bukiet!

Smak: Niewiarygodny beczkowy profil. Euforię smaków rozpoczyna szlachetny rum o jego mocnym i bezkompromisowym smaku, pełnym przypaw korzennych i drewna. Następnie wkracza z wielką werwą beczka po jabłkowej Brandy (czyli jak domniemam po Calvadosie) nadając trunkowi posmak pieczonej szarlotki.
Kolejne warstwy bukietu smaków to lawina czekolady, toffi, pralin belgijskich, trzciny cukrowej, drewna, rodzynek i toffi.
Ostatnia prosta należy z całą pewnością do przypraw z których najbardziej wyróżnia się chilli, stawiając kropeczkę nad „i”, poszczypując w gardle. 
Alkohol jest obecny, rozgrzewa, trochę mąci w głowie, ale na szczęście nie ma ciepłego, rozpuszczalnikowego charakteru i nie wychodzi przed szereg.
Ciała Double Barrel Hunaphu’s nie brakuje.
Dostojny, szlachetny charakter trunku zapewni wiele minut udanej, owocnej degustacji.

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

Nareszcie!! Hunahpu’s (kilka roczników) - NIE! Bourbon Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s - NIE!
I dopiero Double Barrel Hunahpu’s - zdecydowanie TAK! 

Przecudowne piweczko dające tyle radości i satysfakcji z degustacji!
Głęboki profil smakowy i zapachowy, oszałamiające beczki po Rumie i Calvadosie.
Balans, głębia, różnorodność, klasa i szyk.

Najlepsze piwo w dorobku Cigar City Brewing!

Pours completely, oily black with a thin tan head that slowly recedes to bubbly lace. The nose is very rich, with tons of Mexican hot chocolate, vanilla, really great molasses rum, a really nice dose of maple and brown sugar, and just a bit of tingling burn on my nostrils. The flavor is rich milk and dark chocolate up front, a bit less cinnamon than on the nose, but just enough, moving to more molasses rum, vanilla, brown sugar, and a nice hint of spicy chili pepper that has a nice burn from my throat to my belly. The body is very full and creamy with light, but just enough carbonation, and a very long oaky chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy finish.

Pours viscous motor oil black with a small fizzy dark mocha head that quickly dissipates while leaving a small spotty trace on the glass. Smell is sweet and malty with roasted malts, caramel, dense dark chocolate cake, dark roast coffee, smoked chili, charred wood, raisins in rum, caramelized apples, alcohol and ketjap manis. Taste is heavy sweet, salty, tiny bitter and malty with roasted malts, caramelized apples, toffee, ketjap manis, cocoa nibs, figs, raisins in rum, minerals and hints of cinnamon. mouthfeel is round, viscous, sticky sweet, slightly boozy and full bodied. Finish is sweet, tiny salty, tiny bitter and malty with roasted malts, caramel, toffee, cocoa nibs, cinnamon, smoked chilis, figs, raisins in rum, hay, minerals and hints of ketjap manis. Over the top sweet and sticky. There is a good beer here that comes out in the far finish but the initial sweetness smacks your senses unconscious and ruins the experience. Good but inferior to regular the regular 2012 vintage Hunahpu we tried during the summer of 2012…

We did some 50/50 blends with this and California Brandy Hunahpu later on in the tasting which was very very tasty. Just add some more bitterness and some less knock out sweetness to this beer and it’s truly as great as its weighted average indicates.",4.0

6055,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Thanks DmouthCaliBrewz for sharing this bottle with me. Split 4 ways (more than enough I should add) at about 55 Degrees F in snifters.



A - Pitch black, 1 finger head that fades fast. Great legs, some minor particles on the swish. Looks eerily similar to straight up regular Hunahphu. 



S - Nose WHOA. this is a different beast than it’s little brother. Maple, cupcake, vanilla, rocky road ice cream, the brandy sweetness definitely comes in like it’s 4th of July.



T - Again, shines even deeper. I would guess this is way higher than 14% ABV. Wedding Cake, brownie batter, pepper only at middle to end and doesn’t linger. the spice is in no way hanging on for dear life. You get this bright maple waffles and chocolate cupcake like this is all dessert and should pair really well with NOTHING. drink it straight up after eating a steak dinner. you’ve deserved it!



M - Thick, velvetty, sweet and smooth. 



O - Great beer! I love it. Would get more if I could.",4.1
5820,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Thick. Most notable flavor is cinnamon, bit of chili pepper skin, and maybe a hint of twang from the AB barrels.

All the same complexity as the aroma, even with a bit of saltiness in the taste. The Chili tickles like a feather of ""oh, fuck"", right on the edge of the tongue in the after taste. Wonderful.

Wow, fabulous aroma, both barrels shine, the brandy moreso, vanilla and cinnamon abound, especially the vanilla, which mingles in a way with the roasted malts and spice, barrels, etc. to remind me very specifically of roasted marshmallows and s’mores, whoa. Even better flavor, amazing. This was practically made for me. Vanilla, cinnamon, roasted malts, peppers, wood, the barrels, all combining again to hit me as roasted marshmallows/s’mores.

5982,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"> A total overhaul of Hunahpu creates Perennial BA Abraxas


[ Bottle ][ vacax ][ 750ml ][ 10K+OT Tasting ][ Stemless Wine Taster ][ 5/3/14 ]

>> Thanks Jake for this one! Pours ink like other Hunahpu’s with layer of weak, read foam. Stains the glass. Nose on this one is instantly the best of any Hunahpu variant: guajillo pepper, cinnamon, ancho chili, vanilla, graham cracker, rum raisin, dry rubbed skirt steak. Taste is also instantly the best of any Hunahpu by a long shot, in fact, this beer is so much better than previous Hunahpu’s that it is clear this is a complete recipe overhaul to transform this beer from an ashy, sour, thin mess to something 99% identical to Perennial Abraxas. Gone is that extreme sourness from over mashed black patent malt. Now there is rich, melted sea salted dark chocolate, assertive chili pepper deep heat from ancho chilis. Previous Hunahpu’s had near a smidgen of chili heat. Palate is rich and viscous instead of ashy and watery. This is a major overhaul and easily the best Hunahpu out there. Now the question is, why is this rated so much higher than BA Abraxas? I’ll give you one guess.


>!< what if CCB and another brewery made an identical beer? Would they be rated the same?",4.5

The barrels come through and the base beer is still there and it all comes together in one big, gigantic, complex drink. Still a little hot and I bet that chills out over the next year or so. Would love to try this again around that time to see how it is doing. Otherwise you get some sweet brandy and sugary rum up front. A little bit of vanilla as well. The spice comes through late in the palate from the Hunahpu base. Extra points here for complexity and bravado.",4.3
5910,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Many bottles, many times.



Pours dark chocolate/black, tan-colored head, thin right, wisps. Nose is sweet milk chocolate, smooth booze, oak, rich & creamy, maybe a trace of chilies. Flavor is similar to the nose, which is excellent. Chocolate, smooth booze, oak, cream, molasses, caramel. One of the best Hunahpu’s variants ever made and right up there with fresh Apple Brandy. Body is full, light perfect carbonation, creamy rich finish.



Overall, an excellent barrel-aged imperial stout...get this if you can!",4.3

Big rich dark chocolate, huge spice - vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon - brandy, sweet roasted toffee, oak, and coffee. Taste is again thick and rich dark cocoa, balanced by sweet vanilla, roast, and spice. Amazingly complex - with cinnamon and spice, light chili peppers, fudge brownies, espresso, and wood. Luscious, velvety mouthfeel with soft carbonation. No real heat from the peppers except on the back-end, that rounds it out beautifully. Every time I have Hunahpu or one of its variations I’m completely blown away and this beer is no exception. Delicious chocolate spice cake.",4.6

There is some pretty noticable coffee and coconut in here too. It’s really rich this one. The mouthfeel is thick but manageable. The flavour is insane too.

Full bodied and it stimulate all of your taste buds. Medium carbonation that is pefect to open the flavors. Spicy finish.

Tasting Notes

Aroma: Doughy, fruity, hint of vinegar and honey.

Appearance: Cloudy gold color.

Flavor: This is a truly complex beer.  Everything is so subtle and well-blended.  Amazing flavor that is very difficult to describe.  Light caramel and honey sweetness, bread, sour apples and some vinegar, hint of wood complexity. 

Palate: Medium-full body.  Creamy and milky texture.

Overall: Spectacular beer.  I really wish I could get my hands on a bottle of stuff!  It is so intense and complex and would be prefect to sit and enjoy for hours!",4.4

Taste raisins, and rum raisin ice cream, sherry, port, madeira and a whole host of other fortified, vinous wines, rum soaked bred, wine barrels. There is a bit of oxidation, but it is light and pleasant. Some musty notes. Long duration. Warming with light bubbles and an awesome vinous finish. Very pleasant indeed!",4.2

Honey, icing from an oreo ice cream cake, spicy relleno and pear/apricot jellies. Also lingering tastes of bread, anise, molasses, candy sugar. Sourness is as pleasant as I’ve found in an aged Belgian. Finish is absolutely monstrous, ten miles long, holding my palate hostage without a ransom in sight.

14114,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"This is one of the few beers that I've seeked out that delivered more than I was expecting. The odd thing is that my reason for not expecitng more from this beer was that I had had the regular Stille Nacht and wasn't impressed. This, on the other hand, is AMAZING. The color is a nice apple cider and amber with good clarity. Likely the age fo the beer had allowed the yeast to really stick to the bottom because it never got cloudy even toward the end.  Nice glow. Aroma: Some spice, cotton candy, cider vinegar, alcohol. I know I mention the vinegar, but it doesn't show up in the flavor and is only a small part at the very end of the aroma. It actually adds to the quality of the aroma instead of detracting. The flavor is nicely malty, toffee and caramel. Very fruity like cherries and apples. Underneath you can actually taste the wood of the cask. Slightly winey. I'd put it easily in my top five. The guy I split the bottle with agreed. If I could find cases of this, I'd buy them.

This beer, each time I enjoy it, produces another one of those magical beer moments where it’s almost impossible to pick up the pen to write any notes.  The first two times I’ve had it, I didn’t even bother, this time I knocked off at least something to make it official...This beer is a 30 year old wood aged port in disguise.  In fact, nothing from Bordeaux has ever come close to what De Dolle managed to extract from this wood.  Honey colored and wonderfully viscous with an unfortunately sudsy, sort of soapy head, but at least it still shows some carbonation despite its age and size.  Color and clarity are gorgeous.  The body is pure silk.  Forget every other time I said a brew had a velvet or silken palate.  I was an idiot.  This brew glides on Apollo’s wings across the palate, pure love.  The flavor embodies all that is ancient wooded port, hints of sherry, dry spices.  It’s a Christmas vigil with the fireworks of the 4th of July.  It’s sweet, savory, and deep, while its still making a sweet case for attention.  Hell, it’s too good to deal with the pen in my hands; it takes two hands to control this snifter.",5.0
13942,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Well, here we are then: one of the biggest whales from Belgium, the legendary start of Dolle's Special Reserva editions and therefore the very first beer in Belgium to have been deliberately aged on wooden casks which previously contained another beverage, red Bordeaux wine in this case. The pioneering role of Dolle Brouwers cannot be underestimated, in being the first non-family-owned craft brewery in Belgium (around 1980, the same time as the beginnings of Abbaye des Rocs' brewing activities); then in 2000, this Special Reserva series, which is continued to this day and has been applied not only to Stille Nacht but also to Oerbier and on one occasion to Dulle Teve (of which a new one is in the process of preproduction now), marks the beginning, at least in Belgium, of what is now common practice among craft breweries around the world. The brewer, Kris, was generous enough to offer us a vertical tasting of all Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions yesterday and needless to say, I cannot thank him enough for his kind generosity - I did have a few Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions before, but never this legend, the ultimate one, a whale I never thought I would ever be able to taste. Carefully opened by Kris himself, the 17 year-old 75 cl bottle, with rusty crown cap and charmingly moldy and partially disintegrated label, did effectively - and contrary to my expectations - produce a minimal head upon pouring, in the form of a thin ring of eggshell-white, loosely knit bubbles, which expectedly disappeared shortly thereafter; the beer itself was of a most beautiful and intense, almost glowing orange-amber colour with a molten copper-like hue, clear initially but hazy with sediment near the finishing of the bottle. A milky cloud of dead yeast and proteins appeared only in the very end. The aroma was of an unbelievable complexity, depth and beauty - I cannot recall ever having sniffed any barleywine (because that is basically, though perhaps unintentionally, what were are talking about here) that comes close to this: gooseberry jam, candied orange peel and marmelade, beguiling vanilla-ish wet oak wood, sweet white dessert wine, honey liqueur, armagnac, matured sweet sherry, old cider, amaretto, marzipan, fresh fig juice, moist raisin bread and, as a sign of its respectable age, hints of wet cardboard and damp cellar, only adding charm, maturity and complexity. The onset was sweet, lush and almost 'praline'-like, hinting at candied figs, sugared fried apples and sweet raspberry jam, drenched in an orangey marmelade sauce with a light sourish sherry hint, that stretches towards the finish where it becomes more outspoken - though a kaleidoscopic, utterly refined and ravishingly beautiful candied sweetness remains the main flavour. Carbonation is evidently very soft (but not at all flat!), resulting in a thick, very vinous, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Thick layers of caramelly and slightly cookie-like malt sweetness with honey and marmelade sweetness on top blend with an unbelievably deep and rich finish, where sweet dessert wine flavours (rather than actual Bordeaux, strangely) are added, tannic woodiness renders a gently drying effect and very sherry-like oxidation, of the noblest kind I may ever have encountered in any vintage beer, establishes a deeply elegant and luscious maturity. Vanilla-, marmelade-, marzipan- and cognac-like impressions make this almost like a liquid crêpe Suzette - with yeasty breadiness added in the very end, soaked in brandy-like alcohol warmth. This is, along with some of the greatest lambics, the most impressive Belgian beer I ever tasted - I feel humbled by this, and not just because of its legendary status in the craft beer world. It is hard to describe, even for me, how beautiful, opulent, deep and aristocratic this beer is; this is without any doubt at the very top of what beer can do in a gastronomical sense, so I cannot but give this the perfect score - if this doesn't deserve that, then I don't know what does. What makes it all the more remarkable, is that it has remained in such mint condition after seventeen years - this only adds to the fact that this product was made and cared for with utmost knowledge, skill and experience. My deepest gratitude goes out to Kris, not only for being so immensely generous to offer this and other bottles for our tasting session, but for giving a beer as utterly beautiful as this to the world. A whole string of young craft breweries today, in Belgium but also on an international level, can and should learn from this. A day to never forget!",5.0

Maple frosting. Flavor is a nice, fully synergized fusion of caramel, purple grape juice, overripe apricot, sweet red Napa zinfandel. Nice gooey viscosity.

14022,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,This generously provided bottled brew from Mike Sprinkle on Dark Lord Day poured a head of frothy fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a hazy uncarbonated orange brown colored body. The strong aroma was spicy and malt hop. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish. The complex yummy flavor contained notes of mild spice and malt hop.

Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery (almost syrupy) texture, soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Nice stuff, and thankfully has more to balance the sweetness than the recent standard Stille Nachts I've had (though I've heard rumors in the underworld that we will see it return to the slightly more sour style of years ago, like this Reserva is).  This is almost like a blend of Scotch whisky or cognac and beer, with an enormous bucket full of raisins mixed in. Unusual beer to say the least, and somewhat difficult to rate.  Not my favorite from the brewery, but very good.",4.0

Pours a dark brown with a fine lasting head. The glass is exploding with light chocolate and dried figs, dates and raisins. Loads of oriental spices and vanilla. In fact this beer is a liquid version of an English Christmas Cake. The mouthfeel is one of an extremely fullbodied beer with a lot of sweetness that is yet perfectly balanced by the afterburn of alcohol. This is an exceptional beer!!!! No doubt one of the 1-2 best beers I’ve ever had, which is why I managed to taste it 4 times during the festival with consistent tasting notes.

Minimal lacing on disappearing head. Woah that nose! This has to be one of the best smells ever. Extremely vinous and potent. The Bordeaux wood really comes through, basking its glory into an already capable beer. I’ll sound like I’m just enumerating, but this is an equilibrium, trust me, everything at the right place and everything does include a lot of things! Sharp cookie dough flavours, cinnamon powder, vanilla, maple, barley sugar, bananas, oranges, pancakes, nutmeg, pears, nuts.. lots and lots of flavours. Complexity layer over complexity layer. It somehow manages to remain diplomatic, begs to be sipped while forcing you to take your time through pure transcendence and force. WOAH! Yeast overload in mouth, this is more than doughy, it’s a pure French toast. Vinous dates, sweet desserty liquor, a big liquid cake. I’ve no idea how so many flavours can be balanced, no idea. It’s almost a case of name as many flavours as you can and have fun finding them in here. Magnetic sheer polar extremes. Velvet mouthfeel, silky full body, soft carbonation, venerable in that aspect. Evolving flavors, complex, elegant, what more do you want? Decadent stuff. If a beer has ever lived up to the hype, this is it, I’d dare even find it underrated as a matter of fact ;-) That this was possibly not the best bottle of this tasting I consider as the best I’ve been part of is an indication of how good my dreams will be in the next few days.",4.8

Full mouthfeel: similar honey-like sweetness and viscosity that one would expect from the stille nacht, but coupled with lightly tannic red fruits, incredibly complex yeastiness, chewy caramel, and viscous Belgian sugars; this bottle seems to have held up beautifully (thanks to great cellaring, evidently, and large pours); there’s nothing thin about this beer, nothing close to watery or relaxed concentration; I could sip this for effectively forever, and I just might.

14020,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Huge thanks to hopdog for the bottle, Rating #2000!!  Poured clear, fiery medium orange initially (progressively more hazy with subsequent pours).. loose dusting and larger bubbles of off-white head around the edges. 

 The aroma was just exquisite.. definitely a solid dose of Bordeaux influence over a sweet, supple base.. the underlying beer mellowed out considerably, leaving sweet caramel, toffee, and a delicate bouquet of light fruits (peaches, apricots, and some vinous influence).. deeper oak and Bordeaux undertones as well.. almost a sweet bourbon in there too. 

 The flavor begain with an array of sweet lighter fruits, sour oak, and grape skins, followed by warm caramel and toffee on the middle (accented by warm clove and other Christmas-ey spices).. warm back-end with a touch of oak and a bunch more vinous.. very long, warm, sweet and complex finish. 

 Warm and entirely fulfilling on the palate with great balance between sweet fruits, sour barrel influence and grapes, and alcohol warmth.  This was entirely what I needed.  Thank you Steve!!",4.6
14016,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,What a freaking amazing beer.  I found it even more crazy that i purchased it at a bar for $15.  They claimed the single bottle had been sitting in the cellar untouched for years.  What an amazing use of bordeaux casks which imparted a very nice subdued flavor.  Where is the 12%?  It drank like 7 or 8%.  This is probably the best belgian beer i’ve ever had.,4.8

14156,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottled, 2000 version.

Pours thick and deep amber with no head. The aroma is heavenly and arousing. It strikes like a fina muscat wine, there's notes of wood and cherry and so much else I couldn't keep track on. As it warms it becomes more port like and developed peppery notes. There is loads of malt to balance it, and the body is firm and dense and with tremendous depth. It is sweet, sure, but never strikes me as syrupy or sticky just perfectly balanced. The finish is velvetty and oaky. This is as close to perfection as it goes, and this is arguably the best beer I've ever sampled.",4.9

13963,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"10th September 2011
Cloudy orange - brown beer. Decent sized white head. Nose reminds me very much of a Vintage Port cork that has just been pulled. Palate is soft and semi dry and quite well carbonated. Mild caramel malt backbone, tasting slightly aged. Riding over all this are rich wine notes. Red wine with strawberry and then later on blackberry and blackcurrant. Agitating the beer produces some lactose on the nose. Aniseed becomes more obvious. There is a surprising amount of carbonation here and much agitation is required to remove it! The finish is dry and woody. This is the most Port like beer I’ve ever had. Even the Port barrel beers have not been this porty. If you look at recent ratings people are saying this is past it’s best. Who knows but judging it on it’s own merit it’s still quite remarkable it it’s uniqueness and rich flavour. The alcohol is still quite robust. The most surprising thing about this is that De Dolle have never redone this. 2013 postscript - they must have read my mind! 

15th January 2016
That’ll be me 20K then @ ChrisO’s. Almost clear orange beer, small cream colour head. Light palate, decent fine carbonation. Lovely Port Wine flavours with vibrant crystallised fruits.

14057,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Produced in 2000, Stille Natch Reserva is a very special, limited addition of De Dolle’s seasonal Christmas brew, Stille Nacht or ""Silent Night."" Stille Natch is a very special beer to begin with, but De Dolle really out did themselves when they decided to do Reserva. Stille Nacht is brewed with with pale malts, white candy sugar, is hopped, and then dry hopped with Nugget hop varieties, and comes in at a warming 9-10% abv. De Dolle boils this beer for 5 hours, making it a very high gravity brew. It is then bottle conditioned, and will continue to develop in the bottle. 

Any vintage of Stille Nacht is a true gift to any beer lover, but a 750ml corked bottle of the Reserva is truly a Christmas treasure. Reserva takes it to a whole new realm. Reserva was produced in 2000, and was aged for 18 months in Bordeaux wine barrels before being bottled. This age in the wine barrels, gives an already incredible beer a level of complexity, flavor, and character, that is in a class by itself. Reserva comes in at a warming 12% abv, making a very potent beer as well. 


Stille Nacht Reserva pours to a beautiful, hazy, deep golden color with a thick and creamy pillow of a head, and a lively and vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is incredibly complex and aromatic with big robust aromas just bursting in the air. Aromas of sweet malt, oak, candy sugar, deep vinous notes, spicy hops, and peppery alcohol flood the nose. The plate on this beer is rich and full, yet at the same time, has a nice bit of acidity, that dances on the tongue. Big, robust flavors of sweet malt, light caramel, oak, pepper, black berry, and vinous flavors, coat the tongue and glide down the palate. It is almost too much of a good thing, as your taste buds will be on bliss over load. Reserva finishes with more complex flavors up front, then ends with very vinous, acidic, and peppery flavors that linger on the tongue for quite sometime. 

In a word, this beer is stunning. This beer was one of the most enjoyable beers I have drank, ever. The age in the Bordeaux barrels really give this beer a whole new dimension. The vinous qualities of this beer combined with the fantasic malty overtones and warming alcohol makes this one of the most delicous beers ever produced in my opinion.",5.0

Pourd a medium amber color with a small sized off white head. Quite a vinous and complex aroma. Red wine giving way to grapes, light yeast, vanilla, wood, plums, and raisins. I could smell this one all night. Tastes of red wine, grape skins, brown sugar, vanilla, light wood, dark fruits, and I was getting a light cookie doughiness. Vinous all the way around.

13519,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"REVIEW #1000!  Beer has officially taken over my life!  Growler generously shared by largadeer on BA &#40thanks, Chris!&#41. I was really looking forward to trying this beer and annoyed him about it at every possible opportunity. Growler did leak in transit and lose a substantial amount of beer, so the packaging materials were lucky enough to sample quite a bit of this rare brew.  Fortunately the beer was still great, even if a little flat.  I knew from the start this was right up my alley since I love imperial stouts, coffee, and maple syrup. I could probably take almost anyone in a Super Troopers style syrup bottle chug.  Pours black and viscous with the tiniest bit of brown foam when agitated. Clung to the side of the glass when swirled.  Aroma is coffee, roast, maple syrup, and a tiny bit of alcohol. Very inviting.  As for flavor, I’ve heard you can drop a tablespoon of maple syrup into a Breakfast Stout and approximate this beer pretty closely closely. CBS is a little fuller-bodied and more viscous, but as far as taste goes, that is a very good approximation. Flavor is lots of bitter coffee that is very reminiscent of regular Breakfast Stout, roasted malt, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, and a faint hint of oak. Alcohol is detectable but very well-hidden. This beer is really well-rounded and succeeds in balancing the sweetness from the syrup and malt with the coffee bitterness.  Because of the shipping mishaps, the amount of carbonation was somewhere between really, really, ridiculously low and Angels Share - i.e. it was damn near flat. Surprisingly, that didn’t matter much. Call me crazy, but I like it when a syrup beer has a syrup-like mouthfeel. That’s exactly how this was. CBS is smooth and viscous on the way down and lingers on the palate afterwards.  This is incredibly drinkable for an imperial stout. The second I put the glass down, I was thinking about my next sip. It just keeps you wanting that mapley, coffeey &#40not even close to being a word, I know&#41 goodness and almost makes you cry when it’s gone and you know you’ll probably never try this again.  Founders, I can’t stress this enough, please brew this beer again. If I could have a keg of this stuff delivered to my apartment once a month, I would be a very happy, drunk, and fat person.
UPDATE 9/19/09: largadeer got a new growler that was perfectly hermetically sealed, and it was PHENOMENAL.  Huge lasting tan head with great retention and lacing.  Flavor is just incredibly complex with a lot &#40but not too much&#41 of maple syrup.  Nice lively mouthfeel.  This destroyed both KBS and regular BS in a side-by-side.  This is one of the best beers I’ve ever had.",4.7

The maple really comes out to shine in the taste, balancing out the roasted malt and coffee for an absolutely sublime drinking experience.  It’s not too sweet, it’s not too bitter, it’s just fantastic.  Having Don Cherry on the tap was like an added bonus - A+ for Founders.",4.6
13453,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"On-tap at the brewpub, it’s an unbelievably powerful aroma of maple that courses through this beer, unfortunately to the detraction of pretty much all other beer-like smells.  It’s not a terrible offense, but if the maple was turned down a bit this would be a 5/5.  The mouthfeel is perfectly smooth, full-bodied, and balanced.  The flavors in my glass were tasty in their little bits, with some cocoa, coffee, and deep roasted malt shining through in brief glimmers, but the sweet maple subdues these flavors in a way that disrupts the beer’s balance.",4.1

13520,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Enjoyed via draft in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a jet black with a slight tan head that is nicely retained for several minutes.  The nose brings a very strong character of coffee grounds, along with some roasted and crystal malts.  The latter becomes more prevalent as the sample warms.  Nicely complex.  The palate is smooth, especially for an imperial stout.  Coffee flavors come through, along with a nice caramel character toward the mid- to end of the palate.  Especially pleasing is a distinct lack of hop bitterness, which often only seems to make the roasted malt character too strong.  A relatively obvious alcohol character also begins to come through as I work through the beer.  Overall, good but not the life-changing beer that some have noted.",3.7

On draught at Pour House Tampa, deep dark snifter full pour of darkness with khaki head. Nose is rich and full, plenty of caramel an booze, bourbon sweetness, smooth malt. Flavor is loads of caramel and rch dark malts wit bourbon and a lingering dark chocolate... Still loads of dark chocolate lingering after a minute. It’s really well made and enjoyable. The maple is there with every sip and as I pay attention, there’s more maple. It’s really that amazing.

13106,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Reviewed 9-1-10.

I had this one on tap 2-3 weeks ago over at Churchkey. At the time, I liked it, but still thought the KBS was better. However, after thinking about it and in retrospect, I was out with friends, spent most of my time and energy enjoying their company, and wasn’t able to give this brew my full attention. Fast forward a couple of weeks.... I was out beer shopping in downtown DC and came upon a great bookstore and tap house I had always heard great things about, but had never experienced - Kramerbooks. I went inside and the bartender handed me a draft menu and low and behold.... there it was!

Ap: Very dark, pitch black even, with a great deal of carbonation for a beer this style. It poured with about an inch worth of head. This one’s a beauty!

Ar: Maple and coffee (just like the name dictates), with hints of chocolate and caramel. It had a very candy-like sweetness, as apposed to a brown sugar-type one.

T: Founders BS with maple sweetness. How to describe this best .... Hmmm...Caramelized, coffee and maple infused, dark chocolate cotton candy, melted into liquid form and slightly chilled. Simply amazing!

P: Surprisingly creamy and smooth. Some of the coffee ground notes I found offensive in the BS are now muted, and the high grade maple prevails.

O: This beer is pure ""man candy."" No need for syrup, I think I’ll just pour this over my waffle!",4.8

Very intense yet balanced. Ends on a fantastic chocolatey roasted and slightly bitter note with dry coffe and a fine spirit kind of heat alongside a fat creamy maple syrup character that seem to wash the heat off while providing a deep sweet drinking experience.

Flavors a very sweet oak, wood, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, alcohol in the nose only, maple sugar note is there but hard to find. Very sweet overall. So based on the overall rating, I would say this is a great imperial stout, however, not as good overall as the rating overall suggest. This is a great beer to age and I will age a bottle for a year or more and make a note here on the changes and if it taste better. I have had better imperial stouts than this. By better I mean more complex and more balanced. Struise imperials remain as some of my favorite imp stouts all time.",4.1

13277,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Poured from a 750ml bottle.  Beer is a dark black with tan head.  The maple is prominent in intial aroma.  Flavors evolve as beer warms up. More chocolate and coffee (and booze) in the beginning and more  maple and less booze as your drink.

12647,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"CBS vertical tasting @ Tim's. The most anticipated highlight of the evening, thank you TimE for sharing! First one is 2011 version. Pours dark brown, light beige foam. Nose has spices, chocolate and some maple syrup with booze and vanilla. Toasty, some tobacco, deep chocolate. Light chilli heat, sweet but not too sweet or cloying. Taste has dark bitter chocolate, bitter booze, really intense still, flavours intact, tasting like KBS on steroids. Still dry finish, chocolaty, light maple booze. Worth the hype, nothing short of amazing. We move forward to 2017 version. Well, you can recognise its still the same beer. Thats about it, fresh version has more maple, its sweeter and all characteristics are not as chiseled compared with this original 7 year old sample. So rating based on the 2011 version, 2017 is still amazing but should probably be aged a bit more.",4.7
13295,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Bottle, this beer had a black-brown pour and made a tan colored head,  

the aromas were roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, with faint bourbon and a little syrup in the background, 

flavors were roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, syrup, caramel with syrup and brown sugar sweetness, 
roasted malt bitterness, there was a little alcohol warmth but it was dim on the palate, 

this Impy had a pretty full mouth feel and felt nice on the tongue, 

I thought the syrup, bourbon and roasted malt went well together, 
a very nice sipping beer.",4.4

28895,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"From the tap in a snifter.  Maybe I was expecting more or maybe it is because I do not like bourbon, but I was a little disappointed in this brew.  Almost no head by the time it got to me.  Dark as night.  Bourbon flavor pushed aside all other flavors.  Nice drink and I would recommend to everyone, but I would prefer other beers at the brewery to this drink.",3.7
27884,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Fresh from bottle (2013): Black pour with brown head. great aroma with coffee at the front with chocolate (a mocah really) and bourbon behind it. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I’d like. Coffee flavors up front, with bourbon and chocolate undertones. Great bitter/sweet balance, but I think Eclipse might beat this beer in a fresh head-to-head. Better taste than the ’11 I had aged 1.5 years, but less body. Same score as last time for different reasons. Have a feeling that 9 months to 1 year is the sweet spot on this beer.

Old score and writeup: Gave it a 4.6 Had 2011 on draft (1.5 years old). Overall a very pleasing and complex beer, though it didn’t age age as well as I’d think. Definitely one of the better stouts up there, though I’d rank bourbon county and Avery stouts above it.",4.6
27921,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"My 1000th rating, care of Mr Paul Unwin. I was a bit hesitant about going for the KBS. Was not a fan of Bourbon County Stout. Opened this and looked into the neck of the bottle to see the swirling smokey aroma released. One sniff and it was pure dark chocolate. A very good start. Next sniff and there’s a strong whiff of bourbon whiskey barrel. That grainy smokey sweetness. Hope it’s not going to overwhelm the flavours. So, smokey oak barrel, bourbon whiskey, dark chocolate, expresso coffee, spice, minerally. Colour is opaque black, thin tan head. There’s some carbonation bubbles in there but not too much. Taste is a surprise. Really well balanced. Big hit of dark chocolate, black coffee and some sweet bourbon whiskey, but it’s not overwhelming. There’s some carbonation, which tingles with the bourbon flavour, but as it goes down it’s smooth dark choc and black coffee. Perfect balance. Watching Danny Boyle’s Olympics Opening Ceremony. Perfect night.",4.3

The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, oily/creamy, lightly sticky texture, lively carbonation, long finish with moderate bitterness, moderately alcoholic.

It’s a beautiful looking beer, pitch black, basically no head retention, thick and oily. Ok so at first this thing smelled like oxidized and burnt coffee and tasted pretty oxidized too and I can’t verify how old my bottle was. I was honestly pretty turned off by it at first. Burnt, stale, bitter coffee, old wood, cereal grains and cocoa powder. As it warmed up however, I started to enjoy it more- deeper chocolate notes, vanilla cream, not a lot of heat on it anymore. The coffee warms up very nicely too as this beer opened up. Very glad I got to try this and I want to try another again, maybe fresher. Best imperial Stout? No. Second best? No. Overrated? Yes.",4.0

26214,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"I reviewed the 2018 edition originally, but now that the 2019 edition is released, I am updating this review. The packs I bought were bottled just 10 days ago and ran me $28 each 4 pack. The taste this year is extremely well-rounded; I’m not sure if it’s due to it being so fresh or not, so perhaps the coffee will fade overtime and the bourbon and oak will be more pronounced. I’m laying down an entire 4 pack to cellar so I can see how the beer evolves overtime. The appearance is as usual, very dark but not motor oil. Got about a finger of head on an aggressive pour into the KBS snifter from last year (nicer than last years’ in my opinion). The smell is quite wonderful, bittersweet chocolate, lots of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and of course rich roasted malt. The barrel profile comes out more as this beer warms up. Mouthfeel is light but not thin. Very well-balanced for a beer of this ABV. The remaining test is to see how this beer ages. This is world class beer for sure.",4.7

Taste is similar to the nose with some nice elements of vanilla and oak with a charred bitterness that works well with the sweet malt.  Bourbon really shines through on the back end and actually cleanses the palate in between sips.  The barrel aging really helped this beer and us a big improvement over the Breakfast stout which I thought was a coffee saturated overrated mess.

But towards the end, upon full warming, there is a thinning and a rise of the bourbon that sstarts to drown out the rest and it beomes less interesting.

Pours dark brown, almost black, with very thin reddish-cappuccino head.
Unfortunatly I got a bottle that was a month beyond the BB date already (the risk on online shopping... ), and this most probably affected the aroma, in which the coffee is surely there, but not as strong as expected. On the other hand, I can get a smoky flavour, like habanero. 
Very nice as the same flavour I got drinking, plus a much more evident coffee roastiness, plus dark chocolate and some alcohol to warm. Sweet and bitter are balanced perfectly.
Very low carbonation, full body and oily, everything packed with a nice alcoholic kick.

Taste was very, very big chocolate and loads of coconut in this one initially. Not being a big fan of coconut, I wished there was more char/roasted malt present across the middle.

11648,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"One of the most sought after versions of BCBS, vintage of 2013; my bottle says 14.1% ABV instead of the 13.9% ABV given above. I taste this special treat from an old port wine snifter at near room temperature. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, near to black but not entirely so; only in the last remnants of the liquid, a cloudy brown appearance reveals itself, with tiny bits of dead yeast and proteins lining the glass wall.  The head is thin, beautifully deep beige and a bit coarse, but is sadly reduced to an irregular, wafer-thin rim around the glass in instants. I passionately fall in love with the aroma: what a divine bouquet rises up from the bottle... I could sniff this for hours on end: deep dark chocolate sauce, raisins, candied figs, vanilla-like oaky tannins, Islay whisky, liquorice, old sherry, soy sauce, candied orange, eucalyptus syrup, espresso, cocoa powder, cedar wood, pear syrup, Worcestershire sauce, some cooked meat or fried eggs far away but not disturbing at all, and indeed a faint hint of coconut, though I suspect this volatile aroma has faded considerably in the course of almost two years. The taste amazes me even more: a complex and baffling experience indeed, starting off with a very dense, pointy, refined, concentrated, candied sweetness, cloying a bit to the lips, candied oranges, pear, dried dates and indeed a hint of dry coconut meat; a tinge of carbonation pierces through, as well as subtle sourish and salty accents (red berries and soy sauce). Then a profound chocolate maltiness unfolds in all its glory, bitter chocolate with caramel and cashew nuts, spreading over the tongue and mouth cavity, with a fat, oily mouthfeel; a wonderful symphony of sweet versus bitter, with a lively, almost faintly clove- and cinnamon-like spiciness to it (perhaps the rye whisky already speaking?). Bitter wins in the end, as - almost unexpectedly - a tangy yet still mellow roasted coffee ’blackness’ appears, almost cappuccino-like in combination with the bittersweet chocolate, warming and filling the back of the mouth. Even before I swallow the first sip, it is clear to me that this beer increases in complexity as it makes its way through the palate; the finish beautifully recaptures the whole taste trail from beginning to end, blending the candied sweetness, the bittersweet chocolate malts and the softly roasted coffee bitterness into one concentrated ’ball’ of taste, which is finally confronted with a big wave of warming, whisky-like alcohol which also remains on the tip of the tongue after swallowing but somehow manages to remain gentle in all its force; a clear, drying, tannin-like woodiness ensues, as well as a background hint of peppery, leafy, noble hops adding a subtle, double bass-like structure to the whole. The complexity and richness of the malts, including a warm sense of high quality, aromatic coffee and again the woody tannins, linger for hours after swallowing and the alcohol warms the heart... Things just keep happening here, no matter how many sips you’ve taken.  Though I have to admit I expected more coconut presence, this is still one of the most noble stouts I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I particularly appreciate the follow-up of tastes in this one, sweet and bitter and bitter and sweet all make their appearance one by one only to lead to a resolving climax, as in a classical drama, though I did find the alcohol and the cloying sweetness perhaps a tad over the top - I had the same experience with AleSmith’s Speedway Bourbon Barrel Aged, and like in the case of the latter, this is the only thing keeping me from giving both stouts a perfect score.  Obviously, in view of this beer’s complexity and greatness, this is only the slightest form of criticism, if any; both remain unforgettable and both surely belong to the best beers I ever tasted.  This one, too, is a slow sipper for sure, to be treated with graciousness, dignity and respect. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into this beer; it is as if the malts were selected especially to fit in with the spirit of the barrel in which it has aged (and frankly, I would not be surprised if this is indeed deliberate). Fantastic example of the style, definitely worth the money (which was quite considerable, needless to say...). A world-class masterpiece, that is beyond doubt. I will remember this for the rest of my existence and I will keep the empty bottle in my cellar, only to look at it every now and then with a feeling of nostalgia...",4.6

I have to say, this actually lives up to the hype. And holy crap there is a lot of hype surrounding this. If you have multiples and plan on drinking one, probably best to do it now, this is good to go, cant imagine it getting any better.  





7/17/14 Was at room temp for a few months and then in my fridge for a few months. Everyone said the coconut would be gone in 6 months. Well it’s about 1/4 of what it was. Which is still a decent amount of coconut.  But not to say that this turned to regular bourbon county. It’s almost as if the coconut broke down into sugar. Super sweet, touch of bourbon.

Nose is rich, but not as the almost cloyingly rich OG version of this wonderful stout. Coconut is super present, more in this beer than any other coconut or non-coconut beer I have ever had. Super impressive. Balance is incredible. Really good stuff, maybe my new favorite bourbon county, though the Rare was pretty incredible. Psyched to try this delicious elixir.",4.4
11820,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Dark dark brown pour, brown head. Little coconut floaters. And this is a bourbon soaked mounds bar in liquid form. Delicious. Wow.",4.7
11803,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"My Bottom Line:

Coconut thrives through this fun dessert of an Imperial Stout, swimming around chocolate and caramel flavours in an otherwise heavily sweet, complacent mouthfeel.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-There is no head of foam atop the darkness.

-The sweetness is prevalent and can get on your nerves quickly. Glad I got to split this bomber with a few likeminded aficionados.

-When the coconut subsides, this beer might reach better cohesion. For now, flavours are harmonious, but the flavour profile is not nearly as tight as it should be.

-The flatness and utter dominance of the coconut make this much less compelling than the ratings suggest.

11778,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Pitch black with a khaki head. Nose is chocolate, coconut, vanilla, wood, and leather. Thick and hearty on the palate, chocolate, syrup, coconut, wow.",4.4
11635,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coconut and black chocolate with some bourbon and some vanilla notes. Taste is a complex and satisfying mix of vanilla and bourbon with some black chocolate with just the right amount of coconut. Quite a bit of residual sugar notes but not overly so. Body is full with nice creamy body and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Such a shame that this was only brewed once.,4.4
11815,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle thanks to daknole. Aroma has a medium light coconut note but it is strong enough to break through the moderate chocolate notes and moderately strong bourbon notes. Some light oak and toasted almond character. Light roast character and faint dark fruit. Pours black with hints of dark brown. A faint attempt at a head appears but then disappears even quicker. Some white coconut flakes floating in the beer. No lacing and more a sheet of liquor than legs. Flavor has moderately strong chocolate notes with some light roast. Moderately strong bourbon character with lighter oak notes as well as some toasted almond and vanilla. Medium light coconut notes that add a hint of sweetness. Not much fruit esters. Medium alcohol spice in finish and moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium low carbonation. Oily, silky and chalky all at the same time. Low astringency and medium alcohol warmth. Overall the coconut flavor and aroma are great, but the appearance and mouthfeel are severely hurt by the coconut. A great coconut stout, but it is rough on the edges. The barrel and bourbon qualities show through nicely.",4.0

No alcohol burn whatsoever. A world class sipper.",4.9

The aroma is at first an overload of rich bourbon vanilla, afterwards some nice dark chocolate, lots of cinnanom n the back and then some toasted hints. In the retrofaction, some coconut indeed, and upon a closer inspection, there are some small white coconut leftover flaoting in the glass. Body is oily thick, yet the alcohol heat is overwhelming. Why oh why are American BBA stouts so hot...? Dear Lord. Taste is rich chocolate, loads of molasses, sweet coffe and perhaps some blackberry and cassis jam.

5388,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Tasted blind at a horizontal including Vanilla, Rare, Cherry Rye, Bramble Rye, Coffee ’12 and an ’09 Bomber. Poured into a snifter at approx 55 degrees. Reviewed from blind tasting notes. 5/6 in the lineup. 

A- The lowest carbonation of the bunch, essentially no head formation whatsoever upon pouring. Thick, blackest of black, motor oil appearance. 

S- Tons of barrel on the nose as well as bourbon. Some sweetness, almost like a port-like oxidation. In addition, some vanilla. 

T- Tons of vanilla, barrel and bourbon. The vanilla is very rich and the most apparent note. Tastes absolutely fantastic. 

M- Thick, rich, and lingering. Not much more to be said. Simply fantastic from start to finish. Minimal carb. 

O- We actually misidentified this as the ’09 bomber, and the ’09 bomber as this. To be honest, we all enjoyed the ’09 more, although this was the close second out of our ratings by just 1 or 2 total points. We should have been able to guess by the very low levels of carbonation. Either way, this is a fantastic beer, but I think it may have peaked. When I had this back in May, it definitely had a bit more oomph than this bottle.",4.7

Nice big thick BA impy.",4.2
5570,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Ethan!   This beer was very tasty.  I enjoyed the flavor much more than the  aroma.

A little sweet, but not in a cloying sort of way.",4.3

The full body has a rich yet crisp mouth feel.  flavor is bold with the oak standing out in front giving a bright vanilla flavor reminiscent of bourbon then the taste of raisins soaked in brandy. After taste lets the dried fruits stand out with the oak building a bit more and the alcohol shows a bit.  overall its a wonderful brew but the there vanilla seemed to be a little more complex.",3.8

Flavor is incredibly smooth, rich barrels, bourbon, mild roast, and such smooth malts. I can still taste this one and having tried it against an aged regular version it was incredible what the barrels did to this version. The 50$ price tag was a bit over the top even for this but the beer was impressive and memorable.",4.2

5716,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz bottle, #3,642 with an 11/19/10 bottled on date. Picked up this piece of hype at the Binny’s LP Black Friday event. Pours an oily black colored body with a few ruby-brown traces around the edge. Thin, frothy, dark brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light ring around the outside. Aroma absolutely jumps out of the bottle upon opening. Extremely rich and smooth. Loaded with molasses, caramel cookies, vanilla, an underlying yet distinct roast, dark chocolate, and a very pleasant warming bourbon that never announces itself as boozy. Some raisins and dark fruits, soft oak, and barely a hint of leathery tobacco. The barrel presence is quite deep, but anything but overwhelming. Flavor is more the same. Loaded with thick, rich, and sweet chocolates, molasses, and caramel cookies up front. Smooth vanilla, somewhat salty oak, raisin, and roast follow quickly before the extremely deep barrel aspect wraps this up. Tons of sweet bourbon, but oh so soft and never boozy. The barrel completely dries this out with a very enjoyable warming feel that increases more and more as it flows down my throat. This beer finishes better than Peter North. Plenty of vanilla, raisin, bourbon, oak, rich chocolates, molasses, and fairly bitter roasts make it so complex before leaving a lengthy aftertaste. Full, silky smooth body and barely a trace of carbonation. Fantastic mouthfeel. Overall, I was skeptical, but the ratings are legit. This is every bit as good as advertised. The barrel aging on this is so deep and complex, but it still has plenty of sweet, rich, and roasty malts. Spectacular balance and enjoyable in every aspect. $43 and two hours in the cold is a pretty steep price tag, but damnit this is a world class barrel-aged imperial stout.",4.6

I really don’t think so. Pours solid black, pretty viscous with a brown head. Aroma of rum soaked stone fruits, soy, bourbon/vanilla/coconut, smoke, chocolate, it’s one of those beers that you smell something else seemingly every time you go for a whiff. Taste of sweet earthy chocolate and bourbony flavor, toffee, all of the aforementioned aromas blend nicely in the mouth. Thick body, smooth, silky, oily, soft carbonation. Thanks once more Kyle. This was a whale of a beer and it stood up past my expectations after doing a massive amount of beer tasting at the festival.

A - Pours black, mocha-colored head, some nice lacing and a thin cap on top which eventually dissipates to some random bubbles and some thin whisps.

S - Chocolate, oak, bourbon, toffee, burnt sugars, roasted nuts. The alcohol is a little hot, but hey, it’s still not overpowering by any means. The sweetness is not overdone like I find in some other big -bal aged stouts.

T - A very nice smooth and rich oaky bourbon character, chocolate, roasted nuts, burnt sugars, caramel. Very rich and big, but nothing in this beer is too much for me. All balanced out nicely and very enjoyable.

M - Full body, rich and viscous, creamy finish.

D - Goose really made an awesome beer here. It wasn’t as good as the PVW Eclipse that we had in our blind tasting but it was very very close, which is impressive. Highly recommend.",4.2

5611,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle shared by the other Matt the other day at the other house. This is the other Bourbon county, the green one, served in a Russian River wine glass. Thanks Matt! This beer was also drank close to the same time the Bourbon County Brand Stout (regular) vertical was drank. I’ll review that later.

Beer looks exactly like BCBS, it’s black, thin head of small tan bubbles, minimal lacing, low carbonation, the swirl leaves a coating on the glass, legs appear, looks really nice.

Aroma is great, it has this sweetness from the malt, hints of roast with a strong but not overpowering woodsy and liquor character. The liquor is smooth and flavorful on the nose.

Beer is medium in body and lowly carbonated on the palate. Beer is sweet at lead off the way a syrup is sweet, giving way to a huge, flavorful midpalate experience of strong liquor and alcohol. The finish is a little dry with minimal bitterness, somehow accenting the flavor of the oak and the bourbon, it tastes really nice. For such a big and aggressive beer it drinks wonderfully. I am very curious to see how this ages. Very excited about this beer in general. I am not a scotch or single malt expert but all of these nuanced flavors from the different barrels definitely makes me curious.

There is a definite initial note of alcohol that dissipates as it has a chance to breathe, and other than needing a little time found this quickly went away.  Flavor is equally up to the task, with more rich vanilla, oak, molasses, chocolate and a blend of ripe dark fruits.  The carbonation is just a touch higher than I’d hope, with some prickliness, but retains a smooth and coating finish.  A fine beer, but not quite at the level of something like FiftyFifty’s PVW Eclipse.  Embarrassed at how much this costs, but for a one bottle, one time kind of thing there are no regrets.  Thanks again Danny!",4.2

itself. Carbonation is present and body is smooth.  Decadent to say the least.  Not sure if it’s worth the pricetag but it’s a must-try for me as a bourbon county stout lover.

5626,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"5 oz pour.

It pours a dense black with a fizzy head that dissipates before I even get it.

The smell here is richer and smoother than the average BCS. This is partially due to the extra aging, but also the bourbon barrels used. It has all of the traditional BCS traits: thick bourbon, barrel, chocolate, and roast. However, there is an added almost woodsy-spiciness that is unique to this version.

The flavor follows. It has that hint of spiciness that takes regular BCS to a different level. It is smoother, and richer. The aging has allowed it to mature to perfection. The drinkability here is much greater than the average BCS.

This one is overpriced, but it is a great experience. An outstanding beer.

Nose is really smooth bourbon with a nice amount of toasted wood. The flavor reflects the oak barrel a bit more then all the other BCBS variants. The complexity is just as fantastic as any BCBS. Great slick, oily texture that just slides down the muzzle. Bourbon flavor is real smooth leaning on subdued. I would say if you have any of this now is the time to drink it. Still wonderful flavor but I feel like it is leaning on the ledge of falling off real soon. I was really happy to have gotten to sample this.

Got some liquorice on the finish and it was a little warming as it went down.

Thick and strong on the nostrils, rich and creamy, sweet yet roasty, deep barrel presence. Initial is rich and creamy, roasty malts, dark chocolate, brownies and cookies, caramel, coffee grounds, bigger vanilla tannins, rich barrel presence, warming as it goes down. Wet oak, thick bodied with legs, coats the palate well as raisin and dark fruit, touches of plum and dark black cherries really grow and give this beer it’s character. Vanilla, rich bakers chocolate, coating malts and warming barrel, a little hot, but a big luscious body supports it. Incredible, if not a bit hot. Truly a good display of the barrel, and special ones at that. Finish is warming, loads of vanilla tannins with roasty bitter malts, cocoa, and coffee running the gambit and warming spirit, touches of dark fruit, anise, biscuits, nice. Overall, it IS BCS..

5715,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Draft.  I’m sure the appearance is probably a 5... but in the little sippy cup thing they give it to you in... I’ll leave it a 4 for now.  The aroma also suffers because of this, maybe it’s because of waiting in the cold for a while, but it also seems muted.  Wow, what a great marriage of bourbon and wonderful stout, the bourbon is quite strong but never gives the sense that it’s too much, not subtle but remains ever sophisticated, the stout has just light touches of soy up front, a few people commented that it actually seems to have less depth than regular, the bourbon is just amazing... o so delicious.  Mouthfeel seemed to be just a bit marshmallowy but that could be because this is out of a keg, so it fluffs up a bit, supremely drinkable though, no indication that it’s 14% at all, and you don’t tire of drinking it whatsoever, doesn’t gloop up like other big stouts... probably will get a 5 on palate once I try it out of the bottle, (eh just tried some regular BCS, this is for sure a 5 on palate).

It pours a lifeless midnight black in color with no head or carbonation. It looks like an ’08 Bourbon County, perfectly oily and overly viscous. The aromas consist of sweet bourbon, vanilla, molasses, oak, chocolates, and syrupy goodness. You can tell it’s had plenty of time to age and let it’s intricate qualities intermingle. I would like a little more PVW but it’s fine. The beer is already over two and a half years old at this point. The flavors are just wow.

Viscous and lucious mouthfeel, low medium carbonation. Extremely smooth and while the bourbon notes are there, this isn't super boozy at all. Just awesome. The main difference I see with this relative to regular BCS is the heightened coconut and graham cracker flavors.

Still i find this too boozy and next to a 2008 BCS i felt there was little to no difference, hence i felt this was a big rip off.  Well even if it was outta this world 50$ for a bomber, is ridiculous.  Maybe that left a bit of a sour note on this.  On a whole there’s too much alcohol despite the lighter oxidation barreling notes.",3.8

5346,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle #6554, 4 oz pour into tulip tasting glass.
Appearance: Black with a light dark brown foam. Foam dissipated rather quickly after pour.
Aroma: Tons of chocolate on the nose followed by powerful scent of bourbon.
Taste: What I picked up on the nose gets amplified on the palate. Starts with big chocolate and then the rich bourbon flavor starts to build and come into its own. This is such an excellent fusion of flavor.
Palate: Medium body. Beer leaves its mark on your palate and the flavors persist long after a sip.
Overall: This was one of the finest imp. stouts I have ever had. I wish I had a more sophisticated bourbon palate to better detect the intricacies of the barrel aging. Regardless, this was like eating a box of chocolates, all of which were filled with pappy!",4.6
5368,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Pulsen stiger. Trodde inte jag skulle få uppleva detta. (Thanks biggsbowler!). Lite av kvällen höjdpunkt och stora överraskning. Känslan att få dricka den bästa bärs som ett av de bryggerier som betytt mest för mig har gjort är tungt. 
Doft av vanilj, bourbon och nostalgi. Känner att den troligen inte har att vinna på längre lagring. Balanserad, len och fin. Svag känsla av oxidation som är lätt att bortse från och bara njuta och känna sig nostalgisk och minnas tillbaka till sin första bourbonfatade imperial stout.",4.8

7/28/2011: Goose Island RARE Bourbon County Stout... Aroma: AWESOME! (but difficult to describe)... Vanilla, raisin, plum, high-end bourbon, black licorice, tobacco. Appearance: Deep, dark ruby-brown color, OPAQUE; fleeting dark brown-colored brown; oozing golden bubbles. Flavor: F-ing A! WOW! This beer is truly light years beyond the ""regular"" BCS... rich, deep, robust caramel tobacco; chewy, but muted black licorice; smooth, subtle VANILLA, a splash of red wine/port; roasted almond; really great refined bourbon alcohol and slight burn through the finish. Palate: Full body; silky SMOOTH and mellow; milky texture. Overall: Insanely good! #1 or #2 overall for me! Is there any more I need to say?! Yes, yes I do... This beer is WAY beyond what I expected. There was a lot of talk that this wasn’t overly distinguishable from the regular BCS, but there is no comparison. This is a PHENOMENAL beer.

5421,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Quick notes. 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Bottle #2209, bottled on 11/19/2010. Huge thanks to Doug for slaying my number one want by sharing a pour with me!

Appearance wise it is identical to BCBS, no surprise there. Having never had the 2008 vintage which this beer is using, I can say its awfully similar to how the 2009 vintage is drinking now. There is a stronger vanilla presence and it is smoother and mellower than the standard beer. Just loads of chocolate, charred malt, and rich and decadent bourbon. It drinks far too easily, which is sad considering how elusive it is now. A marginal improvement over standard BCBS, but when that is your favorite beer it truly does matter. Such a beautiful beer that I’m glad to have finally tried.",4.9

Taste is sweet, syrupy, apple concentrate, strawberry, orange and general fruit salad in syrup.  Slight sherry.  Potent flavours, oversweet.  Alcohol is not noticeable.

Closer and deeper inhale reveals intense, deep, rich apple that is the essence of apple, like Eve’s apple, more apply than apple itself. Proto-apple, apple in Plato’s Form of apple. Flavor makes eyes roll to back of head from intense delight. Sweetness on the level of a Turkish baklava, unabashed, unrelenting, and unapologetic. Honey married to sweet crisp apples, like pink lady, and underlying currents of jam. After the diabetic coma comes a splash of acidity complements of Mother Apple that rescues the mouth from becoming bogged down but which tortures with its insistence on more (when there is none!). Moderately complex, fully accessible. I don’t understand it and won’t try, it’s meant to be enjoyed. Having such a small bottle causes existential pain.",4.9

A bit more dark and caramel coloured than Neige, it’s viscous and oily and coated the tulip-shaped tasting glass well.  Aroma starts off with a little oak, then a few alcoholic fumes, but not overpowering at all, then comes the fruit salad: lychee, passion fruit, mangoes, and then finishes off with a smell of freshly chopped mushrooms.  Insane.  This elixir tastes like liquid apple pie.  Soft notes of caramel, it feels powerful in your mouth but comes down smoother than silk.  It has a residual sweetness that cancels out any apparent acidity and doesn’t give you that ""too much sugar in my bloodstream"" feeling a lot of dessert wines can give you.  This is the ultimate ice cider in Québec right now, and can give the best ciders in the world a run for their money.",4.6

10303,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"5/4/07.  Poured out of 375 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with Olivier_MTL on RateBeer 12/3/05.  2003 Vintage.  Pours a deep amber-gold color with good clarity and a bold, beautiful depth of autumn color.  The oily legs on this cider are much broader and slower than those of its brother, the Neige-- tilt the glass and there are times that the high edge of residue takes literally several minutes to droop, like the wax from a freshly-lit candle.  The aroma here is much richer and more succulent also-- some overripe apples and fresh apple sauce (complete with cinnamon accompaniment), as well as soft caramel and a captivating, warming, sweet-liqueur aura.  First taste is decadently sweet with a lightly leathery, lightly waxy tart apple outline.  The finish drops most of the soft tartness that balanced the initial taste and leaves a homemade soft-and-syrupy cinnamon apples and a slight apple pie doughy flavor.  Some zesty alcohol rounds out the mouthfeel, sort of a funny way to balance the gripping sweetness.  This is even more indulgent than its companion, lacking most of the tartness of crisp fresh apples but replacing it with an intoxicating medley of apple desserts that rival the best restaurant creations I’ve ever sampled.",4.5

Deep gold and syruppy. Lightly sparkling with a slightly rose hue. Lots of legs. Aroma of apples, peach, wood, alcohol. There was an odd but welcome truffle-like aroma that carried over to the flavour. Could have been from the wooden barrel. Excellent balance of sweet and tart. Lots of full apple flavour but deep with peach and stewed ripe fruit. Traces of vanilla bounce around. I don’t know much about ciders but this was fantastic.",4.6
10198,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"bottle - This cider has an incredibly rich aroma of ripe apples with notes of flowers and brown sugar. The flavor is syrupy sweet and smooth but it works oh so well. It has rich apple sweetness and tart character at the same time. The natural sugars are sweet and delicious and the finish is pleasantly warming. Remarkable. As it turns out, it happens to get the same total rating as the previous La Face ice cider that I rated.

The finish is long, smooth and sweet with the sugar glazed apples and the perfect warming from the alcohol left behind. It just goes down so smooth leaving you wanting more until the last drop. This is the epitome of an Ice Cider as it is simply amazing stuff. Worth every penny.",4.5
10283,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"My 2000th rating! Bottle (375ml) shared with my wife. 2005 Vintage, bottle 1077 of 3466. Pours a clear amber-gold with no head. Very nice aroma of lots and lots of sweet apples along with light oak, pears, mild tartness, honey and white wine -- lots going on here. The flavour is even better, it’s downright delicious! Again, lots of delicious sweet apples along with some other fruit, sweet honey, some oak, alcohol (it’s there but it’s subtle), spices (nutmeg and more) and a good amount of acidity 
-- quite complex and never overly-sweet. Great full body with a syrupy mouthfeel. What more can I say? This is simply an amazing Cider.",4.3
10254,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Bottle kindly shared by TheCheeseMan! Pours golden, still, with legs like whoa. Huge sugary apple aroma. Intense apple flavor, very sweet, a little wood and a nice slight tartness to hold it all together. Slight alcohol evident in the flavor and mouth, evident as some drying sensations despite the sweetness. Slick, super drinkable. Amazing. Simply top-tier.",4.5
10263,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"A Mes rate: bottle, HUGE thanks to our Magic.
Big respect to Tom for doing this properly and freezing it first. This is ice cider. Bright orange and very thick. Very very special indeed. Incredible apple aroma. Spice a plenty, sweet as hell and loads of fruit. Those apples are just amazing. Amazing toffee notes in the flavour. Ok you piss taking set of bastards (Tom & Sim) I mean candy apple. Lashings of custard. This is, as Tom describes, like apple pie and custard without the pastry. Big tarty apple bite with plenty of sharp acidty that rather than lingering in the background is brought rushing to the front carried by the alcohol. Darker than the Neige and like a bigger badder brother. A bloody amazing experience that brings back all the fantasticness of last time I tried this stunning nectar.",4.4

10269,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"375ml split on Valentines Day. I’m not as crazy about this as I have been with past samples. Perhaps it’s now that I have so much of it, or that I’m drinking so much more. The sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a while, and the alcohol presence is strong. It is still delicious, with a supernaturally thick body, delicious apple and grape sugar. There is a touch of acidity early in the sip, with a bit of cookie and cake later. Apples taste is very young, green, not the old, rich apple I’ve noticed in Neige and other frozen-juice ice ciders. I couldn’t possibly deny the greatness of this beverage, but truth to be told, it’s not one meant for even moderately large quantities of drinking.",4.3

It can only be described as the freshest apple juice you have ever encountered, painstakingly reduced to the nth degree.  The flavor is inconceivably perfect, like a million fresh apples that have been crushed in the dead of winter, in the middle of the unadulterated wilderness, and somehow crammed into a tiny package.  A thick, oily body glides over the tongue, effortlessly delivering the sweet apple goodness to each and every corner of the mouth.

276,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Thanks to the Birthday Boy, Craig ""Swiftkey did it"" Garvie - 2008 Vintage

Opaquest dark brown, a total black hole swirl of a tan head. Rich sugary dusting. Dark smooshed figs, toasted coconut and isolated grab of raisins as it warmed and a welcoming porty porter core. Initial taste is a proper shotgun burning raidance of Meaty, juicy darkest malts - treacly charred sweetness seeping through. Vanilla pod crackles. Soily/dusty coffee dryness. Stabbing richness towards the finish, speckled fizzing out heat on the finish. A lot more layered and flavorsome than a Dark Lord, although a little more chewy meaty and leap at the finish - it’s up there and it’s mysticality will only increase each year this isn’t made.

A: Deep black body with a smallish khaki head of tight bubbles.  Receded over a minute or two leaving behind some whispy lacing.

S: Delicate milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and some oak.  The bourbon barrel aging is undeniable but it is quite restrained and silky.

T: Like the nose, the bourbon barrel aging is graceful.  That said, its subtleties are somewhat lost in its meekness.  I prefer barrel aged stouts that are a bit more potent, but refrain from burning your throat off.  Milk chocolate, oak, vanilla, and bourbon are all here.  Surprising, not as much roasted malt as I was expecting.

M: The mouthfeel is the standout element of this beer for sure.  Nice and thick, with a luscious, velvety feel as the beer coats the tongue.  No burn with just the slightest hints of the 10% ABV.  

O: Quite nice.  I think just about anyone can appreciate the quality here, but its just not quite the bourbon barrel RIS that I absolutely crave.",4.2

296,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Some kind of celebration punching my 4K rating at RateBeer. I’m not really that concerned with numbers but sometimes it could be fun to do something extra about millstones anyway. The truth is I’m such a lacy rater so barely 50 % of my notes end up here. The big advance of this is the fact that it’s quite easy to grab something interesting from my notes and make it my “celebration”. So what could be more appropriate than world greatest Imperial Stout. I’m lucky to have sampled this by several occasions, but this 2007 vintage where pulled out of my cellar late one evening after a great beer tasting session. Everyone had gone home and I just felt for splitting this bottle with my beer buddy Gunnfryd. The big question where if it still was able to kick balls after a set of other superb ales (lots of good memories from those days my buddies cared to bring fine beers at our beer evenings). Back to the beer. Pours pitch black with a small but nice, dense brown head. Body feels thick and heavy with a appropriate moderate level of carbonation. A sight for sore eyes. Strong aroma of everything dark, like dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate with leather, wood and smooth, refined alcohol. Flavor is sweet but in perfect balance with the bitterness and alcohol. Everything from the aroma is present in such a perfect and smooth combination. The body feels perfect and it has a really long aftertaste, still soft as silk, rich malt, pleasant wood and warming alcohol. Pure pleasure.",4.7

The aroma is beef bouillon, soy, dark chocolate, burnt and roasted malts and marshmallows with faint porto notes. The beer pours a gloppy black and settles with a thinnish mocha head, but initially the head is finger thickness and creamy looking. 

The first sip is fairly boozy and the barrel aging is immediate and unmistakeable imparting vanilla, pineapple and coconut notes. I also get some nutty Maderia notes and gobs of dark chocolate. Fairly hot on the swallow with a cream and chocolate chaser. It almost tastes like a dark chocolate liqueur. The finish makes me think of a vanilla liqueur with faint nutty and chocolate notes that invoke german chocolate cake. A very enjoyable beer that is definitely not a product of hype or hysteria.

Jet black, espresso head. Toffee liquorice vanilla aroma soft but very powerful. Mocca and whisky taste - again very powerful, but quite mellow. Whisky definitely dominates, quite alcoholic. Excellent sipping beer, not for glugging, that’s for sure. Looks like it’s been made to taste of whisky rather than to taste of wood that’s been steeped in whisky, or even to simply age itself. In retrospect, this isn’t vastly superior to any of the other whisky-laced beers, but as my first in the style I was very impressed by it.

Rerate: 250ml bottle - Thanks Jesper! (8:4:8-:4:15=3.9-)

444,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Rating 500. Version 2009. Tasted 14 oct. 2010. At first, till some weeks ago, I was thinking Närke probably should be overrated. Cause of the low brewingcapacity, and the very hard to get beers, this beers just had to get an higher rating then they deserve… Ok the beers should be good, but that good like described? Then, soms weeks ago, I had the chance to taste some beers of this brewer (thanks to Brouwerij De Molen, with the beerfestival!). And I took the chance to taste 3 beers of this brewer, that are not at the top of the ratebeer-rating, but decent. And damn, they are very good, maybe even great. So I got myself also Stormaktsporter and Kaggen Stormaktsporter at 25cl bottles. And now is the time to rate this 2 beers next to eachother (lucky me). So my 499th rating is the Närke Stormaktsporter 2008, my 500th rating is the Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter 2009. And here we go my 500th rating: Pours out a bit darker then the non-kaggen version? Really pitch black. A small head, brownish, won’t holds that good as the normal version. Smell is diferent, more sourness comes up, and something for sure different, the bourbon? Coffee, fruits, something pleasant (bourbon?), wood, chocolate. Very nice smell for sure, also the vanilla seems to come trought a bit more... Taste is different for sure also. Ofcourse the taste is roastiness, coffee, chocolate,… but some more liquorish for sure, more alcohol, and the bourbon comes up with a kick. The sweetness goes at this one more to some sourness. The mouthfeel is pleasant, about the same, oily like i like it. The taste is maybe just a bit to sharp for me at the start. Maybe I’m weird, but I like the normal version just a bit more, It seems more balanced then this one, but that’s maybe cause this one is younger, and after some aging the sharp start will be softened. A very good brew for sure, and wanna try this again in some time, with an aged bottle. But till then: overrated? NO! Best beer? no... Top-beer? For sure! Very decent imperial stout for sure, well done Närke! Maybe I had to wait a bit longer to open this bottle, or the other version, as my 550th rating or so, but now it’s more easy to compare them. Edit: retasted to celibrate something special. 2009 version on 12/09/2014. Almost like i remembered this beer. The honey seems faded away some, but while warming up it’s still there. Ages good (5 year old bottle), but expected a more different taste as fresh.",4.5

Super-rich flavors, fruity, and complex, and really hard to describe. Medium-full body. A great unabashedly Old World stout. Unrestrained but classic.",4.5
756,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Alright, I had the chance to get a sample of that (2005)  in Copenhagen, then I tried the new 2007 version at Oliver twist a few weeks later and retried, some days after, the 2005 thanks to my very generous Göteborg hosts: Marsiblursi. First off, the regular Stormaktsporter is an excellent imperial stout and rather tough to beat in complexity. I don’t quite understand the purpose of setting it in a barrel. It is apparently a rather short journey that it takes (2,5months), yet the effect is considerable as bourbon is obvious in the nose, but the low duration has allowed the body to keep most of its thickness, silkiness and richness. 
 So what do I think about it? Well, first off, I prefered the 2005 version which is 1% lighter and more developped and rounded around the edges at this point. The 2007 is still a fair bit boozy. The 2005’s complexity is more obvious and the concentrated fruitiness from the regular comes across more naturally. Appearance-wise, they both wear a fair diminishing dark beige head. Totally opaque, oily body, pitch black. The 2007 actually left legs on the glass. Gentle alcohol flavours, rum-soaked grapes, heady nose with wild leather smokiness, mint, vanilla (strong), chocolate roastiness and hard to pick up single fruits. Complex nuances, age-worthy, silky full body with honeyed and brown sugar tones. Very creamy, smooth carbonation. it manages to feel quite vinous at the same time, full on truffles, earth mushrooms powderiness and growing date square undertones. You can eventually all kinds of little nuances, which is the sign of a great beer. Still, at the end, I’m not convinced I prefer the barrel version and remain unconvinced that the rarity does not make me try harder to pick out stuff. Certainly a fine experience though. I’ll just give both Stormakts the same score.. but it is a sipper and I’m less into those that I once was.",4.1
750,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2005 bottle - June ’07 - purchased at Akkurat, Stockholm - $40.  

First off, I thought this really lived up to the hype.  It was flat out unbelievable - right in between the imperial stouts that need to be a bit bigger and those that go overboard...no matter how hard I tried to find something I didn’t like about it, I simply couldn’t - it was the definition of balanced.  Each sip was proceeded by a heart-felt ""WOW!"".  Every part of this brew was so insanely complex.  The aroma wrapped up vanilla, oak, dark chocolate malts, espresso, licorice, dark fruits, etc - I smelled it for who knows how long.  Flavor was exquisite - wrapping all those smells into a perfectly chewy and smooth palate.  Talk about wanting to lick your gums and lips.  The finish was balanced between sweet and bitter - the slight alcohol burn warmed but nowhere near overpowered anything.  Will I get my taste buds on this one again?  Let’s hope so.  Ya, I liked it that much.  Simply divine in every right a beer can be....",4.7

188,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the ""best beers of the world"" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny.",4.8

Interesting to note that a sample pour from the same bottle into an identical vessel did not have any head at all; no idea why. Aroma is prominent molasses and caramel with more subtle notes of vanilla, coconut, and very light ash.  Maybe a touch of chocolate dipped orange peel as well.  Flavor has a full vanilla and caramel burst up-front with a similar finish to the regular; toffee, roasted malt, and light fruit.

Flavour is rich and very complec with bourbon, honey, vanilla and chocolate. At the end of the glass the bourbon has covered my whole mouth and the thick palate has become really sticky. 25 cl of this is really enough. Kind of reminds me of Goose Island Bourbon County, but this is slightly better. Worse than the non-Kaggen version though.

25 cl bottle vintage 2018 @ home. Rated on 11.2.2023

Aroma has bourbon, cocoa and some vanilla. Also licorice. Flavour has alcohol, bourbon, dark chocolate. A bit sharp on alcohol, perhaps would still need some ageing.

504,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2005 vintage, 180ml bottle, into smallish tasting glass. Big props goes to Alex for breaking this one out at our Pre-Night of the Living Ales Tasting. 

A - Pours black, tan head, a bit of retention and a hint of lacing.

S - Honey, chocolate, molasses, coffee, oak, etc. This is a very complex beer, so it’s hard to pick out everything in this one. I’m sure I’m missing some notes but rest assured, it’s awesome.

T - Even better then the nose. Lots of honey up front, some chocolate, oak, dark fruits. Lots of stuff to pick out here and like the nose, very complex. 

M - Maybe a touch too light, but very rich and smooth. Sweet finish that makes you want to come back for more.

D - We split this bottle several ways, but I could have easily drank the entire thing (if I were being greedy). It was very special to have the 2005 version, which already has 5+ years on it. I won’t probably ever get to try a ’05 again, but perhaps I’ll get to compare some of the newer vintages versus this.",4.4
339,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/30/2011.  Poured from a 8 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. 2008 vintage. 

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter has a typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace. 

The aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose.

The flavor is pretty much exactly what I want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. Smooth, sweet bourbon comes in first and slowly lets in the fig, raisin, cherry, and roasted malt blend beautifully together. Some dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, and light espresso notes are in the background. The finish has a bit more bourbon and finishes fairly clean.

The carbonation is smooth, with just enough crispness to excite the tongue along with the bourbon. The body is on the fuller side of medium and consistent all the way through. Slightly sticky on the lips.

Clearly, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. No individual flavor really stands out, but the flavors in concert work so well together.",4.4
690,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"rating #300....bottle of 2006 vintage....silky smooth dark brown and almost black pour accompanied by a very thin tan head with some very nice lacing as it is swirled.....even better was the nose which, too, was velvety amooth with rich caramel and vanilla notes.  the bourbon was present but did overpower the other essences.  it nicely works in harmony with the rich chocolate stout characteristics.....moving on the the flavors, lots of bitter roastiness here and more of that rich chocolate sensation.  some of the ba qualities also comes into play here.  in my mind, the flavor was somewhat curtailed and i wished that it had more of a followthrough.  finish was roasty as well.....in summary the nose was terrific and i wished the flavors lived up to those expectations set forth by the aroma.  a must try if you can get your hands on it.",4.2

The aroma is fantastic of dark fruit, some coffee, dark chocolate, some peat, and some alcohol. The taste is absolutely wonderful of the above smells, with some brown sugary sticky goodness on the palate. The alcohol is by no means over powering, but is enough to let you know its there. finish and mouthfeel is creamy smooth with a light lactose presence. If only I had some more....First class stout all the way.",4.8
804,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Re-rate bottled at Akkurat and at SMÖF.  The flavours are now more mature and balanced. The silkyness of teh regular Stormaktsporter now combines well with all the attractive barrel induced flavours.  It has grown one step further on bottles.


[Draught at Oliver Twist, Stockholm]  Intransparently black, small pale brown head. Rich aroma of licorice and wood. Sweet with full body and concentrated flavour of coffee, tar, oak and whiskey. Salty finish with vanilla and chocolate as well as a fair amount of bitterness. The barrel character does not overpower the other flavours, making it more balanced than many other barrel aged beers.",4.3

227,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"250 ml bottle from a trade, vintage 2016.
Black body, with a small, creamy, dark beige head. 
Beautiful aroma of honey, dark chocolate, bourbon, moderate coffee, some tobacco, slight toffee, slight wood. 
Tastes quite similar, with less honey, more cocoa powder, slight soy sauce.
Medium, oily mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. Finishes smooth, moderate roasty, moderate sweet, a bit dry, with tobacco, cocoa powder, moderate bourbon, some coffee, some honey, 

Delicious! I really love the nose, the honey adds a very smooth, unique layer. Greatly balanced in the taste, just enough roastiness and sweetness, with the bourbon barrel perfectly integrated, very smooth for the ABV. Not my very favourite style example, while I enjoyed this a lot and I can see why this was so special back then. Score: 9 / 4 / 8 / 5 / 17",4.3

716,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Royal Park Beer Festival. 2006 vintage. The emperor has no clothes? I’m not sure, he’s definitely not as well-dressed as he thinks, IMO. The aroma just screams coconut, to the point of not much else getting through. So bourbony - it’s completely dominant. Piney, minty American hops mixed with coffee and chocolate in the US stout style underneath. Bourbon doesn’t affect the flavour nearly as much - no noticeable saltiness or booziness, which I appreciate, but I didn’t detect any oak character either. The barrel-aging doesn’t seem to have added much besides the rampant bourbon aroma, it’s more like an imperial stout with a shot of bourbon. And the thing is it just doesn’t taste like good bourbon either, it really reminded me of white label Jim Beam. I dunno. I mean, it’s quite a nice beer, but obviously you’re gonna have high expectations with a beer like this. If this is what barrel-aged imperial stouts are all about then I’ll just stick with the plain ones I think.",3.6

465,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2008 Bottle at Akkurat, split with a friend.  I can’t find my notes for this, or the other bottles we had at Akkurat.  So everything here is from a foggy memory on a day where I hadn’t slept in like 36 hours and was pretty much walking around in a daze.  Pour was black with maybe some brownish edges.  Nose was pretty wonderful, some elegant bourbon, oak, plethora of dark fruits, roasted malts, almost smoky.  Sweet and amazingly complex flavors swirling around.  Sweet malts, sweet honey, dark fruits, some spicy oak and bourbon, smoky, roasted malts.  Really surprised at the smoke element in this.  As it keeps breathing and warms some breathtaking nuances take shape, I think the honey became more pronounced.  It should not be served cold.  This was super complex and a delight to drink.",4.5

The 2007 Kaggen was my favorite of the bunch, it was a bit better rounded than the 2008.  
 

Pours very deep brown, nearly opaque, capped with a thin brown head. Beautiful lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, oak and perhaps a bit of honey. Flavor begins with roasted chocolate malt, coffee, licorice, and molasses, with oak and charcoal in the background. Hop bitterness builds a bit towards the finish, and remain on the palate along with dark chocolate. Some alcohol in the finish as well. The body is a bit thinner than I expected.

This beer gotta be kidding me. The taste is just freakingly slick chocolate, raw cocoa, vanilla, chili, cinnamon rolls, dark fruits, nougat and a lot of wooden whiskey barrel character. I think the barrel and the chili saves this beer from being cloying. The end of this beer is just crazy good just covering your mouth with melted chocolate haha!

There is a strong spiciness from the chilies and cinnamon, but the chocolate really mutes it. The barrel offers a further balance and a hint of vanilla. The light woodiness really adds a touch of sweetness that I like. The flavor is just as good. The complexity and depth really stand out. Chilies, cinnamon, chocolate, light vanilla, whiskey sweetness, and a light woodiness. This is just so complex and lovely. The mouth feel is light and not as viscous as I’d want.

Nothing is jumping out and dominating the palate, but each ingredient makes it;s presence known. Nice cocoa and vanilla sweetness that cuts the pepper heat and barrel character nicely. Just wishing it was a bit more ""bold"" in terms of body and character. Typical gluttonous expectations. Finishes a bit ""hot"", but fairly balanced.

Taste: very thick, lots of barrels, very complex cinnamon. When it's warming up you can find nice black chocolate notes. I couldn't really find any vanilla.
Overall: for sure - this is a nicely done imperial stout, but you can't really find much over the cinnamon and chillies here. Not that they are overpowering here, no, they are nicely balanced, but the rest is quite weak. Some black chocolate here, yes, for sure, but no vanilla here for me.

It is black w/ only a small head of brown foam. I get a bunch of cinnamon and vanilla and all kinds of good stuff in the nose and can say it smells legitimately delicious but tasting it is when it sort of goes awry. It is heavy and sweet and the spices and booze overwhelm any real malt character.

13765,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Thanks to Matt and Kevin, shared with my family on Christmas Eve.

Pours a viscous black color, with a small, fluffy, dark brown head, leaving back a perfect, thin lacing at the side of the glass.

Smells of sweetened cinnamon on top of earthy malts, bakers chocolate and a gentle amount of coffee. The Bourbon qualities aren’t too present on their own, but blend very well into the chili spices, adding heat and wood to the nose. Notes of molasses provide a sweetness to the brew, which gets supported by the omnipresent cinnamon spiciness outstandingly well. 

Begins with rich cinnamon flavors straight from the beginning, while earthy, toasted malts, as well as slightly bitter coffee build the foundation of this beer. The cinnamon gets a bit sticky and dusty, while it turns pretty intense on the palate, with molasses and toffee adding a lot of sweetness to its dominant spiciness. The Bourbon barrel, mirroring the nose, doesn’t turn very present on its own, while it interacts perfectly well with the chilies, leaving the spicy cinnamon with an interesting, hot and complex touch on the palate. The sweetness gets balanced by a wooden Bourbon bite, which got a semi dry, bitter aspect to it, highlighting the earthy malts. 

Finishes with a sublte, spicy burn, while coffee becomes more present, still with a slick sweetness detectable, which is now calmed by the wooden maltiness, while the Bourbon shines through in its wooden, vanilla qualities, with a peppery bite. Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, with a hot burn in the end. The beers body is incredible full and quite different to the normal version, while providing less coffee, way more cinnamon and the proper sweetness.",4.6

7675,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Beautiful smell. 10oz glass at nakedcity brewpub in greenwood. The smell is even better then the taste. Amber hoppy nectar but is it really better then a green flash IIPA or Founders Devil Dancer or Black Raven wisdomseeker? Worth the wait but too much hype.,4.8
7821,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Tria in Philadelphia, served in a 13 oz tulip glass. The beer poured a vibrant copper color, clear and with a thick off white head that disapated slowly and gave way to a nice ring around the end and a swirly island in the middle. The aroma was a strong pine and citrus nose that was similar to the Elder but kicked up a bit and more pure and extreme but enjoyable. The taste was very similar to the taste. There was the initial hoppy, piney taste with some citrus, grapefruit and a touch of sweet caramel. The mouth feel was very smooth with a nice alcohol burn on the way down that tells you this is a 11% beer. What a smooth ride the Younger was. I was expecting this to be hard to handle but found this very enjoyable and drinkable. I had 2 in this sitting and will go back for more wherever I can find it. Another RR hit and it has been a long time that I have waited to try this.",4.5
8109,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(Draft: O’Brien’s in San Diego, CA) Compared side-by-side with Pliny the Elder, and I think the young whippersnapper is schoolin’ the old man.  This is a very flavorful brew, big, very bitter, grapefruit-like citrus, but also quite fruity with an apparent sweet, orange citrus flavor.  Aromatic grapefruit/hoppy nose is bigger, sweeter, fruitier and more balanced than the Elder.  Thick, sticky, very sweet palate like a barleywine, but with a strong bitter bite to balance it out.  Dark golden in color and a bit hazy in appearance.  The occasional large carbonation bubble speeds to the surface.  The off-white head fades to an island of sheen.  Overall, I am very impressed with this beer, though I’ve tempered my praise just a bit by comparing it with a YuleSmith, and that certainly put things in perspective.",4.0

7947,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler: Pours an orangey golden with an off white ring for head. This is one of the closest thing to hop-juice out there. The aroma is pure hop oils and pine. It’s like having hops in you hands and crushing out the resins between your fingers. Has the pure hop-oil flavor as well without being overly bitter or chaotic. Lemony citrus notes are everywhere, along with a fresh & sweet apricot background. There’s just enough malt to make this hop-juice quaff-able, and the alcohol is well hidden. A pure hop experience, and a top IIPA.",4.4

Went back to my notes, but didn’t really need to:  this one’s really stuck with me, since it’s pretty much the best beer I’ve had.  The balance of citrus, bitter hops and sweetness is extraordinary.  I’ve not had the Dreadnaught, but it is hard for me to imagine a better DIPA.

This was definitely worth the anticipation.  Has a great taste, creamy smooth balance of bitter and sweet.  Notes of citrus.  I think what separates this imperial from other imperials is the creaminess.  I love the harsh hop bitters in imperials but the complex flavors here are balanced so well to reduce that harshness.  Which is likely what makes it so appetizing to so many beer fans.  I will not say it is the best beer I have ever had.  But it is near the top of my list.",4.7

Aroma is huge citrus hop with notes of grapefruit, light orange, and some floral tones as well.  There is also a solid malt backbone on which the hops can perform. Flavor is also saturated with citrus hops; grapefruit, orange, and floral notes.  The malt backbone balances everything out and makes this incredible drinkable 11%.

Full of citrus; grapefruit and pine and other aromas I can’t hardly begin to describe are not only blended perfectly, but are powerful enough to greet your tongue from a foot away. Amazing taste of aforementioned aromas with a strong, yet amazing bitterness. The bitterness seemed like it came in waves; extremely bitter, but only pleasant bitterness, not harsh at all. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a dry finish, leaving you wanting more and more once the explosion of taste leaves your mouth. I would drink the hell out of this if given the opportunity.

Mouthfeel is fairly full as far as DIPAs go, almost a bit oily.  Flavor starts and finishes with the most rounded, balanced yet assertive hop assault I’ve ever tasted.

7531,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"True to the hop-forward roots of California, this one lives up to my expectations of what a ""triple IPA"" should be.  It had the big hop citrus-grapefruit kick at first with a nice and bubbly palate feel as it swirls around on the tastebuds, and finishes off with some smooth maltiness.  Sometimes the supposed double or imperial IPAs are imbalanced with lots of hops along with an ugly, synthetic side, as if it’s the cost of brewing extremes.  Not this one though.  It’s a great, well rounded beverage with big IBUs and some soothing malts too.",3.9

7603,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"The beer pours a medium orange that is surprinsingly clear. The head rises about 3 fingers but falls quickly to a soapy cover. The lacing is light.

The aroma is much lighter than I had anticipated. The aroma is some hops mixed with a little pine and a bit of soap. 

The taste is also pretty light, much lighter than I thought it would be. It starts off a little sweet then goes to a full bitterness throughout. When you start out its a little bitter, but as your drink it, it becomes very drinkable.

The feel is medium in body, a semi dry feel, and a very lasting flavor.

The drinkablility is very high. You can’t notice the 11abv but its highly drinkablility. 

Overall, this beer is really really good. Its smooth, drinkable, and a nice expenience. Its not overally hoppy which is nice. Is it the number 1 beer in the world, no? Is it the best ipa in the world, no? Is it a top 50 beer for me, yeah, its that good.",4.3

7507,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Served on tap at Russian River Brew Pub, Santa Rosa, California Thursday night.  It glows a beautiful, deep, clear, orange color and produces no head, just a thin, white ring around its surface.  I usually like seeing more of a head on this style of beer, but there was something so enticing about its stunning, solid color.  Swirling the glass would immediately bring a white film to the surface, and it would dissipate just as fast as it had appeared.  The aroma is an amazing blast of pine and fresh orange peel ... though not as overpowering as I had anticipated (feared) it would be having never had a triple IPA until now.  On the palate it was full bodied, very slightly sticky, and it’s carbonation danced perfectly in my mouth.  The taste sealed it with a perfect bitter.  This is an intense beer that makes so many bold statements, and yet remains incredibly well balanced and so easy to drink.  I’ve been a fan of Pliny the Elder for years now, but it’s ultimately the impeccable balance of the Younger, and that equally amazing color that’s sets it apart.

I can still taste it. Taste: very brief but intense sweetness, right into extreme, but not over the top bitterness. Overall, there is a great reason for the rating of this beer, it is amazing.

A - Pours clear golden orange with a fluffy one finger tall white head leaving thin sheets of lace down the glass. A very nice looking beer.

S - Smells of fresh cut grapefruits, apricots, pine needles, pungent citric hops and a touch of sweetness creeping in as it warms up. The balance of aromas is very well maintained throughout.

T - Starts off with a ton of tropical fruits - mostly grapefruits, mangos and pineapples - quickly giving way to a mix of strong, bitter citric hops, fresh cut pine and a bit of sweet malt. The balance of this beer is amazing for how big it really is. Finish has plenty of lingering bitterness, clinging to the pallet long after the finish.

M - Medium-Light body with a well balanced flavor and moderate carbonation. Bitterness is surprisingly mild, lingering on the pallet for quite awhile.

Overall
It is said that this was a QDH TIPA. There were signs which suggested that this beer was a hugely improved version of DDH PTE - sweetness, floral, corn, ripe fruits, refreshing bitterness, etc. The improvement is mainly about the mouthfeel - such thick and creamy, without any peppery pungency. This beer is extremely easy drinking and enjoyable, especially for sweet enthusiasts.  A redefinition of West Coast IPA!
据说这是款四倍干投的三倍IPA。有一些迹象表明这款酒是DDH PTE的魔改版——可以感受到甜度、花香、玉米味、成熟的果味还有清爽的苦度等一脉相承的特征。改进之处主要在于口感，如此的厚重而又细腻，没有丝毫的椒麻感。这款酒极其的易饮且愉悦，尤其是对于甜渣党而言。它重新定义了西海岸IPA！

But it was worth it to join this club.  Beer pour dark golden, with good head retention.  HOPPY aroma, and hoppier still taste, to the point where it controls your entire palate while you sip.  It’s a full-out, well-balanced, hop attack.  Mouthfeel is thick and there’s so much hop character that the malt, for all its glory, has a bit of trouble keeping up with the hops!  That’s the only thing that holds this back but I know for most of us, thats not a bad thing.  Fantastic brew.",4.5

Najbardziej poszukiwane IPA na świecie. Przez RateBeer określane jako Double IPA. Przez Untappd jako Triple IPA. 
Po raz pierwszy wypuszczone już w 2005 roku!
Piwo do zeszłego roku było dostępne tylko i wyłącznie lane w browarze w Santa Rosa, jeden jedyny dzień w roku, w lutym. Długie kolejki beer geeków wyczekiwały godzinami na możliwość spróbowania tego majstersztyku.
W zeszłym i w tym roku właściciele browaru, małżeństwo Natalie i Vinnie Cilurzo zdecydowali się zabutelkować Pliniusza. 
W 2021 roku do szerokiej palety chmieli dołączył nowy chmiel - Elixir. 

Pliniusz Młodszy nalewa się z białą, puszystą jak śnieg pianą, która powolutku osuwa się w dół zostawiając umiarkowanej ilości krążki.
Kolorek złoty, czysty, klarowny.
Już po zdjęciu brandowanej czapeczki czuć siłę i intensywność chmielu. Pachnie fenomenalnie - żywica, igiełki sosnowe, las, lawina cytrusów, z których najmocniej wyczuwalne są pomarańcze i mandarynki. Przyjemna słodowość, a zaraz za nią minimalne kwiatowe nutki. Po ogrzaniu w dłoniach jeszcze więcej żywicznych detali. 
Smak bucha intensywnością, a zarazem zaskakuje lekkością i gładkością doznań.
Intensywnie iglasty, leśny z elementami igiełek sosnowych. Potęga cytrusów: mandarynek, grejpfrutów, pomarańczy przypieczętowana elementami ananasa. Goryczka konkretna, ale w żadnym stopniu nie  przytłaczająca.
Arcymistrzowski balans. Ciało potężne i zbite. Raz goryczkowe, raz słodkie, raz cytrusowe, raz kwiatowe, raz żywiczne. Całość połączona w niezapomniany obrazek. 
Doskonałe, niezapomniane doświadczenie. 
Hype is real!😍🤩🔥💥🍻",4.7
7368,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Had this on tap on Saturday. Was expecting much more from the hype this beer has but I was not at all dissapointed. This is pretty much an amped up Pliny the Elder. I had Elder right after and Elder tasted like water in comparison. Definitely the most balanced triple IPA I’ve ever had.,4.5
7724,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Wow what an amazing beer. Thanks to Mike and Diane for sending this out to DuffmanSW. I lost my notebook with the rating so I’m gonna wing it. Poured a clear golden color with beautiful head. Aroma was very very fresh hops, very floral and sweet with lots of pineapple and dank marijuana. Taste was like Elder on steroids with some alcohol present, super sweet and sticky with nice malty balance. Well balanced triple IPA that left a tiny bitterness on the pallet but a great aftertaste. One of my favorites.",5.0
8031,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"The Elder’s little brother that can certainly kick your butt 8 ways to next Wednesday.  I had this at Liar’s Club and was pretty damn excited about it.  In small doses, this is a gem.  If I drank this all day, I’d certainly get into heaps of trouble.  This is a fine example of hop gravy.  I’d love to see this and Maharaja in a steel cage match in my backyard with me as the referee who doesn’t pay too much attention to dirty moves.",4.2
7986,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Hand Bottle shared by moejuck at C-Bus 6: Clear orange/gold in color with a white head. Aroma, pine, grapefruits, some citrus, a bit of alcohol and some orange. Flavor, some slight caramel up front, loads of citrus and piny. A touch of heat. Incredibly bitter, dripping with juicy hop notes. Some resinous qualities as well. Fantastic beer, I can only imagine what this is like fresh on tap. It would probably dethrone fresh Dreadnaught for me.",4.5
7756,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(growler thanks to thickfreakness) pours clear yellow orange with very light ring of bubbles. Nose of big juicy citrus, oranges, pineapples, tons of hops. Taste of oranges, grapefruit, So much hop presence. The finish is delicious citrus. Love it.",4.0
7797,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draft at capones and tria: Poured into a small snifter. Golden orange in color, good head. Awesome aroma of bitter hops. Taste is bitter as hell. A Grapefruit and citrus bomb. But its still well balanced. Its even bitter in the aftertaste, dry clean finish though. No trace of the 11 percent alcohol. Overall a great DIPA, but not the best I have ever had.",4.2
7831,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Massive hop bite, with enough taste, it almost chokes you off with hoppiness. Pours a burst orange with trace of fogginess. great balance.",4.4
8003,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On draft at Toronado.  Wow.  Hops, hops and more hops.  Great beer.  Intense citrus hop flavor.",4.3
7850,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler courtesy of my hero tpd975. Wow! I finally get to try this. Thanks Greg. Pours crystral clear deep gold with nice off white head. The aroma is huge with tangelo, apricot, mango and sweet orange citrus like hops that demand another whiff. There’s also a nice foundation of smooth sweet malts from which the huge hop aromatics have been erected. The taste is much the same with tangelo, apricot and mango all seemingly oozing with pure perfectly ripe citrus-like juices. The very late addition hop flavors slowly give way to evenly smooth yet decidedly bold hop bitterness that grows right to the finish. Even with a solid slick sweet malty backbone the full force hop flavor and bitterness don’t let up until deep into the after taste. Simply amazing. This one is bangin’ on all cylinders and more than lives up to what I was expecting.",4.6
8009,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Way too sweet, this is hopped sugar. Honeyed malt with extreme residual sugar. I would prefer to see this much drier. Big hop profile all of the way through. Sugar and hop resin finish with the sugar overpowering all.",3.4
7862,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"I didn’t think I’d ever get a chance to try this bad boy so big thanks to golubj for sending it and to maxxdaddy for sharing it.  Deep golden amber beer with a thick sticky white head.  Aroma is freaking awesome.  A huge blast of fresh grapefruity hop oils and bright piny resin.  Tropical fruit, hoppy spice and a lot of alternation between fruity citrus and brash pine.  Sticky, tooth-coating hop oils on the palate that just fill your mouth with sweet hoppy goodness.  This is like sucking on delicious alcoholic pine cones.  Very chewy, very intense and still manages to keep everything under control.  Massive bitterness, but it’s so damn good that I just can’t stop drinking it.  I drank this much more quickly than I probably should have.  Beers often fail to live up to the hype surrounding them... not so here.  Mmmm, mmmm, this is tasty stuff.",4.8
7408,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at the Bistro DIPA festival. 
Aroma is nice with a lot of grapefruit, citrus, pine resin and tropical and stone fruit. Medium light malt notes with hints of caramel and honey. Some medium light alcohol spice. 
Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange with a moderately sized, thick, white head with good retention. 
Flavor is moderately sweet with a medium light malt character with hints of caramel that help hide the alcohol. High bitterness with a high hop character and medium light alcohol spice. The hops and malt help hide the alcohol well. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really nice triple IPA. I forgot how good it is. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer isn’t too sweet. Lots of hop character.",4.3
7846,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler in trade from madorb.  Thanks!  Pours a clear amber color with a lasting beige head.  Smell is big piney hops and some fruitiness.  Taste is quite hoppy and bitter with fruity orange and grapefruit along with pine.  Touch more hoppy and bitter than Pliny the Elder, but not any better and less drinkable.  Medium body and carbonation.  Certainly great, but definitely not my favorite DIPA.  Flavor wasn’t quite as good as PTE, and I’m glad that the other one is readily available rather than this.",4.0
7872,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Handbottle. Aroma of peach, pineapple, grass, mango, generally tropical, pine kicks in as it warms, and always sweet malt there too, seemingly also throwing in some similarly citrusy esters, but really, it’s hard for me to say what notes are the hops versus the esters here. Big, in any case. Flavor resinous, extremely bitter, despite the huge malt that tries so hard to balance it out. I must say it’s a bit on the hot side, but there’s so much else here that I’m more noting than complaining. Though based on this handbottle sample I’d say I prefer the Elder, who really cares with a 4.3 score.",4.3
7801,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"growler brought forth by the illustrious sparky27...


golden amber pour with a soapy white head and an abundance of spotty lacing. 

it smells fan-fukking-tastic!!! bitter pine, orange pith, grapefruit and flowers mix with honey, caramel and malt. alcohol plays a role as it warms up a bit. seriously the best thing i’ve ever smelled in a glass!

the flavor... well, it cannot live up to the aroma... it is on the sweet side with a medium to full body  thinned with alcohol, bitter and resin to make it exceedingly easy to keep drinking (and getting terribly d-runk!). delicious. 10/4/8/5/17/4.4",4.4
7689,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at the Falling Rock in Denver and out of a kick ass growler thanks to Bill. Both times the experience was the same. Pours a crystal clear, golden body with a creamy, finger-width, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a veil of lacing throughout the session. The aroma is incredible. Tons of fresh, dank, oily hops. Resiny pines, sweet citrus, passion fruit, mango, florals, dense earth, herbs, and melons with a touch of caramel. A fantastic aroma. Flavor is a hop explosion as well and fairly sweet. Tons of bright, piney, grassy citruses, wet and dank earth, flowery tropical fruits, resins, a touch of honey, and a decent amount of caramel. Finishes dry and bitter with a very lengthy, oily, and resiny aftertaste. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Not a bad balance at all for such an explosion of hops and no hint of alcohol until a slight warmth shows up in the throat. Overall, this definitely lives up to the hype. Hoppy as shit with an outstanding aroma. A pleasure both from the tap and the growler. Awesome DIPA.",4.3
7537,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Nice golden like color with a nice small but creamy looking off white head. Aroma was amazing tons of pineapple, citrus, and pine. Taste is similar to Pliny the Elder but a little ""thicker"".  Full mouthfeel.",4.3
7887,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draft at O’Brien’s Russian River night.  I tried this brew years ago before I really knew what it was all about, been waiting for a while for it to come back around.  Pours a clear deep golden color with a 2 finger white head that left tons of lacing.  Enormous nose of fresh citrus and piny hops, good malt balance to back up all those hops.  Flavor was sweet, bitter, hoppy.........a lot of stuff......amazing.",4.5
7878,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Thanks to Bobby91w for the handbottle.  Hazy bright yellow pour with a fluffy white head.  Pungent resinous citrus nose.  Excellent hop profile flavor dominated by tropical fruit and sweet malts.  Extremely well balanced,4.2
6665,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2013 bottle shared with a few friends pours bitch black and thick, excellent aroma of soy and dark chocolate and sweet dart fruit.",4.6
6755,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,The standard BA dark lord might be the best because it is like dark lord that has mellowed and had an infusion of some oak and vanilla flavors that tone it down.,3.9
6808,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"This sample was a Heaven Hill.  Very dark.  Smells like cat kibble.  Bleh. Tastes rich, whiskeyish, balanced with super roasty character and lots of sweet malts.  Intense.",3.9
6680,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle. Thx dolle. 278/420 2012. Pours deep black with a brown head. Aroma dark chocolate, vanilla, burbon, wood, cocoa, light malts, what a balance. Taste is smooth, vanilla, wood, dark chocolate. Very balanced wauw.",4.5

6948,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"DLD 2008. 1200th rating to be entered... what a coincidence! Pours black with no head. Flows very thick. Sweet, lots of bourbon. Some vanilla and lots of alcohol. Very good.",4.1
6984,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,DL day after a 1 hr wait. That was damn well worth it. A black/brown pour that looks like chocolate syrup with a nice small head of dark brown foam. An aroma of oaked bourbon chocolate just like mom used to make:0 A sweet chocolate flavor without the ton of bitter I expected. Chocolate dominates the flavor. The abv is almost not detectable. Just the slightest bit of warmth for me. A very good solid all over mouthfeel just enough carbonation to feel. I would describe the carbonation as soft. A most excellent beer. Second best thing besides seeing and meeting a ton of good people at DL day. Wow what a beer.,4.7
6863,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"On tap at DLD 2010. Pour into a 10 oz plastic cup. Super dark appearance with no present head. Very viscous, leaves an oily film on the side of the glass when swirled. Smell is primarily of oak and bourbon but you still get the chocolate, coffee and molasses undertones in the brew. Taste is of chocolate and coffee up front meshing into a long oak and bourbon finish. Super smooth imperial stout with a long lasting chocolate taste. I can’t believe how different this tastes from the regular dark lord. So far, best beer I have ever tasted.",4.7
6946,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Draft @ DLD 08:  This is as black as Pinhead’s soul and about as relentless and abusing.  MASSIVE oak and bourbon nose but surprisingly did not cover up the other subtleties...dark fruits, vanilla, dark malts, tobacco and coffee.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, I believe this to be very well balanced as far as the oak/bourbon goes...didn’t seem too cloyingly sweet and was unbelievably drinkable.  The thickest brew I’ve ever had and the best.",5.0

6905,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Not as good as the vanilla-bean aged and by nature of how thick and hard to consume in any appreciable quantities, I’d even say it’s not as good as the original, but it’s an interesting twist on the original to be sure.  Really tasty.",4.6
6956,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,On tap at DLD’08.  Glad to get some.  I heard the ran out.  Lots of molasses and bourbon in the nose.  Taste is sweet and loaded with bourbon. Very black with no head.  Very drinkable.,4.6
6951,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"I like regular Dark Lord better than the oak aged.  This seems to be true for any beer I try that is oak aged.  I either can’t tell a big difference or it just adds alcohol flavor.  For me the it doesn’t add much to it other than that.  It’s still good, but I just prefer the regular or vanilla bean.",4.1
6712,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Russian style Imperial Stout ... WAAAAHHUUUUU. Den er vild. Ligner tjære, når den siver langsomt ud af flasken. Olie sort og fed nærmest uden skum og stort set ingen kulsyre. Næse af lakrids, kaffe og kirsebær. Smagen er en eksplosion af krydderi, anis, kaffe, jord og overmodne skovfrugt. Sødlig, men med tilpas bitterhed til balancen.

7008,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pours a black deep ruby highlights- with the head consisting of just an oily film.  Oak barrel, bourbon, vanilla, earthy and dirty with some yeastiness, intense chocolate and roasted malts with hints of coffee and a bit of alcohol towards the end.  Chewy and sweet with tons of caramel flavor and raw sugary sweetness, fruity, bourbon, oak, light on the chocolate and coffee.  Very full and thick mouthfeel, chewy and syrupy.

The strong bourbon aroma was hoppy malty and did I mention bourbon? The thick malty mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a strong malty bourbon flavored aftertaste. The sweet vinous flavor contained notes of bourbon and dark malt. Delicious and one I would certainly love to have again.  All Hail The Dark Lord for he shall return!",4.2

6771,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"750mL bottle, pours jet black with a small light brown head. Aroma brings out the bourbon barrels upfront, some slight vanilla notes, some subtle chocolate notes. Flavour is insanely complex, with big dark fruits especially raisins – shitloads of them, complex bourbon notes, and slight vanilla. Incredibly rich and complex, with no hint of the 15% ABV. The barrels don’t destroy the base Dark Lord at all, but rather build and re-direct this into a new beast. A special treat this is. Great beer. If you’re lucky enough to try this, you’re in for a treat, but the hype is surely responsible for this beer’s average.",4.2

The nose is big sweet sticky Dark Lord, completely going one on one with the oak.  Tannins are heavy, but no heavier than the sweet alcohol, chocolate, vanilla, alcohol, and roast.  The mouthfeel is as thick as a solution can be.  The flavors are as to be expected, insane.  Basically just like I imagined, only with more oak, and not as  screwed up as I thought it would be.  This is an actual improvement to Dark Lord!  Splendid.",4.4
6697,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Great Taste of the Midwest on August 08. The pour is used motor oil with a dark brown ring of head and a viscous glass color changing clinginess. The aroma is big chocolate malts and bourbon. A lot of oakiness and vanilla. Heavy soy comes through on the end, especially as it warms. The flavor is good, but it’s dominated by soy sauce. There is a nice malt and chocolate with a great bourbon coming through. Oak and vanilla are delicious but the soy sauce is a touch off putting. The mouth feel is thick and viscous with a heavy soft carbonation. The soy sauce dominates. Lingeringly thick and chewy with a completely controlling soy sauce again on the way out. Could be amazing, but the soy just won’t let it.",4.4

Huge explosion of a thick dark head that sat atop the beer for the 1/2 hour thatit ook to sip through everything going on here.  Fairl viscous notwithstanding having sat in a barrel of bourbon saturated wood for a year.  Huge overtones of cherries, vanilla molasses and roasted coffee.  Slight tang and bite from the everpresent bourbon flavor that linered long after the first sip.  The aging allowed the flavors to meld with the coffee bite from the ’05 batch mellowing significantly.  A true gem.",4.9

I savored this sample for the next 30-45 minutes, as I made my way through the crowds.  The pour was thick and brown-black like molasses.  The aroma was intoxicating, with a faint whiff of alcohol, coffee, dried fruit, and caramel.  The malty sweetness combined with the coffee notes was superb.  Heck, I’d almost put a bit of this on a bowl of high quality vanilla ice cream (if I was insane, that is).  It is experiences like this that make me a fan of this style.",4.6

One of the better barrel beers that I’ve had. I don’t give out perfect scores, and the only detractor was that a small fleeting head would have fit the style better. Undoubtedly this was from the re-bottle so figure my appearance score upwards in your head if you choose to.
Black, oily and coating the glass as it’s swirled.
Rich alcoholic yet restrained bourbon aroma. Notes of licorice and raisins come easily. This is one that can be enjoyed for the aroma alone. I don’t like bourbon, but there is plenty of good Imperial Stout aroma so that the bourbon doesn’t take this one over.
Thick, sweet, smooth and very well balanced by roasty bitterness. Again, very well done and one of the better attempts to meld a Big Imperial Stout and a barrel that I’ve had. Thanks Matt for the chance to share and try this one!",4.1

7062,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thick, robust black with a huge, charred brown head.  The aroma was pretty sweet, full of bourbon, vanilla, burnt grains, light coffee, tons of cocoa, some light caramel, mild carbon/charcoal, woody tannins and more whiskey/alcohol.  The body is big, syrupy and smooth as hell, with definite barrel-aged smoothness.  The flavor is sweet with definite signs of whiskey-barrel aging; however, the charred malts and coffee elements still maintain some presence.  I’m generally not a huge fan of whiskey-barrel aged anything, but this has been one of the better examples.  The hugeness of the base Dark Lord is enough that it is probably the best candidate for long-term aging in these sorts of barrels.  Pretty damn good.",4.2

Clung to the sides of the glass it got poured into. Very tight brown head with black appearance. Highly viscous mouthfeel. Temperature effects did accentuate the bourbon nature as time went by, but only enhanced the deepness of flavors in another direction. From chocolate-coffee-cherry to oak-leather-alcohol bitterness.

6814,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Reviewed from notes the day after DLD ’11.  I actually enjoyed this beer today at the brewpub. They still had one keg left when they opened this morning. The menu said that it was 2010 DL aged for one year in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. The nose was of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and light bourbon. The vanilla and bourbon were predominant but neither was overpowering. The flavors were nice and superbly well meshed. The chocolate and bourbon finished quite well together. It was exceptionally smooth, perfect in body. This beer was fantastic.",4.8

The flavor is so complex and and layered, with one smell/flavor coming one after the next; the layering is so incredible. So full bodied that your mouth feels sticky afterwards, but so tasty too.

Thick and coating. Low carbonation, big body, well balanced. ABV is there but it is later that it catches up to me.

T: The oak aging gives this one a bit of a tannic character and some bitterness that the original does not exhibit. The bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors are quite strong but still allow the chocolate, roast, licorice, and dark fruits to show.

M: The body is thick and chewy with a low, smooth carbonation.

The body was thick as all get out, it was tempered a bit by the oak, but the vanilla actually blew the pretense that this is anything close to a balanced beer. The vanilla reminded me of the woeful lack of attenuation and this beer was a sticky sweet mess that I could hardly drink. The flavor was vanilla dominated and it accentuated the high residual sugars, there was the rest of the typical DL flavors, but the vanilla was the straw that broke the camels back.

8301,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"2013 Vintage, bottle 428/711

Split with my friend Keith who attended DLD with me this year. Served in a FFF mini-snifter. Reviewed from notes. 

A- Upon pouring, a mocha head quickly appears and dies down within 30 seconds, leaving a ring of foam around the rim of the glass. The color is opaque black, thick like motor oil. 

S- The first thing I can smell is a very strong bourbon barrel presence, but it is quickly joined by vanilla, coffee, and a sweet molasses like aroma. Excellent aroma, it definitely invites you to take a drink.

T- I don’t think it would be possible to use any more descriptors for this beer. Black cherries, prunes, vanilla, followed by some tobacco and caramel with bourbon strong on the finish. There is a lingering sweetness that is very familiar from regular dark lord on the back end, and surprisingly little to no alcohol bite, even with the bourbon flavor being so apparent. There is no detectable hop bitterness. 

M- Silky smooth, yet very thick at the same time. This is definitely a sipper, but it is very easy to drink. Low-medium carbonation is right on for the style. The flavors linger and change over the incredibly long finish, definitely over a minute later I can still taste the beer. 

O- This is a very enjoyable, incredibly complex beer. I’m glad I hadn’t drank anything before this, because it was such a pleasure to really get into this beer and enjoy the full range of flavors you can get from it. The bourbon is there on the nose and finish, but the vanilla really outshines it, at least in my opinion. I’m sure that will die down with time, although I think this is simply amazing as it is right now. It was an honor to drink this beer, so very glad I was able to score one this year!",4.8

8433,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Draft sample at Dark Lord Day 2010.  I was crestfallen a little earlier when I had heard that the Vanilla Dark Lord was gone; my only goal of the day besides getting my bottles and having fun with my pals was to try this.  Then someone nearby pointed out a guy who had a little bit left.  It was good timing because I had my Kate the Great bottle cracked open to share, so I ran over and bullied the guy into trading a pour for a pour.  He instead gave me what was left in the glass (maybe 2-3 ounces) and said he couldn’t finish it and didn’t care for any KTG.  Fine by me!  Granted, the bottom of his plastic cup sample wasn’t ideal, but still a fantastic beer emerged.  Dark, opaque brown, with remnants of a brown head.  Big vanilla notes on top of the Dark Lord’s coffee, milk and dark chocolate, dark fruits, earthy notes, and molasses.  I’m an absolute sucker for vanilla aromas but the flavor doesn’t always match the sweet goodness; this was the case here, though not by a ton.  Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a smooth, rich, sticky mouthfeel.  I thought the sweet vanilla detracted a little bit from the normal (and very sweet) Dark Lord, whereas the oak version adds a special element to it.  Don’t get me wrong, this is amazing and needs to be tried; it just doesn’t match the others. Re-Rate: Downgrading this a little bit after trying 347/934 of the 2012 series, the most sober I’ve been when I tried it. It had a very sweet candy note on the nose above vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Flavor of chocolate-covered cherries, vanilla, oak, caramel, and molasses. Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, smooth mouthfeel. Great, but not as good as I remembered.",4.4

8485,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Enjoyed at FFF pub on Dark Lord Day ’09. Pours from the tap to a very brownish=black color with thin skim of a dark brown head that lingers thru mid-glass. Aroma is an overwhelmingly pleasant mix of vanilla, roasted nuts, chocolate and molasses, with just the right amount of the 14% alcohol. Mouthfeel is almost syrupy full, and the vanilla explodes in the taste. Nice, long warming finish. Didn’t enjoy quite as much as the Bourbon Barrel aged DL, but a damn good beer.",4.2

8446,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Tasted at Dark Lord Day 2010, out of a wee plastic cup instead of the recommended snifter.  This was incredibly thick beer.  More like molasses or a milkshake than beer, really.  Without a doubt, the thickest brew I’ve ever tasted.  Get it yet?  It’s freakin’ THICK!

The nose was very nice.  The vanilla comes through, here, but it is well complemented by the roast and chocolate flavors, as well as a fair smack-in-the-face from the alcohol.

Flavor was huge and bold.  Perhaps too much so?  The vanilla is very big in the flavor, perhaps to a fault.  Not bad, of course.  Just too much vanilla, in my opinion.  Then again, I""m not the biggest vanilla fan.  On a positive note, the use of real vanilla bean, rather than an extract or something else, really does make a difference, as the quality of the vanilla is notable.

Overall, a very big, very good beer.  For those who enjoy vanilla more than I, this could very well be paradise.  For me, it was a nice new way to try the Dark Lord.",4.3
8230,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Poured from bomber into a big ol' snifter. Thin head that dissipates quickly. A terrific aroma of bourbon, chocolate, coconut (I'm guessing from the vanilla but if came through as coconut), and some soy sauce. Mouthfeel is excellent. Beer is slightly syrupy but also has a pleasant thinness to it. Nice and oily. Flavor is very sweet. Bourbon barrel is supremely integrated and even throughout. Vanilla is more subtle than expected and only contributes on the back end. You really only notice it if you look for it, but when you find it, it's quite nice. This is a mature, sophisticated beer with many element expertly weaves together. However, the sweetness is just too much for me. Best to be had in small quantities.",4.2

8161,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Shared bottle. Not much in a way of appearance - dark brown thick liquid with virtually no foam, something you would expect from such a big beer. Rich and complex aroma dominated by vanilla and bourbon over the black chocolate and coffee notes common to imperial stouts in general. Tastes as complex as it smells, with vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel and coffee nuances playing in tandem and changing one another with every moment passing since the first sip. A truly magnificent dessert beer that provokes deep introspection and will make you think about the meaning of life while trying to get to the end of the aftertaste.",4.5

8220,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Bomber (many thanks, dustbunny, for opening this gem). A super-heavy dark chocolate tone dominates the aroma and is joined by sweet vanilla, boozy bourbon, cocoa buttercream frosting, a slight touch of phenols (wet campfire), and a balsamic whisper. Pours very dark brown with nearly no head. The taste is wonderfully smooth and layered, with rich vanilla, decedent chocolate, toffee, hot booze, caramel, and a slightly earthy bitterness. The flavors complement each other perfectly. Beyond smooth texture (almost slick); very hot and dry finish. A whale that exceeds the hype; I like it even better than the port barrel version, which recently wowed me.",4.4

Thick sticky palate.  Rich chocoalte flavors where the dark fruits show themselves a little more.  Brown sugar, dark chocolate, raisins, dark fruit, and vanilla.  The beer coats my mouth and the rich bittersweet chocolates stay around after I swallow.  Really sweet but excellent. 9/5/9/5/17 = 4.5

It just sticks to the plastic glass and has pretty much stained it!  This beer has a really sweet aroma with rich caramel maltiness underneath TONS of real vanilla.  The flavor is very much like the aroma.  It is very sweet with caramel, vanilla, and a pretty high level of alcohol and just a hint of bourbon.  It has a mellow and milky texture and goes down smooth, but sticks to everything else.  Overall, this beer is really, really good, but almost too sweet.

I could literally pour this over ice cream.",5.0
8405,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Huge thanks to Diego for scoring a very well-kept handbottle of this.

That out of the way, I’d like to say that I think this beer symbolizes a lot of what is wrong with certain elements of craft beer today.  It smells fucking divine, vanilla beans for miles and miles and some hot cocoa swirled in and a touch of bourbon.  But the taste is pure sugar, under-attenuated as all hell and almost impossible to keep down in more than the tiniest sips.  There’s extreme, and then there’s over-the-top, and VB DL strikes me as more of the latter.  I’m giving it a 3.0 because it would make a great candle wax or Febreeze.

On draft at Hunahpu day, this beer was legit really really good.  I’ve become a fan.",4.1
8435,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"I got to taste a couple of sample pours while standing in line at DLD thanks to the friendly folks in Columbus who were able to get a couple of full cups out of the brewpub. Re-poured into a 4 ounce tasting glass.
Milky off black color. Beer still had a thin brown collar around the rim.
Tons of Vanilla, boozy alcohol and very sweet syrupy aromas. I took a couple of whiffs of this -- very pleasant on the nose. This tasted like a frozen ice cream drink with creme de cacao (such as a Brandy Alexander) that had melted. 
Very thick and rich, low carbonation. Mouthfeel was very much like melted milkshake -- certainly interesting but not what I want in a beer. Very chalky, chocolate finish. I realize drinkability is not the same as availability, but how drinkable can a beer be that’s only available at one place for about 45 minutes a year, and then only in 3 ounce pours? I consider this a gimmicky beer -- if it were more readily available it would be something you would want to try once, but then move on to something that taste more like beer than a vanilla milkshake.",2.6

8487,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap at DLD ’09, served into a goblet.  Holy cow! This aroma is nothing short of heavenly.  Fresh vanilla galore, creamy ice cream, bourbon and roasted bourbon wood, malted cocoa, coffee beans, subtle citrus undertones.  I didn’t want to start drinking, it smelled so good.  Zero head from the pour.  Black.  A dark wood colored outer ring with some small stagnant carbonation bubbles.  As thick as it gets, and rather mysterious looking.  But really, upon sipping, how can a beer this big, be so smooth? A really unbelievable feel, super thick, leaving flavor everywhere.  Just great for sipping.  Aroma really did not lie about how this one would taste.  Quite similar actually, as the flavors feed off the aroma very well.  Vanilla syrup, roasted bourbon cream, the best black malts I’ve ever had, a thick woody bitter to back up the sweetness of minor 3fs herbal and citrus.  The hop backing fits in with everything so well, making this a very well balanced beer.  Other notes of warm cocoa and roasted black coffee.  Sweet till the end, but its never too much like it was last year, with just the perfect amount of vanilla.  A decent amount better than the other two versions, this was probably the best imperial stout I have ever had.  Wonderful!",4.7

Deep ebony thick black pour with no head.  Smell is vanilla ice cream and oak and chocolate cake.  I liked the Oak aged DL better without the vanilla, but there is less present obvious alcohol in this one (the vanilla takes it over).  Thick creamy big palate.  Overall, nice and bold but I am not the biggest fan of big vanilla flavor.",3.8

8366,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Rating #600. 2012 bottle won at DLD ’12 and shared with eWestern and AndyReynolds the following month. 
 
 I hate it when I give in to the hype of these over priced Three Floyds beers.  I resent the fact that I had to pay $50 for a beer that I ""won"" in a lottery.  However, splitting with two other great friends, and the fact the beer is absolutely amazing, pretty much eases the pain.  

 I was going to describe all of the nuances of this beer, but I’ve decided that I’m too lazy right now.  I will just say that, this is my favorite bourbon barrel aged beer that I know to exist.  It also seems to the most appropriate use of a vanilla bean that is known to mankind.  Two years in a row, well played Three Floyds.",4.7

8332,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap at CBC, pours black with a small ring of tan head. Aroma brings out loads of vanilla beans, which dominate, moderate bourbon barrels, and lots of silky chocolate coming through. Flavour is super rich, bringing out very rich vanilla beans which have taken centre stage, along with subdued bourbon notes, and rich chocolate. Super complex, and although very sweet, not cloying in any way. Very rich and viscous. Might be considered a cloying mess to some, but I think it’s great. Excellent, but no where near the hype and rarity.",4.2

8534,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"The closet thing to a perfect beer I have ever had. Flat out delicious in every possible way. Pours thick and heavy. So black that it stains the cup. No lacing. Aroma is yeaty and full of chcolate and vanilla, some bread, cherries, and candy as well. Richness everywhere, in the aroma and taste. This one is creamy as creamy can be, just incredibly smooth...thick, but never TOO thick, a perfect mouthfeel.  Flavor is f’n delicious. Thick and chewey, with lots of roasted barley, vanilla, chocolate covered cherries, cocoa powder, oak, and yeast, also notes of coffee. Some dark fruit and syrup notes as well. Roasted malts make themselves known at times, but the vanilla and chocolate covered cherries pack the punch. Alcohol is present, but doesn’t feel like 14% whatsoever, but everything else is bold, yet smooth and totally drinkable. Flavors swirl in your mouth and are constantly changing, even the same mouthful will evolve before you swallow. The vanilla is always present, but only adds complexity and flavor, it never dominates. Very warming, but never at the expense of the brew itself. Everything strikes a great balance in getting the beer to feel and taste exactly as it should. This one is thick, oily, and bold. The vanilla beans are the PERFECT compliment to DL, and should be an actual ingredient. This beer is like drinking heaven.",5.0

8419,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Had on tap at Dark Lord Day 2009. 

A: Very dark, nearing black, with a small dark tan head.

S: Very similar to regular Dark Lord, but not with an overpowering--in a very, very good way--scent of vanilla. 

T: Vanilla, vanilla, vanilla. Wow. Tastes of vanilla cake, brown sugar, hints of chocolate. Dark malts galore as hints of coffee and sweetness make their way through. 

M: Unbelievably smooth. Little carbonation and sublimely creamy. Again, only modest hints of the presumably-high abv.

D: Simply put, this is by far the best damn beer that I have ever had. Hats off to Three Floyds for taking one of the best beers in the world and making it exponentially better.

8516,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Didn’t put pen to paper all that much this year at the Taste, but I figured I’d be insane not to rate this one. Draft. Dark, melted milk chocolate, toasted vanilla bean, wet, and slightly charred wood on the nose. I thought the vanilla would be more prevalent, but the insane amount of chewy malt and wet wood overpowered most of the vanilla. Pours the standard DL looking thick, sticky, oily jet black with no head. Flavor is chock full of loads and loads of sticky, chewy, thick chocolate.  Just a hint of vanilla.

6363,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(bottle shared at the RBSG brunch) Pours jet black with a dark tan head that quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass. Aroma is very potent, and the maple syrup really dominates proceedings, and it serves to mask the coffee component underneath, which improves the beer as I can smell some vegetal snap pea and green bell scents emanating from the coffee undertone. With more air, some sweeter scents of Reese’s peanut butter cups, walnuts, and raisins make their presence known, which does improve things. The flavor also heavily emphasizes the maple syrup, and along with that is an abundant amount of chocolate, peanut butter cup, and roasted malt. Very sweet. The coffee again is pretty suppressed by the sweeter flavors but some ash and greenness is evident towards the finish, although it’s not nearly as glaring as it is in the aroma.

The taste is unbelievable. Heavy coffee, that unbelievable maple, a great chocolate, moderate vanilla, and a light bourbon presence. This baby tastes like a maple-soaked coffee fudge. My god.

Taste was huge coffee. Can’t understate how much coffee flavor is in there. Probably more than the average extra dark roast coffee from the local coffee cafe. Has lots of sweet maple flavor to cut through the coffee. One thing I didn’t like was that is was kind of tart. This might have been the coffee though. Still, I didn’t care for the tart taste.",4.7

The aroma is just fantastic with notes of maple right off the bat, molassess, some dark chocolate, and roast. Heavy mouthfeel, chewy. As in the aroma, the flavor starts off with a sweet maple syrup note which transitions to a dark coffee note at the end. It literlly is like eating and maple pancake and then taking a big drink of your fresh brewed coffee. I will say that this beer is fairly sweet though, I could probably slolwy drink a whole bottle over the sourse of an hour or so but for this occassion 4-6oz was perfect.

Such a huge banana desert component to this I could compare it to just about any sweet cream + banana combination. Bananas foster? Sure. Banana split? Why not. Big sweet creamy bananas. Not a bad thing really, but this beer is sticky sweet. Carbonation is dialed in perfect for the style. For a desert beer, this is well above average.

Tastes more like a beer, oily, roast bitterness comes out at first, then maple sweetness comes with chocolate. Coffee beans, lightly drier finish, maple also present in the linger.

The aroma was multitudes of dark fruit and chocolate and toffee and brown sugar. The appearance was beautiful to look at as it was incredibly dark (stout like?) with little light passing thru but what did was a deep purlple, almost eggplant like purple to it. The taste is almost liquer like, with a sweetness to match the dark fruity-spicyness that is velvety soft on the tongue.

 I return to this beer after another 1000 or so rates. I was worried I might not like it as much. No way - it’s still #1, but the Pannepot Grand Reserva is a close second....must open the Westy 12 soon.....Just phenomenol 9/4/10/5/19 4.7



Appearance is dark brown-amber with golden amber edges on glass. Pours with off white head that dissipates to a thin layer. Aroma is exceptional and complex - raisins soaked in alcohol with gentle fruit cake spices, sherry notes, hint of roast malt, dark spice sugar. The flavour enhances the aroma,  so complex and interesting, everything is blended so well with just the right amount of alcohol. Each sip brings something new - I feel as though I am drinking something antique - reminds one of the whiff of resin off old furniture (it’s not in the beer - it gives a memory of it !). The carbonation is just right, the mouthfeel rich. The finish is complex, warm and smooth with spicy hops and fruity raisin - pure nectar. This beer is incredible, so beautifully crafted and so hard to describe in words, but so wonderful.  10/4/10/5/19 4.8 [240611]",4.7

A lot more alcohol showing up in the Rochefort 10 than in the Rochefort 8. Wonderful taste with figs, roasted malt, aniseed (not noticeable in the rochefort 8), nougat (which adds a lot to this beer), herbs (I can’t make out which ones, but definitely an excellent blend), pineapple and homemade caramel showing up. A beauty. Deeply pleasant silky mouthfeel. Full bodied. Beautiful lacework. Definetely a lot of alcohol in this beer - which is a little too present for my liking. Especially just before the finish. Huge amounts of licorice appearing in the finish. A great beer - but I enjoyed Rochefort 8 more than than the 10. Additional Comment. Initial rating: March 6, 2007. Rerate August 5, 2008. 8th rating February 11, 2009: Surprisingly pale huge light beige head.  A lot of aniseed in both aroma and flavor. Incredibly complex with hints of sage, pineapple and candy. A lot of reminiscent homemade caramel. Warming alcohol showing up with the swallow. Outstanding. I reveled in every sip. Without a doubt a lot better than Westvleteren Abt 12. Beyond world class.

A bit overpowering, and I don’t find many of hte notes in it others are tasting unfortunately, and, well just to contradict a previous reviewer, I believe I prefer a Trois Pistoles from Unibroue to this - it’s a little smoother and less alcoholic tasting, if memory serves (which it may not).",3.6
20298,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"330ml bottle into a goblet.

Pours an opaque dark ruby, almost black, with a light tan one finger head. Really decent head retention and lacing throughout.

The aroma is full of dark fruits such as plums, raisins, dates, and figs. Is quite vinous with a very red wine-like aroma. Some notes of sherry and cranberry. Quite nice.

The flavor provides even more depth than the aroma. Plums and grapes along with sherry and a hint of vanilla. More dark fruit washes over the palate with some oak and plums. Bitterness is on the moderate side with much of the perceived bitterness provided by the alcohol. It is never harsh but is definitely noticeable providing a nice, pleasing warmth in the chest and throat.

Anyways, on to the beer!  Dark brown, opaque, loads of ""floaties"" massive foamy light brown/tan head. Active carbonation, the bubbles form a honeycomb structure under the foamy head, interesting looking! Sweet malts, toffee, prunes, honey a hint of allspice in the nose. Smooth & creamy, sweet toffee & raisins, like a new flavor of ice cream topped with spiced rum, cotton candy, traces of hazelnut....there’s so many flavors at once plus the alcohol sneaks in after the swallow to make its presence known. Thick & chewy, a delicious dessert beer and another fine example of why Belgian Quads are one of (if not my absolute) favorite style.

Head diminishes but there was some head right to the end of the beer, which came much too fast. Very complex aroma that to me was dominated by raisins and other dark fruit. There are earthy notes to the flavour along with chocolate. There are other flavours and aromas in there which I just cannot identify. By far the best beer I have had to date however I am not giving it a 5. You have to leave room for a better beer to come along.

It's a combination of malts, caramels / molasses, plum / raisin and Christmas spices. The first sip brings out the breadiness of the beer and exposes the full-body seen in most trappist ales. At mid-palate the flavors open up with a large hit of malt and molasses. As it continues to roll through your mouth, you'll start to experience the fruits and spices which will leave you with a pleasant aftertaste and wanting to jump in for another sip.

23495,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Bottle, Ciro’s, Toronto.  Dark brown / purple colour.  Fantastic aroma, lots of spice, plum, and slight alcohol.  Very little head on the pour in a nice trappist style glass.  Mouthfeel was a little disappointing in that it was thinner than the appearance suggested, but still it was complex without being syrupy.  Lots more spice and warm alcohol in the taste - I couldn’t really describe it, but I knew it seemed well balanced and quite agreeable.  This beer got better as it warmed as well - the flavours were less intense, but by the end, I couldn’t identify the 11% alcohol level.  A nice experience with good company.

Re-rate April 20 05.  Acquired a bottle in a trade with Mustang3.  My initial rating of this was when I was still at a pretty infant stage as far as trying new styles were concerned.  The bottle I had last night absolutely blew me away in a way no beer has.  The appearance of this beer was quite different, as I was in my well-lit living room and not a dark enjoyable bar.  It was very dark brown with red hues and a murkiness that looked fantastic. Small tan head.  The aroma was amazing - fresh hops, sweet malt, a little spice and some alcohol - I’ve never wanted to try a beer based on its aroma before so bad in my life.  The mouthfeel was also very unique - full-bodied, yet really frothy - this is where I encountered the biggest difference in my 2 ratings.  The taste was of rich malt, a well-balanced bitterness and the alcohol was incredibly restrained.  There was almost a sweet rum like quality to this beer.  I have not done it justice, but this was without question the best beer I have ever tried.",5.0

Pours a murky, rich dark purplish-brown, with a magnificent, pillowy two-finger khaki head on top. The head reduces to a thick, creamy khaki cap that leaves substantial lacing. Very nice.

Nose is hard to get a grip on - nutty, bit of cocoa, primarily brown sugar, spicy dark fruit, and doughy yeast. What’s there is fantastic.

Taste is full, rich, complex, and yet perfectly in sync with itself, if that makes sense. Notes of cocoa and spiced brown sugar, raisins and dates, doughy, spicy yeast, with a mild earthy bitterness coming out to join the fray right before the finish. Finish is sweet, spicy, yeast with some sweet raisin notes. Fairly short finish, warming, just a bit of alcohol underneath. Subtle but big in flavor, all while being very approachable.

Pours a deep dark brown almost black color with tiny light-brown head. The aroma is as strong and potent as ever, with a delicious bouquet of dark fruit engulfing the nose. Plums, raisins, and sweet dates. Such a beautiful, complex, assertive aroma... Surprisingly, after three years, carbonation is still very strong and prickles the tongue. The flavour seems to have lost a bit of its complexity. It has certainly softened over the years but still is an extension of the basic notes of the aroma... plums, raisins, dates. What is new is a less hidden taste of alcohol that has a distinct strong liqueur taste to it. Whether fresh or aged - Rochefort 10 is one of the best beers in the world.",4.9
23402,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"I’ll start off first by saying that I am partial to rich, complex, full-bodied beers.  I crave layers.  I 

want dimension.  I want to be able to look into every corner of the beer and find something worthy of 

mentioning.  To me, the difference between a craft beer and a world-class beer is that a while a craft beer 

may be an excellent example of a particular style, and therefore enjoyable cum that particular style, a 

world-class beer is an oeuvre on the palate that can provide the culinary depth of an entire meal in one 

quaff.

All this to say, Rochefort 10 is such a beer.  

From the deep mahagony color (dare I say it reminded me of buffed koa wood from Hawaii?), one expects that 

the malt should shine through, and from the nose one waits to taste spices of all different kinds.  One is 

not disappointed.  The first thing that I noticed in this beer is how well the brewer has stood up to the 

formidable 11% alcohol content; unfortunately most high-alcohol beers will have the experience of ethanol in 

center state, as the lead singer, with the rest of the flavors singing backup, however Rochefort 10 is in 

control of the alcohol content and uses it to strong advantage.  There are of course raisin tones, and plums, 

but factor in the chocolate and you have gourmet Raisinettes.  The tastes have a matte finish, rather than 

glossy; everything is balanced and textured rather than bright and zinging.  More tastes follow - muted strawberries, ripe banana, and of course a highly pleasureable layered maltiness.  At first drink I was tempted to say that the finish was dry, but it wasn’t.  It was clean, as if it were purposeful.  One gets the sense that everything is in its place, nothing is an accident.  This is a wonderful beer, practiced and perfected.",4.8

Purchased on eBay, shipped direct from Brussels from the limited release gift pack with glasses.  Extremely expensive, but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Enjoyed on December 25, 2011.  Color is dark brown, slight reddish tinge, almost opaque.  Half a finger of head retreated quickly to leave minimal ring of lacing.  Nose is incredible - chocolate, espresso, roasted hazelnuts, spice - maybe even cinnamon??  First taste was surprising.  Lots of carbonation, dried fruit, raisins and dark cherries.  Many hop notes - piney ,a bit earthy.  Strange, nearly sweet flavor presents at the end of each swallow.  Almost a smokey, charcoal with a hint of maple syrup!?  Molasses!  Alcohol nearly missing escept in the after taste, where a pleasant warm burn is felt.

Compared to the St. Bernardus, I found it to be more yeasty and complex, with more carbonation and a more robust mouthfeel too.



UPDATE July 28, 2013.  I’ve been saving these bottles and slowly drinking one at a time since December 25, 2011.  Cracked open the fourth from this batch today, and it has aged extremely well.

Een schuimkraag die niet al te lang blijft maar van een mooie lichte caramel kleur is. Troebel en extreem donkerrood van kleur. Zoet met een zachte bittere bite. Er is zoveel smaak aanwezig! Een prachtige niet al te droge afdronk die gewoon prachtig in balans is. Woorden komen te kort. Een bier dat al je zintuigen prikkelt. 

Qua complexiteit van smaak behoort dit tot de absolute top, zo niet de beste!",4.4

4416,Westvleteren 12,"Blind Quad 07 tasting 330 ml bottle from xnoxhatex.  Very malty aroma, its light especially when held next to Rochefort 10.  Grain, toasted chocolate toffee, vanilla, prunes, rasins, its definitely complex but I have to stick my nose in their a little to really get it.  Murky rasin brown in color, average off white head with lasting lacing.  Lightly sweet in flavor and finish, candi sugar, rasins, plums, cherries, oak, and the warmth of alcohol.  Medium bodied, creamy and fizzy with some nice undertones in the flavor.  This unanimously took second place in the the tastings, beat out by Rochefort 10.  
-----------
8/2/06 Thanks to xnohatex for the sample straight from belgium bottled only about a month ago.  
Pours dark with a small off white head.  The aromas are very nicely balanced like everything else in this beer: plums, currants, raisins, brown sugar and dough.  At the first sip i’m struck: suprisingly medium to light body but a crazy amount of fizziness over the whole tongue.  The longer I hold it in my mouth, it almost becomes numb with the carbonation.  Drewbeerme described it as probably what it would be like to taste a little finger-lick of cocaine, i agreed.  Flavors followed with successive sips:  raisins, toffee, carmel, cinamon, oak, vanilla, clove, and alcohol all balanced so well (maybe even too balanced).  as the beer warmed it seemed to turn sweeter and the aromas and flavors turned more to chocolate and almond.  After a few sips of this i was suprised to feel heady very quickly.   

This isn’t a crazy or intense beer, dont expect that, but it is (possibly)  the most balanced beer in the world.  4.7",4.3

Just a touch of sourness and some hop astringency in the finish.  Beautiful deep copper to brown color with an amazing off-white head.

3190,Westvleteren 12,"33cl bottle.

I will rate the beer further on this evening and yeah, I look forward to get drunk with it too. Pours a brown reddish with a lightly tanned head. It goes off leaving some stains. Nose : Dried fruits (plums and raisins), alcohol notes. Caramel, vanilla. Sip : Smooth body with a decent carbonation.Starts with sweet caramel then follows with a cognac like alcohol feeling which is really royal.Licorice. It changes while the bitterness mysteriously appear. It’s a really interesting bitterness, not like a burned malt but more of a bitter hops ? Maybe a mix of both.

Bottle poured with a nice 1 finger biege head. The head thinned out but lingered with noticeable lacing as the glass was consumed. The color was a reddish brown with some sediment evident even though I tried to leave most of the year in the bottle. The nose offers a sweet character that reminds me of caramel and butterscotch.

4245,Westvleteren 12,"Rating #1000   I did a side by side between an approx. 5 year old bottle (labeled at 10.6%) and a 6 month old bottle (labeled at 10.2%).  I will give the beginning stats on the five year old and then the traits / differences of the 6 month old.   The  five year old  bottle had a minor ""pfft"" when the cap came off.  Poured with the color of brown sugar with a nice beige head that was very respectable for the age.  The aroma is full and open with plums, raspberries, brown sugar, thick caramel, earthy malt, red wine notes, buttered toffee, raisins and more - there is something new with each wiff.  Full body that’s thick and velvety smooth with some incredibly soft carbonation.  The flavor starts with brown sugar, Belgium earthiness, plums, raisins & smooth rich toffee-like earthiness.  The finish adds some spice and a surprising sharpness and some astringency.  As it warms the raspberry aspect comes out more and the finish loses some of the sharpness and becomes more lush and adds dark cherry, brown sugar and caramel. (9/4/9/4/18/4.4)    The  six month  version pour deep mahogany  with a dense tan head - everything darker than the older version.  The aroma has cola, brown sugar and other flavors of the aged version, but all of the favors are more subdued and sharper.  There is less earthiness, but more fruit.  More brown sugar and caramel earthiness as it warms, but nothing like the aged bottle.  The flavors are much tighter and hidden, the five yar was significantly more lush and opened up.  Medium / full body with fairly sharp carbonation.  The taste is more sharp with earthiness, very dark caramel, coriander and pepper.  The finish gets quite sharp with anise and  pepper.  As it warms it opens up more, but nowhere near where the aged version was from the beginning. (8/5/8/4/17/4.2)   Overall, it is well worth aging the beer.  I’ve held onto the aged beer for years and it was worth it.  Big thumbs up  for this exceptional beer, but if you have the patience with a fresh bottle it is advised to give this a bit of time to age.  The rating numbers are for the older version as it was quite a bit better.

It is a good beer, really good beer and worth it’s hype, but to be honest I have tasted several other beers that I think have a more refined taste, mouthfeel, smell and aftertaste than this one. Still this one is good!
Though the Rochefort 10 is another damn good beer, maybe even better in my opinion.
Well I enjoyed drinking this and back then, many years ago, when I drank my first one, and there was a hype about this beer already, I know I could die happy, having tasted them all.

Had this beer some times again, which didn’t taste as remarkable as it did in the beginning. And had it during a blind tasting it became 3rd.

A: Poured into a Mikasa chalice. Pours a large mocha head atop a very dark brown body. Plenty of yeast. The lacing is extremely long-lasting.

S: Lots going on here, especially as it warms up. The trademark yeast is by far the most prominent smell, accompanied by some dark malts and fruits, along with a bit of alcohol.

T: Much the same as the nose, and probably the most complex beer I’ve ever tasted. Plenty of dark fruits, dark malt, alcohol, fruit and yeast spice, caramel, and molasses. 

M: Very full and heavy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Luscious.

D: Quite complex and takes a while to drink, and only gets better as it warms up. Very nice to savor for a long period of time while continuing to find new things going on.

Misc.: Bottle cap and part on bottle  said best by Jan. 8, 2015; The only time this beer has been in the U.S. and supposedly the only time it will be.

Poured a mahogany color with about a finger of off-white head that stayed forever on the top of the beer. Great thick and milky lacing on the sides. Great retention all the way down.

Smelled sour fruit up, followed by a sweet tarty flavor. Got green apple and kiwi. Also some malt backbone to it, mainly toasty caramel and toffee. Some light chocolate, too? Got better as I sat and smelled it.

Tasted similar to the nose. Just so damn smooth. Definitely could taste the alcohol up front. Some cloves, which I didn’t get in the smell. Got the green apple and tartness. Also light hints of caramel, honey

931,Westvleteren 12,I finally had the pleasure to enjoy this incredible beer - and it was everything I was told it would be.  Perfect Quad.  Shared with closest family/friends - raisins/plum fruit - hangs on for a long time.  Amazing.,4.8
5041,Westvleteren 12,"RE-rate: Extra 2 points this time!!! Original rating: Very, very good, chocolate pudding nose, and slightly sweet smell, malty is the word, and smooth (especially for 10.8%), lots of fruit, and chocolate, but i think the alcohol does shine through in the finish. But a very good experience, distinct candy sugar flavour, as with the other 2 Westy beers.",4.7
2471,Westvleteren 12,"12-oz. bottle. Dark copper pour with a good deal of suspended yeast globs and a pillowy, latte-colored head. Aroma of brown sugar, dates, dark stone fruit, banana bread, and subtle Belgian esters. Incredibly rich flavor with heavy bready malt (almost like a märzen) being the dominant tone early, along with some raisin, a touch of brown sugar, and a surprising bit of almost spicy, boozy heat. As it warms, the breadiness takes a back seat to a sweeter Belgian yeast/candi sugar note. It’s not as complex as past bottles, but still quite layered. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with a tangy, lingering finish. A delightful beer, but it doesn’t quite live up to its extremely lofty hype.",4.2
2060,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle, 2 years old, sample. Didn’t take proper tasting notes. This is seriously good stuff, there’s just so much going, so many delicate flavours, it feels and tastes just right. Never wanted to pay the money for it, but it’s definitely on the shopping list now.",4.6
1764,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle best before 16 September 2018. Pours a dark brown colour with a reddish hue and with a foamy head which laces well. The aroma is quite strong with sweet malt, sugar and fruit, maybe cocoa. The taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter with a slight sourness and a lasting dry and spicy finish. The beer is viscous with a smooth mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this beer.",4.5

4095,Westvleteren 12,"Well, what better way to end the year than with the proclaimed ""best beer in the world."" Pours a very dark slightly murky brown (left some yeast in the bottle) with surprisingly small, dissipating tan head.  Very effervescent, with rich wine-like nose with hints of molasses, baker’s chocolate, and sweet fruity liqueur. On the palate, smooth but a little thin, tasting like a nice aged port with added barrel character, along with a sort of grape jelly note i remember from the 8, for which this is most definitely the more adult version.  A lovely long finish, melding through many different stages from winter spices to delicate candi sugar sweetness to a final delicate tingle of herbal hop bitterness.  Best beer in the world? That always seems a contentious claim, as taste is inevitably subjective, yet this is one particularly well crafted and lovely ale, and one that I am very happy and thankful to have tried.",4.3
4652,Westvleteren 12,"I sought it out because of its high ratings on this website.  While it is a very good beer but it wouldn’t put it in at 100%.  It definitely has a small batch, hand/craft-brewed taste.  Rich caramely alcohol on the nose which is repeated in the flavor along with dark, sweet fruits (figs, dates, and prunes).  Has a well-rounded and smooth mouth feel across its wide ranging flavor profile.  Very complex all around.  A very nice trappist ale with a homemade feel.",4.1

Dream fruits, raisins, prunes, plums, raspberries, cranberries molasses in the aroma. Wonderfully complex, changes as the beer warms. Flavour flows the nose, underpinned by a warmness from the alcohol. Long, dark fruits finish. As good as its rating suggests.",4.6

3671,Westvleteren 12,"Was planning on ageing this for awhile but something inside just told me to drink it tonight during a nice summer thunder storm. Poured a smooth brown and settled into a darker shade of deep dark brown in the glass. The head was foamy and thick and held an almost indigo hue. As I polished off the pour, the sweet smell hit me...raisins and rum mostly. Tasting this behemoth was a stage-by-stage event that involved multiple phases and finishes. Stage 1: Lots of raisins on the taste buds, some alcohol presence felt as my whole tongue kinda tingled upon the first sips...felt really good. Finish was very rounded, slightly hoppy, and so smooth and balanced. Stage 2: As it warmed up, that alcohol became far more evident in the taste...almost canceling out all of the raisin aspects from before and introducing some kind of medicine-like feel...not unpleasant...but reminded me of vodka with it’s icy, somewhat metallic tone. At this point in time, the smell seemed sweeter and made me think of cotton candy and the finish had quite a burn to it. Stage 3; That burning sensation has tapered off a bit but still noticing mostly alcohol in the finish; although the balance remains stable. Stage 4: I’m thinking of port now, some smoke and a slightly toasted flavour that is difficult to pinpoint. Some fruity aspects coming out to me now also...apricot, apples, grapes. Stage 5: Coming near to the end of the glass now...sad to say. More of a distinct bitter sweetness coming through in the taste...brown sugar, cloves, spice, and cinnamon. But those elements are kind of attempting to cut through that thick hazy alcohol wall and not always making it. There is a sort of tar-like flavour that I am detecting along with orange peel and a burnt coffee zest. As I downed the final drop, it kind of sent a slight shiver through my body. The monks done good again. Bottom line: an interesting beer for sure, not sure how often I could truly drink these and seems like something I could enjoy more in the dead of winter...especially around Christmas/New Years Eve. Festive, complex, and comes across more like a Belgian Barleywine than anything else. So glad I could drink this. Will try and keep my patience and age the next one properly and compare.",4.3

2405,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle: 2011 bottle thanks to Mike, review based on a 2012 bottling. Murky brown & deep mahogany with some light sediment, a thin tan foam sits nicely on top for a while. Aroma is fantastically Belgian; grapes, raisins, figs, Belgian Candi sugar, brown sugar, faint roses, toasty nuts, toffee, light phenol, dark esters, faint finishing spices, & a plum-y, sugar-like finish. Taste is wonderful toasted bread, caramel malt, candied grapes, figs, dates, sweet red licorice, light booze, sweet honey, earthy & fruity esters, mild clove, warming spices, Belgian yeast, faint Candi sugar... Insanely complex. Buttery smooth mouthfeel, really such a treat. No doubt, one of the best Belgian quads out there.",4.2
2501,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle. Foggy, brown. Light brown small head vaporates quickly. Aroma has yeast, caramel, chocolate, nut. 

Taste has wood, citrus, cocoa, coffee, yeast and malt. Lively carbonation. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is not too present but rounds up the taste nicely. Crisp bitterish long aftertaste.",4.4
1580,Westvleteren 12,"At home, 2016 bottle (33cl). Direct comparison tasting with Rochefort 10.

Pour: dark burgundy, slight orange, nice and clear. High initial carbonation, high foam.
Nose: Malt, minerals, dades.
Taste: first - molasses, minerals, liquorice; mid - dades, dried fruits; after molasses, dark sirup, slight alcohol, dry bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Sirupy and thick. Carbonation is not dominant, which is nice. Really lovely.
Verdict: A very good beer! Definitely next level compared to Rochefort 10, just that bit more well rounded and delicious. But not enough to warrant the price tag - I would rather have a few Rochefort in future! :-)",4.3
2155,Westvleteren 12,"There is really no discernible aroma at all. The appearance is light brown to brown with a minimal, but lingering head. The taste is smooth and lightly sweet. The palate has a light body with average carbonation. There is a lingering astringent finish. This beer was above average, but not worthy of it’s legendary status.",3.1
5105,Westvleteren 12,"Not as amazing as the hype would have me believe.  The Extra 8 is definitely superior.  It has a slight note of Dimetapp, but is still very tasty.",4.2
1776,Westvleteren 12,"Il colore è l’atteso ""tonaca di frate"" (o marrone con riflessi ambrati); molto buona la schiuma, fine, cremosa, che lascia un bel cappello persistente. Aroma forte e molto dolce, anche relativamente semplice: ciliegia e prugna sciroppata, banana matura, caramello. Al palato: corpo pieno, poco carbonata, consistenza ""masticabile"". Il primo sorso impressiona per l’intensità, per la potenza, e per il dolce: ondata di uvetta e prugna, con una nota amara finale di erbe officinali e di china. Emergono note di banana matura, di biscotto e di caramello, ma sopratutto note ossidate che la portano nel territorio di vini come Porto, Sherry o Madeira, Passito. La bevuta diventa molto interessante, con una straordinaria intensità e, soprattutto, con l’alcool (10.2%) nascosto in modo incredibile. Il dolce è stemperato - come detto - da una chiusura di china e di erbe officinali, una lieve pausa prima del sontuoso retrogusto, etilico, morbido ed appagante, fruttato e lunghissimo.",5.0
1739,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle to snifter, pour is murky brown, aroma is a typical quad: sweet fruits, plums, cereal, and raisin. Taste is similar. Well done beer, just doesn’t live up to the hype in my opinion",3.6
2117,Westvleteren 12,"Managed to try two separate bottles, one from a promotional six pack but close to use by date, the other probably brewed this year. There were of course massive difference, the older one having lost its carbonation massively and while much sweeter at first, didn’t have the pleasant aftertaste of the fresher bottle, which my ratings are based on. Having done the Belgium 6 abbey trip, this was of course a big must try, since the others I had all had before. Given it’s lofty rating on this site, I was at first a little disappointed, with the initial flavour quite mild compared to Rochefort 10 or Chimay blue, but it does maintain the flavour in your mouth and the sweetness comes through slowly. Like most Belgians strong caramel flavour with nice balance of light bitterness. Still, prefer the Rochefort and the Chimay triples but that’s just my preference. A very good beer.",3.9

A caramel hue with a rusty tinge.  Very murky as well.  Flavor is slightly fruity then transitions to earth and finishes with a bitter linger.  Palate is lively and medium bodied.  Will be much better in a couple years.  A good beer but over rated now a days.",4.1
3780,Westvleteren 12,"This 22-1-2008 brewn batch beer, personally retrieved from brewery, was a feast to get, to keep in stock for one year and to drink eventually. It poored a fine head with a bit of brown yeasty slur. That slur ruined my drink. It gave the head and a awful taste. I have to rely on my impressions of earlier consumed examples of this outstanding beer. It is less pronounced and sweet as the Rochefort 10. Has more bitters. Its no showof but more contemplative of nature. Tip for pouring, keep sludge absolutely out of the poured drink. Two more years of evolution are awaited with joy.",4.3
4847,Westvleteren 12,"Very very smooth.  Best before 2006. Alcohol is almost not noticeable.  You could be hammered before you knew it. Looking forward to next trying an aged version. Cinnamon and light pepper quality.  If this is the model Unibroue et al use they need to keep working to catch up.  Aroma was the lowest quality of the beer. Aroma moderated after a few minutes.   Dark colour, even a little head.",4.3

Det doftar fantastisk gott av kola, jäst och lite söta mörka frukter.

Smaken är stor av söta plommon, lite russin och choklad. Tycker även jag hittar toner av vanilj.
Eftersmaken är mycket rund och välbalanserad, och ligger i länge, länge.

Ja, god är den verkligen, men är den värdens bästa? Nja, inte i min värden.
Faktisk så är det så att jag tyckte den nästa ölen vi provade var bättre… faktisk mycket bättre, så Westvleteren 12 får bara en fyra av mig, men en god fyra",4.3
3048,Westvleteren 12,"Pours a bleary chestnut brown into chalice. Smells immediately of hot whiskey alcohol, cashews, Candi sugar, vanilla beans, cinnamon, leather, cough drops and mint. Upon this mighty beer right away I get plums, Cloves cigarettes, heather; as I let it warm it certainly got sweeter, with notes of honey, oak, yeast, white nectarines and a kind of interesting bite by swallow. Simply awesome stuff.",4.5
