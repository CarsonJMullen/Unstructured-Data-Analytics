8741,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle graciously shared by ygtbsm94.  Pours hazy orange with a medium, frothy off-white head, medium-high retention with excellent lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (straw, hay, meal), light hops (spicy), and average esters (grape) with notes of wine, horse blanket, faint black walnuts, blueberry; simply amazing.  Flavor is a complex marriage of heavy malt (straw, hay, bread crust), light hops (spicy, floral), and average esters (grape) with notes of wine, horse blanket, faint black walnuts, and blueberry; slightly tart.  Medium body, light warmth, medium-high carbonation, light creaminess and a pleasant dry finish.",4.8
8799,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"I originally had a nice big sample of this at De Heeren back on September, 5 years from the date this beer was bottled. I was lucky enough to share a full bottle of this with my cousin (krkearney), my brother and other family on Christmas Day. In addition to what I note below, I think the taste of the blauw is a bit more tart than the roze but it works very well in this fantastic beer. 

I was hoping to find a bottle of this on a recent trip to De Heeren but was suprised to find it available there for sample at a beer fest they were having behind the restaurant. Wow! For the price of about $3 a got a nice sample of about 6 oz or so. 

The beer poured a slightly hazy golden color with a nice thick bubbly head. The nose was a bit sour and citrus, funk. The taste was tart and funky with some definite yeast notes. There was also a nice wood character to the beer and overall this was one refreshing and beer worth savoring.",4.6

8846,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(3/8/08) Bottle at De Heeren van Liedekercke in Denderleeuw. Cloudy orange with a big white head. Aroma with a lot of barnyard, wood, citrus and maybe a bit of sweat. Flavor is very dry, really sour, with some lemon and grapefruit and towards the finish also some bitterness. Medium-bodied with a lot of carbonation (even a bit too much carbonation for my taste) and some astringency. A great Geuze.",4.1
8775,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"From notes. Hazy yellow/gold, small white head. Intense gueuze- barn funk, citrus like acids, more mild acetic notes, earth, subtle menthol, plenty of tartness. Medium body, sparkling, very dry. Awesome lambic.",4.5
8920,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Cloudy orange in colour, lingering medium sized white head, some patchy lacing.  The aroma is intensely sour and tart, lots of oranges and lemons, mould, old cheese, some horse blanket.  The flavour is quite tart, puckering, some barnyard, cheese, some grape and apple skins, woody.  Dry puckering mouthfeel, medium body, lively carbonation.  Finishes long, dry, very tart, complex stuff.  It’s hard to pick between the Roze and the Blauw but I found this better...just barely.

8938,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Light hazy orange-yellow beer with copperish shine and with a good airy head. Nice aroma’s of rasped Renette apples with touches of Greek yoghurt, nutmeg, humide tobbacco leaf, fresh rubarbe, wet wood, led pipe, horseblanket and hints of lemon and grapefruit zest. Taste is dry and has a nice dosis of tannins who are accentuated by the high accidity of the beer. The mouthfeel is rich but dry, it has nice complex fruity touches of green prunes, peaches, Granny Smith apples some cinnamon-stick and cigare-box. The afthertaste is dry and ends with a fine bitterish touch of Vin Jaune,  hops and and grape-pits. A very complex Gueuze with a gastronomical avantage.

8804,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"75cl bottle courtesy of ygtbsm94.   Hazy gold with a huge white head.   Huge aroma, with razor sharp cheese, dust, and biting acidity.   Hugely sour in a grapefruit juice way, almost crossing into peel-bitter character; sharp yoghurt acidity as well.   Medium-light bodied with ample, spritzy carbonation.   The aroma was almost to sharp, but the flavor and finish were amazing on this one.   A burly gueuze that I really enjoyed.",4.2
8939,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Enormous pink to yellow head, dense and leaving lace over orange to copper beer, end of bottle fully hazy. Woody and vinous lactic acid nose, ""mals"", sherry aroma with nearly Manzanilla character, faint horseblanket, some citrus zeste. Very dry taste, again some sherry and lots of wood, fruity (dried apricots on sherry? and lemon), some restrained lactic acid and some fresh bread. Little nutty finish. Dry MF but with restrained dry-out effect. Bitterish-leathery aftertaste. A truly superb gueuze, with, as proven on a recent tasting, indeed ideal for food-pairing. This is a top-blend, big hooray for J&J and for Armand, of course.",4.5
8765,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle at De Heeren Van Liedekercke.  Fabulous beer, fabulous food and a fabulous setting.  It really couldn’t get any better to have this brew at the venue it was brewed for.  Full of dust in the nose.  Dry and fruity.  The dryness and mustiness continues in the flavor, making one of the better gueuzes on the planet.  Everything you could ask for.  This sets the benchmark for gueuze.  Fantastic.",4.5

8906,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle at Chris_o Shindig.  You see, this is good and I much prefer something to this to the Cantillon Blabaer that I had before.  This has more balanced sourness and good funk.  Excellent fruit.  Really gorgeous funk and sourness.",4.2

Rich, tart fruity aroma- green apple and white grape, cantaloupe, soft grapefruit with lemon pulp, with earthy, musty, barnyard notes, mushroom and bit of cheese, lots of oak.

Balanced, very complex, an incredible geuze. One of the best for me.",4.5

8838,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle shared by miketd at lb4lb’s tasting.  Thanks man!  Poured a hazy orange color with a moderate white head.  Aroma consists of barnyard funk, yeast, and some citrus undertones.  Tart, sour entry with some citrus (lemon, orange, and light grapefruit) leads into a funky, barnyard yeastiness with a dry finish with more moderate citrus and funk.  Dry, crisp mouthfeel.  Beautiful beer.",4.3
8604,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle shared at Leightons place 27/03/2017. Huge thanks to Daniel cad for this one. A hazed onion skin orange coloured pour with a a sticky off white head.

Really good.",4.3
8757,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Unbelievable pour, each time I’ve been lucky enough to try this beer I’ve been shocked by the creamy rich head that lasts for days.  The nose is one of the funkiest I’ve ever smelled, and the beer is not nearly as tart as I expected.  The flavor is a complex mix of some lemon peel, earthy and barnyard funk, and a nice yogurt character.",4.6
8728,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Served at a tasting, side by side, with the J&J Roos. First thing is first. The labels of these beers are great. Oil paintings of a silhouette of a nude female torso profile, its just such a pretty painting. I understand that these beers were originally brewed for the brewer’s wedding and the roos was for the wife (naked woman on the label) and the Blau was for the husband (naked man on the label). Great concept.

Beer is yellow and hazy, just like the other one. Head is small bubbles, white to off white.

Aroma is a strong funk and completely sour. More funky than the Roos but still amazing smelling.

There is a lot of citric based sour in this beer. This reminds me a lot of a Cantillon Helena but totally different. Beer is tart and there is a slight sulfur taste really late. Overall this beer is very similar to the Roos, slightly less sour, slightly more funk, and there’s some sulfur in the palate. I understand that most people like the Blau over the Roos but I’m the opposite. Both are great but the Roos is slightly better.

Serving type: bottle",4.4
8873,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"fucking wow. Thanks to JohnC for breaking this out at PPSAF. Tart, funky, orange tangerine zest sourness. Light zesty cheesy and sour.",4.5
8717,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle thanks to maltomeal for his 1,000th rating-great choice! Hazy light gold with a white head.  Nose is super fragrant of lemons, fruitiness, and tartness. Taste is extremely complex, very earthy, with citrus and lemon. Hugely carbonated and just a bit sticky. Immensely complex and satisfying. Great beer.",4.4
8829,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Huge thanks to Hopdog for sharing.  side by side with the Roze.  Appearance is a bit more cloudy than roze, a shade lighter and a higher carbonation.  Aroms is very acidic, woody, not quite as woody as roze, intense barnyard funk- pwerful sour lactic and citric acids, gets real funky and almost goaty sweaty with lgiht stinky cheese, butyric acid as well.  Light sour apple flavor at first but grows with the other acids in there, and becomes one of the most powerful guezes I have ever had- insane acidity but something in there to back it up so it isnt all just sour- funky brett, lacto and pedio.  Finish is almsot mouth puckering, and I think the champagne like spritziness intensifies it.  This is one insane Gueze.",4.8
8844,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle (750ml) shared with HogTownHarry, GregClow, jerc, mabel & tupalev -- courtesy of jerc & mabel. Pours a cloudy orange-amber with an average size creamy off-white head. Nice funky yeast aroma along with some citrus and light spices. Flavour’s also of funky yeast, quite sour and citrusy. Compared to the Roze that we had before this, it’s funkyer, more sour and more acidic. Medium bodied, quite carbonated. Like the Roze, this is also very good. Thanks to jerc for sharing these!",4.0
8924,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle at Heeren de lidekerke. Pours a hazy golden, with a big white creamy head. Aroma is funky and slightly sour. Taste is tart, rather sharp, funky barnyard notes. Not as dry as the ’rose’",4.3

8690,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,Soft acidity on the nose.  Very mild with hints of sweetness.  Pours slightly hazy gold with a dense white head.

8632,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Properly cellared bottle thanks to BrewDan. Pours a golden yellow, one finger, frothy white head on a gentle pour. Nose is mushroom and funky brett. Taste is heavy, but well rounded flint and dry funk that ends in a crisp sourness. Some light notes of Parmesan cheese are in there as well. Medium carbonation and finishes very dry. Extremely earthy and unique!",4.8
8929,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle. Pours an orange-brown foggy body with a persistent, frothy whitish head and sheet lacing. The aroma is perfectly refreshing - green pine needles, cheese funk, lemon and grapefruit. Amazingly drinkable with soft quenching carbonation. Harmonious balance of grapefruit and brett. The finish is long and dry with some fruit twang. 


Had this at Heeren van Liedekercke, what a wonderous place!",4.4
8742,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,Bottle. Nice pop from the cork as the cage is released. Pours a slightly hazed orange yellow with a big fluffy white head that slowly recedes. Pretty funky floral aroma with nice touches of some fruit. Oaky and earthy with some nice fruit almost like blueberry as well.  Decently sour and tart with a nice lemony zest type taste but balanced with other fruit like sweetness. Hints of oak and earth. Light mouthfeel. This is an amazing beer with lots of depth. Some peach as well. Ends rather cleanly.,4.7
8773,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Cork bangs off, pours a clear medium orange/gold with a tempestuous head that just stick around the upper regions of the glass.  Epic.  Big, funky nose full of light fruits, slightly vinous.  A bit light and tingly on the nose.  Crisp, snappy, and lively in the mouth.  Tight, dry, but wondrously rich and full-bodied.  Not the most funky or sour geuze out there, but just so refined, balanced, and lively.  Light oranges, lemons dance about a musty barnyard funk.  Near perfect really, and  absolutely delightful.*********************After fantasizing about this beer for the past few weeks, the thing that struck me the most was the really lively, vibrant lime and lemon which kind of fizzed throughout the whole thing.  This quality really reminds me of batch 3 Sanctification (the really good batch), so that’s the closest comparison I would have to this wonderful beverage.",4.7
8858,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"bottle....did i just have a cable car and now we’re having a J&J blauw (sounds better as blou not blue!)!.  another thanks to drewbeerme for this one.....pours a slightly opaque orange brown with a hefty and considerable off-white head.....awesome nose of tart sour cherries, a nice assertive funky presence that really just blew me away.  i wish i could be more eloquent with my depiction of this but i just cannot be.....flavors of earthy funkiness with a much more withstanding and dominant sour tart sensation......i truly can’t get enough of this one.  fantastic!",4.5
8743,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"A big thanks to Marc for hooking us up at the LCBS 10.  A cloudy straw color with aromas of funk and lemon permeating the air.  The taste was semi-sweet with sour cherries, lemon, and vinegar carrying the load.....",4.1
8878,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Courtesy dsnowden.  Thanks Dan for this uber-rarity.  Opened with an intense POP!  Pours a hazy, light tangerine body with a massive, billowing, off-white head.  Intricate patterns of thick tapestry lacing coat the entire glass.  This beer looks incredibly inviting.  The aroma is as intense as advertised.  Easily the funkiest nose I’ve ever encountered.  Searing citric acids scream from the glass and singe the nose hairs instantly.  Horseblanket, dust, barnyard, and farmhouse yeast impart an incredibly funky, yet earthy element.  This brew smells almost aboriginal, as if was born of and has become one with the earth.  The flavor isn’t as intense as the nose indicates, imparting just the slightest bit of malt sweetness into the fold.  Still, this beer is a lesson in intensity.  Raw lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine sourness assault the tongue.  Funk, earth, and minerals round things out.  Perfectly carbonated, medium body.  Stinging and sharp finish.  This is a fantastic lambic.  Excellent blend.",4.2
8779,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Hazy orange-yellow pour with a thin white head.  Woody grass aroma with lots of fruity sourness.  Very sour but incredibly nice and fruity citrus flavor.  Soft wood, grass, and funk.  Very bitter hop finish.",4.5
8658,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle @ THE Sour and Saison Tasting. The pour’s deep, hazy gold with a massive white head. Lively indeed. The nose is sharp lemon peel, sweaty sock, dank basement and a bit of dusty cork. Very earthy, musty aromas. The taste is more musty dust and buggy wood. Some light sweet lactic lemon cake. Barnyard yeastiness, hints of meaty grapefruit and lemon pith. A bit of cheddar cheese. Soft, complex flavors. Wonderful, but the taste is a bit muted and lacks some of the vitality I was expecting. Smooth and very drinkable. Active carbonation on the palate. Overall, a very pleasant experience. This bottle felt like it was starting its decline. Still, very good.",4.1
8819,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle shared by pepsican. Thanks! Poured a hazy medium orange color with a white head. Smelled of old couch, light vinegar, lemon, and a hint of funky cheese. Light bodied and effervescent with a decent dose of mouth-puckering acidity. The flavor included the likes of pale malt, dusty white wine, citrus, and vinegar. Nice.",4.4
8810,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(bottle, big thanks to Skyview for sharing this rarity at the Sourfest!) rating #500-Pours out hazy light gold with a fluffy white head that sticks around and leaves impressive lacing.  The aroma is potent and possesses every aspect I enjoy in a gueuze.  Dominant smells of funky blue cheese, brine, spikes of tart pineapple, peach skin, dusty hay, and of course, manure.  The taste is full of brine, funky cheese, minerals, lemon peel, and oak. The finish is incredibly long, earthy, and bone-dry.  The mouthfeel is full.  This beer is quite possibly the pinnacle of gueuze.",4.7
8768,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"75 cl capped and corked bottle shared by mreusch.  6 - 9 - 2003 on label. Pour is a gusher, hazed orange copper with a big foamy 4 inch white head that falls fast with splotchy lacing.  Aroma is soft barnyard, plastic, acetic lemon citrus, and some earthiness. Taste is the bright lemon citrus, vinegar, and the same plastic of the nose. The finish is lingering with the vinegar. Palate is active carbonation, light bodied, with a plastic mineral aftertaste. Nice, thanks for sharing this one Matt.",3.8
8832,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"750ml bottle acquired in a couple trades. Tasted side x side with the Roze. Major gusher alert This guy prematurely spewed everywhere. Poured a medium and cloudy orangish color with a large sized off white head. Aromas of funk, musty, tart, and sour. Tastes of tart green apples, sour, lemons, and just all around tart. My description really doesn’t do this one justice This one was very nice and puckering.",4.9
8898,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle... This beer rocks!... Hazy, brilliant golden ale with an orange hue and a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Great, small, tight retention. The acidic, acetic and funky aroma is a holy union of white pepper, earth, resin, dried flowers, canvas, damp straw, sawdust, herbs and sharp, well-aged cheese. Intense! The flavor provides a perfect balance of moderate initial, pale malt sweetness; medium spicy, floral bitterness and restrained funk and acidity. Medium to full-bodied and creamy with modest carbonation. Bitter, acidic finish. Complex beyond belief! A forty year vertical might be necessary to find this beer at its precise prime. Thanks, boboski, for the chance to try this wonderful rarity!",4.4
8619,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle shared at the Moeder Lambic cellar session 2015. provided by bart. thanks again! poured an beautiful hazy dark golden colour with a medium seized white head. the smell has a awesome blended mixture of citrus, lemon zest, funk, barnyard, wet wood, and some spiced yeast, wich could be from the girardin. it’s sounds so easy. but this was by far the best smelling lambic that has made it into my nose! taste has again that real citrussy character, with old dusty grains, wood, tart funk, some spiced peppery yeast. that typical ""horseblanket"" kind of feeling, just so so good blended and age to perfection. smooth as silk with a perfect acid sour finish. just the perfect geuze! so so lovely",4.8
8711,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Corked bottle, from De Hereen Van Liedeckerke
Hazy light amber color; higher carbonation than the Roze; big frothy head. The aroma is more elegant than the Roze, and without the cork touch; there is some lemony sourness, a bit dusty, light cheese and apples; still pungent in the end. The body shows more carbonation, but it has a good structure, more balanced and less astringent than the Roze; good soft tannins, pleasant and not overwhelming cellar character, high acidic touch, a bit lemony; it ends with some astringency. The only thing I would like to change here is the carbonation: excessive.
Wonderful, more subtle and elegant than the Roze.",4.5
8639,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Acquired in a trade from Mads in Denmark in February of 2013. Allowed this beer to sit horizontal in my basement for 10 months and now I’m ready to open it up on a random Saturday night by myself before a trip. Nothing fancy, just because. Also, temp of this thing is 55 at serving in a Cantillon Tulip. I allowed the glass I poured to sit for 15 minutes to sort of liven up a bit and just sort of chill the fuck out. It was bottled like 10 years ago...best let this beast chill! The cork was perfectly intact but had escaped out of the bottle by a couple of centimeters. The cage held up great.



A - Appearance is on par with Oude Gueuze Vintage 2002-2005 era. Mahogany oak and minor orange notes. A more reddish brown than gueuze being released today. Is that just age? Probably not because the 20 year old gueuze I’ve had from others wasn’t this dark. The cork whisper heavily but did not explode or gush thankfully.



S - There are a few levels to this nose. You can do a one ounce pour, swish heavily and you get this blossom or oranges, lemon skin, wet hay and musty fecal aromas. Then if you let the beer chill out for a bit, it’s this cheesy old shoe with what I’d consider to be the cheesiest basement aroma like the moldiest old stone basement. Something to consider at this age though is storage conditions.If it was kept in an old damp basement, that will certainly influence the nose.



T - This is probably the most orange and lemon forward gueuze I’ve ever had. It’s also the most moldy wet blanket gueuze I’ve ever had. I’m reviewing this beer over a few glasses so I can get the full effect. It’s not really sour, more tart like a lemon, fruity like clementines and moldy, funky just leathery wet hay. It is the most ""rotten"" tasting gueuze I’ve ever had and, to that effect, I freaking love it!



M - The carbonation is as I expected. Not a huge explosion just a nice cork wisp with a 1 finger head that faded slowly. The beer still explodes nicely on a heavy swish with a Harbaugh approved 15% carbonation (do I really have to explain to him what that means? He’s a freaking science teacher right?) Lingering rotten grapefruit rind sticks around.



O - For what Blauw is trading for now, it’s slowly moving past its prime. The first review was in May of 2005. So that well debated 10 year fall off that Drie Fonteinen gueuze has is starting to hit. I want to say the mold / damp hay I get is totally because of storage conditions which is understandable. Is this worth a case of Framboos? No way. It’s still really freaking delicious and hopefully people rating it now get to have more than an ounce of it. It’s best shared 2-3 ways like most 75CL Gueuze. Amazing this is a whale now but age & bottles in circulation will do that. Personally, Golden Blend, Armand & Tomme, Lente, Zomer and 2007 Oude Gueuze Vintage score higher than this in my book but for different reasons. They’re all younger than this beer and brighter. I prefer them to this but this gueuze was still an experience worth going through.",4.2

Dusty basement, old yeast, light spice, lemon peel, funk, white grapes, and sweet apples.

Taste is tart, smooth, balanced dry, sour. Wow! High carbonation and that fluffy old gueuze-body. Yes! Almost as good as Crianza Helena!",4.6
8922,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"750ml bottle thanks to mds. Whoa. Massive funkiness in this one, especially compared to the Roze. Aroma is stinky as hell and it’s a beautiful thing. Very cheesy, stinky basement, barnyard, some citrus, and a nice dose of brett. Quite sour, but it doesn’t seem to come across as overbearing because of how funky it is. It’s balanced in that strange way. Nice puckering mouthfeel, moderate to high acidity, very dry, and relatively soft carbonation. Wow.",4.7

Hazy golden/orange, with a tiny white head. More sour than the Roze, and definitely more ""manly"", there are no flower notes like Roze, just the typical geuze characteristics, of the finest type though. Lemon and grapefruit, fruity, nice malt base, vinegar, barnyard, cellar, wet wood, such a complexity packed in a perfectly balanced beer.  And what a perfect beer to finish the night with. A night to remember for sure: http://www.flickr.com/photos/aserezis/sets/72157629118513251/",4.6
8659,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle, thanks to jackl at THE sour tasting (part 1). It pours hazy amber, with a gigantic off-white head. The nose is faint spice, light sulphur, grapefruit, lemon, sweetness in the background, floral, damp wood, dusty and cork. The taste is wood, sour lemon, grapefruit, pomello, lime, pithy, some acidity, dough, spice, sherbet and wood, with a dry finish. Medium body, fairly lively carbonation and foamy mouth-feel. Pretty big on the grapefruit. Tasty and well-balanced. A great blend, but feels a bit tired, a touch over the hill perhaps (this specific bottle anyway)? Still a great gueuzey experience.",3.9
8660,3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"And this is what Sean finished the tasting with. Had this back to back with the Roze. 750 ml bottle served in a Portsmouth tulip.

A: Much darker amber color than the Roze. A nice frothy white head forms on the pour and slowly recedes to a thick collar and thin cap. Splotchy lace is left behind.

S: Sour raspberry, tart cherries and some oak. Light sweetness and mild funk as well. blends really nicely together.

T: Dark sour cherry with a nice pucker. Almost like a warhead candy with out the artificial sugar flavors. Tart raspberry, vanilla sweetness, some woody oak and nice funky cheese on the finish.

M: Light bodied with a crisp, drying mouthfeel. The sourness gets in there gives you a nice pucker. A real jowl hitter.

O: I enjoyed this just a tad more than the Roze as it had more a sour kick to it. The Roze was more vibrant, but this beer went deeper in flavor. Huge thanks again to Sean (Sean9689) for sharing this rarity!!

An incredible minerality to the nose. Rotten orange peel. As it warms, the orange peel turns to a grapefruit note. Loads of dirty, funky, wet-animal like sharpness. Old cedar. Wow. Pours a glowing, hazed dark orange with a pillowy, fluffy, lasting eggshell white head. Flavor is insanely sharp, funky and dry. Absolutely zero residual sweetness. Stones, gravel... Leather. Sharp, sharp acid. Long aged cheese and earthy mushrooms. A slight hint of tangy smoke. Moist cedar wood. Wet wood tannin all over the sides and especially the back of the tongue.  The palate is full of intense and stingy acid. Lively, but not overbearing carbonation. Once past the carbonation, the texture is fairly creamy.

Apple cinnamon pie, bright cherry. Minty fresh with sour blood orange. Incredible. What a treat. Thank you! 



750mL gold foil 1998 ed from Akkurat in Stockholm, Sweden. The pour is incredibly vivacious, insane carbonation, creating a towering/over the top white suddy head that explodes out of the tumbler but settles down quickly and leaves no lace. Body is hazy deeper yellow. Aroma is not impressive whatsoever: heavy orange mint, vanilla mint, sweaty, burnt plastic, moldy apple. But as it warms and I really spend time with two full pours in tumbler, the nose is TOMATO JUICE and CELERY. Not a good sign. As if the burning plastic was not an immediately ominous sign.

I believe it was around 50F temp when served.



A - First pour was a burnt dark orange / gold appearance. The cork had a HUGE pop exploding but not gushing. GREAT SIGN! First pour was a 5 finger solid white huge bubbly head. Subsequent pours got more cloudy obviously. Dregs were dark brown w/ hints of red.



S - Nose is a mix of blue cheese, cardboard basement musk and funk with a lot of wood, mold and more cheese the 3F funk with lemon nose is there but super subdued. Reminds of the same funky moldy basement funk that I got from Blauw.



T - a know what....taste is pretty freaking awesome. Yes a lot of cardboard and shoe polish. A lot of leather and wood and moldy grapes. But it’s incredibly tart and well done. Lots of lemon, cloth aged old cheddar and funk classic 3 F. Tart overall. 



M - Bursting classic 3F mouthfeel. Bubbly, filling and huge.

25678,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle at jeffc666’s Birthday Gathering. Bottled on 21 Nov 98.  Hazed gold body. Nose is leather, rotten cheese, moldy books, sweat, horse blanket, light urine and musty damp basement. This runs the gauntlet on aromas for a gueuze. I loved every second of it! Taste is big sour fruits, more leathery notes, sweat, light ammonia/urine, more cheese and horse blanket. Body is light and refrshing and VERY effervescent. Finish is mellowed tart fruit, leather, sweat and light urine. Excellent beer! Everything a gueuze should be! jeffc666 and I had the leftovers at the end of the night and it was even more intense. Wonderful!",4.7
25608,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Smells like spider web, fermented wheatgrass juice, stale carrots, musty horse hooves. Looks and feels like it was frozen in the Canadian tundra for 12 hours or even in someone’s freezer.

 It pours hazy gold with a thin, lasting head.  The aroma is sour citrus and intense.  The flavor is so tart, but quite good.  It has a medium body and a lively mouthfeel with a dry finish.  Very interesting.  I’m lambic ignorant and a beer this sour was something different for me.",3.9
25587,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Big ups to AtlAggie for sharing this one and big ups for passing the bar as well. Poured an opaque orange with a big bubbly white head.  The aroma wafted from about a foot away and had a bit of citrus and some some funky stinky cheese aspects.  Each sip was totally different with this beer. The first one exploded with some tasty citrus fruit, the second went a little more to the sour side of my palate.  Third sip I got a bit of the dirty malt profile. Incredibly complex beer that I will reminisce about for a while.",4.7
25649,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle from the georgians: Hazy gold color with a light white head. Aroma is sour some lemon and sour apple. More lemon and apple in the flavor, not overly sour. But still simply amazing. Possibly the hi-light of the night.

25524,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle from Frank, with Jeremy and Bill. Huge thanks to Franks for cracking this sour gem. Poured a hazy golwing bright golden orange color with medium white head and small amount of lacing. Aromas were very floral up front, minty, vintage wet wood, earth, grapefruit citrus, lemon peel, and some leather. Taste was insanely complex with lactic funk, champagne yeast, dried fruits, oak, earthy grains, stonefruit, brett and acid. It is going to be hard to find a better geuze then this example. Outstanding.",4.8

25518,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"A very big thanks to spdyfire83 for popping this bad boy, one of the last 3F I haven’t ticked. Thanks Bryan! Pours a brilliant orange color with a half fingers worth of tight white head. Wow, nose is kinda weird. Right off the bat, it smells minty, it overwhelms the gueuze characteristics of it honestly. Must and lemon are in the background, but very subtle. Mint character is very light in the flavor, it’s more balanced gueuze with lemon and funk. Good mouthfeel, light carbonation, gentle acidity, with a moderate finish. This is a peculiar gueuze. The mintiness is kinda distracting honestly, it is way different than anything I’ve had from 3F. Thanks to Bryan for popping this guy, a real treat.",3.7

25509,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"75cl bottle at Akkurat. Not on the list. It pours a golden/light amber colour with a large white head. Aroma is nice and complex: wet wood, strong funkyness with fruitiness and some spiciness. Nice acidic notes, recalling the classic cheesey and horseblankety notes. Taste is rich with strong funkyness again and tartness sorrounded by a sort of yogurt-like sweetness. Huge citrus and lemon peel notes. Grassy notes in the background. Some wood and fruit too. Mostly dry finish. Palate is creamy, silky, with good carbonation. So easy to drink, I’m glad I had a whole bottle for myself. This is now rounded, complex, almost on par with the Millennium.",4.5
25491,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle shared in London - many, many thanks to Jack. Opens with a bang but doesn’t gush at all - thankfully. The aroma is dense, full of damp grass, wet wood, slightly rotten lemons. Light sweet flavor with moderate acidity, licks of salt, abandoned basement, sturdy grassy bitterness, some oily tangerine rind. Light bodied with lively, massaging carbonation. Quite dry on the finish with mild tannins, bitter citrus rind and grass, acidic bite, dried lemons, salt, soaked wood. Great stuff. Impressively bright and lively for its age. Wonderful.",4.4

Wonderfully complex and still vibrant. The flavour’s so earthy. Dirty lemon, hints of jasmine tea. Mandarin orange. Bretty funk. Slight biting acid on the finish. Still fresh and zippy.

Moderatelately sour, lightly bitter initial flavour.  Moderately sour, moderately bitter finish.  Nicely well balanced beer.  The typical 3 Fonteinen mark is enormously shining through, but somewhat less sharper (but more softer) than the ’ordinary’ gueuze.  Definitely another succes of Armand.",4.2

750ml bottle, vintage 11/1998

Consumed at  Delirium Cafe, Brussels, May 2006 (8 years cellared)
 Cloudy yellow and warm orange colored body.  First taste is semi-musty oranges and warm fruit.  Thick, musty, old, over-ripe fruits dominate this gueze, admittedly not one of my favorite gueze aspects.  Old, tinny, almost ""bloody"" nose of oranges.  The sourness is fresh and light, thankfully, and almost creamy at times.  Moderately thick texture.  Very good, less brash than most, most likely due to age, but I can’t mark this up anymore due to the old fruit flavors which I find mildly unpleasent.

25541,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle generously shared by Destructo at his 3 Fonteinen vertical dinner.   After working our way backwards from the 2010 vintage, this bottle was just a little disappointing.  It had many of the acidic citrusy notes that I love about 3F, but it also had a ""chemical taint"" or off flavor.  Would like to revisit this one because it might have to do with the way it was cellared..
Re-rate I have to change my original rating of 3.9.  I shared a bottle received from a friend whose cellar conditions cannot be questioned.  This version was much dryer with champaign characteristics.  The tartness and sourness were almost non-existent.  I believe this to be closer to the Armand’s intentions.",4.1

A: Deep orange-wheat colored body.  Large, fluffy off-white head.  Stuck around for a few minutes before leaving behind a nice coating of lacing.



S: Subtle musty, earthy tones.  Damp hay.  Smells like the barrel room at Drie Fonteinen.  Mild citrus.



T: A truly fantastic flavor profile.  If you aren’t going in expecting something super dank and funky, this will amaze.  Delicate complexity.  A refined blend bringing together a little bit of everything... lemon, orange, sweat, musty oak, barnyard notes of straw and musty air.  The complexity of this really came out when we returned to this after trying the 1999 and Millennium Geuze.



M: Stellar.  Medium to light bodied.  Lively effervescence.  Restrained sourness in the finish.



O: An exceptional blend.  Lucky to have been able to get to try it with a dozen years on it.",4.4

Holy crap, this is complex as hell. The funk is more complex than any gueuze I’ve had thus far. Finished on sharp funky notes, with a very dry palate and low acidity.

Acids are subdued -just my oesophagus thinks otherwise. Aftertaste has a little bitterness - not surprisingly woody in character. I cannot say this gueuze is really overwhelming me.

Aroma is funky lemon, earthy, just a touch of burnt bread. Taste is earthy, lemony, with again only a touch of the 3 Fonteinen-typical burnt bread, apple funk, a tiny note of vinegar and leather. Lively carbonation, silky mouthfeel. Amazing stuff, still after all these years, although I'm pretty sure it would have been better 2-3 years ago.",4.4

I didn’t think I’d get to try this one, thanks for being so generous.  Pours a hazed orange yellow with a foamy white head.  Earthy funky and acidic aroma with some citrus and vinegar ... full and inviting.  Citrus funky flavors of grapefruit resin, and a dirty oakiness.  Smooth and lively carbonation that leaves the tongue tart and dry.  Excellent brew.  Thanks a ton andrew.",4.4

25584,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle brought back from Brussels (bought at Beer Mania).  Wonderfully and unbelievably complex gueze...everything a gueze should be, to the max.

25494,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"750 ml bottle to geuze glass, to the face all by myself because it’s on-site only. Looks good; a hazy darker geuze orange with fizzy eggshell head. It was a gusher, so the carbonation has clearly held nicely. Smells and tastes outstanding; funky, spicy, fruity (mostly citrus), and mildly floral with a bit of a damp basement presence as well. Tastes like it smells with a pleasant mouthfeel. Complex and world-class, even after all these years.",4.4

25546,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Sampled alongside a ’99 and Millennium at a recent tasting with sideshowe, callmemickey and his wife Marie.

Pours a dark golden yellow color with pale golden straw colored hues and a two finger soapy white head. Good retention, slowly fading into a lasting cap that leaves sporadic spots of lace in it’s wake.

Earthy, musty aroma that isn’t overly funky with barrel/wood character as well as some barnyard/horsey notes, crisp light fruit and subtle citrus.

Medium bodied with a soft, earthy funkiness that isn’t harsh, solvent-like or overpowering allowing the citrus notes and vinegary acetic acids to shine through. Very clean, complex and smooth with a well balanced flavor profile that makes it very easy too drink. This beer has aged very gracefully, retaining it’s puckering, funky character while remaining clean and quaffable. It became more funky as it warmed and we came back to it, with hints of puckering citrus/lemon and a lingering vinegary, dry finish that left me salivating for more.

This beer is pretty amazing at this stage and is worth seeking out. Highly recommended!",4.7

25686,3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"1/7/05.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, sampled courtesy of TAR and cb on RateBeer 1/7/05.  Hazy golden-orange with a huge fluffy white head that lingers long.  Very good, long patchy, sticky and blotchy lacing--pretty close to a perfect appearance if the lacing were more consistent.  Awesome aroma that screams with brett and barnyard tartness, beautifully funky with lemon and shades of lime citrus.  Whispy and very soft body with deliciously pleasant flavor.  Very faint in all its measures beyond the tartness, and while it starts tart, it finishes dry and very soft.  Leaves mostly traces of the tart residue on the finish with a light glow of acidic citrus and must, dust, and chalk.  Light honey and very traces sweetness.  Bright particles of lemon tart sparkle in the mouth.  Really beautiful stuff, delicate and subtle the equal of any geuze I’ve yet had.  Thank you so much, Jeff and Emily!",4.3

Not for the first time, there I am in Jacob’s / Plan B’s cellar picking out something amazing to drink. As soon as I saw this, I knew I didn’t need to look any further. I’ve had it before but it was pre RB days. I won’t rattle on here as I just don’t think it’s necessary. We all know what this is and we all know it’s bloody amazing. It’s still plenty sour and is not struggling in the slightest. Maybe a little sweeter and more floral than other beers from Drie Fonteinen, or maybe that was down to age and the funk had settled down just a little. Whatever, it’s one of the special ones and is just sheer brilliance throughout. Jacob, you’re just a total bloody star mate.",4.4

T: Chocolate and cherry dominate. Plum, woodiness, coffee, and vanilla are subtle.

P: Creamy smooth. Chewy enough. It goes down smooth for such a high ABV.

O: The alcohol heat is definitely there. The coffee adds some nice roastiness without becoming overwhelming. In the end, the flavors were too subtle, which made drinking it somewhat boring.",3.1

Resampled some 2003 (11/7/09) at the SDBGF on tap. It was awesome having this slightly after having the 2003 BA version. This beer aged beautifully. The flavors popped with wonderful dark chocolate, rich roasted coffee, smooth roasted malts. The mouth is rich and creamy and wonderfully smooth. Outstanding beer!!!

My Ratebeer score reflects the regular speedway edition. Below are my ratings for aliased versions.

AleSmith Finca San Gabriel Bourbon Coffee Speedway
Earlier Rating: 11/6/2010 Total Score: 4.5
Served on tap at O’Brien’s Night of a Million Zillion Speedways 2010. Was able to get two samples. The appearance is the usual Speedway deep black hue with a medium roasty brown head. The aromas are strong with a medium roast medium bodied Central American coffee, very fresh aromas with an oily character to it. Some vanilla and nutty aromas too. The flavors are strong with that medium bodied fresh roasted coffee, essential oils, some light wood flavors a rich fabulous pure coffee flavor. Some nutty flavors and a touch of chocolate too. Very smooth and easy to drink brew, more laid back in intensity and incredibly well balanced.  Again another fantastic brew I hope they continue to make.

AleSmith Dry Hopped Speedway Stout
Appearance 4 Aroma 8 Mouthfeel 4 Flavor 7 Overall 17
Served on tap at O’Brien’s Night of a Million Zillion Speedways 2011. The appearance is the usual Speedway deep black hue with a medium roasty brown head. The aromas are rich roasted malts, bold roast coffee, and wonderful herbal and earthy hops. The flavors start out with the malty, coffee, and dark chocolate that is Speedway with a very nice addition of earthy hops. As the hops grow they taste more herbal and reminiscent of herbal tea. A coffee tea combo is pretty cool. The beer does become a bit astringent. I really liked this one but not sure if the astringent flavors would overpower if you drank even more.",4.6
15880,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Noire opaque, vêtue d’une mousse dense, épaisse et persistante, qui manque un peu d’agrément de dentelle. Le nez est sucré, aigre, plein de grains grillés et de figues séchées. Son goût, au travers la masse liquoreuse, est de raisins secs, de chocolat, d’espresso, le tout accompagné d’une douce et franche amertume. L’alcool s’invite efficacement. Un produit qui ne cesse de nous remettre en question. Un bel équilibre entre l’amer et le sucré. Une rondeur exemplaire. Encore une fois, merci Louis! (554-120113)",4.2
17268,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"I remember as a kid blowing bubbles in my chocolate milk (you know, because it was cool).  That frothy head had just as much silkiness and flavor as the actual milk.  The same holds true for this beer.  I must have been three or four sips in before I actually hit full bodied brew.  This was a great treat!  Black as night, loaded with coffee.  Each beer needs to stand on its own merits within its style.  And this one has a lot of style.",4.4
15433,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Year and a half old bottle. Dark brown pour, black in the glass, with a medium sized, light brown head. The aroma has a lot of dark chocolate upfront, with some strong coffee, dark stone fruit, burnt notes, and both medium and dark roast. A slight touch of alcohol as it warms. The flavor stars out big and sweet, with a strong chocolate and coffee. The sweetness is toned down a bit by some mellow astringency and bitterness from the coffee. A lot of caramel and coffee in the finish. Huge body balances everything and also hides the alcohol well. Fantastic.",4.4
15357,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Pours pitch black with brown head. Tastes intense, a bit salty with roasted notes, a bit alco in the throath. After barley wine feels super smooth. Great ethalon imperial stout. Third time I drink this and still love this.",4.1

16889,AleSmith Speedway Stout,Bottle.  Black with a small durable brown head.  Aroma is strictly chocolate and coffee with a pinch of hops that were hard to find.

17618,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"My first rating in quite some time, and well worth the wait.  Appearance: darker ’n’ a black steer’s tookus on a moonless prairie night.  Head: frothy brown, the color I associate with Bergman’s -Passion of Anna-.  Oh, and is it frothy.  Silken.  So its action is beautiful.  Flavor: like a rich cup of coffee, stronger than normal coffee taste, cappuccino maybe.   Palate: O the palate.  Smoother ’n’ rose petals flowing from Cindy Crawford’s posterior.  Overall impression: this is some top-notch shit.  To paraphrase a prolific internet movie commentator: Every beerfully literate person should experience this.",4.6
16976,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Wow! Pours with a small, ultra creamy, light brown head with some great lacing. Pitch black body. Amazing aroma of coffee and chocolate.

16955,AleSmith Speedway Stout,Pours totally black with a brown head. Very strong coffee and malt aroma. The flavor is very chocolatey and coffeesque with a little malt but not too much. Leaves a smooth taste in your mouth that has you longing for another sip. As it warms the alcohol becomes more pronounced and the malt stands out.Would buy again,4.5
17245,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Very dark, opaque pour with a dark brown head that quickly disappears. Aroma is warm roasted coffee bean. Taste sells this beer though, with more coffee flavor than a starbucks. Bitter, creamy coffee with bitter hops. This really has a warm, bold taste with great balance.",4.6
15783,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Pours deep dark tree bark brown. Zero opacity even when held in front of a light. Nice slow viscosity for a beer. Nose is a beautiful rich, espresso and malty chocolate. Palate has a surprising bitter almost hoppy bite with deep toffee, coffee and burnt hot cocoa. Long finish that stays in the nasal and back of throat with lingering malt. Delicious stout indeed. My wife reviewed it as follows: I taste a good beer. Well said.",4.2
16895,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Bottled, April 09, 3.4: Tried 2 different bottles but both were lactic. And the beautiful balance is gone as well. What happened?

Pitch black beer.

Aroma is specialty coffee, dark rye bread, dark chocolate, oats, toffee, hint of red berries, vanilla and toasted oak in a fantastic blend.

Taste is cappuccino, complex espresso, light coconut, oats, dark chocolate, vanilla, crema, charred oak and a light fruity note from the coffee.

Mouthfeel is unbelievably smooth with a perfect medium-low, soft carbonation. Very drinkable without ever feeling thin and while retaining a creamy feel. Plump body. Medium bitterness. Amazing pastry stickiness. Only small hints of alcohol (and they suit the beer) at this ABV, which is pretty ridiculous. This is how you do it. 

Overall: Thanks to BierCab Barcelona's amazing bottleshop, I finally managed to get ahold of this beauty. This is worthy of the hype! I do think it gets a tad bit too sweet at times and then too roasty at times, so the optimal balance isn't there but that is a bad case of nitpicking honestly. Fantastic brew.",4.3

17296,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Ominous brown head, huge cappuccino-like frothiness that settled into a thick ring of micro-bubbles around the glass.  Absolutely pitch black, with maybe just a very slight reddish-amber color when held up to the light.  Sweet, malty aroma with elements of molasses, caramel, coffee, cocoa, roasted grains, some slight nuttiness.  Ridiculously huge, overwhelming flavors of dark roasted grains, malt, molasses, dark brown sugar, coffee, cocoa... some slight alcohol presence but not too much.  The alcohol makes itself apparent after a few sips, in the form of a gentle warming of the throat and esophagus.  Slick, smooth, silky texture, but not too sticky--a reasonably dry finish, where the heavy hops make themselves apparent.  Pretty amazing.  Certainly the best of the style that I’ve ever had, and probably one of the hugest beers... ever.",4.3

16023,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Aroma is burnt malts: mocha, charcoal, tobacco, hazelnut. Aspiration helps the booze come through. A whiff could give you a buzz.

Gorgeous bowling ball black. Fluffy meringue of brown head. Beautiful sheet of lace.

The flavor is burnt cookies; boozy as hell. Raisins and dates. Heavy dark chocolate and mocha. LIke an overcooked brownie (in a good way).

Smooth, chunky, chewy feel. A little oily but more chalky. Strong and outstanding. I’ll join the chorus of aficianados.",4.5

Aromas with hints of molasses, cherry, currant, vanilla, coffee, espresso, chocolate, roasted nuts, caramel and toffee are most impressive.  Did I say there was coffee in this beer?  Good, because it is used brilliantly.  Taste was very smooth for it’s strength with a terrific salty finish.  Palate is excellent with coffee, chocolate, cherry and alcohol in the mouthfeel.  Quite smooth, not overbearing with the alcohol.  Drinkability is good for 12% alcohol and all that is in this beer.  Just a magnificent brew overall.",4.7

Massive chocolate, maple, dark roasted espresso beans, sweetened condensed milk, pipe tobacco smokiness and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-thick. Aftertaste burns a little from the alcohol but still exudes an even balance of sweet chcolate malt and roasted hops. This one is truly a rare treat.

15696,AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Had this on tap during the Speedway craziness going on, this time had the Hammerhead version. The rating here is for Hammerhead.  Unfortunately walked in unknowingly that they had 12 Speedway varieties on tap. Because I didn’t pre register, was only allowed to have regular or the new ""Hammerhead"" with no explanation as to wtf Hammerhead was. Once I took a sip, it was obvious to me it must be some coffee. Also I would like to note that I was very sad I could not try the others :-(

Pours pitch black with a small mocha head on top, looking super creamy. Aroma of huge acidic earthy coffee, a hint of chocolate, and just more huge coffee and espresso. Flavor follows with massive espresso, earthy and spicy, lightly acidic, with some hints of chocolate fudge in the background. Slight warming alcohol and lingering espresso. This really highlights the huge amounts of coffee here. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Honestly, this blew me away. One of the best coffee stouts I have ever had.

This is my bottled, regular Speedway version rating.  Pours black with frothy brown head. Aromas of bitter coffee, some hops, very roasty grains. Hint of chocolate. Smells more like a bold porter. Was hoping for more on the aroma (the only knock here and it is minor). Huge coffee flavor with a nice bitterness. A bit of a cocoa powder lingering on the palate. Another sip reveals a bit of dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel, lighter than I had expected but still pretty chewy. Love this because it doesn’t go all syrupy like some others. Really coffee forward with the right carbonation. Alcohol hidden but leaves a lingering warmth. Heavy lacing as it goes. Very nice. Really want to try the BA version.",4.4

Finishes bitter but doesn’t linger too terribly long.

This stout always impresses me because its opening notes are as smooth as many bourbon barrel aged stouts. Impressive work here, Alesmith, though I wonder if you used a lighter roast coffee if that would make this an even better beer.",4.4

14319,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Bottle shared at my wedding on 9/12/15. Pours pitch black with a deep-rising mocha colored head. Fading to a ring, with some swirls of lace. Aromas are bold with coffee wafting out immediately. The barrel character makes itself known, but does not smell hot....lingering sweetness of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate and a final dose of heavy roast. Taste is delicate, yet bold. Nice medley of coffee and chocolate out of the gate. Simmers into oak, vanilla and fudge....and then the bourbon creeps in to take the sweetness of the edges. Great mouthfeel, thick but not chewy...seems the barrel thinned this out in comparison to the non-BA Vietnamese version I had. Still, this body holds up nicely against the backbone and never tasted ""hot"". Finish was very oily and gave a great bitter coffee splash with more chocolate, vanilla to compliment the oak/bourbon. Great stuff!!",4.4
14286,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988 for his 1000th rating. Congrats buddy. The pour is a nice oily black with a thin head of dark khaki that falls to a ring, leaving no lace. The aroma is a huge chocolate bomb. It’s awesome. There is such a big chocolate malt presence. There is a strong barrel character as well. The bourbon is big and it does offer a nice addition of vanilla. The coffee is quite subdued, which I’m not that much of a fan of. The flavor is good, but lightly disappointing. The coffee again is lacking. The chocolate is big once more and the bourbon is nice. There is a strong woodiness to it that I just don’t care too much for. The head and chocolate balance well though. The mouth feel is a little light. It’s viscous, but you have to work the carbonation out and I’m not crazy about that. This one is good, but it’s not quite as good as some of the other BA variants. The aftertaste is chocolatey and malty and carries a little bourbon to it. It’s tasty",4.3

Drinking all of these side-by-side while becoming increasingly intoxicated drives home a few points. (1) they all pretty much taste the same -- I mean, the bourbon barrel versions are a little smoother with more bourbon/vanilla with the coffee in the background, but with the exception of regular Vietnamese I couldn’t telly you which of the many variants I was drinking without looking closely at the bottle. (2) that’s fine, though, because they’re all pretty tasty.

Appearance: Pours a turbid, dark brown, near black body with a thin, short-lived, tan head.

Smell: A very full, all-encompassing bourbon barrel presence on the nose -- large notes of oak wood and full-on bourbon with lighter notes of vanilla and coconut shavings. Pair this up with a malt aroma replete with plenty of chocolate and roast and you have something worth smelling.

Taste: Cup of Sumatra Dark Roast ’Black Satin’ Coffee stirred up with aged oak and light touches of vanilla and coconut and garnished with a few chocolate-covered coffee beans. Fleeting plum fruitiness. Some fire-roasted marshmallows. A pinch of Black Cavendish Tobacco. Medium roast bitterness. Plenty of alcohol to be found, but, thankfully, it’s not glaring. Warming, roasty finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Yes! This is going to be a pleasure to finish off, I can tell. It’s so darned yummy, I just had to tell the world!",4.3

9375,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2009 bottle from JohnnyJ in trade. Aroma of bourbon, signature Speedway-Ryan Bros, and deep, dark chocolate.

9493,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2006 Vintage (Bottle #85/233)

A: Dark brown-black body with a slight khaki head. Settled to a spotty skim quickly. Not much in the way of lace.

S: Lovely... Bourbon, oak, vanilla, espresso, caramel, general roasty goodness.

T: The bourbon here is sublime... all the flavor without much of the burn. Earthy oak and vanilla are present along with profound coffee and espresso flavors. Nice caramel underbelly with perhaps a little brown sugar.

M: Moderate-heavy bodied. Oily, smooth and lightly carbonated. Nice finish that lingers for a few seconds without any burning sensation from the bourbon.

O: Truly top notch. I think this vintage is just about at its peak. It was sublimely delicate and complex. Would easily seek out another bottle if anyone is trading!",4.2

Pendant cette longue dégustation, les mots prononcés furent rares et les orgasmes papillaires nombreux. Est-ce le meilleur stout impérial que j’ai bu de ma vie? Peut-être pas, mais il trône fièrement sur l’immense podium de la formidabilité! La bière noire assombri soudainement la terrasse en ce jour précis d’éclipse lunaire. Le liquide est surmonté d’une magnifique et légère mousse blanche que je ne me lasse de contempler. Des dentelles, lacings, formes géométriques diverses et irrégulières... Une Grande complexité au nez où tous ces arômes sont savamment balancés: anis, bourbon, café, mélasse, cassonade brûlée au chalumeau, vanille et noix de pécan rôties. C’est prodigieux! Les signes d’un subtil vieillissement se font sentir mais peu-importe, c’est merveilleux! Texture laiteuse; alcool brun et chaud. Le liquide coule le long de ma langue avec une sensualité à peine ponctuée par une faible pétillance me rappelant qu’il s’agit ici d’une bière. Je passe du massepain à la crème pâtissière en passant par l’éclair au chocolat. Longueur admirable et mesurée laissant les saveurs caramélisées s’étirer longuement et doucement.

9589,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Original:
Bottle 191 of 447 from Hophead22 beer tasting. Not very aromatic. Had a very sour after taste. Something happened to this bottle unfortunately. Maybe it sat in a hot car or garage for too long. I was very disappointed. Looking forward to trying the new batch and will re-rate this.

Update:
On draft at Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival 2009.  Dark black pour with toasty brown head that spilled all over my rating book (oops). Aroma was hints of coffee, whiskey, dark fruits, and cocoa. Taste was just bourbon and chocolate. Pallet was medium and nice. Overall very good stuff but the barrel over powers the roastiness and the coffee that makes speedway what it is.",4.2

Big bourbon thrust, too much at first but give this some air and it improves dramatically and the initial heavy handed strangulation tactic seemingly employed by the bourbon cask use starts to wane and this becomes a better stout altogether, though still not as good as the regular in my opinion. Good thrusty creaminess, vanilla, and lashings of chocolate infused with the fast retreating bourbon, its damn good!",4.0
9592,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle 53/233 from 2006.  Pours an elegent thick dark brown/black with a wisp of brown head.  Aroma is dried red fruit, sweet cafe mocha, and a hint of spicy hops.  The flavour is very refined with vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, café au lait, dried cherries, and a slightly bitter finish.  Alcohol is clearly present - like the pleasant warmth from a fine aged rum.  A very fresh, lively stout that I am glad I had the chance to sample.",4.6
9510,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"HUGE thanks to Kevin for sharing this growler with us!

A-Body is big, thick and opaque black. Pours with a 1-2 finger creamy dark tan head. Head fades eventually to a thick collar but plenty of lacing sticks all the way down the glass.

S- Exceptional. A delicate balance between bourbon BA characteristics and IRS characteristics. Very complex and slightly sweet-of moderate strength. Vanilla, oak, a slight hint of bourbon sweetness, dark chocolate, anise, dark fruit. Just wonderful.

T-Flavor is just as good as the nose but adds a slight roasted malt component to it. Upfront is a lot of IRS characteristics-dark fruit, anise, licorice, dark chocolate-and offers a bit of vanilla and bourbon sweetness and the slightest hint of oak in the background. A hint of roasted malt comes through for the finish to create an equal balance to the slightly sweet initial flavor. Some remnants of the initial flavor linger as well as a slight roasted malt bitterness.

P- Low to medium carbonation and a body that is thick, viscous, and exceptionally smooth and creamy.

O- This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The BA components compliment the stout characteristics very well and this is worlds better than regular speedway-seem like 2 completely different beers. The flavors are really big here but it is not nearly as aggressive as regular speedway. Great to try the 2 side by side!

9530,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"What great luck!  I was at the brewery and they had this on tap and actually got a growler fill ($30).  Pours completely black with nice mocha colored head.  Aroma of bourbon, earthy organic coffee, and burnt dark chocolate.  Flavor is hot bourbon which somehow blends into the rich coffee tones very well.  Also notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, and ash.  Complex and rich like a bourbon-drizzled brownie drunk with really great espresso.  The high ABV is much more noticeable than the regular Speedway with quite a bit of booze in the finish, but this is not overly distracting.  I had sampled this previously from a bottle and thought that it was much too hot (booze) and that it drowned out the wonderful smooth coffee tones which is what I love about the regular Speedway Stout.  But trying it from the growler, I have more appreciation for this barrel-aged take on a truly classic and world-class beer.  (386, 259)",4.5

It pours black with a brown head on it.  The beer is black, there is no brownish hints, no dark brown bullshit, this is black.

The taste is smooth, rich, creamy, absolutely not overdone with bourbon in the least.  This beer is phenominal.  Lives up to all of its high expectations, and then some.  These guys need to give pointers to all of the barrel aging brewers that have their beer tasting like bourbon.  With just the slightest bourbon notes, this becomes better than regular speedway.

Big roasted coffee aroma with combined elements of cocoa powder, anise, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and subtle hoppiness.  The body is thick and rounded, but could really use some carbonation to help move everything along and give the tongue even something more.

The coffee, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla meshed well, though I yearn for a bit of vinous character and a touch more hops.  Ultimately, I am not disappointed by this beer, but I also never thought it could be the best in the world.  It is very nice that the aging was not over done, but it really needs *some* carbonation and a hint of fruit to even consider being the best in the world.

9633,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle thanks to Hophead22. Bottle number 71/447. Poured pitch black with not much head if any. Aroma was very nice with dark fruits, chocolate and coffee with a touch of bourbon. Taste was oak, vanilla, lots of dark fruits, sweet chocolate, but coffee was weak compared to regular Speedway. This was very smooth and and easy to drink considering the 12% alcohol  but Personally I agree with Gabe. I would rather have a regular Speedway Stout over the BA. Big Up’s to Tim for sending this my way.",3.9

9820,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Rerate, 2006 bottle, courtesy of tertons.  Thanks, Nelson!  The most recent batches of the BA Alesmith beers have been rather disappointing.  Bumping this down a few points, out of the top slot.



TITW Part Deux - Rerate: 2004 bottle, #75/228, courtesy of jeffin7.  Thanks, Jeff!!  Raisins, dark chocolate, vanilla bourbon in the aroma.  Plenty of dark chocolate, dried fruits, slightly hot.  Long, milk chocolate finish.  9/4/9/5/19.



2004 bottle, courtesy of Bück Dich (a fine soul), RBSG 06.  Headless.  Coffee and bourbon in a glass-filling nose.  Upfront: slightly vegetal, showcasing its bourbon at the edges.  Nicely balanced, with a mouthfeel that lasts for ages, w/ layer upon layer of chocolate and oak.  10/5/9/5/19.",4.5
9426,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Reviewed from notes. 2009 vintage poured into a tulip I believe. The beer is pitch black in color with a light brown head and is completely opaque in transparency. The head dissipates to a soapy ring.  In the nose, I get milk chocolate, some light smoke, light oak, and very faint bourbon. Nothing here really stands out to me, pretty meh overall.  Taste follows the nose, chocolate, oak, some light bourbon, and malt round out the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel was light, almost a little watery in fact. Not much in terms of carbonation. No booziness and it finishes decently.  Overall this was a disappointment. In comparison to some of the other mammoth stouts that were sampled alongside this, this fell flat.  Hard pressed to see why this has received such accolades.",3.5
9285,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2012 bottle from Adam in trade. Poured Dec 7, 2013. Big time thanks for this one. Pours pitch black along with what looked like some coffee grinds, and a one finger mocha head. Aroma is bourbon, coffee, vanilla, roast, some chocolate, oak, light anise. Flavor is bourbon up front, light roast, vanilla, anise, chocolate, sweetness, more vanilla. Comes in waves, with that bourbon first then the layers of roast and sweetness. Much sweeter than the regular version, and I like it. Silky smooth, relatively thick mouthfeel, low+ carbonation. Sweet bourbon coats the palate and warms the throat.",4.8
9613,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottled @ Jbrus’. Aroma has chocolate, coffee, roast, oak, cherry and so much more. Black coloured beer with a brown head and an oily texture. The taste is sweet and has confit fruitiness, different sorts of liquors, prunes, whisky, oak/wood, chocolate, coffee, roast. There is also a touch of lactic sourness/milk chocolate. Full bodied with a lingering palate. Complex and well balanced. This is truely a wonderfull brew.",4.7

9554,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Had this from a growler of unknown origin.  Been looking forward to this for a long, long time. Speedway Stout is so awesome on its own that I couldn’t even imagine what would happen when they aged it in the -bals. The answer is that it became a ridiculously good beer, even among ridiculously good beers.  Pours a clear light golden color...no, scratch that, actually it’s pitch black. This is where photons go to die. Not much in the way of head, but then again it did come out of a growler. This is the beer’s only minor flaw, if it even is one.  Absolutely heavenly. High-quality chocolate and coffee (I’m talking weasel crap quality), roastiness, oak, and just a touch of bourbon.  Amazingly balanced, yet very intense awesomeness liquified. Lots of chocolate and vanilla, a little bourbon, sweet caramel malt, roasted malt, and oak. Coffee is definitely less dominant than in regular Speedway, as I hear aging will do to coffee flavor. This is a good thing, even though I like a strong coffee presence in a stout. When I drank this, I think a light might have shone down from the heavens and angels might have sang, but I’m not 100% sure.  Incredibly smooth, full, and creamy on the palate. Very soft carbonation.  I know this is a barrel aged imperial stout, but I could drink it ALL NIGHT LONG! I couldn’t imagine this beer really being any better unless they put weasel sh*t in it.",4.8

9765,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Another really amazing beer from Alesmith.

9308,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2013 Bottle. Pours thick deep black with a big mocha head. Aroma is bitter chocolate, roasted malts, big coffee, faint vanilla and oak and very little bourbon. Taste is coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and some vanilla and oak. Balanced, creamy, full bodied beer. I prefer the original Speedway to the barrel aged version. This beer was a slight disappointment as I thought the barrel aging would have improved this beer. Still a really great beer however, the original takes the gold medal for me.",4.6
9768,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2004, #157 of 228. Pour looks like a regular Speedway, tan head almost as thick as standard offering, a little lighter in color, with beautiful lacing. Bold vinous aromas meld quite well with choco-coffee and bourbon, some new oak, chocolate malts, lighter toffee and smores. Flavor is just what I expected though a little less aggressive than I’d hoped for: coffee, chocolate, molasses, burgundy wine notes. The bourbon taste is mild, but comes on strong over the fifty degree mark. Palate is very sticky, in my mouth and on my lips, though in this case as well, not as sappy as the regular version.. Also a little more oily throughout. Very full bodied, long finish that is semi-dry. Good overall, I totally enjoy the regular Speedway more and think it is best left alone. As far as barrel aged stouts go, it is pretty delicious. I’m glad I wasn’t awed, as obtaining the regularly produced Speedway seems to be a tad bit easier.",3.8

9750,AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thanks Abby for the chance to have a go at this beer!!  Shared at DLD.  I really wanted this one to blow my socks off and while it was excellent and a great imperial stout it was not everything I would have imagined.  The aroma was great  with vanilla, bourbon,chocolate, coffee, caramelized burnt wood and all sorts of other stuff as well.  The palate was incredibly smooth with the only notion of alcohol coming from the bourbon barrel not the actual beer.  And even then it melded really well and worked perfectly.  Alesmith really knows how to make the most completely balanced beers, and even when they experiment with barrel aging they still manage to make one the most balanced BA stouts, that is really tasty!  I guess I just had too high of hopes for this one that I was bound to be let down, but none the less it was still highly enjoyable and a real treat that I am so happy I was able to try.

The aroma is bourbon (but not overwhelming), espresso, cinnamon, molasses, and pinot noir. The flavor is just as impressive as the aroma. Bourbon, pinot noir, oak, bitter chocolate, espresso. The finish is woody and earthy, and has a coffee element that sticks into the aftertaste. Some prunes come out from time to time, as do tar, blackberry, and ash. The alcohol is very well masked. A very complex beer that melds together beautifully. This is high quality stuff. I wish I could get some more.",4.5

11179,Bell's Black Note Stout,"2012 vintage bottle pour.  Phenomenal beer. Little to no head.  Aromas are strong bourbon and roasted malt goodness.

Flavor is similar- some notes of roast, chocolate,  vanilla, slight coconut, mild anise, and earth all wrapped together with a nice bourbon whiskey goodness.  No booziness at all until the finish, and then there is a hint of whiskey and wood that is mildly abrasive.

10980,Bell's Black Note Stout,Poured into 5oz at new years day event. Pours a thick dark slick color with minimal head. Bourbon is easily noticeable but blends very well with the underlying tones of coffee and chocolate with maybe even a hint of dark fruit. Flavor is upfront with the bourbon and roasted malt notes and a heavy alcohol presence. Turns into a nice chocolate coffee mixture with a slight burn from the alcohol in the back end. Mouth feel is bitter and only slightly sweet. Carbonation is low and I think could benefit more. Phenomenal beer I would love to have again.,4.4

11093,Bell's Black Note Stout,"12-oz. Second batch, bottled 12-28-12. Thanks, JA! Pours jet black with a dense and creamy dark tan head that sticks around forever and ever. Humongous bourbony nose hits you before you really even get your nose anywhere near the mouth of the glass. Sweet and chocolatey, lots of vanilla and apricots, there’s coffee and prunes as well, but the predominant quality by far is the intensity of the oak and the bourbon without a doubt. Thick creamy body, almost sludgy, still showing carb--but it’s kind of a formality. Even if this were re-carbed, the density of the body would still keep this moving more like a creamy liqueur. So don’t spend a lot of time thinking about them bubbles. The mid-palate is big and sweet and bourbony, oaky, showing lots of vanilla and apricots and some sharper phenolic bourbony notes. Then lots of coffee, chocolate, prunes, and other stout notes thunder past. It’s big, heavy, complex, harmonious, just incredibly well done throughout. Lovely beer.",4.4

10963,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Bottle shared at Scopey’s 5000th rate. A huge thanks to Bruce for a beer I never thought I would get. Pours black with a tan rim which is very sticky. Nose is very sweet vanilla - huge vanilla macaron, vanilla bean, white chocolate, chocolate biscuit and big bourbon spice. Absolutely chock full of creamy vanilla in the taste. It really does remind of me of an amazing vanilla macaroon. Loads of creamy milk chocolate with plenty of vanilla sweetness, a good dose of bourbon, touch of spice. Almost a mocha like finish to it. Very creamy stuff and sweet as shit but it works. A nice bitter finish with a slight kick of heat. Nice depth and usage of the barrel here. For the sweet tooths. It’s very good, but like with most hyped beers, not amazing",3.9
10801,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Look - Oily black. Thin light tan head. Lacing not so much.

Smell - Bourbon. Black licorice. Sweet. Chocolate.

Taste - Bourbon/alcohol taste is very subdued. Honey and fruit. Sweet chocolate finish.

Feel - Heavy. Really no carbonation to speak of. This is what I like in a stout.

Overall - I got it! I like it better than KBS. Too bad this isn’t as readily available.",4.6

Notes: GABF ’13",3.9
11039,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Comes out of the tap a rich sable just a whisker above black with a dark, chocolaty tan head. Roast malt aroma has an overtone of bourbon-soaked wood and subtle notes of coffee, caramel and licorice. Flavor begins with a strong bourbon note and then blossoms with roast malt, quality coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, licorice, toffee and molasses. It is quite sweet, but not nasty; bourbon bite helps offset the sweetness. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and quite viscous, with an appreciable and persistent tingle. I have been chasing this beer for months, narrowly missing it at stores and getting no response from trade offers - and now I have finally scored this delectable brewski. Worth the wait!",4.8
10859,Bell's Black Note Stout,"I guess I forgot what my favorite style is. What a great beer. The aroma is one of the best I have ever had the joy of snorting up from the glass. All the great flavors are there, even the smokey, caramel flavor in the finish. Awesome beer.",4.4

S: Smells of strong bourbon alcohol and strong notes of chocolate and some vanilla. Very bold and very attractive, can’t wait to try a sip. 

T: Similar to the taste, Strong alcohol with a bourbon creaminess along with chocolate, dark berries, and roasted malts. Very good, but didn’t knock my socks off like I had hoped. 

Overall: Well carbonated and silky mouthfeel. The drinkibility is lower on this one though, It’s delicious and smell amazing but it would be hard to put down a couple pints of this. Great beer though, get it if you can, while you can.",4.3

11094,Bell's Black Note Stout,"12 ounce bottle poured a dark nutty brown color. It took a bit of coaxing but it held a coating of tan head. Aroma has sweet bourbon, chocolate, barrel wood, perfect oxidation, brown sugar, dark coffee, and some dark rich fruit. Absolutely wonderful with so many layers it just calls you to take another sniff. Mouth feel coats very well and it is rich and juicy with just enough carbonation to bring it all across. The flavor from both the rich malts and the barrel treatment are equally top notch and combine perfectly. Dark rich malts, sweet bourbon, hefty barrel wood, sticky molasses, coffee but with little bitterness, dark dried fruit, and a spicy hit of alcohol that is well within reason for such a big beer. Here is a case where the hype is deserved and the beer is beyond expectations!",4.4
11419,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Tap at Churchkey. Pours ink with a medium tan head leaving webby reddish lace. Nose is rich buttery bourbon with tropical notes like dried pineapple and dried papaya. Toasted coconut. Let it decant to cinnamon ganache and very subtle meat/umami character. Soft booziness, coffee liquor. So many rich subtleties makes this an incredible experience. Taste is similar to normal and Rare Bourbon County Stout. Super creamy, rich coconut oil mouthfeel. Feels less sharply bitter than normal Expy. Softer and easier to love than normal Expy. Superlative soft mouthfeel. Nice bitterness comes through to cut initial sweetness. Great mouthfeel- mild heat reminds of soft bourbon aging but softness is unreal. Roasty bitterness and coffee character hints that this is not BCS but something else. Very beautiful. Complexities are easier to fall in love with than normal Expedition which can be too aggressive  and powerful at times.

Nose holds amazing barrel vanilla and wood, cream, charred roast, bourbon-soaked cherries, dark and milk chocolate, and sweet mocha; just a stunning combination of aggressive tones of bourbon/roasted bitterness with silky sweetness. The flavor is absolutely mindblowing; huge creamy vanilla up front mixes with bourbon wood in the middle, then shifts to ashy roast with a brilliant roasty dry finish. The mouthfeel is super creamy and luscious, but with enough effervescence to aid that bitterness. The most impressive part about this beer is that you can taste the amazing contributions of the Double Cream, the bourbon barrel, and the Expedition all separately (and in that order, I would argue), but it is also incredibly integrated as its own entity.

Great mix of bourbon, molasses, tons of bittersweet chocolate... some cold brewed coffee for good measure.. again the alcohol is pretty hot... lingering bourbon/vanilla and brownie sundae on the finish... just lingers forever.. pretty damn well done. Happy that this one isn’t overly sweet and an insulin shot isn’t needed like BT.

Light carbonation with a silky thick mouthfeel.

I’ve got way too many of these ""landmark"" beers all stored up for a few hundred more ratings. I’m not going to sit here and not enter this one so it can be all celebratory when I do. 



Pours basically black with a small but well retained head. 



The aroma is big & sweet with lots of fudge & bourbon notes. The alcohol is there in a pleasant bourbony kind of way, even fainter is a hint of smoke. 



The flavor is roasty and bitter, this is not without sweetness and lots of bourbon character, but this retains so much of what’s great about the big awesomeness that is Expedition Stout. Plenty of chocolate, both in the dark bitter variety and the sweet fudgy variety. Some black currant and cherry fruitiness become more and more pronounced along with the woody character of the beer as it warms. 



Just wonderful.",4.3

11454,Bell's Black Note Stout,"10oz pour at city taphouse bell’s event

A: Deep brown/black body. One finger dark khaki head that held for some time after the pour. Spotty lacing.

S: Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, sweet cream, molasses, roasted malts and dark fruits. Complex and well layered. Nothing really overpowers the other elements.

T: Nice blend of boozy-goodness and sweet, dessert like malts. Warm bourbon is present from the first drop. Sweet milk chocolate, cream, molasses, caramel, a little roasted coffee, vanilla and some figs. 

M: Thick, full bodied and viscous. Low carbonation, but appropriate. A bit boozy, but not overbearingly hot. Nice lingering sweetness.

O: At first it was fairly easy drinking considering the thickness, but the beer eventually slowed down for me. This was likely the result of the underlying sweetness.

11609,Bell's Black Note Stout,"6/23/07.  Poured out of 64 oz. growler, obtained in a trade with mcallister on RateBeer 6/22/07.  Somewhat oily dark brown-black appearance with slightly crumbly, ""malt ball"" uneven, dark tan-brown head.  Carbonation and lacing could be better, but it’s a growler pour and the beer itself can’t be held to the fire too much over that, especially where everything else seems perfect.  Huge aroma of French Vanilla saltwater taffy, chewy fudge brownie, hints of molasses and a light burnt treacle, with fuzzy prickling hops and a warming bourbon-oak tingle, beautiful and lovely.  Decadent and filling malts, and I’ve only just smelled it!  Flavor is terrifically dense with chocolate and vanilla taffy, some caramel toffee, rich chocolate malt, and chewy bourbon, as well as a soothing, gentle lactose sweetness.  A bite of anise seed husks emerges as it warms.  Incredibly full-bodied and viscous, though not with a gritty, chunky viscosity like some other huge beasts (Dark Lord, Southern Tier Oat)-- this is thick and silky, almost like a syrup, but paradoxically not cloyingly sweet like one might expect.  The finish remains incredibly long with a focus on burnt char, firming up and thinning out the decadent chocolate-marshmallow syrupy malt richness.  There’s also a black roastiness married to that thin woody tingle, but a slight sort of medicinal retronasal alcohol burn creeps a bit too much in the back end.  The bourbon burn is coupled with an oaky, almost tannic dryness-- contributing an almost wine-like character even, like the most luscious cabernet you can imagine.  There’s a toasted nutshell quality WAY deep in the finish, but it’s undoubtedly there, and a sign of one of the wonders of this and many other masterful beers--  new eccentricities continue to unfold with each new sip, and sometimes even long after your last taste.  I can’t shake the taste of this beer even five minutes after my last sip, and thankfully the good outlasts the bad.  If the carbonation were a little more prominent, it might enhance the texture some, but I don’t know if it could have taken down that alcohol burn; still a stunning marriage of malt and wood, more densely layered with big stout and bourbon nuances than most others in this class.  More like Double Cream than Expedition, but the Expo undoubtedly contributes a lot of that heft that can stand up so well to the bourbon flavors.   Still, this isn’t quite as good as the best bottles of Expedition that I’ve had.  I’d love to try a fresher sample to see if it could improve any, but this will have to do, and I won’t apologize for how well it’s done.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff.",4.5

11614,Bell's Black Note Stout,"6/19/2007:  Bell’s Bourbon Barrel Double Cream/Expedition Stout pours out in a ribbon of milk chocolate brown.  It seems a bit thin, but as always, looks can be deceiving.  In the glass it has a deep, dark mahogany brown color and is nearly opaque.  However, it is clean and clear when held up to intense light and tipped slightly.  There is also a nice, foamy brown head that doens’t last too long, but does leave a thin lasting crown.  The aroma and especially the flavor of this beer are very intense and insanely comlex.  I will do my best to describe them both, but like most high quality beers, sometimes words do not really adequately represent how awesome it is...  The aroma is a lustrous composition of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted and caramelized malts, vanilla, docile bourbon, alcohol-soaked oak, char, and sweet anise.  Very complex, hypnotic, and alluring!  The flavor is very much like the aroma, but even more sophisticated.  Again, I will do my best on describing what I can...  The first pass is sweet and reveals caramelized malts, vanilla, chocolate, and char.  There is some sort of faint nutty quality as well that tastes like walnut or suble black walnut.  Each sample reveals additional flavors and complexities:  One sip has rich, layered chocolate, and roasted malts,  The next is creamy vanilla, soft and mellow oak, mellow bourbon.  After that comes tobacco, sweet licorise, molasses, and char.  It really is very deep and truly complex, yet quite fluent and refined.  Here is my last attempt as describing the flavor which might be the closest:  Creamy and sweet, semi-sweet chocolate, bourbon soaked wood, deep char, sweet licorice, molasses, a hint of tobacco, and some gentle warming alcohol.  There is also a blast of smooth bourbon just before the finish that gives way to more wonderful semi-sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, sweet char and subtle licorice.  The alcohol is so well blended into the flavor; it is truly complimentary to everything else going on in this beer.  I also provides a pleasant warming sensation as well without being out of control or burning.  Amazingly, all of there intricate flavors are expertly melded together in a beer that isn’t overly thick like sludge or syrupy.  The body of the beer is medium to medium-full body.  The carbonation is very fine which helps produce an extremely smooth and silky texture.  It is milky on the palate and sticky on the lips!



Overall, Bell’s Bourbon Barrel Double Cream/Expedition Stout is very intense, yet so easy to drink.  It’s hard to hold back and just not drink the entire glass quickly, but it’s so awesome that it should be enjoyed slowly so that each drink can be savored and pondered.  This is truly an excellent beer and a phenomenal blend of two great beers.  Characteristics of both beers are present, but they are so beautifully melded together that this blended, barrel-aged beer is absolutely better than either one is by itself.  True synergy.  Not only that, it is also a fine example of how barrel-aging should be done.



Draught (growler fill) from Party Town in Florence, Kentucky.  This beer was well worth the drive and wait in line!  I should have made my wife go so that she could have bought a second growler for me (it was one fill per person since it was only a 1/4 barrel keg), but that really wouldn’t have been fair to everybody else there.  After all, a beer this good should be shared with friends (although deep down I really wish that I could horde it all for myself!).  I really hope that more of this excellent beer is made available in there area...",4.7
10779,Bell's Black Note Stout,"Une grand merci à Clark pour cette magnifique bouteille! Cheers my friend! Bière issue de la cuvée 2012 en format 341ml avec capsule. La bière est d’un noir d’encre et sans mousse, si ce n’est qu’un mince anneau brunâtre et sombre en bordure de ce trou noir inquiétant. Nez duquel émanent de puissantes et chaudes vapeurs de bourbon, de vanille et de mélasse. Je m’attends ici à un liquide dense dominé par le vieillissement en barriques. Outre le bois et l’alcool, des fruits noirs confits, de la réglisse et un chocolat au Grand Marnier. Texture huileuse, alcool réconfortant, vapeur douces dans l’arrière-palais... Ohhhhh que c’est agréable! Du chocolat à profusion mêlé à un bourbon vanillé des meilleurs! Les malts rôtis offrent une base des mieux balancées et aromatiques à ce liquide charpenté et complexe. Une douce effervescence ajoute une touche de vie à ce liquide qui aurait sans doute été trop pâteux. Je suis sous le charme!",4.3

Thick body with good carbonation.
Amazing beer.

First taste is of the spices, with cardamon coming first, followed by a bit of cinammon, molasses and just enough chillies to be notable but not to burn, at least not initially - there is a soft burnijg on the back of the throat. Really nice with the condiments offering something different.

24444,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"I try not to get caught up in the hype of beers like Cigar City Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout that are only released once a year on a special day at the brewery for which you need to buy tickets in advance (i.e. Dark Lord, Kate the Great, etc.). But since two friends of mine in Florida were generous enough to send me a bottle of the last two editions, I figured it was okay to get a little excited. And now that I’ve tried the beer I can definitely see why it receives the praise it does. This is a very unique and impression imperial stout brew as it utilizes a variety of spices and flavorings to give it a taste you’re not going to find in any other beer of the style. It’s not quite world class, but it is damn good.



NOTE: The scores are indicative of the 2014 vintage.



The 2013 vintage was given to me by Christopher G. and the 2014 vintage was given to me by Matt S. Thanks to both of my friends for sending me these beers! I split each bottle with four friends. We poured them into various stemmed tulip glasses and goblets. 



Appearance: Both vintages are, not surprisingly, completely opaque black and a very dark shade of black at that. Both had a dark brown, frothy head, though the 2013’s was slightly lighter. Both heads faded relatively quickly and only left a little bit of lacing.



Taste: My friends and I started out with the 2014 edition, which at the time of drinking was an 11-month-old bottle. Right away there was a huge sensation of dark baking chocolate – intensely bitter, but also rich with chocolaty sweetness. Dark cherry and other fruit flavors are prominent as well, probably likely derived from the use of massive amount of malt in the brew (a lot of imperial stouts tend to have similar characteristics). On the second half, a strong surge of cinnamon spice sweeps across the palate – creating for a Christmas cookie-like taste. As it goes down, there’s a warmth from the peppers, though I would not consider it spicy in a peppery way. All in all it’s quite delicious, though a bit repetitive. I’d probably prefer a touch more sweetness, but what’s here is extremely pleasant.



The 2013 edition was noticeably different. The pepper character had faded, though the chocolate component had not only strengthened, but gone from bitter dark chocolate to sweet milk chocolate. The alcohol was also a bit more pronounced, ironically enough, though it did create for a slightly smokey, bourbon-like flavor. Cinnamon was still quite potent on the finish, though it was more a sweetness than a spice. It left a residual cloying/sticky sensation which is common for many imperial stouts. I don’t think anything was gained by aging this vintage, in fact, it was probably hindered a bit since the spicy character was weakened (though if you don’t like spice, cellaring a bottle is the way to go).



Drinkability: It was clear right away that both of these beers were pretty beefy. I believe the 2013 edition was 11% ABV and the 2014 was 11.5%, though neither had any kind of “extreme” quality to their weight. The mouthfeels were, of course, full-bodied, but with a soft texture and smoothness as it went down. Not much in the way of alcohol warmth, though the fresher vintage definitely had some noticeable heat from the peppers (but again, nothing too extreme). The 2013 vintage traded Scoville heat for alcohol heat and it was actually rather cloying in the aftertaste whereas the 2014 was remarkably dry. I’m glad I split these bottles with friends, though I was certainly feeling the weight of the brew bearing down on me afterwards. Splitting a bottle with friends and family is definitely the way to go.",4.4

24858,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Perfection!

Received this bottle from Chairmissing and I can’t thank him enough!

A: The darkest, thickest beer I’ve seen to date. Decent carbonation.

S: Coffee, chocolate and vanilla.

T: Let me start by saying I came into this beer very skeptical. I never believe the hype behind beers but this left me speechless. I let the bottle sit for about 20 minutes after taking out of the fridge, poured into a snifter. The first taste was strong chocolate and alcohol with a interesting aftertaste. As it warmed the cinnamon and chili became quite apparent. The strong chocolate hits first then some malt and to finish it off the chili hits the back of the tongue simply amzing and this is now the most complex beer I’ve ever had.

O: Can’t describe how much I love this beer. There is no way I will miss the release next year. I wouldn’t trade away the cellar to try it but if you have a friend near the brewery or someone offering you a bottle for a decent trade definitely do it.",5.0

Really in a league of it’s own at this point.  Flavors were also full of rich dark cocoa, lightly sweet, some vanilla and a hint of cinnamon and spice.  Oh how this warmed up so nicely.  A new top for me and worthy of all it’s praise.  The cinnamon and small hint of chilis really gave this one a ’wow’ factor.  Quite incredible.",4.8

Quite a beast on the tongue, packed with big smokey, roasted flavours and loads of bittersweet chocolate, sprinkled with vanilla. So bloody smooth on the tongue, really something else indeed!

Pours dense black with trace tan head; chaulky aromas of pepper, burnt malt and chocolate; quite harsh to me on first sip with ashy pepper and astringency spice; I really dig the nose in this one, but pepper and chilies are a little off putting to me; dry, ashy mix of peppers and chocolate; I’m kind of a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so not that unexpected that it’s a little much for me here; I’ve read that Zhukov is again the base here and while I love that beer, the treatment here (like the humidor version) doesn’t work for me; got another bottle that I’ll put some age on to see if the pepper fades a little bit",3.8

Alright this is why we came to Tampa. While I have had this beer before at craft festivals I have never actually reviewed it. Love the nose of this beer, it has such strong scent of coffee and cinnamon. It is hard to compare that odor, but it makes me happy. After first sip you can taste the cinnamon, coffee, and a hint of brown sugar and vanilla. Pretty complex and matures well while reaching room temperature. I would say slightly chilled is a great temperature for this 11% ABV beer. It is very smooth and easy to drink. Not an extremely thick Imperial stout. Wow…I’m really happy that I came to Tampa and am able to pick up some bottles of this beer. I personally think it is going to become AMAZING after a few years in the cellar.

24966,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"split 3 ways, poured into a tulip and two snifters. Thanks ""Suitcase Jon"" (Capra12)

Pours insanely black, void of any light. Thick tar-like syrup. liquid/melted chocolate. I have never seena beer so thick. Dark Brown milk chocolate colored foam. i think a spoon would stand up in this. plenty of thick head a couple fingers deep. It stands still long enough for me to grab my camera and line it up for a few close-ups. I know this one is gonna be good.

Aroma is heavy laiden with roasted malt and burnt toast. some espresso and pepper spice. Loads of dark havy chocolate on the end of the first nose. Espresso and alcohol after a swirl and another smell. I just can’t help but stare at this liquid tar, are there preserved dinasaurs stuck in there?

Taking my first sip. insanely thick and heavy. First is the bitter roast bounding my taste buds with hints of coffee slipping through the heavy doses of dark chocolat. rolling around through the tongue out comes spice and smoke. so much chewy thick syrup coats my entire mouth. Chocolate rides all the way across the top with alcohol and vanilla that swarm in the creamy foam that happens as it rolls through my mouth. More sips bring some tobacco and leather to accompany the slight smoke, as it warms a bit more sweetness of chocolate and caramel come out along with more peppery notes, i can’t tell if its cinamon or peppers or both. The 8 or 9 ounces that I poured myself of this were definately all I needed.

when i rolled this around in the glass the foam just clung to the glass fighting for its life and reflecting light with glittering accents like little diamonds on the very outreaches of the head.

This is truly one very unique brew. Can’t say i’ve had an imperial stout this big, thick, and heavy. truly a great one. Thanks again Suticase Jon for hooking me up with this one.

This beer could swallow any food up that you throw at it. only the richest most crazy thick triple chocolate cake with chocolate fudge layers and tons of heavy chocolate and roasted coffee sauce drizzled all over it would ever come close to matching up or cutting through this beer. If i was going to die tomorrow, I would order this beer with that cake.

Thanks to Joey for the taste.  I would rate this higher than a 10 on flavor, if I could.  The chocolate flavor in this beer is over the top delicious.  It is strong, creamy and decadent with vanilla and cinnamon spices added in.  The peppers are sitting in the back, providing just a slight burn to let you know they are there.  The mouthfeel is thick and oily.  Swirling the beer around the glass leaves a light brown oil slick on the sides.  I simply cannot wait until this hits the market.  The chocolate flavor is a desert of its own.  Fabulous flavor.  Great job!

RE-RATE:  After the Cigar City Kickoff party, I had to bump my rate even higher.  This beer is amazing.  Was told the ABV was kicked up higher, to the 13%-14% range, but it doesn’t show.  The flavors seem even more intense and the alcohol is hidden very well.  The chocolate in this beer tastes like the best gourmet chocolate I’ve ever had in a beer.  No corners have been cut.

2013 vintage, on tap at MBCC 2018, red session. This is far below the Huna's I've had so far. Maybe it's the tap or the age or both. Still a good Imperial Stout, but it feels a bit rougher and a bit oxidized, with less lusciousness.",4.6
24556,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Vintage 2011

A: Pours obviously quite thick - crude oil. Broken, dark mocha foam coats the surface and then dissipates nearly immediately. No residual foam. No lacing. The beer coats the walls of the glass and tans the window.

S: Plenty of vanilla. Plenty of earthy and spicy chiles. The ancho chiles are more evident than the pasilla’s, but nonetheless, the chile is there. Anise and licorice notes are also there, and IMO, more prominent than the cocoa. 

T: Dark chocolate truffles laced with salt, chile and vanilla. Decadent. Very sweet and sticky. The beer is not particularly complex, but the ingredients are fairly balanced in here. I’ve read that the chiles are the fastest dying aspect of the beer - I’ll buy that. The cocoa is at the forefront of the beer, but the chiles offer the counter to the sweetness albeit subtly. The vanilla flourishes in the ol factory aspect of the palate. There’s bitterness which is predominated by the malts IMO. 

M: Sticky, tacky, viscous, chewy. I really can’t use enough adjectives to describe how thick and alive this beer feels. The thickness is only interrupted by the fine, sharp carbonation. There’s no visual indication that this beer has carbonation, but the feel is spot on the for the style. Finish is dry and mouth watering. 

O: There’s no question this is a fantastic beer. Does it live up to the hype? Almost. A little more from the chiles and I would say yes. I can’t see the benefit of aging this in barrels. The bottle size is a bit too much for one, but would be great for four folks as a digestif.

24868,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2011 bottle courtesy of burg326.  Aroma is fantastic; chocolate and roast are very potent, cocoa, and sweet chocolate, almost get a note of fresh baked dense chocolate cake, caramel and molasses, vanilla.  Some hop bitterness, spicy note from the chilies, cinnamon, somewhat earthy.  

Pours like used motor oil, completely opaque, I can’t even see through the stream as I pour into the glass, nice tan head which is thicker than I presumed such a beer could support, retention is only a minute or two before subsiding to a thin ring of foam.

Flavor starts off with a load of sweet chocolate and roast; the roast flavor is pleasant and mellow, not at all puckering or astringent.  Caramel and cocoa, toffee, molasses, dark sugars and some dates, dark roasted coffee, nice vanilla presence.  Cinnamon really shows up once the chocolate and roast have a second to dissipate, slight flavor from the chilies, but they show up more in the form of a nice warmth in the finish.

Very full body, thick and chewy, coats the palate and keeps the flavors lingering for quite a while.  Medium carbonation.

From Notes:

A: Absolutely amazing pour. Ominous pitch black oil, huge deep brown head (almost purple), retention is surprisingly good given the ABV

S: Complex to say the least. Chocolate, fudge, vanilla, coffee, lactose, cinnamon, and dark fruit to name the main notes. Overall sweet smelling, but definitely has lots of depth

T: As I suspected, a sweet beer, and alcohol is pretty well hidden. Vanilla, fudge, chocolate, coffee, and cinnamon come the the front. I never really picked up on the peppers, but then again, there is so much going on.

MF/O: Thick and oily feel to it. Smooth and creamy despite the moderate carbonation.

tasted right after kaggen and it held its own!

the pour alone is worth a 5... thick viscous black with a creamy orange tinted head. lots of foam clings to the glass.

there’s definitely chilis in the nose.... along with black pepper, raisins, cinnamon, vanilla, dark chocolate, roast, a little rubbery smoke and a touch of sourness.

the flavor is all of that but much more intense... ash, chocolate, cinnamon and peppery spice are amped while it finishes a bit tart. the aftertaste is a nice blend of dark cocoa and vanilla tobacco followed by mellow sweet smoke.

Eventually it all becomes mixed together to smell a bit like a band-aid, but the chillis just seem to get more and more powerful. Huge milk chocolate taste with pepper heat following it up and a hint of vanilla behind it all. Elements aren’t so layered here; everything feels well integrated but each sip is very similar and it does get a bit tiring. Massively thick and oily mouthfeel.

Taste is very nice as well, loads of cocoa, roast, coffee, vanilla, rather medicinal as well, the chili becomes more evident the longer you keep it in the mouth.

24591,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Did a vertical of Hunahpu with year 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 Hunahpu bottles. 2010- pour dark black. aroma of spices, cinnamon and chocolate. Taste vanilla, cocoa, cinnamon and a good amount of spices. Love it. 2011- pour motor oil black. I was surpise 2011 did not have a punch of spices as 2010. The nose did have alot of vanilla. Taste was Choc, cinnamon and vanilla. 2012- pour black. Aroma was of more cocao and vanilla. Spices did come back but it was not as much. 2012 also has a peppery flavor to it as we’ll. 2013- still very much fresh had all the aroma. Cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, heat from the peppers and it tasted as such. Over all I think the Hunahpu beers is fantastic and if you can get your hand on a bottle get one. My favorite out of all the years is the LOL... BA Huna. If you can get a BA Huna get it!",4.6
24932,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Weird, somehow my rating disappeared for this:



Sampled March 2010

A vigorous pour produces a very, very dark brown colored head that is four-fingers in height and just crests the rim of my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is inky, perfectly black and remains opaque and black in hue even when held up directly to the light.  The aroma smells of a restrained mix of cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and roasted fruit, all the while being quite huge; meaning the aroma on this is quite over the top big, but there is a lot of competing complexity without the individual components not being in balance with each other.  There is a touch of a salty, maybe peat smoke like character that seems to be a combination of rich, umami laden dark malt, perhaps some chipotle like notes (which is strange that this beer smells faintly of these smoked chiles when none are included in the recipe) and some general spiciness that is more wood-like than anything from the chiles.  Roast malt character plays a big role here, but this is not nearly as big and unbalanced in its roast character as one might expect for a beer of this color.  The roast character seems a touch chalk-like at times, but is incredibly smooth, with ample toasted whole grain character in addition to the mellow, deep roasted grain component.  Ah, there is actually a hint of peppery chile, seems almost like green chiles at times; this last might be induced somewhat by the roasted malt.  The vanilla is almost the most subtle ingredient in the nose, but the chiles seem to be quit subdued too; though I think some of the fruit character comes from the chiles.  As the beer warms up more the alcohol becomes more noticeable and actually increases the burnt vegetal note just a bit too much unfortunately, but also compliments a peppery note that does work.  And on closer inspection, the green note is not so much the green, burnt broccoli like note that some stouts have, but rather it is a bright, green bell-pepper like note that is really not objectionable; my wife thinks it smells like fresh cut green vegetables.



Thick, viscous and creamy as it first hits my palate, but some carbonation lightens things up just a hint.  Huge roast malt flavors dry the finish out just a touch with some chalky notes, charcoal bitterness and a dry, rich dark malt character.  Surprisingly this is not as sweet as something this sweet seems like it should be; the roast character helps with this, as does a really rich, darkly complex malt character, some smoky grain notes, evoked flavors of peat and the sea (with an almost salty quality), dark cocoa notes, and an Ethiopian full-city roast coffee quality that is quite nice.  Rich fruit notes lurk just below the dominant roast character, suggesting flavors of black-berries, a big blueberry note that almost seems shocking, roasted dried fig flavors as well as some roasted prune like notes.  The chocolate character is big (well actually it is huge) here as well, one definitely finds a rich dark chocolate character, though it makes me wonder how much is from the base beer versus the added cocoa nibs.  Some spicy, peppery flavors start to emerge as this really warms up.



I like that this is thick and lush without being so cloyingly sweet.  Rich, berry-like, dried chile, ancho flavors start to become more noticeable as this warms up as well.  I like that the chile flavor serves a sort of ""hop-bitterness"" like role to this beer, it is fairly subtle to this particular chile-head, but I like the hint of subtle heat it adds as well as the touch of fresh chile character that is found in the finish.



I was fully prepared to not like this (though truthfully I was fully prepared to like it too), but I definitely do.  It is quite well balanced, much more than I was expecting and truthfully I would have liked a touch more ancho and pasilla character (speaking of which, does this mean that both dried pasillas (aka ancho chiles) and fresh pasillas where used here, or are this two distinct chiles in the Florida / Cuban culture?), but in the end this would have brought the so carefully crafted balance of this beer a bit too far off.",4.3

24402,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Amazing hookup by Weezel, thank you sir. I’ve been wanting to give this one a try for some time. Enjoyed it in the backyard with the wife, while watching some fireflies. Pours a thick looking motor oil like colour, deep mocha head that also has oily looking legs, tiny lace spots, but not much. Nose is cinnamon, chilies, vanilla, surprisingly not much roasted malt that I would expect from the colour. It reminds me of my wife’s chocolate chip cookies. Tastes sweet, cinnamon initially, then gives way to a little heat from the chillies and abv, vanilla is a large part of it too, the chocolate flavour is a large part of this beer as well, which I can only assume is from the nibs. That could explain the heat factor as well. There is a fudge flavour as well as some dark fruits that contribute to the awesomeness. It’s thinner than you would expect from the pour.

24670,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2013 vintage into a Teku glass. Thanks so much LiquidDegenerate!

A - Pours a pitch black body with two finger’s of dark mocha foam. Settles down quickly and sits still after a few minutes. Moderate lacing with weak retention. Swirling does coat the glass in a thin brownish yellow film.

S - Starts off with roasted char and just a phenomenal chili aroma. It doesn’t smell spicy or burnt or over the top, just delicious chili peppers sans the heat. Sweet vanilla, chocolate and earthy cinnamon really work to balance things out on the end. Has a sort of ""faux-cinnamon flavored coffee flavored drink"" thing going on, but in a good way. Really complex with a lot of different elements working seamlessly together.

T - Very roast dominant, and reminiscent of Founders RIS in the beginning. However things start to get complicated when the vanilla, cinnamon, and chocolate take over. On the very end is some subtle roasted chili flavor and even further back is a slight burn of the tongue. For some reason I was expecting something spicier, not the case as this is beyond approachable. All the flavors are present and just meld together. Medium bodied and creamy. Alcohol is very well hidden.

O - I absolutely love this beer. Completely lived up to the hype for me. The ingredient lists reads off like a most wanted lists for the perfect stout, just fucking fantastic!",4.5

As it warms the pure dark cocoa emerges even more. Then the cedar boosts the body even though its flavors are buried beneath the superb Mayan chocolate experience. Sublime and dreamy.

Re-rate from bottle. Inky thick black yields a dark brown head. Smells hot and smoky. Smoke is pronounced and spices are apparent in the back of the nose. Can really taste the ancho as it warms. That’s very cool. 8-4-9-4-17 = 4.2",4.5
24810,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2011 bottle at home. It pours jet black, with a thin dark tan head, which quickly dissipates. The nose is soy sauce, chocolate, a hint of chilli pepper, paprika, roasted malt, coffee, toffee and meat. The taste is chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, salted caramel, soy sauce, toffee, tanginess, tar and burnt tire, with a dry-roasted finish. Full body, low/fine carbonation and dense, sticky mouth-feel. Not quite as sweet as expected. Alcohol is pretty well hidden, but the dense nature makes it pretty tough going. It is good, but for me anyway doesn’t belong anywhere near the top 50!",3.6
24953,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Bottle shared with portableparty.  Inky dark black pour, dark brown head and a strong boozy dark chocolate, and spicy coffee aroma.

25177,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Bottled version:  Looks absolutely perfect.  Smells divine.  Taste is a lot different from how I remember, with the cinnamon standing out more, very complex.   God this beer is awesome.


On draft at the tasting room party.  The appearance was good but not great, I think that I’d like to pour this into a snifter before deciding if it deserves a 5.  The nose has strong, strong chocolate that meshes well with some notes of vanilla.  Didn’t detect much of the pepper until it got warmer.  The mouthfeel is extremely creamy and just divine, and the taste very closely follows the nose.  There’s a great blend of chocolate and vanilla with no coffee or burnt malt taste.  Don’t notice too many hop flavors either.  Not too sweet, just right.  The pepper hits the back of the palate gently but isn’t as significant as I expected.  Lived up to my expectations, and I cannot wait to try this again.  Also, it’s preposterously easy to drink two or three glasses of this.",5.0
6038,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Huge thanks to DocJ007 for sharing this one with us tonight. Happy birthday buddy!!




A - Pours jet black with a small film of tan head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Pretty much dead flat almost instantly.




S - Smells of milk chocolate, chili spices, vanilla beans, cinnamon, spicy rum and fruity brandy warmth. Everything that should be present is there and shining brightly.




T - Starts off with a mix of cinnamon and chili spices quickly being joined by the milk chocolate, vanilla and toffee sweetness. The spicy rum and fruity brandy match perfectly with the base flavors. Finish is spicy sweet with some mild booze burn, lingering long after the finish.




M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. Slick, spicy feel with a bit of heat at the end of each sip. Just needs more carbonation and it would be amazing.




O - This is a pretty incredible beer. The two barrels blend very well together and complement the base flavors amazingly well. I would still take the Apple Brandy version over this one but it is closer than any of the other variants I have had to date.",4.5

Aroma has porto, some alcohol tones and dark chocolate. Flavour is sweet with rum and dark chocolate. Peppery spices appear after some sips and take over.

Imperial Stout With Cacao & Spices Added. 50% Aged In Rum Barrels, 50% Aged In Apple Brandy Barrels.

Alkohol: 11% obj.

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy rozwścieczonego boga ognia Hun-Hunaphu

Piana: Beżowa, skromna o drobno ziarnistej strukturze. 
Głośno syczy i opada do niewielkiego paseczka. Na krawędziach TeKu pozostają punktowe plamki. 

Zapach: Jest miazga! Aromat rozpieprza na maksa. Na początek rum i rodzynki macerowane w tym szlachetnym trunku. Potem cała gamma suszonych owoców, kandyzowane jabłka, śliwki, morele i winogrona.
Zaraz po tym potworny cios prosto w twarz od ziaren kakaowca, gęstej mlecznej czekolady i belgijskich pralin. 
Knock out zapewnia szereg elementów toffi, kawy, rodzynek, cukru trzcinowego i przypraw korzennych.
Przepiękny bukiet!

Smak: Niewiarygodny beczkowy profil. Euforię smaków rozpoczyna szlachetny rum o jego mocnym i bezkompromisowym smaku, pełnym przypaw korzennych i drewna. Następnie wkracza z wielką werwą beczka po jabłkowej Brandy (czyli jak domniemam po Calvadosie) nadając trunkowi posmak pieczonej szarlotki.
Kolejne warstwy bukietu smaków to lawina czekolady, toffi, pralin belgijskich, trzciny cukrowej, drewna, rodzynek i toffi.
Ostatnia prosta należy z całą pewnością do przypraw z których najbardziej wyróżnia się chilli, stawiając kropeczkę nad „i”, poszczypując w gardle. 
Alkohol jest obecny, rozgrzewa, trochę mąci w głowie, ale na szczęście nie ma ciepłego, rozpuszczalnikowego charakteru i nie wychodzi przed szereg.
Ciała Double Barrel Hunaphu’s nie brakuje.
Dostojny, szlachetny charakter trunku zapewni wiele minut udanej, owocnej degustacji.

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

Nareszcie!! Hunahpu’s (kilka roczników) - NIE! Bourbon Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s - NIE!
I dopiero Double Barrel Hunahpu’s - zdecydowanie TAK! 

Przecudowne piweczko dające tyle radości i satysfakcji z degustacji!
Głęboki profil smakowy i zapachowy, oszałamiające beczki po Rumie i Calvadosie.
Balans, głębia, różnorodność, klasa i szyk.

Najlepsze piwo w dorobku Cigar City Brewing!

The nose is very rich, with tons of Mexican hot chocolate, vanilla, really great molasses rum, a really nice dose of maple and brown sugar, and just a bit of tingling burn on my nostrils. The flavor is rich milk and dark chocolate up front, a bit less cinnamon than on the nose, but just enough, moving to more molasses rum, vanilla, brown sugar, and a nice hint of spicy chili pepper that has a nice burn from my throat to my belly. The body is very full and creamy with light, but just enough carbonation, and a very long oaky chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy finish.

The nose is rich chocolate cake, powerful cinnamon, moving to graham cracker crust, and clear vanilla presence as well. There is feint vegetal quality here, with some earthen barrel notes as well. The nose is not the highlight here at all - but I knew what was to come - The flavor profile reveals a robust and fairly complex hunahpu variant - its sticky sweet, with chocolate cake and vanilla bean initial - caramel and cacao moving forward. The rum / apple brandy barrel treatment is a nice combo - although I wouldn’t have been able to pick out the apple brandy without knowing it ahead of time.

5982,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"> A total overhaul of Hunahpu creates Perennial BA Abraxas


[ Bottle ][ vacax ][ 750ml ][ 10K+OT Tasting ][ Stemless Wine Taster ][ 5/3/14 ]

>> Thanks Jake for this one! Pours ink like other Hunahpu’s with layer of weak, read foam. Stains the glass. Nose on this one is instantly the best of any Hunahpu variant: guajillo pepper, cinnamon, ancho chili, vanilla, graham cracker, rum raisin, dry rubbed skirt steak. Taste is also instantly the best of any Hunahpu by a long shot, in fact, this beer is so much better than previous Hunahpu’s that it is clear this is a complete recipe overhaul to transform this beer from an ashy, sour, thin mess to something 99% identical to Perennial Abraxas. Gone is that extreme sourness from over mashed black patent malt. Now there is rich, melted sea salted dark chocolate, assertive chili pepper deep heat from ancho chilis. Previous Hunahpu’s had near a smidgen of chili heat. Palate is rich and viscous instead of ashy and watery. This is a major overhaul and easily the best Hunahpu out there. Now the question is, why is this rated so much higher than BA Abraxas? I’ll give you one guess.


>!< what if CCB and another brewery made an identical beer? Would they be rated the same?",4.5

5881,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Shared by neat people of uncertain identities at a location remote of my dining room. 

The beer pours basically black with a smallish head. There is some sheeting on the glass, for sure. 



The aroma is huge, roasty & oaky with lots of vanilla and chocolate. It’s very sweet smelling with a mild spiciness and some light alcohol. 

Terribly inviting.



The flavor is awfully complex, unknowing that there was any apple brandy barrels involved in the production of this beer I certainly noticed some calvados character to it. It’s remarkably chocolaty and defiantly very sweet (but not without balance) It’s got vanilla, and cinnamon, and a nice warming booziness. The beer is jus over the top in all aspects, and perhaps it’s a touch too sweet and a touch too boozy, but these are easily forgiven given the depth of flavor and the utter richness of the beer.



I hesitate to give this one a 5 on palate, although the sheer thickness and mouth coating syrupy nature of it generally lent my opinion towards that inclination. Over the top is over the top though, and that one luxurious as it is may be pushing excess in the mouthfeel department. 



Really fun beer for sure. 

I think I prefer just plain ol’ Hunahpu though.",4.1
6012,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle: Huge thanks to Travis & Tommy for splitting this with me. Black, black, black & oily as fuck, topped with a velvety, fine mocha cream that lasts exceedingly long for a stout. This beer is a bowl Cinnamon Toast Crunch & Teddy Grahams covered in vanilla drizzle, fudge, & sweet Apple Brandy sauce. Chocolate, roast, sweet brandy, vanilla, cinnamon, mild coffee, graham cracker.... Only thing I don’t get is the chili peppers, I’m guessing the barrels have swallowed them whole. I don’t mind, though, because they might interfere with the decadence of this brew. Thick, chewy, creamy; this is a very big beer on the palate. A dessert beer to the max, fantastic all around.



Update: After having this quite a few more times thanks to many generous BA’s, as well as some local tasting groups, I have to bump the score up. This just gets better & better. Molten  Chips Ahoy & Teddy Graham cookies with cinnamon graham cracker, apple brandy, vanilla bean chips & dark fudge drizzle. This is truly an excellent beer.",4.6

6062,Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"I don’t have the best nose (been punched too many times), so I couldn’t tell you every little flavor that comes out in this amazing Imperial Stout. But it’s definitely chocolaty and boozy with almost no carbonation. It’s got just the right touch of sweetness and pours like fresh oil being put into your car. It has that distinct Hunahpu bitterness to it, which is reminiscent of any imperial stout, but as CCB can only do. We were limited to 2 glasses per person (special Valentine’s Day tap), which was easily understandable as after 1 glass I was feeling all warm and fuzzy. For me, it’s hard to say whether I would choose this over the regular treatment (and can’t compare to the Brandy Barrel Aged treatment since I’ve never had it). It’s a similar taste and mouthfeel compared to the Goose Island Bourbon County Bourbon Stout and it had no lacing on the glass, but was good and sticky sweet. I would definitely put this on the list for Hunahpu’s Day this year as one of the beers you need to try if you haven’t had it yet.",4.6

This beer, each time I enjoy it, produces another one of those magical beer moments where it’s almost impossible to pick up the pen to write any notes.  The first two times I’ve had it, I didn’t even bother, this time I knocked off at least something to make it official...This beer is a 30 year old wood aged port in disguise.  In fact, nothing from Bordeaux has ever come close to what De Dolle managed to extract from this wood.  Honey colored and wonderfully viscous with an unfortunately sudsy, sort of soapy head, but at least it still shows some carbonation despite its age and size.  Color and clarity are gorgeous.  The body is pure silk.  Forget every other time I said a brew had a velvet or silken palate.  I was an idiot.  This brew glides on Apollo’s wings across the palate, pure love.  The flavor embodies all that is ancient wooded port, hints of sherry, dry spices.  It’s a Christmas vigil with the fireworks of the 4th of July.  It’s sweet, savory, and deep, while its still making a sweet case for attention.  Hell, it’s too good to deal with the pen in my hands; it takes two hands to control this snifter.",5.0
14053,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle sampled with Stegosaurus. Pours hazy amber with an off-white head. Aroma of fruit, alcohol, sweet malts.

Sampled in ’03 my find.",4.9
14082,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottle at the 4/17/2005 Montreal tasting, shared with Rastacouere, Muzzlehatch, Tiggmtl, MartinT, Beerbuzzmontreal, Olivier and Simon.  Sipped while cooincidentally listening to the Beatles’ ""I want you"".  Aroma bursts forth from the bottle a full, intense and divine creation of sensory stimulants.  So good, the bottle was passed around and people waited in line to get ""seconds"" of smelling the bottle.  I described the aroma as ""just pure goodness"" but I will try to elaborate on that.  Fully rounded, never sharp notes of soft oak woodiness, red berries, soft grapes, caramel, toffee, sweet cherries, marzipan, maple, vanilla, subtle yet strong Belgian yeast, touches of light dough/honey and a bit of drying tannins for balance.  Wow.  Appearance is a thick-looking vibrant auburn-copper-amber color, with lacing as the small white head quickly recedes (no doubt 5 years in the cellar, oak aging, and a high alcohol).  Can the flavor live up to the aroma? It’s possible, I dare to think.  And to some extent, it does.  The flavor of a beer, in my mind, is a much more difficult beast to control and perfect, having to meld balance, mouthfeel and actual taste altogether perfectly.  Perhaps I am just an easier judge of aroma, but it seems easier to imagine a perfect aroma than a perfect flavor.  That being said, there was a little less intensity to the flavor than the aroma, some very light oxidation, a touch of dryness where it dosent belong and maybe a slight receding of firm, thick maltiness.  But this is criticism the beer brings upon itself.  I think near-perfect beers are easier to find faults with, being so close to perfect.  It is easy to hold them to a higher level, created by their sheer magnificence.  The malt is nonetheless, thick, rich, creamy and filling.  Candied apples, soft notes of smoked cinnamon, vanilla, syrupy cherry liqueur of the finest variety.  Bits of dry barley, light maple, playful Bordeaux wine fruitiness and light oak, never overdone, on the finish.  Distinct Belgian nuances from the yeast, light raisins, dates, plums and delicate brown sugar.  Perfect mouthfeel, full and not thin ever, but yet so easily drinkable for me.  Alcohol gives some warmth as it goes down, but does not show anywhere near 12%.  A most treasured experience, drinking this beer, and hopefully, with some luck, one I will have again.  Score is very difficult to give on this as far as flavor and overall,  I could easily justify a perfect score, especially taking in to account the graceful way this has aged.  But I will discount the flavor a point, and see what I think next time I have it.",4.9
14020,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Huge thanks to hopdog for the bottle, Rating #2000!!  Poured clear, fiery medium orange initially (progressively more hazy with subsequent pours).. loose dusting and larger bubbles of off-white head around the edges. 

 The aroma was just exquisite.. definitely a solid dose of Bordeaux influence over a sweet, supple base.. the underlying beer mellowed out considerably, leaving sweet caramel, toffee, and a delicate bouquet of light fruits (peaches, apricots, and some vinous influence).. deeper oak and Bordeaux undertones as well.. almost a sweet bourbon in there too. 

 The flavor begain with an array of sweet lighter fruits, sour oak, and grape skins, followed by warm caramel and toffee on the middle (accented by warm clove and other Christmas-ey spices).. warm back-end with a touch of oak and a bunch more vinous.. very long, warm, sweet and complex finish. 

 Warm and entirely fulfilling on the palate with great balance between sweet fruits, sour barrel influence and grapes, and alcohol warmth.  This was entirely what I needed.  Thank you Steve!!",4.6

14049,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Another rare beer that Degarth so graciously shared with me, yet 9 months later I am ratting it!  Sorry for my procrastination! I actually thought I had already reviewed this De Dolle after our tasting, apparently not!  

 Poured a hazy rusty orange hued body and a kakhi brown head. The aroma radiated a cornucopia of fruit; apples, sweet red & tart green, plums and pears. Amass of beet sugars on the front of the flavor profile, followed by oak, vinilla and a suggestion of apple cider. There was a bit of sourness, mostly from the cask aging, the oxidation was minimal for a 6 year old beer. Overall, as exceptional as this beer truly was, it was too sweet, which helped hide the bold Alc, yet it was still phenolic and aggressive; and although Truly toned down from the original yearly release of Stille Nacht, this baby was still a monster… even with 6 years of life behind it.",3.9
14156,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Bottled, 2000 version.

Pours thick and deep amber with no head. The aroma is heavenly and arousing. It strikes like a fina muscat wine, there's notes of wood and cherry and so much else I couldn't keep track on. As it warms it becomes more port like and developed peppery notes. There is loads of malt to balance it, and the body is firm and dense and with tremendous depth. It is sweet, sure, but never strikes me as syrupy or sticky just perfectly balanced. The finish is velvetty and oaky. This is as close to perfection as it goes, and this is arguably the best beer I've ever sampled.",4.9

Sharp cookie dough flavours, cinnamon powder, vanilla, maple, barley sugar, bananas, oranges, pancakes, nutmeg, pears, nuts.. lots and lots of flavours. Complexity layer over complexity layer.

Some specific details about this beer that will affect my rating points on this

This beer was held in a colling room at constant temperature for the past 12 years, i’m mearly stating this because i was sceptic about keeping beer chilled all those years and i thought it would kill some of the flavours.

This beer has proved me wrong, as most raters tend to say the beer had gone sour i can’t do anything but saying this beer wasn’t sour at all and has held up superbly !!! 


Head: bottle fizzed ( not gushing just making a sound ) and carbonation was still pretty damn good, white but very thin had that gets out of the way after a couple of minutes 

Colour: totally clear , golden/amberish 

Smell: sweet malts, touch of honey, ever so slight booze that blends perfectly  with the other scents, touch of dairy 

Taste: texture is thick and sweet just like a fine high quality Sauternes !!, superb flavours that are impossible to describe, i don’t know what the beer tsted like fresh, but it’s probabbly pretty close but mellowed to what it actually was, i have never ever had a aged beer that was so balanced, smooth, lively and perfect after 12 ( and even less ) years of aging !.

I never give beers a 5-star rating because i think the perfect beer doesn’t exist, but i’ve been proven wrong , this beer is perfect in my eyes, and if i would be able to trade my cellar for this beer i would do it without a doubt !!!

Very sweet body (much like the regular Stille Nacht in that regard), with plenty of caramel and residual sugars playing off a variety of sweet fruits, including plum, figs, a touch of cherry, pear, apple, and persistent vinous white grapes.

14044,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Pours an elegant golden amber with a subtle fire tinge and an even layer of white head.  This beer has everything going on in the aroma - light fruits, dark fruits, spice, vinous character, it just goes on and on.  The first thing to grab my attention are the succulent figs and prunes that decorate the bouquet.  Thoughts of a fine barleywine float through my head before fleeting, being replaced with a distinctly Belgian layer of cinnimony yeasty spice.  Soft, ripened pears and sugary muscat grapes also float gently to my nose, blending artistically with the dark fruity spice.  Rich, full body - lightly syrupy, but at the same time well carbonated mouthfeel.  This is a big beer that hasn’t lost any balance or succumbed to the effects of age.  More fruits flood my tongue.  I continue to be amazed how hoards of figs, prunes, raisins, peaches, apricots, caramel, and spice can coexist together so beautifully.

Smell is of hearty caramel, brown sugar, raisins, biscuits, vanilla, definite traces of wine, Belgain yeast, along with sugary bread. Small amounts of apples & cinnamon smothered in honey come through with a swirl and an inhale.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with sugary, honey infused, beauty of a brew bolstering huge complexitites.

14042,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"750ml - one of only 1920 bottles produced and aged in Saint Julien Bordeaux casks, thereafter bottled in 2002.  Heady aroma fills the nose with a rich, sugary, honeyish malt sweetness, various tangy, tropical and citrus fruits including pineapple, white grape, orange and juicy green apple, along with some earthy, lightly dusty, woody and herbal tones, dried flowers, a slightly musty and estery yeast presence and a certain peppery alcoholic spiciness, all atop a lightly vinous backdrop that does give betray some notion of the aging vessel and the impetus behind the idea.  Gorgeous deep rosy amber color, slightly hazy, with coppery highlights and a lasting, fine, creamy head accompanied by some fairly intricate lacing.  Flavor profile is equally complex and satisfyingly powerful, with suggestions of candied pears, golden raisin and apricot jam, followed by a light amount of spicy bitterness and warming alcohol, finishing with a degree of drying acidity, a blend of peppery spices and some lingering, fairly strong winey touches here and there.  Silky smooth and lightly sticky on the palate with a hugely full body to support the gratifying palette of flavors found here.  Many thanks to Murph who supplied me with this particular bottle back in the summer of 2003.

Sparkling sugar and candied fruit in the nose, a lot of honey scented malt and light candy sugar throughout.  Flavor is big, rich, syrupy and sticky up front.  Alcoholic oranges and bready malts noticed, with even some banana yeast esters present.  Heavy candy sugar throughout the drink, on the sweet side but not overly sweet.   Tannic, dry oak noticed with some sweet almond accents.  The wood character is quite fresh and new throughout, a testament to the care taken in aging the bottle.

Superb!",4.7
14057,De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Produced in 2000, Stille Natch Reserva is a very special, limited addition of De Dolle’s seasonal Christmas brew, Stille Nacht or ""Silent Night."" Stille Natch is a very special beer to begin with, but De Dolle really out did themselves when they decided to do Reserva. Stille Nacht is brewed with with pale malts, white candy sugar, is hopped, and then dry hopped with Nugget hop varieties, and comes in at a warming 9-10% abv. De Dolle boils this beer for 5 hours, making it a very high gravity brew. It is then bottle conditioned, and will continue to develop in the bottle. 

Any vintage of Stille Nacht is a true gift to any beer lover, but a 750ml corked bottle of the Reserva is truly a Christmas treasure. Reserva takes it to a whole new realm. Reserva was produced in 2000, and was aged for 18 months in Bordeaux wine barrels before being bottled. This age in the wine barrels, gives an already incredible beer a level of complexity, flavor, and character, that is in a class by itself. Reserva comes in at a warming 12% abv, making a very potent beer as well. 


Stille Nacht Reserva pours to a beautiful, hazy, deep golden color with a thick and creamy pillow of a head, and a lively and vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is incredibly complex and aromatic with big robust aromas just bursting in the air. Aromas of sweet malt, oak, candy sugar, deep vinous notes, spicy hops, and peppery alcohol flood the nose. The plate on this beer is rich and full, yet at the same time, has a nice bit of acidity, that dances on the tongue. Big, robust flavors of sweet malt, light caramel, oak, pepper, black berry, and vinous flavors, coat the tongue and glide down the palate. It is almost too much of a good thing, as your taste buds will be on bliss over load. Reserva finishes with more complex flavors up front, then ends with very vinous, acidic, and peppery flavors that linger on the tongue for quite sometime. 

In a word, this beer is stunning. This beer was one of the most enjoyable beers I have drank, ever. The age in the Bordeaux barrels really give this beer a whole new dimension. The vinous qualities of this beer combined with the fantasic malty overtones and warming alcohol makes this one of the most delicous beers ever produced in my opinion.",5.0

We have probably shared a bottle with Humulone Red about every year since it was made and it has staying power, even with a bit of oxidation (which actually adds some nuttiness that is very nice).

Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery (almost syrupy) texture, soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Nice stuff, and thankfully has more to balance the sweetness than the recent standard Stille Nachts I've had (though I've heard rumors in the underworld that we will see it return to the slightly more sour style of years ago, like this Reserva is).  This is almost like a blend of Scotch whisky or cognac and beer, with an enormous bucket full of raisins mixed in. Unusual beer to say the least, and somewhat difficult to rate.  Not my favorite from the brewery, but very good.",4.0

The flavor is sweet quad yeasts with pineapple, toffee, aged malts, light oak, cinnamon, and some very subtle Bordeaux.  Nicely balanced and very nice tasting.

355 ml bottle, 2017 vintage, from Boxbeers. Thanks to PowY!
Very dark brown body, with a smaller, creamy, dark beige head.
Amazing, dense aroma of chocolate, maple syrup, bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, soy sauce, coffee, dark fruits, some tobacco.
Tastes delicious, with similar aromas, very creamy and smooth to drink.
Full, oily mouthfeel, with a soft carbonation.
Finishes smooth, moderate roasty, medium sweet, a bit dry, a bit wooden, slightly boozy, with maple syrup, dark chocolate, moderate bourbon, soy sauce, some vanilla, slight coffee.

Amazing! The balance is really exciting, everything is perfectly dosed, no matter if the bourbon barrel, the maple syrup, the chocolate, or the coffee. Drinks incredibly smooth for the ABV.

4.5a, 4.5s, 4.0t, 4.5m, 4.5d
4.4 OVERALL

I got my second chance to try CBS at the Blue Dog in Chalfont PA yesterday. Low and behold this keg sampling had much more maple syrup presence than my previous sample last month at Capone’s (see review below). Although it was still a mighty tasty brew and the maple syrup was impressively present, I found it a touch outside my sweetness comfort range. Also the overabundance of maple syrup found in this sample overpowered lots of the subtle flavor notes I got to enjoy when I tasted this brew at Capone’s last week. The maple syrup totally masked the vanilla and most of the bourbon notes. I think I liked the more roasty sample I tried at Capone’s better but would probably prefer to blend the two!

8/16/09 REVIEW - MORE ROASTY KEG
Straight 4.5’s
4.5 OVERALL

Got my chance to try this white whale at Capone’s yesterday.

Appearance: Pours an opaque black into a tulip glass with a one finger off white crown that offers little retention or lacing.

Smell: What a beautiful array of roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, and maple syrup!

Taste: I’ve heard some say that CBS can be a bit inconsistent from keg to keg...some tasting maple syrupy sweet and others roasty. Oh wow this is one of the most well roasted stouts I’ve had. While my sample didn’t have much maple sweetness, I could tell that the maple helped cancel out any heat. This really was all about the coffee and roasted malt.

Mouthfeel: Perfectly carbonated medium body.

Drinkability: Surprisingly high considering the abv and style.

Quite impressive....really glad I had a chance to try it.

Serving type: on-tap

Pours jet black color with a steady thick beige head. Lots of coffee on the nose, roasted malts, some syrupy notes, caramel, dark chocolate and subtle hops. Flavor is roasted malty with a bitter bite, sweet chocolate and syrup, caramel and faint vanilla on the background, coffee comes through mostly on the aftertaste. Quite nice balance despite the strong sweetness but deceptively quaffable, alcohol peaks through eventually. Heavy, complex and tasty, maybe slightly over-hyped though.

Full body, fine massaging carbonation, semi drying close with a boosty kiss.

I especially like how they ignored the bacon temptation--this works so well featuring the original KBS with a worthwhile variation... it's a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the Jack Daniels Barrel Select I bought a while back, thought that introduces banana--eh, another story for another time... speaking of stories: I had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my forty-second birthday while staying with my in-laws in between houses, and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigerator...the dog loved it, but we all cried a bit.

13601,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Growler fill.  Pours a dark brown/black with a small beige head (combination of the growler and too cold at the time of pouring).  The aroma is very similar to the regular Breakfast stout with the addition of the maple syrup sweetness.  Mostly coffee, roast, and a touch of dark fruit.  The flavor was everything that I have enjoyed in the regular Breakfast stout: Coffee, dark chocolate, and roast with the added dimension of the maple syrup sweetness.  Cold the body seemed a bit thin.  As the beer warmed, the body came around (although not as full as I would like) but remained creamy smooth to drink.  The alcohol was not a major factor until it warmed significantly.

13140,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Sample @ EBF (2015)



Appearance: Black with a huge creamy beige head and good lacing.  



Aroma: Burst of maple syrup and roasted malts with chocolate, toffee, mild bourbon presence, vanilla notes and light alcohol presence.



Taste: Moderately to heavily sweet with maple syrup, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, marshmallow and alcohol.



Palate: Full body. Moderate carbonation. Roasty finish. Lingering maple syrup presence.  



Overall: A lot better than what I remembered from the bottle I had 2 years ago, but not even close to Tree House Good Morning I had a few beers before (which is kind of similar in style). It’s rich, but overly sweet for my liking. One of the beer that I think is the most overrated on this site.

The nose is primarily coffee and maple, but there is plenty of roasted bitterness to accompany, along with milk chocolate and molasses as it warms.  The flavor is bitter coffee at first with some oak notes of vanilla and cinnamon, tons of chocolate, both dark and milk, and a subtle maple flavor that serves to round everything out.

13299,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"It pours like old motor oil, jet black and very viscous, and in most pours develops about half an inch of a mocha-colored head. The aroma is simply sublime, with just the perfect calibration of coffee, bourbon, sweet maple syrup, and hints of chocolate throughout. Unlike what happens with other big stouts, the alcohol doesn’t spoil the experience—not the aroma, not the taste, not the drinkability. I really did not expect to find such a perfect balance between maple syrup/bourbon sweet and coffee/dark chocolate bitter, but I did, and I’m glad I sniffed the everloving crap out of this beer all the way through the end, because it truly is one of the best-smelling things I’ve ever come across. The taste wonderfully puts all those beautiful nose notes to execution, starting out with an onslaught of roasted malts, escalating the conflict with decadent coffee and 75% chocolate, and culminating with a grand finale of bourbon, milk chocolate, molasses, and maple syrup, which really is more subtle than what I thought it would be (hence the one point off). The mouthfeel perfectly tunes into all of this, with subtle carbonation that doesn’t get in the way and a thick body that shows you what a respectable beer you’re drinking.

13001,Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"6 oz pour from Burg and Barrel, Overland Park, KS.

The nose is not what I was expecting. From other descriptions, I figured a big boozy nose on this, but what I got was much more subdued. More like roasty chocolate milk, what I would expect to get from a milk stout with chocolate added. No coffee whatsoever, but that might just be the age on the beer. But if I had it blindly, I wouldn’t guess there was any coffee in this. Also, the glass had a significant smell to it, possibly detracting from the aroma.

The appearance was a deep deep, brown, not pitch black, caramel highlights along the periphery. Thin, almost nonexistent, khaki head.

Taste is where this beer truly shined for me. So much flavor. VANILLA. Definitely some bourbon. Slight maple. Slight coconut. Roasty chocolate. Again, no coffee at all. And no bitterness whatsoever. But vanilla all over the place for me. I don’t know if there’s vanilla added here, or if it’s from the the oak, but damn, so much vanilla. Which is just fine with me.

The beer’s a medium mouthfeel, maybe fuller side of medium, but definitely not heavy. So smooth. Dangerously smooth. The oak is mostly present in the finish, as it dries out the mouth.

Overall, this is the best beer I’ve had, and am fortunate to have gotten a taste. If the nose was a little better, this probably would have been a damn near perfect beer. But again, there are several factors that could have taken away from the aroma. Beware of the alcohol. It’s so well hidden even with the bourbon highlights. I got a slight warming once it was all the way down, but nothing in the nose or mouth. You could get in trouble if you had more than a little. If you’re able to find some of this, and it’s not super overpriced, don’t hesitate.",4.3

Pours pitch black with a big, super thick tan head that recedes slowly to a small cap and leaves lots of lacing along the sides.

The aroma is stunning.  As a coffee lover, I definitely love the fact that the big coffee aroma and dark roasted malts from the underlying beer is still dominant, but the reason it’s world class is the maple syrup sweetness.

Well, if the aroma is stunning, then the taste is sublime.  Again, the Breakfast Stout is still easy to pick out with the heavily toasted dark malts and freshly ground coffee.  But the maple syrup takes over midway through the taste and leaves a lingering sweetness after each sip.

The mouthfeel is as smooth as any beer I’ve ever tasted with soft but noticeable carbonation.  It’s not full bodied, but close.

Very potent chocolate and coffee, some maple and roasted malt, and mild whiskey.  Sipping is sweet, though it doesn't linger.  Flavors are balanced pretty well.  I'd say that rich chocolate is biggest, followed by maple, and then cocoa, whiskey, roasted malt, and coffee.  Long chocolate and maple aftertaste is quite mild.  Full bodied, thick and creamy in texture, and softer in carbonation.  This is extremely easy drinking considering the alcohol content within.  Quite simply, its delightful in every way.",4.3

The beer pours basically a black color with a good sized head & lots of lacing on the glass. 



The aroma is sort of a pleasant amalgamation of espresso and bourbon... you can tell that it’s boozy from the aroma but it’s not off putting or ""cheap-vodka""-like... The aroma is very roasty & rich with some nice vanilla. 



The flavor is very bourbon forward, I drank this glass pretty much at room temperature and it’s far more bourbony than when it’s just straight cold. The beer is sweet but not ""dessert sweet"" a’la Bourbon County Stout. Unsurprisingly it’s a big roasty beer with a nice level of bitter chocolate, the vanilla is mild but pleasant, there is some green pepper character but not enough to be an annoyance, the coffee character all around comes across as a touch brash and there is a pretty high level of alcohol spiciness.

Poured into a snifter 

A: Pours dark black that does not allow any light through even being held up to a light. About a one finger head of chocolate milk color that dissipates rather quickly (30 seconds). There is some slight lacing.

S: Smell is dominated by bourbon and oak. I also pick up on the alcohol even after a little more than a year of aging. There is also roasted coffee, sweet molasses and some dark chocolate notes.

T: The taste is again dominated by bourbon and the oak wood. The alcohol is definately present and after allowing the beer to coat my mouth, the alcohol does have some burn. After swallowing whats left is some sweet molasses. Allowing the beer to warm some there is a nice warming effect on me. 

M: The mouthfeel is rater thin for such a powerful stout. A creamy character comes to mind but surprisingly does not stick around long after swallowing.

O: To my surprise I was not as impressed as I thought I would by. Do not get me wrong, KBS is a top notch BA stout that I would love to have again, but the hype may have let me down on this one some.

Pours a rich dark chocolate, with beautiful clarity and and a thin inviting mocha head that quickly dissipated. The aroma earns high praise. Never overpowering in any one regard the bourbon barrel does come to the fore. Rich vanilla bean, booziness and dark roast coffee follow with a nice hint of floral/orange hop presence. There is also a nice smoky/woody underpinning that holds everything together. The taste is rich complex and well balanced, but you better like bourbon. Not overpowering yet bourbon is the star of the show. Lightly sweet and medium bitter the carbonation is soft and the finish is long and rewarding. The texture is slightly sticky but the beer is never overly heavy. It is definitely a sipper. Overall ...A huge yes please! This stout is substantial and fulfilling a tad bid boozy but a whale worth spearing. I’m really liking how this opens up with time and the emerging coffee and semi-bitter chocolate notes.

The mouth feel is lighter than I was hoping, but it’s still decently thick. There is a decent carbonation but it’s not as good as I remember. The aftertaste is lingeringly bitter roast and good bourbon chocolate. This isn’t as good as I remembered. Still good",4.6

29135,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Received from BA orbitalr0x as part of BIF 33, this much anticipated beer came in a stubby bottle with a label design reminiscent of bygone time.  When poured, the deep brown opaque body aided by a mocha colored, one finger thick, foamy head was inviting and imposing at the same time.  The aroma was heavily laden with dark roasted coffee and freshly hewn oak.  I took a half a point off for the smell being a little too acrid, and lacking either the chocolate or dark fruit undertones of other imperial stouts.  The taste was naturally coffee driven as well, with the Bourbon barrel aging providing a smoother, and drier feel than was expected in a stout of this strength.  The vanilla like oak tannins and the substantial hop and roast grain bitterness came through much clearer towards the end of each sip, before being subdued by the eventual warmth of the peppery ethanol.  The mouthfeel was abundantly thick and just a hair short of chewy.  The hefty punch of alcoholic strength made this a fine late night digestif, but detracted from the drinkability a little.  If you drink this at breakfast, call in sick and go back to bed till noon.",4.5
26665,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),Hype hype hype. I think this beer is worth seeking out the hunt is truly half the fun right? First of all breakfast stout is one the best top shelf easily accessible stouts. Then to barrel age it! This beer is well crafted and flavorful. With that being said I was overwhelmed by the coffee everything took backseat to the coffee And that was disappointing the barrel brought forth vanilla and oak the chocolate roast was there. It’s truly a wonderful stout once the coffee punch subsidies. Yes it’s one of the better barrel aged stouts I’ve had but the coffee dominates and masks a lot of flavor that would make kbs really shine.

27382,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Bottle at Craft Beer Rising (London, 19 February 2015)

Pours dark black with a finger of coffee brown foam. 

The nose shows a lot of milk chocolate with heavy notes of bourbon, slight hints of peat, and a good round off with vanilla (more vanilla coke imo). 

The palate is very smooth and surprisingly light bodied (like most of their breakfast stouts). Slight alcohol bite in the middle, but dominant flavors of chocolate milk (most likely due to a moderate lactose sweetness and vanillin from the bourbon barrels), a very clean espresso finish & bitterness. A smoke background throughout the whole beer. All flavors are very balanced and somewhat delicate yet robust.",4.4

Everything seems more rounded and balanced and without the bitter coffee astringincy. Aroma of wet wood, coffee grounds, some bourbon, and both semisweet and milk chocolate. Pours oily black with a thin dark brown head. Flavor has lots of sweet and dry roasted malt, chocolate, some toned down coffee notes and lots of wood. Rich and creamy on the palate. Finishes quite woody and dry with a pleasant alcohol kick. Thanks again, Dan!",4.1
26028,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"355ml bottle brewed in Michigan at 12.2% (2019 vintage). Black with a neat tawny head, decent duration. Caramel and vanilla with some lurking coffee and chocolate fudge succulence in the aroma. Lowish carbonation, robust texture. Bitter finish with light alcohol. Sweet chocolate and coffee ground developing more complexity, then bourbon wood kicks in in the aftertaste. Thoroughly souped-up version of their Breakfast Stout, staying close to it in terms of flavour profile, perhaps a little sweeter all-in-all despite the increased bitterness. Complex, rich, balanced - but perhaps a little overrated. Still, it deserves credit for popularising the style, and definitely delivers on it.",4.3

11789,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"NOT A SHELF BEER





Solid Pour courtesy of saultbauls. 

Pours basically black with a small head that pretty much just goes away. 



The aroma has plenty of coconut, woodiness, sweetness and bourbon. The alcohol is noticeable but less so than in regular Bourbon County Stout of this age & there is a surprising bit of dark fruit shining through here. 



The flavor is very sweet, it’s got plenty of coconut flavor which works well here in a sort of coconut cookie a’la vanilla and evaporated milk kind of way. There is also a hefty bourbon and boozy element here, again with the surprising dark fruit flavors similar to the aroma. 



The palate is of course huge and mouth coating.

11834,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"22 oz. bottle. There was a time in my life where I would spend a long time trying to track down a beer like this. I’d spend a day or two trying to track down bottles of a hard to find beer for friends and trades. It’s funny: I’d actually stress myself out about tracking down a bottle. Some where. Anywhere. Walking into stores and asking, ""Do you have it?"" to be greeted by a tired and cranky beer salesman saying for the hundredth time, ""No.""

I look back at those times both positively and negatively. Sure, the hunt was thrilling. But the stress? How foolish I must have looked? Here I am, now fully employed and I can’t take off to hunt down rare beerz. I was fortunate enough to track down a bottle or two of this late November of 2013 whale.

Pours a nearly jet black pour with a quickly dissolving head. Some cola tint color at the edges. Aroma of strong bourbon barrel and inviting coconut. Mild almond milk and dark chocolate, touches of barrel and booze. Some cold pressed coconut oil, coco, and vanilla. Flavor is sweet with mild saltiness and umami notes. Sweet, boozy, but not sugary. The coconut is pleasant and complimentary to the Bourbon County Profile. As typical with Bourbon County variants, it’s palate dominating, leaving the palate awash in booze and chocolate. Huge, lush mouthfeel. Finishes with lingering bourbon and chocolate notes. Mmm. So rare.",4.3
11745,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle shared in London - huge thanks to the guest of honor, Jason. Pours black-brown with a fine, beige foam head. The nose has a good bit of dark chocolate and lovely coconut. Medium to big sweet flavor with lots of gooey chocolate, oily coconut, mild bitterness, slight torched wood. Full bodied with fine carbonation and oily texture. Only mild warmth to finish, which is quite impressive given the ABV, lots more sticky chocolate, plenty of oily coconut. Super well balanced, quite rich and decadent. Very drinkable. Excellent.",4.5
11733,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Sample poured at The Beer Temple’s 1st year anniversary party. I have an unopened bottle waiting for me which is likely to be enjoyed before the end of the year, as I expect that the coconut will drop off within that time. Right now, this comes out with a fantastic viscosity and dense, decadent mouthfeel that is unlike any other imperial stout I have encountered. The aroma is heavy on coconut and cocoa with just a hint of spice from the Rye barrel aging. This series will be rotated/reinvented each year but for now enjoy this top level beer whilst you can.",5.0
11748,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle, massive thanx to kermis for sharing this beauty. Pours a headless, pitch black beer with light carbonation going on. Aroma of massive chocolate, slight coconut, vanilla, molasses, roast. Amazing stuff happening here with loads of complexity and different layers. Overall a very sweet, kandi sugary smell over it. Great. Flavor is amazing as well, massive sweetness overpowering the front of the mouth, followed by a roasty, ashy middle and rounded off by a nice hint of coconut. An amazingly well balanced, complex brew which I can’t get enough off. Long, cloyingly sweet aftertaste with again the coconut present. Soft, oily texture. This certainly lives up to it’s reputation!!",4.8

APPEARANCE: pitch black beer, no foam. Though some little coconut pieces in my glass!
NOSE: bourbon, alcohol, very sweet, little vanilla there.
TASTE: sweetness, bourbon, coconut is really clearly noticeable, it’s a strange thing. The bourbon county is a little ’easier to drink’, but still very good. Coconut adds to the flavor in general. Very faint peat at the end. Very nice, but not worth the hype maybe...

Making a beeline for the Goose Island tent as soon as the gates opened I was able to get two pours of this amazing imperial stout. A world class release, this version of Bourbon County Stout made the ticket worthwhile on its own. While I am unlikely to pick up a bottle because of the cost I look forward to trying a few more at festivals and other special tappings.



Aroma / Appearance - An inky black base with long legs creeps from the pitcher into the glass. Anise, coffee, chocolate, and heavy booze rise into the air like dense smoke. Vanilla accents add even more depth. The Templeton Rye peeks out from time to time but due to the general heaviness does not stand out on its own.



Flavor / Palate - Strong malt, coffee, smoke, and Templeton Rye stick to the tongue and throat. Chewy after just a few seconds, the mouthfeel offers something for everybody as it crawls to a bitter warm finish. Despite all that it never feels suffocating. Six to eight ounces would be a perfect pour as I’m not sure I could finish much more on my own in one sitting without having a whole evening.",4.4
11821,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle @ Crooked Stave shared by Baron with Bill and I. Thanks so much! Pours a thick black appearance with a dark brown head. Big dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, sweet whiskey, slight coconut aroma. The coconut actually comes through way more in the flavor which tastes like German Chocolate cake. Lots of fudge and chocolate notes along with toffee and whiskey. Great beer though I’m not sure I would put this above normal BCS. This is what I wish Momi Hiwa tasted like.

 The appearance notes are basically the same, Opaque, oily, small minimal head or lace. Rich bourbon, vanilla, charred oak, coffee mocha, leather, tobacco, and burnt coconuts are the aroma and flavor profile notes. One thing that was different was that the tap offering seemed much heavier of both coconut and chocolate and less roasty notes. Very smooth with excellent dark fruits undertones but missing the charred character needed for balance. I much liked the bottled offering more than the tap...

In the retrofaction, some coconut indeed, and upon a closer inspection, there are some small white coconut leftover flaoting in the glass. Body is oily thick, yet the alcohol heat is overwhelming.

It’s highly sweet with a touch of bitterness in the finish. It’s thick, chewy, syrupy with a full, rich body, and not much carbonation. Definitely a sipper. It has a very port-like quality to it that comes through at the finish with sweet meaty dark fruits (raisin / fig), vanilla bean, a touch of sour cherries, a touch of mellow alcohol warmth (really nice considering the near 15% abv) and a rich chocolate and caramel. At the end of the finish a touch of pine bitter comes through, but is otherwise a very dessert themed chocolate and caramel mouth coating - it’s not heavy, but it does stick around.

11837,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Bottle courtesy of Tim. HUGE thanks goes out for this one. Pours pitch black with a small brown head that recedes quickly. A big chunk of coconut floating on top. Aroma of huge fudge, some roastiness, a little coconut that gives it a Mounds type of smell but it is rather subdued, vanilla for sure, sweet brown sugar, very light licorice, and mild whiskey notes. Lots to like on the smell with the fudgy chocolate dominating. Flavor is massive fudge, a bit if rye whiskey spiciness heat up front on the to the tongue. There is a nice roasty component to this, some definite vanilla, and very subdued coconut. I was expecting more coconut punch but the fudge flavor really takes over. Nevertheless this differs from regular BCBS and I suspect there is a nuance from the coconut that provides this sweet yet roasted finish that takes it above the regular version. No doubt this is one of the best BA stouts I have had. Really sits alongside CBS with a similar sweetness level and without the coffee. Big, rich, thick mouthfeel, perfect lowish carbonation. Drinks way easy for the ABV, but with just a touch of lingering heat in the throat. A rich dessert beer that isn’t cloying at all. I would love to try this next to a regular BCBS to compare but I don’t have a buddy with me for this and that would be a rough morning. I’ll have to savor this on its own.",4.8

11689,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"On tap at Heidelberg at a Goose Island migration week tap takeover!! The pour is a nice black, with a thick thick khaki head that doesn’t want to fade down in a hurry. This was the first pour, so I expected the head. The lacing is just beautiful! The aroma is big on cocoa and roasted malt. There is a beautiful hint of the rye whiskey in there, and not a whole lot of coconut. Molasses and dark fruits are also present on the back end. The nose on this is awesomely complex. The flavor is great as well. Hot damn. The thick, syrupy greatness has a ton of roast and a lightly sweet molasses. The coconut isn’t really overly present here until it warms up. The coconut comes through after it sits on the palate for a while. The mouth feel is thick and viscous with a great covering carbonation and it just beautiful.

11826,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"22 oz. bottle sampled with compliments to AirForceHops. As would be expected, all the deliciousness of the BCBS aroma and flavor were quite present: vanilla, wood and buttery bourbon flavor enticed the taste buds and warmed the belly. Faint coconut in the nose, but most notably at the finish. Given a second for the slick liquid to pass and the senses to mellow with all the other flavors, a slight inhale through the mouth helped bring the coconut flavor to life. By no means a tropical fruit bomb of suntan lotion, but just the right amount of flavor to let you know that it’s there and that’s what the brewer wanted you to taste. Very, very well done!",4.1

11832,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,This stuff was fantastic. Super nice chocolate aroma. Perfect creamy chocolate feel with that smooth layer of coconut throughout. Really drinkable. Really great stuff.,4.5
11803,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"My Bottom Line:

Coconut thrives through this fun dessert of an Imperial Stout, swimming around chocolate and caramel flavours in an otherwise heavily sweet, complacent mouthfeel.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-There is no head of foam atop the darkness.

-The sweetness is prevalent and can get on your nerves quickly. Glad I got to split this bomber with a few likeminded aficionados.

-When the coconut subsides, this beer might reach better cohesion. For now, flavours are harmonious, but the flavour profile is not nearly as tight as it should be.

-The flatness and utter dominance of the coconut make this much less compelling than the ratings suggest. 



Bottle.",3.7
11814,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"Pour is black with virtually no head and coconut shavings floating on top... interesting. Aroma is of chocolate fudge, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, brownies, and slight bourbon. Flavor is sweet at first, with notes much like the aroma, and transitions into a boozy oak finish.

5301,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"650 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 3/3/2012.
Inky black and viscous looking. A vigorous pour yields only a slight chocolate head. No retention to speak of.

Smells wonderful. Bourbon, but so well integrated. It’s not a bourbon bomb like regular BCBS. Vanilla and oak blend seamlessly with the chocolate stout flavors. Far less boozy than regular BCBS. Even less boozy than Big John.

Initial tingly bourbon flavor followed by vanilla and caramel malts. The flavor fades to a darker malt roast of chocolate and coffee. Very sweet, but almost forgivable given the flavors at play. The sweetness gives it a slightly fruity flavor that complements the roast nicely. Like chocolate covered cherries.

Regular BCBS tastes like it’s 20% alcohol. This tastes nowhere near 13%. It’s amazing how dramatically it changes the beer. Still immensely sweet and a slow drink. Thick, viscous, and low in carbonation.

It’s a really good stout. Much better than BCBS. Worth the money? Probably not.

Update: Drank my last bottle on 10/3/2016 side-by-side with 2015 Rare and there was no comparison. 2010 was still drinking great and was a far better beer than 2010.",4.4

5384,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Tasted from a numbered bottle at Three Kings Public House during the Goose Island Migration Week St. Louis. It poured an opaque, nearly black color, reddish at the corners when held to the light, with thin but lasting tan foam, Belgian lace and alcoholic legs when swirled. Irresistibly rich bourbon barrel aromas: toasted hardwood, vanilla, buttery booze. Standard imperial stout characteristics too: caramel, brown bread, toast, roasted barley, dark chocolate, nuts, toffee, coffee and cream, plums and sour cherries, faint black pepper and bright acidity. Faintly tangy hops bitterness made it all the way through. Medium heavy body, full chewy mouthfeel, smooth alcoholic warmth. Exquisite multi-layered aftertastes: fruity, tart, toasty, bourbon-y. As with other versions of BCS, the syrupy thickness and dark tannins actually stained the glass. Insanely delicious. I didn’t think I’d ever get to try this sought-after beer. It’s seldom that something so hyped and highly anticipated actually IS as good as they say. This is undoubtedly one of those times. A near perfect beer.",4.6

Just a pleasure to sit back and drink this beer.  Top fucking notch.",4.6

5550,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Big thanks to Ben aka Hojaminbag for busting this one out at 3:30am the other night to compare to the ’07 DL. Bottle poured into a taster glass.

A - Pours opaque black with a nice half finger tall deep tan head leaving light wisps of lacing down the glass. The pour was just ok.

S - Smells of rich bourbon heat, sweet chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and wood offer some contrast to all the dark roast hidden within this beers core. The bourbon heat was a little overpowering toward the end. Based on the smell this one could use a bit more time to mellow out. It actually kinda smells like the DL at this point.

T - This one tastes just like you think it would. Tons of dark roast blends in well with the chocolate sweetness, vanilla, wood, and warming bourbon heat. This one is a bit more earthy than the DL. The finish is mostly roasted heat lingering for some time. I like how this one isn’t overly sweet like the DL is, more of a well rounded barrel aged stout. The pappy barrels really did their magic on this one. Glad I finally go to try this one.

M - Very heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. This is one heavy beer on the pallet with a mix of deep roast and bourbon heat in the finish.

O - I thought this one was pretty good. I think it is still kinda rough around the edges but it should mature beautifully over the next few years. I look forward to having it again in the future.",4.3

5491,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"A: Opaque black with a very small ring of head that drifts away almost immediately.

S: Super rich fudge/brownie batter. I don’t know how else to describe this. Vanilla with some bakers chocolate, great bourbon character on the nose, smells smooth.

T: Almost no carbonation and the alcohol (given the ABV) is almost non existent. Toffee, caramel, bourbon, chocolate, roasted char (subtle), maybe even a bit of fruit in there. Super sweet bourbon and vanilla goodness. This is the ""creme de la creme"" of bourbon county, or any bourbon barrel aged stout for that matter. Simply excellent.

M: Very thick and slick, it coats the mouth and sticks around for awhile. Leaves a very nice aftertaste that lingers.

O: This is fantastic, and definitely a step up from the regular bourbon county brand stout but I am not sure that the price tag is justified. If I saw this beer on the shelf would I buy it again? YES, and I would save it for a special occasion. A great experience nonetheless!",5.0

5470,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz bottle brought to a tasting by me, via trade from Tweety. In my cellar since 2010. Consumed 6-16, reviewed from notes.

A: I’m shocked. This is deep black. I great a really nice mocha head from my pour, though, and the legs stick to the glass. Perfect presentation.

N: We drank this after running through an 06-11 vertical, and the nose is definitely PvW. It has a deep oakiness which I’ve only experienced when drinking the bourbon straight. The caramel, vanilla, and coconut also have some extra heft. Chocolate, espresso. 

T: Dark fruits (prunes and raisins) Chocolate. Dismayed by the lack of roast/coffee. Caramel/vanilla. Some residual heat, but it’s gotten to the point of being a nice touch. 

M: Smooth, silky and viscous. 

O: This is really very good when viewed outside of the ridiculous value-inflation of the beer. However, I dare say I’d take the 2009 BCS and the BCS Vanilla over it. The PvW 23 is great to taste in the blend, and it is a deeper flavor, but it’s not a religious experience, either.",4.5

5545,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Big ups to Goose Island for actually selling this business in Iowa, big ups to my homies Sam, Jeff, & Eric for coming over finally allowing me to share this, big ups to my Wife for allowing me to buy nay 1 but 2 bottles of this beautiful stuff. Cheers All! 
The beer pours black with a small head that goes away quickly, The aroma is particularly pungent with some spice cake, loads of bourbon, vanilla and cherry. There is a nice dark dried fruit character to the aroma that I don’t really get as strongly in the original version of this beer particularly raisin. The aroma really has a very limited alcohol character and is particularly appetizing. The flavor is nicely sweet with loads of bourbon. I wrote ""refined bourbon"" in my lil’ notebook... I guess by that I mean that the bourbon character is well rounded and the beer honestly tastes like it was aged with a higher grade of bourbon than we usually get in bourbon barrel aged beers. There is not a ton of harsh alcohol or woodiness but instead the vanilla and mild spiciness are much more prevalent in this one. Flavors of cherry and maple syrup provide a nice compliment to the vanilla and sweetness of the beer while a subdued but ever-present roastiness brings some coffee like flavors to the table. This just has an enormous depth of flavor, it took all of us forever to finish our glass (in a good way). The palate is that thick mouth coating sensation that anyone who has had any of the Bourbon County lineup of beers knows so well. Maybe if I’m lucky I’ll get to try this again some day.",4.5

This is everything that the two year craze of bourbon barrel aging (bal-ing if you must) has failed to achieve. A ridiculously dry, bitter, hefty stout that takes the characteristics of the barrel itself, including the heat and brash pappy qualities.

There’s not as much bourbon in the nose as I’d expected, but it’s definitely there, mixed with sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, and molasses notes. Taste is boozy upfront, but not over-powering. Bourbon, roasty, chocolatey, sweet vanilla notes. Full bodied and rich texture, low-to-medium carbonation. Perfect blend of bite and smoothness. Overall, this beer was great right when it was released. Two years in the cellar really rounded it out into a damn-near perfect beer. Each sip was better than the last, and when it finally got down to the last few drops, I didn’t want it to end. That’s the definition of a great beer, and Goose Island nailed it.

Taste of sweet earthy chocolate and bourbony flavor, toffee, all of the aforementioned aromas blend nicely in the mouth. Thick body, smooth, silky, oily, soft carbonation. Thanks once more Kyle.

5716,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"22oz bottle, #3,642 with an 11/19/10 bottled on date. Picked up this piece of hype at the Binny’s LP Black Friday event. Pours an oily black colored body with a few ruby-brown traces around the edge. Thin, frothy, dark brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light ring around the outside. Aroma absolutely jumps out of the bottle upon opening. Extremely rich and smooth. Loaded with molasses, caramel cookies, vanilla, an underlying yet distinct roast, dark chocolate, and a very pleasant warming bourbon that never announces itself as boozy. Some raisins and dark fruits, soft oak, and barely a hint of leathery tobacco. The barrel presence is quite deep, but anything but overwhelming. Flavor is more the same. Loaded with thick, rich, and sweet chocolates, molasses, and caramel cookies up front. Smooth vanilla, somewhat salty oak, raisin, and roast follow quickly before the extremely deep barrel aspect wraps this up. Tons of sweet bourbon, but oh so soft and never boozy. The barrel completely dries this out with a very enjoyable warming feel that increases more and more as it flows down my throat. This beer finishes better than Peter North. Plenty of vanilla, raisin, bourbon, oak, rich chocolates, molasses, and fairly bitter roasts make it so complex before leaving a lengthy aftertaste. Full, silky smooth body and barely a trace of carbonation. Fantastic mouthfeel. Overall, I was skeptical, but the ratings are legit. This is every bit as good as advertised. The barrel aging on this is so deep and complex, but it still has plenty of sweet, rich, and roasty malts. Spectacular balance and enjoyable in every aspect. $43 and two hours in the cold is a pretty steep price tag, but damnit this is a world class barrel-aged imperial stout.",4.6

Perhaps my new favorite cider, easily on the level of Leo Boutin Pomelle at any rate but far more drinkable, dangerously so.",4.5
10297,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Bottle # 1068.  Bu11zeye, you are now my hero!!!!   Holy crap!!!  The color is dark amber, redolent of the finest Berenauslese from the Mosel.  Wafting from the glass is a symphony of apples, honey, apricots and more apples.  Hints of Keifer lime leaves finish the assault.  The flavor is an intensity the likes of which I have never experienced.  Concentrated apple essence, hints of apricots and slight notes of tropical fruits.  There is an acidity that pulls everything together.  As close to perfection as I think I will ever see.  Re-rated 10-18-09

Pours darker orange than Neige, and aroma is a luxurious tropical fruit blend.  Flavor is remarkably suggestive of pinneapple, lychee, and ripe apple.  My girlfriend also said it reminded her of Lilikoi (passion fruit).  Texture is thick and finish is long.  Just a beautiful drink of balance, robust flavor, and gorgeous aesthetic.",4.5

10242,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,Bottle@Home. Nice stuff but I preferred the Neige a lot more. It does give you the feeling of apple essence but it’s a bit too sweet and not much more than the apple.,3.6
10303,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"5/4/07.  Poured out of 375 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with Olivier_MTL on RateBeer 12/3/05.  2003 Vintage.  Pours a deep amber-gold color with good clarity and a bold, beautiful depth of autumn color.  The oily legs on this cider are much broader and slower than those of its brother, the Neige-- tilt the glass and there are times that the high edge of residue takes literally several minutes to droop, like the wax from a freshly-lit candle.  The aroma here is much richer and more succulent also-- some overripe apples and fresh apple sauce (complete with cinnamon accompaniment), as well as soft caramel and a captivating, warming, sweet-liqueur aura.  First taste is decadently sweet with a lightly leathery, lightly waxy tart apple outline.  The finish drops most of the soft tartness that balanced the initial taste and leaves a homemade soft-and-syrupy cinnamon apples and a slight apple pie doughy flavor.  Some zesty alcohol rounds out the mouthfeel, sort of a funny way to balance the gripping sweetness.  This is even more indulgent than its companion, lacking most of the tartness of crisp fresh apples but replacing it with an intoxicating medley of apple desserts that rival the best restaurant creations I’ve ever sampled.",4.5

Amazing and lovely mix of fresh apple, almond, citrus and almost an underlying vanilla feel. Hazelnut and again this overwhelming fresh strawberry coming thought. Very full bodied with maybe a hint of alcoholic and thick texture. Soft carbonated. Heavy sweet flavor with good counter acidic.

10333,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Deepest cider gold, still, very honest viscous legs coating the glass. Strong applesauce aroma, even more decadent than the pomelle I believe if less powerful and alcoholic. Elegant whole apples, juicy like no other. Red apples, pears, pancakes, toasty, baked nature. Greenish toward the end as it develops the mildest acidity. Incredibly controlled flavours. In mouth, this is one of those sensory overloads, immediate and cutting, one that makes you forget the world exists and take everyone of your concerns away to leave only you, your bubble, the glass, the cider and an ecstatic moment, one that cuts a bit short as you realise you’re holding a pen and must express your emotions one way or another. Thickest applesauce palate, as thick as a JW Lees, the dark lord of ciders if you will, cinnamon undertones, slick, only slightly boozy goodness. Almost fuelic and in a good way this time. Greenish tea finish, long and powerful. Utter apple decadence, I can’t imagine cider getting any better except for a most funky example that I’ve yet to encounter, so this might well be higher rated for me one day as I try more. Genuine and awe-inspiring.",4.6

10166,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,Bottle shared by b3shine. Poured dark pale color with a minimall head that diminished quickly with excellent legs. Heavy sweet apple and soft alcohol aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and solid legs. Solid flavor of apple with a medium to heavy complex sweet finish with a warming alcohol burn of moderate to long duration. Good after dinner sipper with a good cigar.,4.1
10296,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Melted bricks of gold covered in oils and sunburst orange candy shells. Totally translucent, wide and shapely legs. The aroma is pulsing with apple, whole and stem-inclusive, so potent it’s hard to move the cider glass away from my nose to attempt a sip. The nose is not eve close to wholly apple, however. Apricot, puree, high-brix honey, molasses, maple, fresh figs, black cherry pit notes in moderation, mild spiciness, white flowers undefined, vanilla, the mildest lavender essence, clove liqueur all hold my attention as long as they please. This aroma is pure, it is dew-scented, it is utterly magnificent. In the flavor, at first, medium-high acidity seems out of place and overdrawn. Sweetness is very high but it’s not as intense as expected, actually less than the Neige ice cider from the same ciderie, mostly due to relatively high acidity. Bold tropical fruit notes now include pineapple and mango, as well as lesser kiwi. Notes of woodgrain trickle in and back out again. The finish is smooth, sweet, lightly acidic, enduring and succulent. The mouthfeel is extremely full bodied, viscous, sticky, syrupy and sugary. Alcohol is incredibly well concealed throughout this entire experience. A masterpiece.",4.5

10184,La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"Skinny bottle cracked at Eric’s Epic Tasting. Pours glowing gold. Aroma is caramel apples, granny smith, peach, wood, and a touch of cinnamon.

The aroma has...apple?...hah...but almost something like pear and plastic as well, definitely intense and fresh, some spice.  Very sweet.  So sweet you just have to confront it and either embrace it or tolerate it.  And I love sweet drinks like port.  For all of its sweetness, the palate is thick but not sticky, somehow.  How does this make me rethink ciders?  It eliminates a lot of the sourness and acidity associated with good quality ciders (esp. English ciders, e.g.)--it is obviously a distant stylistic cousin to English farmhouse cider--while retaining and concentrating the flavors.  But I wish it didn’t have to bring the sugars to such concentrations.  Clear but a still yellow appearance.",3.8

Closer and deeper inhale reveals intense, deep, rich apple that is the essence of apple, like Eve’s apple, more apply than apple itself. Proto-apple, apple in Plato’s Form of apple. Flavor makes eyes roll to back of head from intense delight. Sweetness on the level of a Turkish baklava, unabashed, unrelenting, and unapologetic. Honey married to sweet crisp apples, like pink lady, and underlying currents of jam. After the diabetic coma comes a splash of acidity complements of Mother Apple that rescues the mouth from becoming bogged down but which tortures with its insistence on more (when there is none!).

Nose is rather underwhelming, it is heavy on the dark fruit and has hints of vanilla, smoke, honey, tobacco, some blackstrap molasses, and oak.  The taste follows the nose quite closely.  Lots of dark fruit, smoke, honey, brown sugar, and chocolate...definitely the highlight of the beer.  It is on the thicker side and coats the palate nicely with light carbonation.  Excellent imperial stout, I can definitely see why this gets the hype it has.  I was a little let down by the nose for this being a world class imperial stout.",4.3
728,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"A Mes rate: 
A Mes rate: 2006 bottle shared in the private gardens at Dorset Square in Baker Street with the legendarily generous HogTownHarry.
 After lusting after this beer for some time all of a sudden I have had it 6 or 7 times. Possibly the beer I have drunk the most of without rating. (with the exception of possibly the Cantillon Blåbær.) I wanted to give it the respect it deserved and rate it with a totally fresh palate and that I did on a Thursday afternoon that was to be the beginning of a top 50 fest of beer rating thanks to Harry. Anyway... the beer.
It’s black. Totally black. No light penetration what-so-ever. A slight but solid brown head. Certainly the darkest coloured head I have seen in a long time. It’s more akin to chocolate ice cream.
Aroma is superbly roasty and full of amazing hops too. Peaty whiskey, outlandish malt, dark, dark chocolate and some lovely sugar and smoky hints. So incredibly nosable. I was appraoching half way through my glass while Harry was still sniffing at his!
Flavourwise it is not quite on the level of the aroma but still utterly stunning. Once again, incredible hops are balanced perfectly with the most unreal malt I have tasted. Beautiful rich dark chocolate ice cream, hints of tartness, spice, boozy peaty whiskey notes, utterly gorgeous lip smacking vanilla, viscous, oily and huge alcohol but oh so bloody good. Finish is of biblical proportions and just doesn’t stop. The light sting of alcohol reminds you that this is really serious stuff. Palate. Oh... my... f**king... GOD. Honestly it is unsurpassed by all I have tried previously. Totally unexpected carbonation that is so very good. Fizzes and zings around the mouth and prepares your palate so very well for the following rich velvet cream. Impossible to explain. It’s just stunning.
On the way to tipsy after half a bottle. Totally incredible beer. Having had this along side the regular Stormaktsporter I have to say that in all honesty it is hard to pick the winner between the two. Both are stunning but when geeking out and writing numbers the Kaggen just edges it. Oh, another thing, it has the best sediment of any beer ever, I’m convinced of that. I once drained every last drop of the sludge of three bottles into a glass and filled it halfway with water. It was STILL gorgeous. I kid you not. Right, that’s it. I’m off for a wank. I mean... erm... oh sod it.",4.8

296,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Some kind of celebration punching my 4K rating at RateBeer. I’m not really that concerned with numbers but sometimes it could be fun to do something extra about millstones anyway. The truth is I’m such a lacy rater so barely 50 % of my notes end up here. The big advance of this is the fact that it’s quite easy to grab something interesting from my notes and make it my “celebration”. So what could be more appropriate than world greatest Imperial Stout. I’m lucky to have sampled this by several occasions, but this 2007 vintage where pulled out of my cellar late one evening after a great beer tasting session. Everyone had gone home and I just felt for splitting this bottle with my beer buddy Gunnfryd. The big question where if it still was able to kick balls after a set of other superb ales (lots of good memories from those days my buddies cared to bring fine beers at our beer evenings). Back to the beer. Pours pitch black with a small but nice, dense brown head. Body feels thick and heavy with a appropriate moderate level of carbonation. A sight for sore eyes. Strong aroma of everything dark, like dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate with leather, wood and smooth, refined alcohol. Flavor is sweet but in perfect balance with the bitterness and alcohol. Everything from the aroma is present in such a perfect and smooth combination.

The taste is sweet vanilla and chocolate cake. Strong charred woodland. Thick, rich toffee and burnt sugar. Bitter, slightly hot finish. Full body, though not smooth or supple.

Loads of tastes as well that include the dark bittersweet chocolate and leather. Sweet malts (maybe the honey?) up front with a lingering bitternes. Extremely well balanced. My only gripe (a very small one) is that I would love to have the mouthfeel a little bit heavier. I will say that it has a great velvety, creamy medium mouthfeel though.

Nose was pretty wonderful, some elegant bourbon, oak, plethora of dark fruits, roasted malts, almost smoky.  Sweet and amazingly complex flavors swirling around.  Sweet malts, sweet honey, dark fruits, some spicy oak and bourbon, smoky, roasted malts.  Really surprised at the smoke element in this.

A- Pours opaque black with a small half finger tall mocha colored head leaving little to no lacing down the glass.
S - Smells just like the regular version with a few extra things tossed in. Compared to the regular version this one has a bit more vanilla, charred oak, peat whiskey, and just the faintest sour note. Excellent stuff.
T - Just like the regular version the taste is a bit of a letdown from that amazing nose but with the addition of the cask maturation it has really helped to round things out. Hints of rich bakers chocolate, sweet vanilla and charred oak tannins, licorice, dark fruits, and a tiny bit of light soy sauce. Only the faintest hint of alcohol creeps in as it comes to room temperature. The finish is a mix of sweet dark roast and some dry wood tannins, lingering for a short period of time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth feel with a mix of sweetness and dryness lingering through the finish. Only the faintest hint of booze can be detected.
O - Damn, I really wish I had a few more of these. I don’t like to say that a specific beer is the best I have ever had, but if you asked me what is the best RIS I have had this would be near the top of my list.

512,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Review of 02-02-10
I drank this 2008 version 250 ml bottle into my Rochefort chalice.

The beer pours pitch black with a nice creamy dark tan head. Its very pretty and fluffy. The head rises about 2 fingers stays around a couple minutes and leaves a sopay head. The lacing is a little lighter than I would have hoped for. 

The aroma is medium in strength, pretty matly to start lots of sweet chocolate, some vanilla and light bourbon on the end. There is a tiny bit of oak. Overall, its pretty understated.

The taste is super smooth its sweet up front with sweet chocolate, in the middle it brings some depth with some nice oak/bourbon than as the beer finishes you get a little more oak and vanilla.

The feel is very nice, very viscous and a very lasting taste.

The drinkability is nice, can’t really taste any of the alcohol.

Review of 07-06-2010.
Re-tasted at the brewery
- 08 kaggen vs 08 stormaktsporter, the stormkatsporter was the better by everyone.
-05 kaggen(first year of Kaggen) vs 05 stormaktspoter, the kaggen won this around. 
- Tried the 09 kaggen directly from the barrel. Its on Wild Turkey, only going to be about 800 bottles, this one is going to be special. Unreal vanilla already presenting, aroma is one of the best ever, taste still getting there but this will be awesome.
-06 version that was not barrel aged put into a glass bottle and just sat for 3 years, awesome vanilla notes on the front, beer itself is almost syrup lots of acid, a little tough to drink but interesting
- 08 kaggen that is 4 parts kaggen and 1 part smoked beer. This is not a commercial beer, made by the brewery for him and his friends. This was the best of the lot, unreal balance and totally amazing. They need to make this, it would hit top 5 easily so balanced with tons of vanilla, smoke, wood, and coffee. AWESOME. 

Each version is totally different, the 08 that I reviewed and gave a 4.55 is widely considered in Sweden as the worst batch. The 05 was clearly better than the 08, the variants were unreal. Everything about this beer is awesome, good variations, good story, super rare, and even better people-owners at the brewery.",4.9
598,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(Bottled vintage 2006). Sampled to celebrate my 40th birthday. Courtesy of oh6gdx (who brought this bottle from GBBF 2007). 
Pitch black color, good dark brown color. Oak (oak barrels), tobacco, dark malts, vanilla, some licorice in the nose. Full-bodied. Main flavor is licorice, dark roasted malts, molasses, dark chocolate. Then nuances: oak, vanilla, honey in portwineish palate. Very very complex and highly drinkable. Kick of alcohol in the atfertaste. Long mix of roasted malts and vanilla in the aftertaste. Normal Stormaktsporter is one of my favourite beers and this even tops it.",4.5
522,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"What Hell was this beer?? Thank you so much Omhper for this Beer!!  I have no idea how to reward you after that! Very dark color, with an amazing beige head that keeps a thin layer until finish. Aroma is too much complex because change every minute. I let at a nice temperature, around 8 to 12ºc and the aroma changed.start with Roasted malt, chocolate, coffe, some vanilla and a little bit  bit of alcohol, but after some minutes I could feel some berry fruits as well.  Flavor is outstanding. You can feel each item of the aroma while you drink. Is good even the alcohol but I use to not like to feel alcohol in some kind of nice beers like that. Aftertaste is loooong and you can feel the mix of flavors. Like some bitter coffee and berry fruit that let a sweet sensation. That beer really surprised me. Now I’m felling some toffee at finish..

Thank you Bonus Beer Bob for the chance to try this incredibly rare beer.  While I’ve had it once before, this was the only time I’ve had more than a couple of sips, and enough to properly wrap my head around the beer.  Thanks dude.



Pours a thick, viscous, oily black.  Tan, creamy head.  Beautiful.

Chocolate, honey, creamy espresso in the smell.  Notes of brown sugar and vanilla.  Complex.  Wonderful.  Inviting.

Huge, rich, creamy chocolate, brown sugar, tobacco, dark fruits, oak all slowly unveil themselves in the taste.  Caramel and vanilla notes.  Honey carries through from the smell as well and provides a very nice, unique note in this beer.

Super rich, super creamy mouthfeel with virtually no alcohol heat.  Excellent.

Extremely drinkable.  



Every once in a while, a beer lives up to the hype.  This is one of those.  Incredibly complex, with layers of complexity that are slowly peeled back, sip after sip.  All this, and no noticeable flaws to dampen the enjoyment.  Awesome beer.  Keg for my home, please?  Ha, I wish.  So, in summary, this beer sucks.  Don’t seek it out.  Avoid at all costs.  /sarcasm.",4.8

353,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"#800 Rating. Denmark, Ulfborg tasting with J&C (in 2009). Thanks to the tremendous generosity of Jan and Charlotte I got to try this gem at the end of our tasting when we visit them for the first time. I can’t deny that I had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fullfill them. Did it ? Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful de molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wondeful deep brown head. The wonderful raosted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, soem distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel lie you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anythign but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ).
Added now (as the rating is from 2009). Having had this on many more occasions and in many vintages, my original rating hasn’t changed a bit. i wish I could drink this every day.",5.0
298,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2007 bottle, from trade with GTH. At last! One of the really big White Whales and a very appropriate selection for my 3000th entry here on Ratebeer - what a ride it has been! :-) Pours a tar black body with a medium light beige head. Nose is coffee, deep malty tones, leather, tar, honey, hints of wood, alcohol, licorice and vanilla. Very elegant and bourbon-like, despite not having touched any such barrels. Taste is burnt toast, licorice, coffee, leather, dark chocolate, dark malts, honey and hints of cellar must and alcohol. Medium body, soft carbonation. Very nicely balanced and well brewed, but times have certainly changed and while Kaggen might have been the top dog some years ago it’s no longer rare to encounter world-class imp stouts like this anymore. Regardless, this beer is still a beauty.

Pretty much the best thing I have ever drank.",4.8
733,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle from the Bieres Sans Frontieres at the GBBF, so another thanks to Andy for getting this rare drop to England. (I met a guy from Sweden while I was at the bar who said he lived 30 miles from Närke Kulturbryggeri, and apart from one bottle at a beer bar, BSF was the only place he’d seen Kaggen for sale.)

And after all the anticipation, a pour for me, a pour for Traci, and we begin: Brown-highlighted black, lovely rusty crema-like foam. Aroma begins with a bright dose of dried fruit: raisins, moves to dates, then figs. Now a touch of muscovado sugar, now vanilla, bananas, cardamom. Underlying all that, a building dark chocolate awareness that several sniffs in takes charge. Then eventually is replaces by rum cake. Deep sustained high-cocoa content chocolate flavor--someone playing a ""chocolate"" note on a grand piano and holding down the pedal. Even a minute after a sip the chocolate coats in sticky bitterness. Vanilla sweetness that is tentatively present from the beginning begins to grow, but the iodine bitterness keeps if from getting sticky. 

This is such an interesting beer to beer to be #1. It’s certainly a big beer, but it’s one of the most subtle, refined Imperial Stouts I’ve tasted. It doesn’t surprise me at all that this is a recipe grown out of years and years of homebrewing—it tastes like every flavor has been subtly tweaked to exactly how the brewers wish.",4.4
385,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle from 2008. Shared in Helsingborg @ Bishops Mollberg. 
Pours black with a small brown head that vanishes quite quick. Aroma is very pleasant, oak and dark chocolate hits immediately. Behind that some vanilla and coffee. As the beer gets warmer in the glass the aromas of sweet honey and dark dried fruits arise. The beer is full bodied and starts off quite sweet but finishes dry and unfortunately quite abrupt. Flavours of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and raisins shines through in the taste.  Bourbon cask aged beer is not always a favourite of mine but here it works all right. The taste is great and the balance of flavours is simply amazing. I definitely enjoyed drinking this beer I just wish I’d taken more notes. Though after all I’m not sure I’d pay for it again...",4.4

Alright, now to the ratings.  First the 2006 version.

Pours black with tan head.  Aroma is of roasted malts, honey, raisins and some rummy oak.  Way more dark fruits and alcohol than the 2005 version.  Taste is chocolate and raisins again, mixed ever so well.  Rather oily and slick mouthfeel.  Finish is somewhat boozy with more chocolate covered raisins.  Delightful stuff.  8/5/9/4/18

The rating I’m giving for this beer is for the 2005 bottle, because it was that freakin’ good.  Pours deep black with magically appearing tan head.  The aroma is heavenly; sweet chocolate, honey and the perfect amount of bourbon.  If someone could turn that into a candy, they’d strike it rich.  At first taste my thought was ""Liquid perfection.""  The maltiness is off the charts but in the best way possible.  Chocolate, caramel with light bourbon and vanilla touches make for a delightful experience.  Palate is oily, slick, and full.  Finish is predominantly chocolate and lingers almost forever.  If Rick James were still alive he’d say ""Kaggen’s a hell of a beer!""",5.0
756,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Alright, I had the chance to get a sample of that (2005)  in Copenhagen, then I tried the new 2007 version at Oliver twist a few weeks later and retried, some days after, the 2005 thanks to my very generous Göteborg hosts: Marsiblursi. First off, the regular Stormaktsporter is an excellent imperial stout and rather tough to beat in complexity. I don’t quite understand the purpose of setting it in a barrel. It is apparently a rather short journey that it takes (2,5months), yet the effect is considerable as bourbon is obvious in the nose, but the low duration has allowed the body to keep most of its thickness, silkiness and richness. 
 So what do I think about it? Well, first off, I prefered the 2005 version which is 1% lighter and more developped and rounded around the edges at this point. The 2007 is still a fair bit boozy. The 2005’s complexity is more obvious and the concentrated fruitiness from the regular comes across more naturally. Appearance-wise, they both wear a fair diminishing dark beige head. Totally opaque, oily body, pitch black. The 2007 actually left legs on the glass. Gentle alcohol flavours, rum-soaked grapes, heady nose with wild leather smokiness, mint, vanilla (strong), chocolate roastiness and hard to pick up single fruits. Complex nuances, age-worthy, silky full body with honeyed and brown sugar tones. Very creamy, smooth carbonation. it manages to feel quite vinous at the same time, full on truffles, earth mushrooms powderiness and growing date square undertones. You can eventually all kinds of little nuances, which is the sign of a great beer. Still, at the end, I’m not convinced I prefer the barrel version and remain unconvinced that the rarity does not make me try harder to pick out stuff. Certainly a fine experience though. I’ll just give both Stormakts the same score.. but it is a sipper and I’m less into those that I once was.",4.1

665,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Big thanks to Drewbeerme for sharing this hard to get and hard traveling beer.  It survived the trip from Denmark to the US but after being stopped at customs it was sent right back.  The owner of the beer was nice enough to send it back again but it didn’t make it back unharmed.  Some of the beer had leaked out of the bottle and also losing the carbonation and tasting a little oxidized.  I had a few extra points to the overall score just because of this but the intense flavors were still there even if there wasn’t a head or a larger/creamier/more carbonated body.  2006 Vintage.  Dark opaque black body with no carbonation, this beer looks literally as thick and creamy as motor oil.  Aroma is dark chocolate malt, some bourbon (very faint vanilla), very well balanced none the less, some toffee and dark fruit, enjoyable.  Flavor is soy sauce (most likely due to the oxidation) dark chocoate, coffee, subtle hops, once again subtle bourbon, the delcious flavor even outscores the soy.  Medium body and no carbonation.

It’s a little less robust than I was expecting. Palate is a bit oily, a bit thinner than I expected, but that doesn’t really detract. Really like this one.",3.8
299,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Traded a Blabaer 750ML 2011 for this tiny bottle. Enjoyed at 50 Degrees F and allowed to warm up slowly. This is a 2009 vintage at 9.5%. Full macho American pour into my large stemmed De Dolle Glass.



A - Pours oily, totally black out of the bottle into the glass. A 2 finger coffee colored head forms and fades over the course of 90 seconds to a thin ring and minor sea-foam consistent bubbles. The stickiness of the head is resilient as it swirls around in the glass. Pitch black, not oily but pretty damn black in the glass. 



S - Nose is interesting. I get almost a mix of espresso creamy latte with lactose and fresh roasted coffee mixed with the sweet booziness of rum barrels. There is a hint of vanilla beans and dark chocolate.



T - Interesting. This may be the most roasted beer I’ve ever had like a mix between roasted coffee and roasted oak over a fire. Not campfire smokiness but just very roasted. There’s a huge chocolate presence at the start, the middle is latte with vanilla added and the finish is this roast bomb with an almost astringent booziness like what you get after drinking cheap cough medicine. In the back of my throat I get a grain alcohol like taste like swallowing freezing cold vodka but the burn is always the same.



M - Velvety and sort of fudge like but you know the feeling you’re left with after eating chocolate covered espresso beans? that’s pretty much what this feels like but in liquid form.



O - I’m overall pretty disappointed in this beer. Tickers GOTTA tick but I really don’t feel that this is worth either the hype or the trade bait. There’s too much roasted notes, way too boozy for a 9.5% beer and the astringency never goes away.

592,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"25 cl bottle, 2006.  Huge thanks to Yngvar for this my 1000th rating!  and 100th Imperial Stout.  Dark brown with some tan froth around the edges.  Nose is molasses, licorice, cocoa and espresso.  Medium body with a light tingle.  Taste is dark roast, prunes, oak and bourbon.  Smooth dry finish with lingering chocolate.  Rich and complex but not overdone.",4.1
661,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006 vintage  Huge, dense, very dark-greige head over jet-black beer. Some shards of lace despite all alcohol. Superb winey, vinous nose, with nuts, cocos, moccha, cacao, whisky, rum, dark fruit, fuselalcohols, fresh vanilla and new oak barrels. Impressive. Chocolate flavourS - mix of milkchocolate and full black; rum, but a better kind than I’ve ever tasted; surprisingly sweet, with a vanilla icecream touch, plus a good dot of moccha  icecream.  Dark rock candi sugar, very little wood, but lots of ethanol & higher alcohols. Liquid black chocolate on rumliqueur. WITH raisins drenched in honey. Utterly viscous, slick as none, soothing best bar none. 


Comparing this to Westvleteren is utter nonsense. I never believed in the idea ""dessert beer"" - until now. Westvleteren is (superb) beer, full stop.
 Thomas D, eternal gratitude!",4.4
758,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle @ Copenhagen Øl Festival.  [To celebrate my #1000 rating. Huge thanks to omhper and the guys from Närke for sharing this one with us]  The buzz was that the Närke guys where at the festival. At some point they slipped Per one bottle and he was so kind to share the bottle with the people around the RateBeer table. There was way to much noise around the table, so I found myself a secluded spot where I could enjoy the quirt moment of complete satisfaction with the Kaggen in my glass. Small brown creamy head that mostly diminished. Light lacing could be observed in glass. Motor oil black color. Huge round berries feel in nose was the first impression. The came an assortment of notes with liquorish, light sweet coffee and chocolate, overwhelming port wine, wood and oak notes with lingering vanilla. Some cola and soy sauce like notes could also be detected. You feel the warmth of alcohol but no evidence of alcohol over the palate. Full bodied with a smooth texture. Flavor was so balanced with moderated sweet dry fruit and light bitter flavor with a hint of salty notes as well. Lingering liquorish, berries and port wine finish. There is a reason why this is considered one of the best beers in the world.",4.8

662,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"2006. Been waiting for a while for this one. Dark milk and bitter chocolate, toasted vanilla initially on  the nose. Creamy peanut butter. A big alcohol presence that kind of distracts a bit. Pours nearly black as night with a thick dark khaki head leaving spotty lacing and a nice yellow film after a gentle swirl. Roasted malt and toasted marshmallow on  the tongue initially.Bitter chocolate. Some dried vanilla, a touch of soy, peanut butter and an underlying fusel alcohol note that distracts from the overall essence of the beer. Viscous and chewy mouthfeel.  An excellent example of the style... if only I could get beyond that fusel alcohol... Thanks so very much  for this awesomely rare treat Brad!",4.1

Fairly sweet, malty, quite roasty, slightly fruity taste of praline, honey, bourbon, vanilla, caramel and milk coffee, followed by a medium long, gently roasty-bitter, minimally boozy finish. Medium to full body, silky smooth and gently effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. A delicious treat, the honey seems to be the ingredient that makes the difference. There's a lot of stuff which is at least as outspoken or aromatic, but the balance is simply incredibly. Lovely beer!",4.3

552,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"With picnic tables full of incredible beer, Craig stand up from the table and exclaims, ""you’ll want to follow me"".  I agreed, and without hesitation we were off.  The bottle wasn’t half way out of the bag and I could not believe my eyes.  The pour was black and sticks to the glass.  A small tan head was visible, but I am interested in how this smells and tastes.  The aroma was worth the wait: chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, coffee, molasses, and licorice.  Can the flavor back up the nose?  Yes, Kaggen was an awesome complex brew that lived up to the hype.  Dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, coffee, molasses, dark fruits, subtle wood hints, licorice, and well integrated alcohol.  Full bodied, chewy, and smooth.  

Thanks to Craig (cgarvieuk) for sharing this incredible beer.",4.7

One of the best imperial stouts out there.",4.8
336,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Bottle 2008 version, 0.3 taste 2007 version @ Närke Kulturbryggeri (Örebro, Sweden). *Hearty-rate*: the perfection in form of imperial stout. Drink it, period. *Rational-rate*: every time I have Kaggen! Stormaktsporter I never feel used to such a masterpiece. As I said to everyone: had many of the BIG IRS whales, like Black Tuesday, Darkness, Darklord, The Abyss, Eclipse, Dark Horizon, ecc., ecc., but this one tower above all. The reasons? Color is intense black, with a brown head like moka. But complexity starts from the aroma: you could never get enough of smelling, you touch something different every time. And difficult, extremely difficult to hive off single components. It’s burned sugar, molasses, apricot, oak, vanilla, plum, cherries, chocolate, coffee, syrup, spice, herbs. Bond between all that stuff is almost indivisible, even more in taste, it comes out an holistic property. Difficult to explain. But fact is, and could seem a paradox, separately from complexity, Kaggen! isn’t difficult to have, even though 25 cl is the best format, because hits directly the bull’s eye of senses without hesitation. You don’t need to be an experienced taster for appreciation and understand you’re facing something SO BIG. Moreover, it’s pointless making long analysis and list all flavors, since the best side it’s just the wholeness of such a full body; warms mouth and palate, in a great alternation between sweetness and bitterness (more the first) and the PERFECT balance of malts and hops. Herbaceous character, given by heather honey, isn’t invasive and oak aging as well. It’s ambrosia, no way. Breweries like Närke aren’t just their hype-geek productions, try other ones (cAmarillo, Örebro Bitter, and so on) and you’ll catch how they great could be as artisans. Long live HG and Berith.",5.0

739,Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"I have to keep my benefactor under wraps, per their request, but suffice to say it’s a them and I thank them profusely and promise to show my thanks very soon. This bottle is a 2006 vintage. 

The aroma is beef bouillon, soy, dark chocolate, burnt and roasted malts and marshmallows with faint porto notes. The beer pours a gloppy black and settles with a thinnish mocha head, but initially the head is finger thickness and creamy looking. 

The first sip is fairly boozy and the barrel aging is immediate and unmistakeable imparting vanilla, pineapple and coconut notes. I also get some nutty Maderia notes and gobs of dark chocolate. Fairly hot on the swallow with a cream and chocolate chaser. It almost tastes like a dark chocolate liqueur. The finish makes me think of a vanilla liqueur with faint nutty and chocolate notes that invoke german chocolate cake. A very enjoyable beer that is definitely not a product of hype or hysteria. Now, if they could brew this en masse for a larger market I would be truly amazed....and an exceedingly loyal buyer.",4.4

13831,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,This stuff smells great but is ultimately a one trick pony. It smells and tastes like Mexican hot chocolate with a shot of whiskey in it. It is black w/ only a small head of brown foam. I get a bunch of cinnamon and vanilla and all kinds of good stuff in the nose and can say it smells legitimately delicious but tasting it is when it sort of goes awry. It is heavy and sweet and the spices and booze overwhelm any real malt character. It has very little carbonation which increases the ponderous heavy feeling of it and overall it feels more like some sort of spicy version of Kahlua than a good beer to me.,2.9
13720,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Perennial's most highly acclaimed product, a rye whisky barrel aged edition of the classic Abraxas - finally able to taste this quite famous beer at BCBF (and I was not the only one interested, considering the long queue of beer geeks lining up when this one was opened...). Thin, moussy, deep brownish-tinged bead head, opening middle but stable in the form of a ring, over a black beer with deep bronze-ish brown edges. Overwhelming, incredibly rich bouquet of Christmas cake, gingerbread including a lot of soft spicy cinnamon, hot chocolate sauce and chocolate liqueur, nutmeg, vanilla-ish bourbon and oak, fudge, brownies, rum, liquorice, fresh cloves, juniper leaves, 'kruidenkoeken' en 'pepernoten' galore. Sweet onset, brown sugariness thickly coating hints of dates and raisins, noble and very concentrated, soft carbo, very thick and greasy mouthfeel. Profoundly deep 'chocolateness' and toffeeish malt goodness ensues, deeply and elegantly nutty, like a mixture of liquid chocolate bars and liquid gingerbread. This huge and decadently delicious pile of malts is brightened by soft woody tannins, vanilla-ish oak and bourbon colours, all on top of the familiar sweet and almost 'Christmassy' ethereal cinnamon and vanilla bean flavours. The chili heat, like in the regular version, accentuates a warming, obviously very bourbon-like alcohol effect without becoming too obtrusive. This is a majestic, caleidoscopic, awe-inspiring masterpiece of a stout - I had already fallen in love with the regular one, but this one is even better, and exceeds my highest expectations. One of the very best stouts I ever had the honour to taste, regardless of hype; I do not see how any stout can get any better than this so after a moment of doubt and comparing it with other top class stouts I had so far, I have no other choice but to give this perfect beauty a near perfect score...",4.9

13743,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Pitch black and completely opaque without even a trace of lighter color. Half finger dark mocha head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Minimal spotty lacing left behind. Nice color but has poor retention. Foam head fades and there’s not much in the way of lacing. 

The nose on this beer is really incredible. Excellent barrel character that doesn’t completely overpower the complex malt bill of the base. Perfectly integrated. A touch of damp oak and subtle toothpick but not too strong of a wood flavor. Really nice spirit with spicy whiskey/boozy bourbon flavor. Barrel also gives off a lot of vanilla bean, toasted coconut and gooey marshmallow. Underneath, there is a very nice blend of roasted and sweet, desert-like malts. Subtle roast but not overpowering with some coffee bean, burnt toast, smoke, oatmeal and bitter dark chocolate. This is countered by silky chocolate-like sweetness, caramel, milk chocolate, lactic cream, fudge and molasses. This beer smells crazy good. 

Full body with oily viscosity and a blast of boozy heat that lingers over the other barrel notes and complex malts into a dry, hot finish. Lots of alcohol flavor and the ABV isnt very well masked. spicy rye whiskey along with dry oak/toothpick. Barrel isn’t as complex as in the nose. Spirit is really strong and it has a stronger wood flavor than I prefer. Some subtle vanilla/coconut sweetness. Malts flavors are still lingering underneath but they are blasted and overwhelmed by the heat/whiskey. Stronger roasted malt presence than expected with burnt sugary sweetness. Deeply roasted robust espresso/coffee flavor along with smoke, burnt wood, charred toast and bitter dark cocoa. As the palate adjusts the sweet fudge/baker’s chocolate notes start to show. Pretty good but isn’t as complex as expected. The chile spiciness and cinnamon show up after it warms but the palate needs to adjust to the overwhelming whiskey and heat. Smells great but it’s really hot and boozy and the malt bill is overly charred/roasted. Decent but kind of underwhelming considering the fanfare.",4.1

Appears pitch black, little to no head, what little there is has a tan color.

Intégration parfaite de la vanille et des éléments épicés. Parfums pralinés. Pâte de noix sucrées. Notes de tabac à pipe. Coco grillée. Friandise chocolatée. Complexe et décadent. Au goût, une explosion de caramel poivré, de cacao noir, de noix de coco, de beurre d’arachides, de brioche à la cannelle, de tabac, de whiskey épicé et de malts rôtis. Opulent, généreux, luxueux, satisfaisant. En bouche, le corps qui est lourd ne sature jamais mon palais. La texture est riche, liquoreuse, si plaisante et différente de ce que j’ai pu voir dans la version dite «normale».

13750,Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,From a shared bomber in a snifter at Binny’s tasting room. Intense chocolate aroma. Flavor is intensely spicy with cinnamon dominating the palate. finish is clean but slightly astringent. Not a drainpour obviously but I don’t understand the hype.

Deep-tan colored, leathery foam rests on top for only a few moments before turning to a collar. Aroma... Wow. Warm cinnamon Teddy Graham crackers, sweet vanilla cake, snickerdoodle cookies, brown sugar, light fudge drizzle, & a mild sense of bourbon soaked wood chips hanging around just outside the periphery... So smooth, so complex & unique. Taste gives way to some dry coffee beans but you’re quickly launched into a world of cinnamon graham crackers, lightly tannic barrel presence, bourbon infused dark chocolate, robust vanilla, & some burnt brown sugar in the finish.

The nose is really quite amazing with tons of cinnamon, coconut, dark chocolate, coffee, sweeter milk chocolate, and just a touch of chili pepper burn on the nostrils. The flavor is more focused on the bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and cinnamon, with all of the coconut and vanilla oak notes underlying, and some chili pepper heat starting to peak through on the back of the palate. The body is full with just a bit more carbonation than I like on a beer this big, and a long bitter dark chocolate, coffee, light vanilla, and chili pepper heat finish.",4.3

Body brings out immediate silky melted dark chocolate, powerful bourbon but no white alcohol or tomato paste. The back end gives tremendous chili heat, cinnamon, dessert spices, bourbon warming. Heating, face flushing back end. Rich, well integrated. This is essentially a redux of Cigar City Hunahpu without the lemon acid and thin tea body. Very delicious and worth the hype.

Aroma is lots of hops and citrus, very tropical fruit Aroma, pineapple, mango, orange peach, biscuit malt. Flavor is hop forward, but with a brilliantly balanced honey malt backbone. Long bitter finish. Full bodied. What else can you say? It’s Pliny the Younger. One of the best IPAs out there.",4.4
7803,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Poured a half inch of white foam atop a translucent sunburst amber body: lighter to dark, bottom to top. Redolent of pine, bubblegum, mandarin orange, grapefruit, leafy hops, sweet honey, caramel, maple, and vanilla. Flavor was pale malt, some caramel, slightly mellifluous, then predominantly piney acidogenic hops, citrus, cantaloupe and grapefruit, then alcohol. Palate was very warming with a bitter resinous lingering aftertaste. Not quite as balanced at the Elder but still excellent. The flavor is just ridiculously unlike anything else I’ve had until now.",4.3
7864,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draft. Finally got my hand on this mother hopper at Downtown Johnny Browns after a few failed attempts elsewhere. Poured a glowing clear gold with a decent pure white head that provided some okay lacing. Nose was pure fresh hop, emphasis on grapefruit zest, and some pine too. Flavors were intensely hopped. Same emphasis and a very pronounced in your face grapefruit zest. Good hop resin character too. Alcohol was very present in the flavor. Nice spicy tone because of the bitterness. Floral tones come in further down the beer, and hints of sweet fruit. Mouth is full of bitterness. Bitterness hits where there are no bitter receptors. Still very smooth and an easy drink. Watch out this one will knock you over. Great intense DIPA, if it had any more hops in it you would have to chew it.  Falls a  tiny smidgen short of the immense hype but still fully deserving of all its accolades.",4.4
7315,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"2020 batch Tap at Tustin brewing. Pours light gold, little head. Honey, resin aroma. Taste is similar, very smooth, piney hops and caramel malt. Big finish of resiny hops. Dope. And the booze is not apparent. Classy triple ipa. 4.3

2023 batch Tap at Tustin Brewing. Pours very pale yella almost no head. Big earthy yeasty aroma. Natural amd yet something like what you get when you wak into an old world market: freshly picked root veggies, fruits and smoked meats. It's a west coast barley wine goddamnit! Soft, light body, subtle and explosive at the same time. The abv is insanely deceptive.",4.3
7993,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draft at the Bistro’s Double IPA Fest and again today at the brewpub (last barrel of this batch accoring to Vinnie) Nose of floral hops with a little pine and citrus; Hazy light copper withsmall straw colored head; Medium hop bitterness in the flavor with some background malts. I liked it! 8/4/9/5/17 4.3
Rerate 2/17/08 Nose is hoppy as hell and smells of ivy and a little pine; hazy amber with a medium off-white head; flavor is medium bitterness with lots of pine and ivy. 9/4/9/4/18 4.4",4.4
7829,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On draft at Brouwer’s. Pours a hazy bright orange with very little head. Smells like a hop flower was picked and crushed under my nose. Some malty sweetness - just enough to counter - but this brew is absolutely all about the hops. Mandarin and grapefruit notes dominate. Mouthfeel is thick, nearly syrupy - coats your mouth beautifully and leaves you salivating. Good God this is hoppy. Bitter aftertaste as the sweetness fades, but all around, this is an absolutely delicious brew.",4.5
8028,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Much thanks to hopdog for this hand filled bottle...don’t know if/when I would ever see it on draft around here.
Appears a light gold with a small off-white head that slowly fades out. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of bready, biscuits, citrus, rich resinous hoppy pine, and vanilla. Much like The Elder.
Taste is of the same and very delicious with a touch of caramel standing out.
Mouthfeel is slightly sugary and mildly piney, woody, and candy.
Drinkability is decent with some ABV that’s noticable.",4.3
7928,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draft at brewpub: Slightly hazy orange, good lacing and retention. Aroma is basically a bigger version of the Elder... huge PNW grapefruit/citrus notes. Medium to heavy body, big big bitterness, some alcohol. Monster flavors with finesse, but lacks the complexity of Dreadnaught.",4.2
7437,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Choice City Butcher. Appearance: finger of white head that lasts a minute or so, straw/golden yellow, clear. Aroma: light fruity sweetness, heavy fresh floral hops, lighter citrusy hops, slightest yeasty leather notes. Palate: light body, sticky texture, average carbonation, dry bitter lasting finish. I can still taste it. Taste: very brief but intense sweetness, right into extreme, but not over the top bitterness. Overall, there is a great reason for the rating of this beer, it is amazing. It is supremely hoppy, but not palate destroying, it does all of the little subtleties right.",4.4
7836,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Draft at Toronado. Very nice gold/orange color. Wonderful hop and fruit combo swirling in this baby with a little bong hit resin thrown in for good measure.,4.2

Taste was very balenced for a triple IPA Cittus was prodominent witha nice malt backbone and a great dry finish!  
Overall this was a wonderfull experience!",4.5
7658,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Wonderful. It’s chock full of hop flavor. I’ve had a number of DIPAs, and this beer expresses hop flavor better than any beer that I’ve ever tasted. Hops are the star in the flavor department. They are citric, piny and very floral. The citrus is grapefruit, orange and tangerine mixed with pineapple. The pine is dark and resiny, like sap. There is a strong malt backbone that allows this much hop flavor to come through. Is this beer balanced? I would say so, but the malt does not express the same complexity and assertiveness of the hops. That is not to say the malt isn’t strong or is bad. The malt is actually wonderful. It’s like a caramel cookie swirled into a fine hop tea.  The color is very close to Elder and Blind Pig, which is to say golden-amber and wonderful. The aroma is very hoppy, with the flavors as previously described. The feel is also exceptional, almost oily with hop essence.",4.8

8004,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Toronado. I had this a few months ago, and just found my notes. Seems to be hopped a lot more than the Elder, but it has a big crisp citrus flavor. This brew is more balanced than one would expect, given the hop content.",3.8
8051,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Sampled at Lupulin Slam III, 2006. Pours clear copper with an off-white head. Amazing hop orgy aroma, like mainlining pine and grapefruit. Flavor of intense pine, grapefruit, orange, sweet pale malt, caramel and citrus. Bold and massive tasting with a slight tinge of alcohol that doesn’t detract. Very full, round and creamy with moderate carbonation. Just amazing stuff.",4.5
7365,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler at Peg’s Cycle BA Day, thanks to Sean who won the growler at a charity auction. Pours a clear gold with medium frothy white head that lasts.

7998,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Toronado.  Slightly hazy orange color, looks unassuming.  Not a very strong aroma, citrus hopes.  When cold tastes just like the Elder -- lots and lots and lots of hops,  as it warms becomes more oily and creamy.  How do they cram 11% into this?",4.5
8114,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Bit hazy, gold-copper.  Hoppy, citric, and herbal sweet nose.  Flavor quite sweet, then dry and bitter.  Similar to 120 minute IPA, trying to make a bigger IIPA has just made another really, really sweet beer.",3.5
7289,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at Isaac Newton’s in Newtown, PA. 10.2% ABV. Finally, at long last, I have landed this legendary brew! Bright, honey gold pour. Brief white head reduces to a small ring. Fragrant, bold citrus aroma is redolent of tangerine, lime, grapefruit and apricot. Big and boozy, as expected. Clean and crisp throughout. Black pepper notes on the backend. Slightly sticky palate in the long, bitter finish. Amazing!",4.3
7330,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Maybe it's that I've sampled a few different TIPAs of varying quality over the past few weeks, maybe it's that I've been sitting in my basement in southeast Tennessee sipping Younger and feeling extra special, but goddamn if this beer isn't the platonic ideal of what a massive, gargantuan India Pale Ale should be. Enormous amounts of citrus on the nose, yet the fruit only forms part of the taste, instead allowing plenty of room for deep, herbaceous pine and hints of berry and resin, with a modest but sturdy malt backbone and clingy bitterness on the finish. Amazing. Balanced, full, and gentle despite the whopping ABV. So friggin' good.",4.7
7776,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Amber orange, with a fluffy white head.  Heavy, beautiful hop aroma.  Bitter flavor.  A bit of sweetness and alcohol.  Yes, this is very hoppy - there’s a little bit of citrus, more noticeable floral and pine elements - but the bitterness overwhelms.  Full and heavy - very slow drinking.  Tasty, interesting, and well worth a try...but not quite the delicious masterpiece achieved with the Elder.",3.9
7774,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Sampler tray at Naja’s Place. Clear light amber with a small head. Intense grapefruity hop aroma. Hopping gone mad- this is as bitter as it gets. Citrussy hops make it just a pleasure. Full body, a bit oily. This beer is one big worship to the US West Coast hops. Do not expect a balanced approach.",3.9
7445,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap at the Brewpub. (Monday 10, February 2014)

Golden with a small white head. The aroma was fantastic, fresh with a lot of citrus, pineapple and hops. The taste was also very good although not as brilliant as the aroma. Very balanced with no alcohol at all, the Younger felt like juice. The finish was bitter and hoppy. 

We waited in the line for almost 6,5 hours, quite insane to be honest but what can you do? For sure an interesting experience, but I won’t do it again. A hyped beer but also a very tasty one.",4.5
7704,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler shared by jerz at Woodshop 5.0. Pours a clear gold with an orange tinge and a creamy dense white head. Aroma is hugely pineappley/grapefruity with vanilla and a piney herbal character. Flavor is very herbal and bitter, lots of resins for sure. Sweetness comes through only in an orange/lychee hoppiness. Malt? What malt? We don’t need no stinkin malt. Even if there was a pound of peated malt in this I wouldn’t be able to taste it through the absurd hop whirlwind. I think I used the word ""whirlwind"" in my PTE review too now that I think about it. Whatever, this beer pulverizes. I’ll rerate next year off a proper pint.",4.8
8037,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"6th annual Bistro IIPA fest. Dry hop bitterness. Slightly hazy amber with a small, off-white ring. Excellent lace. Very high in alcohol; very piney bitter. Too alcoholic. Almost tastes like cough syrup. Reminiscent of DFH 120 which has double the ABV. Good balance despite the alcohol load and pretty good amount of sweetness.",3.8
7637,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Updating for February 2011 release: This year’s release is better balanced. I don’t feel that the sweetness is too overpowering. It’s almost like a very hoppy golden barleywine. Delicious, resiny, hoppy, sort of a honey taste, a hint of minerals. Bit of alcohol burn. Heavy sweetness, but less so than last year and relatively balanced with the bitterness. Surprisingly drinkable. Much more drinkable than last year.
Tap at RR on release date in 2010: Awesome, but a bit overrated. A bit unbalanced with too much sweetness. Tons of hops, of course.",4.8
7662,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler courtesy of ygtbsm94. Wow! Thought I would have to sell my soul at some point to have some of this. Pours a clear orange with a thick, enormous yellow head. Great retention and lace. Aroma is fresh citrus hops, pineapple, papaya, raw Simcoe whole cones. Taste is very bitter, lots of past-their-prime tropical hops, orange juice, orange peel. The 130 IBUs or whatever makes the 11% undetectable. Overall this is insanely bitter rather than fresh and fruity. I’m sure that this is not in it’s ultra freshest state and that it would be a knock-out on tap. But it is a little ridiculous that some of these top IPAs and DIPAs have a half-life of 48 hours and then fall apart. 4/5/2010 9/4/7/4/14=3.8

Tap at Russian River for PtY 2011. The pour is a clear, deep orange with a small, white head that leaves some big sheety lace. The aroma on PtY is a little hard to get at served in the miniature English pint glass. But once it warms up a bit you get some serious jackfruit, bitter mango, candied oranges, fresh orange. Taste is fresh mango hoppy like biting into a raw mango. Lots of bitter mango skin and juicy mango pulp. Dank, fruity tropicals abound but the seriously dense body here is hard to get through. Some quick, spicy alcohol is present but a non sequitor. Obviously the king of DIPAs, but that doesn’t mean it has to be my favorite. 2/5/2011 9/4/8/4/16=4.1 

Tap at PtY 2012. Served in a miniature nonic pint glass, it pours a sparkling, clear brilliant orange pour with minuscule white foam. Minimal lace. Nose is hydroponic marijuana with tangerine and Asian fruits: rambutan, jackfruit, lychee. Taste has some alcohol, minimal ""bitterness"", tangy tangerine and sweet rambutan. Decently chewing with fresh, underripe mango flesh. Yummy. Not special enough to warrant a giant line for two weeks. But it’s worth it for the sour anthology tap takeover. :) Where’s the Compunction this year???????!!!!!!",4.1
7975,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap @ Najas and then again @ Hollingshead Deli.  Pours a clear honey golden with a staying creamy one finger offwhite head, eventually leaving a creamy film of good lacing.  HUGE aroma of juicy tangerines, mango, pineapple, light toffee and biscuity malts.  Wow.  Taste has huge bitterness throughout with fruity hops, light pine and pineapple sweetness, but just for a moment.  Incredible fruitiness from the hops.  Bitterness was about a 9 on the 1-10 scale.  Dry finish.  The ETOH is masked very well except for a slight warming in the back of the throat.  Moderate carbonation with a creamy full body.  This is better than the Elder and I don’t know how this beer could get any better.  Unbelievable.",4.7
7835,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Small sample bottle that arrived from Craig. Cheers Craig consumed 21-02-09   Pours light amber maybe warm gold difficult to be exact in this poor light with a decent white frothy head.

Smells hoppy sweet, not overwhelming, grassy though. Tastes smooth and sweet hoppy, well balanced and grassy. The best part is the aftertaste. I can actually picture the hops as I taste them, stems and sticks and bodies. Full bodied, syrupy, with subdued carbonation. Earth shattering? No. Good? Yes.",4.2
7441,Russian River Pliny the Younger,On tap at back country taproom. Pours a beautiful golden hue. Aroma is slightly hoppy with sweetness. Taste is sweet hops with more hops underneath. Despite that the beer is easy more sweet then hoppy. A great beer,4.3
7808,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Got a growler courtesy of a friend. Beautiful aroma strongly of pine hits you immediately upon opening. Beer is very bitter, but still with a wonderful flavor. Finishes very dry, but the 11% alcohol isn’t perceived nearly as much as you might think. A great beer, but beware, it sneaks up on you.",4.6
8030,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Thanks to hopdog for sharing this hand bottled.  Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a medium bubbly white head.

8069,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"This is a beer for the easily-impressed.




First rating, 2005: Very rich and robust musty and leafy hop nose... spectacular aroma full of sweet oranges and spices, wafting back into a musty, earthy hop cone scent.  I could swim in this aroma.  Starchy and dry palate presents orange and pineapples, mildly sour - intensely dry but remaining smooth.  Incredible.




Rerate 2009: Super rich and fruity sweet hop oil nose. Sugared, crystalline. Hugely thick, syrupy and sugary, decent attempt at balance with a some striking bitter hops, but the finish
is ridiculously and terribly oversweet.",3.5

7972,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Hand bottled sample from Richard (Irishboy) Thanks a ton for this one!  Now this is a double IPA, a seriously good, drinkable double IPA.  Pours out a bright orange color with a little white head on it.  Smell is a huge smack in the face from the grapefruit smelling hops.  Pine, grass, no alcohol noted at all, perfect smell for a double IPA.  Taste is smooth and dangerous to drink because of the 11% abv.  Bitter and inviting taste, plenty of citrus and pine tasting with some huge grapefruit notes.  This is like hopslam on steriods.  Vinnie has now proven to me that he can make more than just belgian style beers.  This is an unbelievable IPA and if anything rivals Dreadnaught, it would be this beer.",4.7

Malt is absent and hops are slightly sharp.  Mouthfeel is very delicate and light, perhaps a bit oily from the hops.  Mild carbonation.  Great DIPA.  Resinous hops throughout the taste.  Perhaps a bit of harsh bitterness compared to past years.  Alcohol noticeable on finish after about half of the glass.",4.0
8079,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Shared from a growler courtesy of goldtwins: Pours a clear, deep, rich golden bronze with a thick, frothy, well-lacing white head.  Aroma is loaded with tons of citrus and piney hops and decent sugary malty balance.  Starts with a mild sticky malty sweetness and tons of bittering hops.  Lots of citrusy piney hop flavor and a sticky, bittersweet, warming finish.  This seems like it’s too young and needs more balance.  This reminds me a lot of Founders Devil Dancer.

Color is a hazy, glowing orange, white head, aroma of floral hops, pine, citrus (more citrus in the nose than elder). Taste is similar to smell, full of grapefruit, pine, slightly sweeter than elder, but maybe a bit more in bitterness up front. The 11% is very well hidden, and the brew is balanced to perfection.

Flavor is also saturated with citrus hops; grapefruit, orange, and floral notes.  The malt backbone balances everything out and makes this incredible drinkable 11%.

7560,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Poured from a draft into what appeared to be about a 10-oz. skinny glass at San Diego Brewing Co. in San Diego, Calif., on Feb. 14. Not sure the name of it. Color was honey caramel with a nice gray lacing that stayed for about five minutes. Just a tad bit of film on the sides, which was a bit surprising. 

Just a fantastic balance of hops on the initial smell. Smelled citrus pine hops and sweet floral notes as well. Also some grapefruit.

Tasted even better than the nose. Obviously citrus hops, but so damn smooth and balanced. Like the nose, the balance was citrus pine hops and sweet floral notes. For how strong it was, the alcohol never came through like so.

Medium body. Not sure the texture, but definitely good. Average carbonation. Long smooth finish.

You’ll see us in any number of regional news sources, representing beer nerds from around the world who came just for this special beer or something like that. Pliny the Younger pours a somewhat cloudy orange-hued gold with a small eggshell colored head that laces the glass and settles into an island and ring. Notes of pine, grapefruit, caramel, florals, grass - the flavor has a more resinous, oily hop character and along with the ABV level, it just barely numbs the back of the tongue. Medium-full bodied, with a bitter, resinous, but balanced mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Excellent. Right on par with Pliny the Elder.

7888,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"sampled a few different times, most recently on tap at Hamilton’s Tavern, south park San Diego. pours a nice hazy yellow with  whitish head.  super strong piney hop aroma with some citrus too. flavor is hugely hoppy wti floral coming through as well as pine and citrus nots. finsish dry ad bitter, but leaving you wanting more. yum",4.3
7392,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Cross this one off the fermentation bucket list. Clear deep amber pour with a nice white head. Lots of lacing. Citrus pine tropical hoppy nose. Intense hops in the taste. The intensity works, without being overdone. Lots of bitterness in the finish with just a hint of alcohol. This is truly is a special hop experience. I could not have more than one of these, unlike Elder or Blind Pig. It’s a bad ass hoppy and bitter dry barleywine.",4.4
7383,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Originally reviewed on 3/14/15. A beer I thought I’d never get to try. 64 oz. growler poured into a snifter. Clear orange body with a small white head. A few wisps on the surface and a thin collar. Orange. Some pine hops. Lots of caramel malt, but doesn’t smell all that sugary. Tastes like an amped up Pliny. Orange hops up front. Sweet pale malts. A touch of booze. Pine hops build in the back end with a moderate bitterness.
Medium heavy. Not a sugar bomb, which I was afraid of. Medium carbonation. Glad I got to try it. It’s very good. I’d take a lot of things over it, especially if it avoids a trip to CA to get a taste.",4.3
7954,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler from Capone’s.  Golden-amber with a small head.  Aroma is a pleasant and overwhelming bouquet of HOPS!!!  - Heavy & Bitter citrus, strong flowery-pine.  Extremely sticky hop flavor in addition to some sweet citrus and malt flavors, plus just a bit of alcohol.  Overwhelmingly hop heavy and wonderful.  The Elder is a very nice DIPA - but as a hophead, this one goes a step further.........Well done!",4.8
7455,Russian River Pliny the Younger,Believe the hype. I have not had a better IPA. Hoppy and ridiculously smooth. Strong grassy and pine flavors. Everything in your typical IPA but more. Worth the hour drive and four hour wait.,4.5
7735,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Snifter - thanks Junko & Sean! The hype and rarity of PtY makes it hard to stay objective in a review.  Really mild but deep citrus & flowers aroma only comes out with a generous swirl. Modest white head keeps going to the last drop, With lacing a plenty. Flavor is light malts and stealth hops intensity. Spicy, almost pilsner style lightness on the tongue. Finish is dry in the extreme. Then the bitterness hits you and lasts indefinitely.",4.7
7453,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Tap at toronado..Pour is golden with a thin white head..Nose is nice juicy hop, pine, floral, some sweetness, bitter..Taste is bitter, pine, dry, resin hops, some malt backbone, heavy pine sol..Not as good as some triple ipas I have had..Hyped up",4.0
7816,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"On tap.  Poured a clear amber-orange color with a 3/4 inch off-white head that faded to a layer.  Aroma wasn’t as powerful as I imagined it would be, but once it made it to my sniffer there was some leafy hops, a bit of bright citrus (orange, tangerine, a bit of grapefruit), and some moderately resinous pine.  Moderately sweet, crispy entry with some light caramel and a bit of citrus fruit (orange and tangerine mostly) leads into a moderately leafy, bitter hoppiness with some pine and an over-powering astrigency that lingers after the finishes with a light undertone of caramel.  Solid mouthfeel and decent bitterness, but the astringency again detracts for the palate.  It’s a decent IIPA, but it could have used a bit more bright fruit to offset the astringency, which really muddles the flavor.",3.3
7479,Russian River Pliny the Younger,This is an excellent IPA. On tap from coastal Oregon (Twist). Rich clear orange color with sticky frothy white head. Moderate carbonation. Flavor is of somewhat piney and citrusy hops with elements of orange. Bitterness well controlled and balanced. Smell is of sweet corn cereal with hops. 9.8 BD,4.4

7528,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Tap into a goblet
This beer has an intense grapefruity aroma. It pours a clear orangey yellow with a small head and great lacing. It's so smooth, much more than I was suspecting. The hoppy bitterness starts strong and lasts and lasts. An amazing IPA, I can see why it has consistently high ratings.",4.4
7531,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"True to the hop-forward roots of California, this one lives up to my expectations of what a ""triple IPA"" should be.  It had the big hop citrus-grapefruit kick at first with a nice and bubbly palate feel as it swirls around on the tastebuds, and finishes off with some smooth maltiness.  Sometimes the supposed double or imperial IPAs are imbalanced with lots of hops along with an ugly, synthetic side, as if it’s the cost of brewing extremes.  Not this one though.  It’s a great, well rounded beverage with big IBUs and some soothing malts too.",3.9
7768,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Draught @ Brouwer’s Café:   Vibrant golden, moderate to large frothy white head, mild carbonation, nice lacing.   Piney nose, hoppy, a little resiny.   Fairly piney on the nose, hoppy, some resin and citrus peel.   Hop sided for sure.   Very resiny on the tongue but luckily not alcoholic.   Moderate malt base.   Backside is very piney and resiny.   Comes across as a hop sided but clean IIPA.   Could use a tad more more malts in my opinion.   Otherwise its a moderate to full body and mouthfeel.   Good stuff, a little hop-sided but very respectable. 



Draught @ Bottleworks:   I must say, the nose seems more vibrant and floral, with more candied citrus peel than I had at first.   Warming 11% ABV, but not hot.   Seems like pure hop juice on the exit, but its not terribly biting.   Certainly hoppy, bright, and vibrant, with a decent malt base.   I still wish it were a little more malty, like a borderline Barley Wine, but this is still damn good and one that I think most others wished they brewed.",4.2
7860,Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Growler shared by cdumler. Thanks! Pours a clear reddish orange color with a large, foamy white head. Great head retention and good lacing.

Nose is sharp hops to light funk.  No, not light funk.  Funky ass funk.  George Clinton and the p-funk all-stars funky.  Big burst in the front of the mouth.  No sweetness at first.  Hint of sweetness in the middle before bitter and gooey end.  It was worth the hassle of driving down mid-week on short notice after being shut out at an earlier establishment.",4.2
6881,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"On tap at GTMW ’09: Pours an opache black with a small dissipating tan head. Aroma is strong oak, fruity sweet (plums and raisins) and very rich. Flavor is strong oak yet very sweet with dark fruit, rich chocolate, coffee and a nice undertone of flower, herbs and grapefruit. Finish is very long and warm with molasses and dark fruit. Large bodied, quite a bit more alcohol apparent than the non oak version. Still one of the best beers I have ever tasted.",4.4
6732,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle (2012). Black pour with thin brown head. Aroma of rich, aromatic milk chocolaste, licorice, bourbon, roasted grain.

Palate is filthy rich with low-medium carbonation, palate seems to be a strong point, almost port-like qualities, great sipper. Very good aged IS, a fine example of how decadent the style can be made to be. It has however been surpassed over the years.",4.2
6818,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"got this in a mix pack of various BA dark lords from my local grocery store. i’m not really sure what all this obsession is with this style. it’s sorta like hey let’s take a stout and make it stronger but not really in all aspects and then throw it in a barrel? and what does imperial even mean? like it was in standard US measurements and then they just changed it to imperial? anyway i’m not amazed but compared to the others in this mix pack it aint half bad. i thought the barrel was there and it was kinda sweet but hey it’s bourbon right?1 it’s like a mix of things you know? like hey this is a stout and not that great but then some bourbon and you know it’s alright. some of the other ones in my mix pack were better but i will still drink this one down, i’m not afraid or anything. i can’t believe I even found this in a mix pack you know? better than the sam adams but not by much, and I prefer the magic hat by a small margin. next time try something a little different, ok 3 floyds?



(real rating)

8/13/11. On tap at the GTMW. Hugely sweet bourbon barrel aroma with some fudge, sour, and coconut. Overly sweet bourbon barrel flavor with coconut  vanilla, and lingering roast. Good, but you can definitely taste the rare. Overly sweet.",3.7
6935,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Having been to DLD for the first time, I was able to try this wonderful brew. It smells like chocolate, malt, and bourbon. Mmmmm. It pours to what I dream of with an imperial stout. The oak age adds so many subtlies of flavor to this beer. I taste vanilla, chocolate, coffee, malt, bourbon, expresso, and a small bit of brewed happiness. The flavor was as good as I’ve had in an imperial stout. Many are overpowering in taste but this is just where I want it. It leaves my mouth coated in it’s chocolatey ice cream flavor that makes everything else taste like it, which is awesome. I was highly impressed with this one day brew. This alone was worth drying to Munster from Cincinnati.",4.6
6848,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"5 ounce serving in a plastic cup at DLD 2010. Really wanted to try this last year when I went, but my friend and I ran out of time and had to leave before. The pour is darker than dark with a brown swirly head on top. This stuff is so thick it sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is incredible; tons of chocolate, roasted coffee, oak, vanilla, bourbon, a nutty smell, a sweet sugar-like smell. The flavor is so complex and and layered, with one smell/flavor coming one after the next; the layering is so incredible. So full bodied that your mouth feels sticky afterwards, but so tasty too. It is an extraordinary beer. However, I wish it could be aged, because after drinking an aged normal bottle of DL compared to an unaged bottle of normal, there is such a difference. If only I could have this whenever I wanted...",4.7

Taste: Bourbon, Soy, Chocolate, Syrup, Coffee and a hint of alcohol.

2007 vintage. ’07 was an extremely sweet vintage of DL so the oak aged version turned out too sweet as well. lots of honey and molasses and bourbon. flavor is huge and over the top sweet honey, molasses, and chocolate. extremely full mouth feel especially for a barrel aged beer and no alcohol was hidden. it’s just too sweet to drink a lot of. a few ounces is perfect but its one intense, sticky sweet BA imperial stout. delicious and I wish I could have some of this more than a few times a year..4.2.",4.2

Aroma of coffee, chocolate, molasses, licorice, bourbon is present but not overbearing, at first it seems a bit underwhelming but the more you sniff it the better it gets, very balanced, complex and nuanced. Taste is booze and bourbon up front with an intense and thick sweet finish. Rich and creamy velvety body with soft carbonation. This is still super sweet but not as one-dimensional as the regular one and the bourbon balances it out nicely. One of the best BA stouts out there for sure.",4.7
6822,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pour is what you would expect, jet black with next to no head. Nose is of bourbon, bourbon, and o yea bourbon.

7047,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Excellent brew, but the aging seems to have toned down the ’05 Dark Lord, replacing some of its bite with Bourbon in the aroma and flavor.  Still Huge in the malt category, with chocolate, vanilla, oak, and a heavy helping of alcohol.  Slightly thinner than the original, but finishes on a malty sweet, Bourbon sticky finish.  Great even in a plastic cup.

6807,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"So its been a while since I actually had this (full disclosure) although the memory is fairly clear given the strength of this beer 0 DLD 08. Pint in a plastic glass at darklord day. Dark viscous black with a nice creamy mocha head. This was like dark lord on steroids. Lots of booze, oak, vanilla, chocolate. I really felt that this overwhelmed the original version - and at least the vanilla bean version balanced things out. Definitely a full body, no idea on the carbonation since the mouthfeel was highly viscous, like motor oil, sweet and alcohol on the palate, long lasting but quite powerful finish. I know that people love this beer, and maybe its become more balanced over time, or maybe newer versions are just better, but I actually gave away parts of both cups I got during the fest because I just found them to be overwhelming - and this was after I had been sampling beer for 4 hours! O well.",3.3
6841,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Got this one from stfun37. Brought this down to San Diego last week and shared it with HopHead84 and dyan. I think this exceeded all of our expectations. Sludgy opaque black, no head forms from the pour - this is pretty much still. Plenty thick, but not as viscous as the regular Dark Lord, which can only be a good thing. Huge aroma of chocolate, fudge, chocolate cake, chocolate syrup, vanilla and caramel. Inhaling anywhere near the vicinity of a glass of this is like walking into a chocolatier. Unbelievably sweet and decadent. Oak and bourbon are noticeable, but the chocolate/caramel/vanilla trifecta is dominant. The taste is brimming with rich chocolate and vanilla, molasses, licorice and oaky tannins. Bourbon is there too, well-integrated and balanced with the base beer. The body is thick and viscous, carbonation non-existent. The finish is mildly tannic, roasty and semi-dry, coffee lingering on the palate. It’s amazing what a little -bal aging will do to a beer. While I’m not at all a fan of the regular Dark Lord, this iteration of it is incredible.",4.4
6675,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Simply amazing, pulling together everything that can make this style great. Thick and creamy as can be, with incredible balance and length. Tons of dark chocolate and cocoa mingle with the evident but not overpowering bourbon notes, picking up subtle hints of soy, molasses, oak, caramel that melt through the pillow-soft finish. Incredible, tasted on draft at 2016 Dark Lord Day and was the highlight of my day.",5.0
6966,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"I had this beer last year before I started rating on ratebeer.com, and I was just waiting to have it again so I could rate it.  Noting was more amazing then when I was standing in line (forever) and my girlfriend came back with three different versions of Dark Lord and the Bourbon Black Sun Stout.    It was exactly like I remembered it.  Pours a motor oil black with a very thin tan head that disappears.  Nice bourbon flavor and it just adds to the flavor that makes Dark Lord the beer that it is.  I did stand in line for about 4 hours today for the DL...I wish they bottled this as well.",4.5
6950,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Sample at DLD 08.  Extremely black with no head.  Swirling leaves the plastic cup stained brown.  Thick looking.  Bourbon is the first thing apparent in the aroma.  The bourbon definitely overpowers the other aromas but it is not overdone, the aroma is still quite pleasant.  Same old Dark Lord smell underneath if you focus on it.  Very balanced smell.  Taste is an explosion of sticky sweetness and mouth coating goo.  The bourbon is immediately apparent then the chewy, chocolatey malts finish.  Perhaps the longest finish of any beer I’ve ever had.  I was licking my gums for minutes tasting this stuff.  Obscenely full bodied.  I don’t know how but this seemed like the thickest DL I’ve yet encountered.  The flavor is a little over the top.  The sweetness of the bourbon combines with the already sweet beer to become a little much.  I kept envisioning drinking corn syrup and the texture doesn’t help eliminate this image.  The bourbon flavor also kind of overpowered any of the subtleties of the regular (yes, there are some subtleties) and made the beer less complex.  All in all this was quite incredible but the drinkability is certainly very low.  I had to share my little cup.  I am very glad to have gotten to try this but I prefer the regular version.",4.5
6725,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Poured a dark black color we from the bottle with aromas of roast, chocolate, earth, light vanilla, oak and bourbon.

6720,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle 381/420. Pours jet black, minimal mocha colored head. Very little lacing. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and booze. Taste is a little more brash than I was expecting. Big notes of the coffee/chocolate upfront, as the nose would suggest. But, I get some of that soy sauce flavor over the middle here that I did not taste in the Vanilla Bean variant. A bit off-putting, but it’s appearance is short-lived. The dark fruits...raisin, plum...come through bringing some sweetness before the roasted nut/oak/bourbon dominate the finish. The syrup/molasses not only encompass some flavor here, but the mouthfeel as well. Very sticky. Pretty darn good beer.",3.8
6686,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle thanks to Zakoon. Thanks buddy! Pours pitch black with a small brown head. Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, fudge, dark fruits, soy, roast, booze and a huge caramel backend. Taste is very sweet, brown sugar, vanilla, sweet chocolate, milky chocolate, dark sweet fruits. Not a lot of barrel compared to how sweet regular dark lord is, but still more barrelsweetness compared to the fruity sweetness regular has.",4.3
6761,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle #5/688 at The Stout Tasting, London - big, big thanks to Jack for providing THREE Munster beasts.

Full bodied with fine carbonation. Warm to hot finish with dark sugars, big molasses, rich dark fruits, dates, figs, more sticky chocolate. Pretty outrageous stuff, but in small doses I love it. Delicious.",4.6
6971,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Notes from Dark Lord Day ’07.  6oz glass in a plastic cup!  Black with brown edges, staining the glass with brown, and a tiny ring of tan head.  Aroma of roasted malts, bourbon, roasted grain, coffee, dark chocolate, and some alcohol.  Flavor added some tobacco, oak, stronger alcohol, pine, bitter chocolate, and a roasty bitter finish peaking at a 5-6.  The beer also got a little bit of salty soy towards the finish.  Full body with low carbonation.  Good amount of boubon in this, though not as strong as GI Bourbon County Stout.",4.3
6823,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle split with Pat, Andrew, Dallas and Bobby. Congrats on Dallas’ engagement. Sampled the bourbon aged DL after a session of 2011, 2010, 2009, and the 2008 vintages. It’s apparent that the Dark Lord improves with age as the sweet notes that were once overpowering become more subdued letting other flavors share the limelight - rich, dark chocolate, cherries, molasses, light tobacco, smoke, and of course coffee notes. With the Bourbon-aging, the DL is perfected. It’s essentially exactly what you’d expect - the flavors have been enhanced with notes of bourbon, sweet oak, earthy wood, one of the greatest beers I’ve ever tried and probably ever will.",4.7
7011,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Served on-tap @ the Dark Lord Release Party.

Pours a thick, syrupy black..the head is modest and a dark caramel color. Aroma is heavy coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate, with some alcohol creeping out as well. There’s definitely an oaky, bourbon kick to it, but the bitter chocolate and roasted coffee flavors still take the stage similar to the bottled Dark Lord. Amazingly balanced between the bold hop character and the array of tastes..just fantastic. Mouthfeel is expectedly thick, and very coating..yet smooth as velvet. Remains remarkably easy to drink for a beer of this magnitude.

Felt privileged to try this one.",4.6
6795,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"2012 vintage, bottle #687/888, courtesy of GT2. Pours a dark brown color with a thin creamy head. Decent head retention.

Nice.",3.8

6912,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,Had this on DLD at the FFF Pub. This was one of the first pours of the day i think I was the 4th person in the door. Thick im talking stand a spoon up thick was more like bourbon syrup. I was not impressed and actually gave the rest of my pour to my friend Kev.The bourbon was very overpowering even for me who loves bourbon soaked brews.

7023,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Suppose I should finally put my rating in. Sampled at the brewpub on DL Day. Served in a small maybe 5.5oz plastic cup. Color was an obvious pitch black, almost nothing getting through. Head was a small dark brown one I’d expect on a nice cup of coffee. Aroma is huge chocolate and coffee, then come the bourbon, molasses and caramel/vanilla things. Flavor is like a dark chocolate stout milkshake. Thick and filling. Bourbon adds a bite to a smooth and well made imperial stout. Good stuff!",4.3
7000,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"On tap at DLD ’07.  Huge beer!!!  Thick as oil and black as night...no light coming through this one.  Great nose of bourbon, chocolates, woody, and burnt malts.  This is easily one of my favorite BA imperial stouts.  I freaking loved this stuff, and had several glasses of it throughout the day.  The alcohol was present but it not really distracting from the beer at all.  There was also little to no head to speak of with this beer.  After having both this and BA speedway this past weekend I have come to the conclusion that I enjoy this one way more because of its ability to be so big and bold.  I loved it!!   The BA speedway was great as well and as weird as it may seem...it was almost too balanced.  How is that even possible???",4.8

Four absolutely amazing beers in a row.  And this my friends topped them all. ........  Pours a thick thick black clinging to the glass with thin brown head.  Nose of cherries, red fruit, chocolate, roast, oak, bourbon, molasses, and so many other rich scents.  So complex and rich.  Full bodied, viscious like pudding, creamy smooth.  Chocolate, fruit, coffee, molasses, espresso, all the notes in the nose but bursting now on my tongue.  This beer is so alive and intense on my tongue the thick black espresso to red and ripe fruit.  Why did I not drink this until I could no longer stand.  That is my only regret of that day.   The best beer I have ever had to date. 9/5/9/5/19




I’ve had many versions of this over the years.  As DL seems to go down, not surprisingly, this has too.  I thought ’10 DL was some of the worst to date, and therefore at DLD11’s BA version of the DL also suffered.  
Oily black color with a thin head. Rich oaky aromas. Sweet malts rich and roasty. Alcohol. Malts. Not a bad beer, but really a shadow of its former self. 8/5/8/4/15",4.1
6896,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Draft, at DLD 2009. Pours pitch black, capped with a moderate sized brown head. Aroma is complex, with oak, vanilla, and bourbon at the forefront, with coffee, raisin, and bittersweet chocolate rounding out the edges. Flavor follows suit, with bourbon, vanilla, wood, and chocolate nicely balanced in the forefront, with dark fruit and espresso notes in the background. Huge bodied and very smooth. Long, somewhat boozy finish, with lots of oak, vanilla and bourbon. I enjoyed this more that the standard Dark Lord, but not as much at the Vanilla Bean aged DL.",4.3
6965,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"from the barel, DLD ’08. Big. Huge. Thick. After having had Parabola, I was stunned how bit this one is. Big and thick, leaving an iodine film on the plastic cup. Just phenomenal. A big beer with a ton of flavors that didn’t clash, which is rare. Awesome.",4.7
6892,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Draft. Nose of vanilla, burbon, chocolate, light dark sugar, and a light bourbon note. Absolutely black with a few bubbles, looks and has the viscosity of dirty 10 weight oil. Flavor of big oaky vanilla and chocolate, with bourbon and coffee notes. Finish is very light bitterness with some very light alcohol warmth; extremely well covered..",4.8
6751,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle 75 cl. Pours black and opaque with a small brownish head. Intense pruney aroma, Bourbon and vanilla. Rich body with a distinct sweetness - perhaps bordering cloying. Again intense Bourbon and vanilla while the roast is fairly subdued. Warming alcohol finish. 040513",3.8
6998,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"DLD 2007 Rating:
This is as close to a perfect beer as I have ever had.  
Dense, rich mouthfeel.  Disturbingly black and near still appearance.  The bourbon really comes out in this beer and so does the oak.  Dark cherry and chocolate with a ton of coffee.  This is definitely the best experience I have had with beer. 10.5.10.5.20
Note: 
DLD 2008 I had a glass and I was too congested to taste much. 
DLD 2009 I had a glass and I didn’t bother to rate it.  

After having multiple bottles, the 2007 is still one of the best beers I have ever had, but the others just aren’t quite up to that level.  My rating reflects that, I hope.",4.6

6839,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"On tap at DLD 2010. I’m not sure why it took me so long to record this rating, but it works well for my 300th. This was a very nice imp stout, but it gets no where near the quality and depth of the vanilla bean version. Hard to say to what it is about those vanilla beans. On the aroma, notes of strong bourbon, sweet vanilla, rich chocolate candy bars, mixed powdery wafer malts, and a wonderful nutty caramel. It definitely intrigues you from the start. The appearance of this is basically identical to the vanilla bean version so I’ll copy and paste that description: ""Zero head from the pour. Black. A dark wood colored outer ring with some small stagnant carbonation bubbles. As thick as it gets, and rather mysterious looking."" The palate here is slightly harsher than the other two versions. Thick and creamy, but much more boozy. To describe the taste, its like sweet vanilla chocolate cake, cream on the top, consumed with a big glass of bourbon/whiskey. Bold. That’s another way to describe it. Overall, this to me was simpler complexity wise than the other two, but still a big and tasty brew.",3.9
6872,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Nip handbottle, courtesy StFun. Pours completely pitch black, thick and viscous looking with a tiny patch of dark brown bubbles at the head. There is no lace, though the sheeting practically stains the glass brown. The aroma is absolutely incredible. Vanilla bean creme brûlée immediately comes to mind, as do notes of softened whiskey and oak, all atop an already decadent blend of burnt caramel, chocolate cake, and mocha cafe. Hints of licorice and anise lend ample spice, completing the near-perfect  nose. The flavor has the nearly impossible task of living up to the beautiful scents that eminate from the glass, and accordingly, it falls a bit short.  Still delicious, and based in rich chocolate, caramel, and roasty coffee, the sharpness of the whiskey barrel and the anise tends to come across on the boozy side. Sweet, scorched marshmallow works nicely with the vanilla laden, toasted oak barrel notes. Very faintly carbonated (though that is no doubt the handbottle talking), the palate is dense and oily, ever so slightly thinned as compared to the base beer. Coffee, anise, and bourbony wood intensify on the sharp finish. Though the barrel influence changes the character of the brew considerably, it remains signature Dark Lord through and through. Great stuff.",4.4
6791,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Soo creamy, rich, and full of flavor. Better than the regular version, which is a personal favorite of mine.",4.8
6794,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Thanks to Brad for sharing this at his tasting on Saturday!

2010 vintage, served side by side with Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord.

Oak Aged Dark Lord pours a near jet black, with hints of brown visible at the upper edges of the glass when held to the light. Head and lacing are somewhat subdued, but given the serving medium, I couldn’t ask for more. A great big aroma of rich roasted malt and oak barrels. Wow. Dark Lord is one of my favorite beers, and I find the addition of oak barrels to be quite wonderful. There is a prominent licorice note in the taste. Someone described the feel as ""oil slick in the gulf"" and I have to agree. Thick and chewy, this beer leaves a coating of stout residue in your mouth that utterly blankets the palate. This is remarkably smooth, given the high alcohol (it is higher this year than previous vintages), and gives a nice, warm burn as it slides down. I really hope I can go to DLD next year and get some of this fresh from the tap.

Simply delicious. Similar in some regards to Goose Island Bourbon County Rare. The beer is full of flavor and wonderfully smooth. Alcohol content hidden beautifully. Lingering aftertaste of delicious bourbon. Warming sensation as it goes down. World class.",4.8
6817,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"On tap.  Very dark black pour, little carbonation and a noticeable (but not overpowering) bourbon nose.  Flavor was similar to some of the recent years of Dark Lord, very slick and sweet chocolate and a nice bourbon aftertaste which really finished off the aftertaste nicely.  Good beer, but there are other BB RIS out there which can come close to this(and are more readily available).",3.9
6844,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Finally found my notes for DLD and getting these in to review!
Draft. Poured a pitch black color with minimal head (I’m sure the plastic cup helped with that). Smells like DL but with huge hints of the oak barrels. Subtle sweetness. Slight smokiness. Adding the DL to the Oak barrels was a great move that only added additional complexity to this beer. Would be great to see it bottled instead of having to drink it from a plastic cup at DLD.",4.3
6887,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Finally getting a chance to try this, with my drinking buddy Wetherel.  Pours brownish black with a bubbly bit of carbonation.  Nose is sweet bourbonny, with hints of vanilla and chocolate.  Taste is sweet and chocolaty and rich with a big boozy punch.  Last time I had regular Dark Lord was Friday and it was an improperly aged and tasted like molasses and wasn’t very good.  This on the other hand is excellent, very sweet, very rich and really big.  Gotta say I like this.  Yum",4.5
6834,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"#900. Nip handbottle courtesy a great RB trade partner. Pours completely pitch black, thick, and viscous that lets barely any light though. The body is topped by a small patch of dark brown bubbles with no lace to speak of, but the drippy sheeting stains the glass nicely. The aroma is really decadent and complex with soft whiskey and oak laden vanilla all atop a nice blend of burnt caramel malt, dark chocolate, and mocha coffee. Hints of star anise adds some nice balancing spice. This thing just smells fantastic. The flavor follows and maybe not quite as impressive as the nose, but still fantastic with notes of dark chocolate cake, burnt caramel, roasted coffee followed by the whiskey boozy influence. The anise adds some nice spice, and the oak imparts its signature vanilla character. Full bodied, dense, and oily, but slightly thinned from regular Dark Lord and very minimal carbonation no doubt due to the hand bottling. Roasted coffee and bourbon soaked oak linger on the finish. It is still signature Dark Lord, but the barrel really adds great depth and a nice bourbon influence. Awesome beer.",4.4
6687,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Bottle, 2015 vintage, courtesy of kermis. Massive thnx! Pours a pitch black beer with alsmost no head on top. Aroma is massive bourbon, molasses, very sugary, woody and loads of presences of the base beer.

Thick black pour, thin to no tan head.  Aroma was boozy, with notes of bourbon, coffee, dark fruit and some slight chocolate.  Taste has notes of hot bourbon, booze, with notes of vanilla and chocolate, some sweet dark fruit and some roast.  Pretty good, definitely too hot at this point and would benefit from some age.",3.9

Date: 4/28/2007

Event: DarkLord Day 2007

Location: Three Floyds Brewing Co. Brewpub

Serving: 6 oz (?) draught sample in a plastic cup.


Tasting Notes

Aroma: BOURBON, sweet anise, chicory, slight oakiness, alcohol...  I can’t wait to try this stuff!

Appearance: BLACK, no head at all.  Thick and syrupy.  It looks like it would stick to anything and is doing a pretty good job coating the entire inside of the cup!

Flavor: WOW!  Instense and complex all the way...  Roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, chicory/coffee, anise, vanilla, wood, a hint of smoke.  Mild bitterness level.  The finish has a very dark chocolate flavor and is a bit more dry than expected, but still wonderful and it helps to balance out the initial sweetness.

Palate: FULL bodied.  It is as thick as it looks with an oily texture that really does cling to everything.  Needless to say, it coats the mouth nicely for a lingering flavor and long-lasting enjoyment.

Overall: AMAZING!  Truly phenomenal and well worth the drive, standing in line, and the cost!  This is a MUST try for all beer aficionados!",4.9

6851,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Rating #1000.  Draft at Dark Lord Day 2010, shawnm213 was nice enough to pick up a handful of these for our crew.  Thanks again, Shawn!  I didn’t have to wait in line for it.  I switched it over from the plastic cup to my Duvel glass, not that it was going to make a huge difference.  Pours a super dark brown; I didn’t see the pour itself to appreciate the motor oil stream that the Dark Lord normally demonstrates, but it sat in the glass opaque, with nice rich brown highlights on the edges and a little brown head.  Damn near perfect on aroma and flavor.  Notes of rich dark chocolate and creamy milk chocolate, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, brown sugar, peat, and incredible oak and bourbon notes from the Woodford Reserve barrel.  Not much vanilla came through for me, but the wood seems to be mellowing the sweetness of the normal Dark Lord.  Low carbonation, and a smooth, rich, woody, oily mouthfeel.  Full-bodied, though Shawn and Mike are saying this is thinner than last year’s version because it uses the 2009 vintage and not the 2008; I’ll buy that, having done a 5-year DL vertical with them, and that’s probably the only thing keeping this from being a perfect 5 for me- well, and the plastic cup.  It’s so close, though; this is one of the best things I’ve ever tasted. Re-Rate: 2012 release, bottle 505/688. It’s a little sweeter and not as good as the 2011 version, which I tried a few nights earlier and confirmed my rating. The 2012 is still amazing stuff but wouldn’t rate as highly.",4.8

6919,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Forgot to rate this one after Dark Lord Day. Draft in a plastic cup at the brewpub. Poured like motor oil. It looked like pancake syrup, and had the same thickness. Had small brownish ead, that did not dissapate. Instant great taste of bourbon and malts. Delicious lingering taste of coffee and chololate. Alcohol is apparant, and damned delish too. Finishes, with thick sludgy goodness. To sum it up, if you soaked a piece of wood in bourbon and then sucked on it, you’d get the same effect.",4.5

Really is better as it warms. Very good but the base beer (Dark Lord) is no longer unique and there are a lot of good beers out there that can compete with it.",4.2
6915,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"I think 6 oz. draft into a plastic cup @ DLD the past two years (rating is from 4/08).  I have been waiting until #666 to rate this because it seems appropriate (and probably cliche’).  This pours jet black with no real head to speak of; perhaps a few tan bubbles scattered about.  It is so thick that it refuses to leave the sides of the cup.  The aroma has the big sweet caramel malt, roast,etc from the base Darklord and adds bourbon, light oak, anise, and hints at the abv.  The flavors are intense and include roasted malt, chocolate,coffee, caramel, vanilla,oak, bourbon, and anise.  There is a dark chocolate like bitterness.  Definetly full bodied, with the flavor lingering for quite some time.  It is worth the time away from the tasting tables to enjoy this special brew once a year.",4.7

7059,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Fortunate to have this as my breakfast beer at Dark Lord day ’06. Very thick, almost spoon-worthy. Clung to the sides of the glass it got poured into. Very tight brown head with black appearance. Highly viscous mouthfeel. Temperature effects did accentuate the bourbon nature as time went by, but only enhanced the deepness of flavors in another direction. From chocolate-coffee-cherry to oak-leather-alcohol bitterness. Dark Lord is big enough to handle this and then some. Not sublime at all, but beautiful nonetheless.",4.7
6955,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Tried this one after the Vanilla DL, and it seemed different in a few ways. 1-it didn’t seem quite as thick, though it may have been an optical dillusion. 2- had a very distinct bourbon aroma and flavor. 3- you could tell the alcohol was in this one as compared to the regualr DL and Vanilla DL. Overall, it was great, but I was MUCH happier that I got a few cups of the Vanilla DL.",4.5
7040,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Impenetrable.  Opaque.  Obsidian, blanketing the glass and seemingly sucking light from all that’s around it.  A creamy, thin, deep khaki tan head resides on top.  Dark mocha fudge hits the nose, paralleled with tracts of bourbon and Godiva liqueur pumped into delicatessen dark chocolate, caramel laden turtle candies.  The bourbon is a major player, but it’s more of a first violinist rather than a soliloquy.  The currant, tar and other black earth elements from the non-barrel aged vintage don’t consciously resonate.  That being said, it’s still salvation for the nose.

Letting the liquid gracefully enter the mouth, we can effectively say that this is a perfectly barrel-aged beer.  Dry hop bite and black patent seem to take a steak knife to the tongue.  Thick, oily toss of the fluid seems to make it ooze even more slowly over the tongue.  Espresso grinds come up big, sweetened by this dark chocolate liquor accommodation.  It’s oppressive, but a welcomed tyrannical dictatorship.  Heavy caramel accents intertwine with a bitter dark chocolate character for a hearty espresso grinder’s day in paradise.  When it fades out from the mildly carbonated and chewy bourbon/chocolate sluice, we’ve got some dense pound cake qualities that’s choc full of flavor and enhanced with greasy mocha grinds, not to mention the dark chocolate fudge and liqueur-laden Dove chocolate bars.  Quite a bitter and fiery flick at the tongue’s tip on its way out, and it seems to devilishly pry open a few of the tongue’s weaker taste buds and ignite them with a peppery flare.  Thick, palatable justice in the hard-to-halt viscosity.

An absolute pleasure (and thanks to my wife for her allotment as well!)  The barrel does supplant some of the intricacies that help to orchestrate the cadences within the traditional Dark Lord vintage, though this barrel aged beer would be any delicatessen’s dream to craft an ale in such an awe-inspiring manner.",4.8
6658,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,So glad I opened this one with some good friends. Fudgey chocolatey goodness. A bit on the sweet side but it was enjoyable nonetheless.,4.5
6990,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Draft at DLD.
Served dark as night with only a slight ring of head around the perimeter of the glass.  Smell is absolutley luxurious.  Deep roasted malts, chocolate, and bourbon are the front runners. This is a big beer, no doubt, the alcohol is there and warming.
This beer is mellowed a bit by the oak aging.  Not the brute that the DL bottle is.  This is a great beer, but not huge and robust as say a GI BCS.
The guys at FFF have taken barrel aging to a whole n’other level.  Other brewers could take notes from them.",4.3

Poured pitch black with zero head and enjoyed in a small plastic cup, just the way it was meant to be had.

Rich oily mouthfeel and light carbonation but a sufficient amount.  Really good stuff.",4.1

It would appear that among the reviews that the beer was actually better inside than outside.  Not sure why, but this was overwhelmed with the bourbon and oak flavors.

Sticky, thick, hearty palate that is densely flavoured to reflect the nose: fresh tiramisu, bourbon-toffee sauce, hot fudge, vanilla, woody and earthy undercurrents. Boozy and warming, but smooth as silk. I wondered whether this would be worthy of the hype or whether it is inflated by rarity. It is worthy of its accolades and deserving of its status.

Big thanks to Gunhaver for sharing this. You ROCK! Pours viscous sludgy void like ooze with no head. The aroma is . . . WHAT?? Hold on a minute, that can’t be right. OK another draw, CRIPES!! I’m glad I’m sitting down because this would have buckled my knees. There are deep rich barrel extracted vanilla notes everywhere. What the hell? Beyond the crazy rich vanilla are chewy smelling notes of caramel covered oak, thick sweet malts, dark chocolate and some crusty roastiness as well as very little evidence of the huge ABV. I guess I have to taste this. If this was all I had for the night I’d just nurse the aroma for hours. Wow.  The taste is rich chewy creamy malts, caramel, decadent vanilla ice cream sprinkled with vanilla and syrup covered oak to go along with light notes of booze. It ends with the sense of rich fudge brownie spread over aged oak. Just frikin’ amazing. I really can’t even tell there’s much alcohol in this. How’d they do that?",4.7

 I liked this just a bit less than DL and the Oak aged. A wonderful beer, but so little goes such a long way. We shared the 3oz sample between three of us and that was more than enough.  I’ll be happy to have it again next year, but goodness is overwhelming.",4.1

Ultra full-bodied and velvety with a mineral oil mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor provides hearty gobs of sticky-sweet chocolate, vanilla and bourbon with a calming bitterness and woodsy undertone. The lengthy finish is rich, bittersweet and smooth. Even better than the original and oak barrel aged versions of Dark Lord!",4.8
8194,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"More than worthy of the hype. There is literally nothing I can think of to change that would improve this beer. It even maintains a half-inch thick mocha head. 

There’s a depth of flavor and complexity that’s richer than any other barrel aged beer I’ve had... including BCBS Vanilla, Rare, Parabola, BA Vietnamese Speedway, etc... This is just more enjoyable. At 15% you taste no alcohol and only get a slight, but pleasing warming sensation as it goes down, with massive marshmallow, chocolate and vanilla-oak goodness forever lingering. 

I can’t do it justice by attempting to analyze and explain. It really is the Dark Lord of barrel aged beers. I need more",4.7

8534,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"The closet thing to a perfect beer I have ever had. Flat out delicious in every possible way. Pours thick and heavy. So black that it stains the cup. No lacing. Aroma is yeaty and full of chcolate and vanilla, some bread, cherries, and candy as well. Richness everywhere, in the aroma and taste. This one is creamy as creamy can be, just incredibly smooth...thick, but never TOO thick, a perfect mouthfeel.  Flavor is f’n delicious. Thick and chewey, with lots of roasted barley, vanilla, chocolate covered cherries, cocoa powder, oak, and yeast, also notes of coffee. Some dark fruit and syrup notes as well. Roasted malts make themselves known at times, but the vanilla and chocolate covered cherries pack the punch. Alcohol is present, but doesn’t feel like 14% whatsoever, but everything else is bold, yet smooth and totally drinkable. Flavors swirl in your mouth and are constantly changing, even the same mouthful will evolve before you swallow. The vanilla is always present, but only adds complexity and flavor, it never dominates. Very warming, but never at the expense of the brew itself. Everything strikes a great balance in getting the beer to feel and taste exactly as it should. This one is thick, oily, and bold. The vanilla beans are the PERFECT compliment to DL, and should be an actual ingredient. This beer is like drinking heaven.",5.0

A - Pours pitch black with a nice one finger tall tan head leaving small trails of lace down parts of the glass.




S - Smells of smooth bourbon, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, dark malt and a nice vanilla sweetness. The vanilla is a little weak toward the end of the glass, otherwise a very nice nose.




T - Starts off with a perfectly balanced mix of sweet vanilla, warm bourbon and dark roasted chocolate malt. Hints of coffee, dark fruits and molasses follow close behind. Finish has some sweetness and dark roast combining to linger on the palate long after the finish. Booze is extremely well hidden, only really becoming noticeable toward the end of the glass.




M - It is definitely a big beer with plenty of flavor and a moderate amount of carbonation. It is much smoother than I thought it would be.

Huge sweet vanilla, but big milk chocolate as well. Lots of molasses, wood, bourbon, and floral qualities. Some soft coffee and roasts creep in more and more as this warms. This would be the perfect aroma if the hops were just a little more pronounced. Despite that, the aroma was awesome. The flavor, however, was as good as an Imp Stout gets IMO. A remarkable medley of tastes. Big vanilla, milk chocolate, wood, bourbon, and fat malts up front. Moves softly into a moderately roasty and bitter middle before finishing with an explosion of tastes. Much more of a noticeable roast and hop character balances out the big vanilla and cocoa flavors to perfection. The wood and bourbon accompany the flavors nicely and never dominate. Extremely well balanced and complex. Full bodied, smooth, and round with a lingering taste of every flavor. Overall, a phenomenal beer.

It overpowers the whole experience.  Has some complex flavors including coffee, wood, roasted malts, and has a nice smooth finish with an alcohol touch like the other Dark Lord beers.  Only issue with this one is its too sweet upfront.  And has on some sips too much molasses/vanilla sweetness that overpower an otherwise beer that could be more balanced with its other complex flavors.  A group of about 10-15 or so of us couldn’t finish our glass because of it.",3.7
8407,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On draft 4-30-11 at DLD in the brewpub. Pours black as oil with a small amount of tan head around the edge of my glass.  Smells sweet like honey, also bourbon, vanilla, licorice, coffee, dried dark fruits, and chocolate really come through nicely. Dark roasted coffee and vanilla  fills my mouth and coats the palate. Flavors of bourbon, chocolate, and raisins are also noticeable. The mouthfeel is wonderfully thick and oily. The finish of this monster beer is rather smooth and sweet with a subtle roasted coffee bitterness and no noticeable burn from the high abv.

Smooth, syrupy, and excellent.",4.2

After the regular one beeing the biggest disappointment ever the day before, this one could only be better. Still very flat, but at least there is a hint of there beeing a head at all. Aroma is sweet, slightly rich, dark malts, vanilla, dark sugar, chocolate, caramel, coffee, cocoa. Tast is still very sweet, but far away from the sugar bomb from the day before. Dark malts, alcohol, vanilla, oak, dark sugar, cocoa, caramel, coffee. Longlasting bitterness, very dry mouthfeel. It’s a lot better than the regular one, but still it’s not even close to competing with Founders KBS for instance. And Goose Island Bourbon County Stout Vanilla is out of this world compared to this one.",4.0
8545,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Had a bunch of this at DLD because, besides my glass, a number of generous folk didn’t want me to miss it, so I thankfully drank some more.  Very thick dark brown (in bright sunlight) body with a few stray bubbles in lieu of a head, this had an aroma of dark-doughed chocolate chip cookies with a generous splashing of vanilla extract, dark roasted malt & barley, anise, oak, alcohol, dark dried fruit, and hard nuts.  Very creamy in the mouth.  The flavor was thicker than the nose and chewy with tastes echoed from same.  Tasty, sweet, complex - - -  It gave me the urge to chase it with a strong Stout.

Pours pitch black with a thin brown head and a little bit of sticky lacing in the glass, the aroma is very sweet, tons of vanilla with a good kick of bourbon though and oak as well, the flavor is, you guessed it, sweet on the front end with lots of vanilla and has a fairly boozy finish, not all that enjoyable on an 85 degree outside after you’ve been drinking for 4 hours already, but still not all that bad.",3.7

8508,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"had this on DLD 08 @ The FFF pub..I think I was the 5th person through the door when it opened...This one was the main target on my list even though I had the Bourbon Barrel and the Vanilla at the same time just so I didnt half to wait for the attention to come my way again..
The Vanilla was very present up front and was noticeable immediately from the first sip. There was a thick mouth feel,very thick almost the consistency of drinking thick pear juice..Pitch black ,over due motor oil change black with a small dark tan quickly dissipated almost non existent head..The taste was awesome to say the least..I have never had anything like it and probably never will again. Surprisingly easy to drink ,but this one is a sipper for sure, just goes down leaving you wanting another. I did notice the pours coming from the bar were getting a little bigger as other cups and glassware came out..They started with 4-5oz pours and quickly started going to 6-8oz pours so I grabbed 2 to go for my buddies in line outside and shared with them
Might as well forget about putting this one on your want list it was a 1 barrel thing on that day and is gone..It was $6 a pour and if I had a bottle and the $ I could have probably filled a growler..But my $ was spoken for from the bottled Dark Lord..Long live the mid evil madness!",4.6

Aroma was chcolate, lots of vanilla, coffee molasses and dazrk fruits.

8408,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Tasted on draft at DLD2011, my friend Ben brought me a sample from inside the brewpub.  Pours a murky oily black.  By the time it got to me, there was no head whatsoever, but with agitation, it forms a thin collar of tan lace.  The nose is dominated by vanilla bean, but there are also dark chocolate, lightly bitter coffee and molasses aromas as well.  On the palate, this beer is cloyingly sweet with tons of vanilla and chocolate syrup.  The coffee is more or less completely lost, but there is still a bit of the molasses, and just a hint of cinnamon spice, but vanilla is undoubtedly the strongest flavor, however.  The body is super full and sticky with very light carbonation, and a long sweet vanilla and lightly spiced cinnamon finish.  Overall, this beer tastes awesome, but due to the cloying nature, it would be difficult to drink much more than the small sample that I was given.",4.1
8353,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Opened a bottle of the 2013 this weekend (thanks Mac!) and updated a few things. Was fortunate enough to try the 2011 vintage on draft at Huna Day a few weeks back, and that drinks pretty similarly. 
 


This black, molassesy, still stout sports zero head. Beautifully full bouquet of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, black biscuits, and roasty malts. It’s one of those beers where one sip crushes everything else you once thought considered elite. Everything from the nose is here in force, with vanilla and chocolate shining the brightest. Bourbon up front, followed quickly by chocolate-covered marshmallows. Massively viscous body delivers all of these flavors to my palate with its sticky, stubborn body. 
 


Shows a masterful level of refinement equaled by only a handful of other beers in existence -- some of which are other BA DL variants (namely Brandy Vanilla & Pappy). Say what you will about the base: the BA versions rank among the best stouts brewed anywhere. Period.",4.7
8487,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap at DLD ’09, served into a goblet.  Holy cow! This aroma is nothing short of heavenly.  Fresh vanilla galore, creamy ice cream, bourbon and roasted bourbon wood, malted cocoa, coffee beans, subtle citrus undertones.  I didn’t want to start drinking, it smelled so good.  Zero head from the pour.  Black.  A dark wood colored outer ring with some small stagnant carbonation bubbles.  As thick as it gets, and rather mysterious looking.  But really, upon sipping, how can a beer this big, be so smooth? A really unbelievable feel, super thick, leaving flavor everywhere.  Just great for sipping.  Aroma really did not lie about how this one would taste.  Quite similar actually, as the flavors feed off the aroma very well.  Vanilla syrup, roasted bourbon cream, the best black malts I’ve ever had, a thick woody bitter to back up the sweetness of minor 3fs herbal and citrus.  The hop backing fits in with everything so well, making this a very well balanced beer.  Other notes of warm cocoa and roasted black coffee.  Sweet till the end, but its never too much like it was last year, with just the perfect amount of vanilla.  A decent amount better than the other two versions, this was probably the best imperial stout I have ever had.  Wonderful!",4.7
8473,Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,# 1300.  2008 Vanilla Bean Dark Lord on draft at the brewpub at 2009 Dark Lord Day.  Pours a pitch black with a small light brown cream head.

The aroma is big and sweet and wonderful. Lots of coffee, chocolate and caramel with a big maple syrup and vanilla note. Coffee is mildly fruity with a nice gentle roast and stays in more of a supporting role than expected. All of that maple and vanilla makes it smell like some sort of delicious breakfast food dessert. Big fudgey chocolate Taste is sweet and provides more chocolate and coffee to balance out the maple, not that the aroma is unbalanced in a bad way. Nice, thick mouthfeel. Chewy stout goodness. I really, really like this beer.",4.5

Edit: On tap at the 2013 Assassin Release. This beer is still rich, powerful, and potent. Full bodied, rich maple and coffee flavors, cool vanilla and some good roast, cocoa, and all around assertive flavors. Sipped on glasses of this that I shared all day. It would be hard to drink more than a glass or two, but on and off throughout the day it really worked. I really enjoyed this and upped the score overall by one.

Flavors inlcude milk chocolate, coffee, well-incorporated maple syrup sweetness and just some toffee. There’s something additional here too, a doughy cookie batter chewiness, that sets it apart from other stouts that have those traditional coffee-milk-chocolate aspects.

Flavour is amazingly rich and complex, with loads of espresso beans, followed by just enough maple syrup, decadent chocolate fudge, and more coffee. The beer isn’t as sweet as I thought. The coffee cuts out any sweetness from the maple syrup that might be detracting. This is stunningly amazing. One of the best impie stouts out there.

6115,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"On tap in Madison, WI

Toppling Goliath has a reputation for excellence which made this the main draw for a night out at one of Madison's best bars. Worth every penny of the cost, it delivers an experience unrivalled by all but the best of the best. Despite the lines I may have to make a detour to their booth at the Great Taste this year to get another pour.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A deep oily black core permeates the glass and stains everything it touches. A minimal head tracks the long icy legs which melt like sheets of snow on a warm spring day. Plums, raspberry, anise, and coffee hang in the air with a glowing warmth that feels mellow and dense. There's no mistaking the ABV but even so it feels very approachable.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Warm espresso, dark chocolate, plums, and blackberries coat the palate with layers of boozy sediment. The dense flavors complement each other so well that it is nearly effortless to follow each sip with another. The mildly bitter finish continues to warm the throat well after the glass is empty. Overall there is only one complaint - that I did not order a full pour when offered the opportunity.",4.6

Dark, ebony/mahogany body has garnet highlights on the edges and a tan head that shows strong retention.
Lovely dark fruits in the nose lead to coffee, for sure, but thankfully it’s very dark and vinous itself, blending in to the stout aspects of the beer quite artfully. SO VERY THANKFUL that this is not just a nose full of coffee beans and nothing else...Ahem, back to the beer, dark chocolate, dry vanilla and liquorous raisins. Hop notes are light, add some mild citrus notes but otherwise give the stout over to the malt. Very strong aroma and no sign of alcohol or any flaws.
Departing again from the recent trend of stouts that you have to chew before swallowing, this stuff is actually only medium-full bodied. Carbonation is very tight and gives the beer a very engaging texture that wraps about the mouth spreading light prunes, bitter dark chocolate notes, sweet vanilla and moderate amounts of coffee flavor. Sweetness is on the low side and it’s not just a mouth full of sugary chocolate. On the finish there is a delicious, difficult to describe flavor, almost bourbon-like, or maple liqueur-like, though not as sweet as maple liqueur. Very interesting and delicious.
Awesome stuff, shows a lot of restraint on the coffee and the beer is well-attenuated. Kind of rare these days when it comes to coffee stouts....",4.1
6289,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Great Taste of the Midwest on August 08. The pour is a viscous and tar-like black with a thin dark brown head that settles to a small ring and offers some great staining on the glass. The aroma is all coffee up front and absolutely beautiful. There is a great complexity of maple, a little bit of green oak and vanilla. A fudgy chocolate backs everything up. It smells like a fudge. The taste is unbelievable. Heavy coffee, that unbelievable maple, a great chocolate, moderate vanilla, and a light bourbon presence. This baby tastes like a maple-soaked coffee fudge. My god. The mouth feel is unbelievable. It’s like chewing fudge. Thick, viscous, with a soft carbonation. This baby just coats the mouth and refuses to leave. The aftertaste is all maple. Sweet, delicious, unbelievable. Best liquid I’ve ever had in my mouth, hands down.",5.0

6196,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Huge thanks to Dylan for sharing this personal whale! 🙌 Batch 2.
Nose is full on roasted coffee. Bit grainy. Huge chocolate truffle. The body is so thick, almost syrupy. very sweet too but never annoying. Immediately had sticky lips and tong from the intense sugary sweetnes. This is just straight alcoholic milk chocolate. Also reminds me of creamy high quality cappuccino. Aftertaste is a Bit burnt fruit. Like fruit compote which is nice. 
Only fault is I expected more maple. But that could have something to do with age. Love to compare this with other batches as there seems to be some differences.",4.7
6407,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,Jet black pour tiny brown head legs and lace.  I would guess a touch of bourbon a bunch of maple syrup a hint of coffee and some extra sugar.  Fuel well coated palate.  Almost a touch of bacon in the swallow with tons of maple syrup a hit of coffee.  Nearly perfect but a touch to sweet.,4.5
6232,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Un immense merci à Yan pour le partage de cette grande bouteille en ce souper de Réveillon! Vintage 2016. Entre l’épaule d’agneau braisée et les fromages. À peine la capsule levée de la bouteille, une véritable explosion d’arômes d’érable envahit la pièce. Du sirop d’érable, de la tire d’érable sur la neige, de la pâte à biscuits aux pépites de chocolat non cuite... De la véritable folie! Une fois dans mon verre cependant, les arômes s’estompent curieusement rapidement. De mon verre s’échappent beaucoup plus de vapeurs d’érable que du verre de Marc-André. Je ressens encore beaucoup de chocolat mais surtout du café. Une base cependant verte me fait sourciller car cette dernière était la dernière chose à laquelle je m’attendais. Le café demeure tout de même au centre de toute l’action - au nez comme ne bouche. Des arômes de grains de café éthiopiens chauffés accentués par des brisures de chocolat au lait de qualité exceptionnelle. Et cette texture!!! Le liquide est léger comme une plume, voire aérien. Une légèreté satinée, moelleuse comme je n’en ai jamais ressentie de semblable. L’érable me salue en passant en guise de rappel en laissant le chocolat et le café se disputer le premier rôle. Laisse moi pas tout seul avec un bomber car je l’aurai bu sans même m’en rendre compte. Un élixir Supérieur.",4.5

Smooth, complex, and absolutely delicious.",4.7
6238,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Bottle shared, batch two. Pitch black with short lasting dark brown head that leaves an oily film. Massive molasses, apple juice spread (applesirop), coffee, maple, pecan, brown sugar, light tart roasted barley. There’s actually a lot of coffee but it takes some time to come to the forefront. Taste is thick sweet with coffee bitterness and a light fruity/ashy sourness in the background. Full bodied with crazy thick syrupy feel, this needs a spoon! Very good, not the best beer in the world but its unique, interesting and very good.",4.5
6383,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,Thanks to whoever shared this.  Poured a deep rich black.  Aroma is of chocolate and maple.  Flavor is rich and roasty.  Wonderful chocolate and coffee notes.  Waves of maple and vanilla then cut through.  Talk about breakfast in a bottle!   A stupid good beer.,4.5
6275,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Mornin delight batch 2

Pours an oily, black color, with a medium, dark brown head to it, revealing huge bubbles within a spongy head. Coates the side of the glass after swirling with alcohol legs, small bubbles and an oily film, showcasing the thickness of the beer.

Smells of warming syrup, wrapped up by cold pressed coffee beans, together with scorched, earthy malts. Atop of that foundation settles a nutty and raisiny quality, both adding to the potent coffee appearance. Milk chocolate enriches the luscious, sweet maple syrup, with coffee cutting through in a flowery, slightly wooden fashion. The most beautiful thing about the aromas is their perfect balance in combination to its outstanding intensity. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth, soft on the tongue with a lower carbonation to it, presenting the beers huge body perfectly. Even its profound coffee bitterness during the finish is not able to distract from its creamy softness, maintaining its fantastic thickness.

Tastes of oaken, multi layered espresso bean, pungent, while offering a pleasant, mellowing sweetness, which gets beautifully enhanced by the syrup. An early, dry coffee bitterness goes hand in hand with earthen, toasted malts and a brewed coffee sourness, almost completely wrapped up by the malts. Into this coffee sourness blends the rich maple syrup, creating an intriguing flavor depth, soothed by whipped cream. During the beers finish, its profound coffee earthiness returns to the palate, while bitter chocolate compliments it, together with perfumy, alcohol soaked praline.

While featuring chewy, sweeter qualities, the beer reveals an awesome balance, due to its mvp, the coffee. It is incredibly rich and exhibits both, sweeter and bitter qualities by itself, accentuated by syrup and malts. Its mouthfeel makes this truly great, maintaining a remarkable silkness on the tongue, while the beers rich, thick body is challenging the tastebuds throughout, in the most pleasant way, coating my tongue for minutes after each sip.",4.3
6409,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"On tap at TG.  Massive espresso nose, probably the nicest coffee aroma I’ve come across, like sticking your nose in a bag of freshly roasted oily coffee beans.  Also some caramel in the aroma, chocolate, malty sweetness, fantastic.  Pours an opaque inky black, brown head with good retention, leaves some lacing and coats the glass.  Flavor is very tasty coffee, smooth with no astringency, chocolate and hints of maple syrup and vanilla, roasty, more espresso, fairly sweet.  Very full body, medium carbonation, very smooth and creamy, coats the palate.  Coffee flavors and aromas in this beer are amazing, well done.",4.4

Looks even thick upon poor, this beer is insanely thick. Nose is hazelnut paste sweet but also bit bitter, herbal nuts, walnuts pure mocha syrup, bitter molasses, syrup, very big coffee, espresso with some roast, pecan, maple is way lower than you would expect. This is not the pasty stout that I expected this to be, maple is quite low, barely there but this is way more about the coffee, espresso, coffee roast, even roasted malts & it is insanely thick, easily one the thickest beers that I have ever had, tastes of hazelnut ,more roast than expected, pure thick syrup, more molasses than maple almost pure malt syrup, heavy coffee bitter finish, expresso, decent roast, lingering nuts & inanely thick. Surprisingly balanced, surprisingly coffee forward. Liked it more & more the more I drank it, surprisingly drinkable despite the thickness.

The aroma comes across as oily rich dark roasted coffee goodness that has an espresso sense to it and also has thin supporting snippets of chocolate and molasses. The taste is similar with rich oily dark roasted coffee to espresso blending into a pleasing mix of molasses, chocolate and dark roasted malts.

6187,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"Toppling Goliath Brewing Co. - Mornin' Delight b4 (2017) 
Imperial Stout Brewed With Maple Syrup & Coffee.  


 Alkohol:  12% obj. 


 IBU:  50 


 Kolor:  Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. 


 Piana:  Nie można się do niczego tutaj przyczepić. Beżowa, wysoka, bujna, zwarta piana.
Długi czas stoi jak zaczarowna w miejscu. 
Po opróżnieniu szkła wciąż pozostaje na jego ściankach. 


 Zapach:  Aromat jest masywny! Roztacza się szerokim łukiem nad całym pomieszczeniem i wypełnia je swoją intensywnością.
Nie musisz wcale przykładać nosa do butelki, aby poczuć gigantyczną woń syropu klonowego wspieranego przez najlepszej jakości kawę.
Tylko minimalna paloność połączona z nutami pralinek belgijskich, karmelu i wiodącej wanilii.
Pomimo, że piwo jest klasycznym Imperialem aromat miażdży większość najlepszych beczkowych RIS-ów jakie piłem.
Myślę, że właśnie dla takich piw jak to powinni wymyślać dodatkową skalę zapachową.
Poezja! 


 Smak:  Na języku dominuje przyjemny syrop klonowy.
Gęsty, pachnący, świeży.
Przywołuje skojarzenia z najlepszymi naleśnikami oblanymi syropem klonowym jakie jadłem kiedyś w Las Vegas w 
jednym z amerykańskich barów śniadaniowych. 
Po chwili dochodzi do tego kawa, która już po drugim łyku zaczyna dominować.
Lekka paloność i niski stopień kwaskowatości z miejsca ustawia to piwo w gronie najlepszych kawowych RIS-ów w moim portfolio. 
Smak uzupełniają akcenty gorzkiej i mlecznej czekolady, melasy, wanilii, pralinek belgijskich, karmelu, cynamonu i marcepanu.
Gęsta, oleista i ubita jak budyń tekstura.
Procenty po mistrzowsku zamiecione pod dywan.
Na języku pełne, słodkie, jedwabiste i kremowe. Pod koniec degustacji, po solidnym ogrzaniu w dłoniach, na końcu języka pojawia się minimalna kawowa kwaskowatość. W żadnym stopniu nie wpływa to na finalny odbiór trunku.
Doskonała robota! 
 

 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 

 Podsumowanie:  
 

Mornin' Delight - piwo z którym wkraczam w 2018 rok. 

2-gi najlepszy Imperial Stout na świecie.

Perfekcja, doskonałość i mistrzowskie zrozumienie tematu.
To jest prawdziwie w 100-ach oddający klimat amarykański Imperial Stout.
Dodatki dorzucone do piwa: syrop klonowy i kawa perfekcyjnie podkreślają to co dla Amerykanów jest ważnym elementem ich życia.
Balans poszczególnych składowych jest jest wręcz niebywały.
Dopieszczony do granic możliwości, od opakowania, przez wygląd, a na smaku skończywszy.
Bogaty, wielowarstwowy, na długo pozostanie w mojej pamięci.
Nie jest to co prawda mój No 1, 
ale na bank znajdzie się w Top10 moich Imperiali.

⭐️⭐️⭐️Batch 4 drugi raz 12.01.2019⭐️⭐️⭐️

20393,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Dark brown hazy pour, with a small offwhite head that clings. Aroma is Candysugar, with a sitrusy, almost dishwasher-soapy smell.

23451,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"The Rochfort 10, is this cowboy’s favorite beer. IT is dark, powerful, and very complex. I get some BING< and some currant in it.

23405,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"330ml bottle, best before 04/03/08.

I have had several bottles of this over the past year, but this is the first time I’ve tried to describe it.

Pours out cloudy murky dark brown with a 1"" head. 

Head receads to a thin cap atop this glorious brew.

Lacing coats the glass in a thin sheet.

Aroma is complex, dusty, plummy, raisins, currants, winey, banana, alcohol, with a touch of burnt sugar.

Flavor is sweet, raisin, malt, dark fruits, caramel, all enveloped by a mildly hoppy finish. Alcohol is not detected in the flavor, but it is when it hits the belly.

Like a Cohiba Siglo V, if I could afford to drink this every day I would. For now I’ll settle for once a month.",4.5
21321,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a mysterious deep mahogany, hazy with sediment, with shining orange spots in the sunlight. A gentle head quickly fades, but given its high ABV this is expected. The aroma is distinctly wine-like revealing a complexity of fruits, specifically grapes, plums, and raisons. Huge alcohol lift in the nose.  

Right away I know Rochefort 10 is an impressive beer. A plethora of delicious flavors immediately charm you. Dark fruits as mentioned in the smell, also including molasses, toffee, and oak. Every sip seems to uncover something different, as you peel back layer upon layer of flavor. Alcohol is not overwhelming at 11.3%, but feels rather natural and warming like a fine wine would. Many Port like characteristics are on display. A luscious mouth feel with a very dry finish. Rochefort 10 is rich, elegant, and full of depth. It is obvious why this is highly regarded as one of the best beers in the world. I would love to see how it tastes with a few years of age (this bottle is only 7 months old).",4.5

22986,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Bottle. Poured a dark brown with a tall, frothy, tan head that mostly lasts and left light lacing. The aroma was dark fruits (raisins, cherries, and prunes), and sweet malts. As it warmed a slight alcohol aroma was also noted. The flavor found dark fruits, light spices, and a hint of alcohol. Medium to full body and a definite warming felling. I’m glad I have another to cellar for a while.",4.1
23023,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Bottle in good company with pailhead. Poured a creamy off white head with a decent amount of carbonation  a clean brown in color Mild malt aroma with some chocolate and toffee .Flavor was mild with chocolate fruit fig and a light creamy finish. At this point it is hard to get excited I just consumed a Westy 12 .,4.3
22160,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Bottle, 12 oz. Murky and cloudy dark ruby with a lasting light brown head. Good lacing. Heavy malt aroma with molasses, caramel, and bread. Only light hops, but heavy on the yeast. Initially an average alcohol aroma, but grew as the temperature of the beer rose. Notes of plums and dates, as well as cask wood and nutmeg. A full body on the palate with a creamy texture and lively carbonation, and a somewhat bitter finish. The flavor lasts long with a moderate combination of sweetness,  bitterness, and acidity.
Overall I get the impression that I have yet to fully interpret and understand this beer. This was an ""off-the-shelf"" vintage (probably 2007). I would love to try vintages of five year intervals to see how it matures.",4.5
22083,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"An extremely complex Quadrupel that has too many flavors to list. And too many features. Was expecting something a little smoother; The booze in this one is quite apparent, unlike Bernardus, which I believe to be slightly better for that reason alone. Still excellent, and highly recommended. I wish I could have this all the time but alas, at $7+ per 11 1/5 ounce bottle, I’d be bankrupt in no time. A treat. Thanks, Rochefort.",4.3

Yeasty aromatics with a ting of mineral laden caramel.  Chocolate, dusty raisins, died cherries, chewy, aromatic and amazing.  Dark, ruby-brown in color with a tall, rocky head that thins.  Flavor is full of rich and sweet plummy caramel malt with a warming finish that lasts and lasts.  Toch of alcohol and a hint of a medicinal cherry starts coming out half way through the glass.  Sweet and full-bodied with a creamy and warming ting of alcohol as it goes down the back of my throat.  Yummy.",4.4

Vierte marrón oscura e inmediatamente llama la atención su cantidad de espuma beis, cremosa y compacta.

 Si la vista es impactante, en cuanto acercas la nariz ya se te empieza a ir la cabeza fuertemente. Y con el primer trago directamente te quieres quedar a vivir en ella para siempre.

No sabría muy bien por dónde empezar. Durante todo el rato que dura la copa, tienes mil sensaciones aromáticas y gustativas diferentes. Caramelo, torrefactos, frutas maduras, especias, uvas pasas, chocolate… uhhhhmmmmm delicioso chocolate, casi se puede masticar.

Su más de 11% de alcohol está ahí, evidentemente, pero nunca te incordia en el trago. He tomado cerveza de abadía con menos graduación cuyo alcohol te macea infinitamente más que aquí.",5.0

22827,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"This beer pours a light cola brown that was very murky with a few clumps of yeast swimming around the bottom. It also had a tan and copper head that is creamy smooth with only a few large bubbles sticking together in clumps. As the beer sat, the head got creamier and smoother. The head stuck around until the end with a film of mini bubbles that looked like a sheet of tiny ball bearings. When I finished the last of the beer, there was still a spot of head in the bottom of the glass. Nice. 

The beer smelled of maple syrup, molasses and black liquorish. There was also a yeasty smell of pepper and spearmint. I found it amazing was that there was zero alcohol smell, even at 11.3%. 

The flavor was magnificent. It tasted of smooth and creamy brown sugar and marshmallows with a dry coffee and liquorish finish that stuck to the roof of my mouth. There was also a pleasant warming in the finish. The flavor possessed a certain quality that I can only liken to jazz. It wasn’t how many notes that were played, but the quality of the notes. Fantastic! Also, there wasn’t a hint of booze in the flavor beside the warming, but my stomach warmed up none the less. Very nice. 

The mouth feel was thin that let the flavors glide together with an un-obtrusive carbonation. 

Well done!",4.3

23844,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"One of the best Belgian strong ales around. I recently sampled a 3.5 year old bottle, but to my surprise the ageing effect is not as obvious as for let?s say Chimay. Still a fantastic and complex brew. Re-rate: BB 2008, sampled 2009 (about 6 years old). Obvious aged notes, especially in aroma. However, in flavor this one seemed to be beyond its peak. Relatively thin mouthfeel. Very good beer, but i?m not convinced about its aging potential.",5.0
21309,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"It tastes really good. Pretty sweet for a brown beer. Not that common... It has a great caramel taste (they use rock sugar, candy sugar). Even a little hint of bananas.  Just by smelling it, you already want to taste it!",4.8
22485,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Ridiculously delicious. I honestly find it difficult to identify the flavours because it all seems to work so well together. Chocolate alcohol-infused plums blended with a touch of brown sugar? Maybe someone dropped a fig in there as well. Superb.,4.8
19280,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Bottle from giant eagle gahanna. Nose is smoky broth and alcohol. Wine like and very complex, with hints of smoke, dark cherry, carmelized sugar and some thick stank malt. Strong and well deserving of its high rating. Would do again for sure. $$ but worth it.",4.5
22462,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Bottle.  Pours an opaque mahogany with offwhite head that quickly dissipates.  Vanilla, grapes and raisins in the aroma.  Smells almost like a port.  Very light on the palate considering the high alcohol and very dark color.  I must have gotten a bad bottle because I expected so much more from this beer.  I was really disappointed and surprised that the complexity and intensity was not there.  I will have to definitely try this one again and rerate it.",3.5

Very intense flavor, vinous, fruity and very astonishing intense flavor of alcohol in a very nice way. It fills your mouth with its very intense flavor. Highly carbonated, makes this beer ""wandering"" about in your mouth. I was very delighted about Rochefort 8, and its bigbrother is far better. It is the bomb.

20550,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"#403
Dunkelbraun, leicht trüb mit einigen Schwebeteilchen; der Schaum ist rar und schnell fort. Ein zuerst malzig-würziges Aroma, das nach längerer Standzeit des Glases geradezu einem Dessertwein ähnelt (Mavrodaphne?). Der Antrunk ist auch einem Dessertwein ähnlich, stark und überbordend alkoholisch. Im Geschmack wird die Süße des Würzmalzes von der Hefe gut abgepuffert. Der Abgang ist primär wärmend vom Alkohol; der Hopfen kommt klar zu kurz, schade! Insgesamt ein ordentlicher Trappist, wenn ich auch -wie so oft- was dran zu nörgeln habe: Da fehlt mir ganz klar die Komplexität und Tiefe, die beispielsweise ein Orval bietet. Zwar trotz der 11,3% Alk. gut trinkbar, aber manch ""normales"" belgisches Abteibier hat eine größere Aromenvielfalt zu bieten. Vielleicht bessert sich das ja mit der B-Probe, wenn die Flaschen Rochefort im Keller ein paar Jährchen vor sich hin reifen dürfen!?

Le liquide est majestueux, onctueux, duveteux. Magnifiquement appétissant! Je reçois de profonds arômes de fruits bien mûrs comme d’un immense plateau sur lequel sont présentés pruneaux, figues, dattes, raisins noirs et myrtilles. Quelques chose qui me rappelle également la pâtisserie. En bouche, une gorgée de ce nectar suffit à graver à jamais ce magnifique tableau dans ma mémoire.

A bit of a berry roast n the nose.  Palate happy with a smooth brewed texture.  Aged quality of berries on the vine and an excellent blend of alcohol.  I drank it cold at first then let it warm up towards the end.  What a great brew and worth the wait.

Aromas of chocolate, caramel, and raisins.  Taste is, WOW!  Lightly-sweet, but not overly so, with flavors of cola, plum, and another fruit that I can’t quite put my finger on.  Has a medium body and texture.  Carbonation is pretty lively.  Finish is smooth and long with hints of brown sugar.

This is one fine beer.  The only thing I might be inclined to change would be to make it a little fuller in body.",4.4

 I return to this beer after another 1000 or so rates. I was worried I might not like it as much. No way - it’s still #1, but the Pannepot Grand Reserva is a close second....must open the Westy 12 soon.....Just phenomenol 9/4/10/5/19 4.7



Appearance is dark brown-amber with golden amber edges on glass. Pours with off white head that dissipates to a thin layer. Aroma is exceptional and complex - raisins soaked in alcohol with gentle fruit cake spices, sherry notes, hint of roast malt, dark spice sugar. The flavour enhances the aroma,  so complex and interesting, everything is blended so well with just the right amount of alcohol. Each sip brings something new - I feel as though I am drinking something antique - reminds one of the whiff of resin off old furniture (it’s not in the beer - it gives a memory of it !). The carbonation is just right, the mouthfeel rich. The finish is complex, warm and smooth with spicy hops and fruity raisin - pure nectar. This beer is incredible, so beautifully crafted and so hard to describe in words, but so wonderful.  10/4/10/5/19 4.8 [240611]",4.7

Very complex taste as well as aroma, but the fruit and berries disseapears a little in the taste, maybe because of the high level of alcohol. Tastes a bit like a mix of a belgian ale and some cherrywine. The alcohol is, as I already have indicated, quite obvious, but it doesn’t make the beer bad, just more slow to drink. The aftertaste is, maybe again because of the level of alcohol, like some sort of berries-liqueur, but after that it turns into a pleasant bitter hopping.",3.9

19702,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"This was quite a full beer, so it’s good that the bottles only contain 33 cl. While pouring the beer in the glass I could see that this would be a lively beer. With a strong carbonation the top was thick and brownish white, and the beer itself was black as a winter night. The aroma was roasty, and full of caramel, raisins and coffee, while the taste was full and strong. When drinking the beer I could taste a little bitterness, but the beer was also sweet and creamy. It surely has a full body, and with a lively carbonation and long finish I was left with a good feeling.

This is a strong beer, and with the fullness of the body I think it’s a good thing that the bottles are at the size they are. If I would have to compare it to another beer that I have tasted it must be the imperial stout, by Nøgne Ø (both the aroma and taste are similar).",4.7

3122,Westvleteren 12,"A damn near perfect beer.  The example that I tried, in celebration of finally passing Level 3 of the CFA exams, was about 5-6 years old.  The aroma was a complex mix of choclates, vanilla, stone fruits, pepper, caramel, leather and a hint of mustiness.  The flavor was less complex, but wonderfully clean and sweet on the open with a dry vinuous quality at the end.  The best part of the beer was definitely the texture.  On the palate the bubbles created a mousse-like quality that really coated the inside of your mouth.  With the wonderful acidity, it almost felt as if this was the sweetest and most concentrated Rose champagne of all time.  Magnificent beer.  Is it the best in the world?  I don’t know, but I’ll keep trying the other ones to find out.",4.7

A dry fruity caramel, whisky barrel flavored sweet coffee, vinous prunes, spices, banana. A bit of yeasties in the glass... hard to pick it out in the aroma/flavor though. Maybe its the slight dryness. Sticky mouthfeel... fizzy by the looks, but not so much in the feel (which is good). Warming in the belly... to be enjoyed slowly. Mmm.....

The aroma is boozy, fruity, bready, spicy. The appearance is hazy yet slightly translucent red/brown, fluffy off-white head.  The flavor is nice, yeasty, spicy, fruit, bread, caramel. The finish is peppery, yeasty.  Medium in body.  Waited a long time to try this.  Very nicely crafted beer, but hardly up to its hype, imho.

Aroma is of dark fruit, brown sugar, and alcohol.  Taste not as great as the aroma would indicate.  Taste is of dark fruit, strong alcohol, and a bit of acidic/medicinal bitterness.  Unless I got a bum bottle, it’s good, but not the greatest by any means.  I put St. Bernardus Abt 12 well above it.

Update: I shared the 2nd bottle I acquired in this trade last night at Kuhnhenn Winter Solstice.  It was much better than the first bottle.  Incredible aroma, and richness of taste.  So I am upping my scores to reflect this.  Great stuff!",4.4

If anyone can do it, though, I’d suspect it would be these monks.  I poured 2 bottles of this--one for myself and another for a friend of mine--and let them sit on the counter for several minutes until the head was almost settled and they were each about 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit.  

Pours dark reddish brown with a light colored head that doesn’t match the rest of the beer.  Aroma of raisins, brown sugar, and plums with a hint of caramel.

I had been looking for this beer for a while when I finally got hold of it.
Chocolaty dark and dim appearance w/ very little carbonation or head.
The aroma surprised me since I had been expecting a grand version of Rochefort 10 or something like that, that is, the aroma wasn’t very strong at all.
The flavor is wonderfully ’old’ w/ a smooth, rich bitterness and a nice burn. 
Mouthfeel was the best ever, a bit burning, very majestic if you will.""

The look is perfect, solid black body, the head that lasts all the way down. The taste is malty, fruity, so complex I was regretting not scribbling it all down. The mouthfeel is oily, solid, all very robust. The boozy kick at the end capped it off. Excellent. The only thing is, I have a cold so can hardly smell... so the 10/10 for the aroma is from the wife.

2113,Westvleteren 12,"A kezdeti benyomások egy vulkanikus erejű habkitörést követően fogalmazódhattak meg bennem, melyek közül elsőként mennyeien krémes, tejszínes aromáját említeném egy lágyan pirított, mogyorós-diós-mandulás vonallal. Páratlanul sima és visszafogott, mégis összetéveszthetetlenül egyedi. És amikor krémességet említek, azt szó szerint kell érteni. Ha valaki csak könyvekben találkozott volna még e fogalommal, tökéletesebb szemléltetés egy korty Westvleterennél nem is létezik. Szétolvad a szánkban, lágyan elterül, szinte betapasztja a szájüreg minden egyes négyzetmilliméterét. Egy rakás alkotóelem jelenlétét véljük felfedezni, a szokásos trappista összetevők mindegyikét: diófélék, datolya, szilva, mézes harapnivalók és krémlikőr éreztetik hatásukat, az eredmény azonban lenyűgözően egyedi. Valahogy egyik fázis során sem érzünk előretörő komponenst, kitüremkedő ízjegyeket, annyira szorosan kötődik egymáshoz minden egyes molekulája a sörnek, hogy az egyes kortyok hatása minden alkalommal szinte előélet nélkül és a halványulás érzetét mellőzve, egyből a lényegre térve tör elő, pár másodperces jelenéseket idézve elő a varázslatból. Mintha minden ital legjavát ötvözték volna egyetlen palackban, az alkohol, mint közös nevező remekül elrejtett ereje, a likőrök gyümölcsös krémessége, a maláta teltsége egyszerre lép a színre, majd még mielőtt megfejthetnénk, megfoghatatlan összetettségbe burkolózik. Ezen ismertető után felesleges lenne tagadni az iránta kialakult csodálatomat, melyet nem elsősorban újszerű, soha nem tapasztalt ízek parádés felvonultatása, semmint inkább a nagybetűs harmónia titokzatos létrejötte eredményez.",4.6

Tonight was the night I drank one of the two bottles. Saved them for a special occasion. But like in the movie ’Sideways’ I just popped one open. Let’s just say the other bottle is for better times ;) Opens a bit foamy. Poured the beer in a trappist glass. Deep brown colour with a good white head. Lovely aroma with raisins, caramel, malts, earth. Very complex. Taste starts smooth and creamy. Very smooth in fact. Then the above hints return. Complex yet open taste. Expected a bit more if I must say so. Think this one doesn’t stand out to the Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus 12. Anyway, very good beer. Gets better with every sip.

The aroma holds all kinds of aged fruits, brown sugar, caramel, dates, figs, raisins, plums, suggestions of oxidation, rich bread, fruit cake. Flavor is big and sweet, lots of syrupy fruits, hints of tang to the dark berries, lots of brown sugar, plums, golden raisins, dates. Full bodied with soft carbonation.

On the tongue it’s all about malty yeastiness with a fine flavour profile of currants, cherries and spiced orange peel. Palate-wise I can’t argue: it’s more or less spot-on. I can’t help feeling disappointed though. It has all the qualities I’ve come to expect from Westvleteren’s other two beers but falls well short of living up to the hype.

2731,Westvleteren 12,"I just had this beer and i have to accept it’s absolutely one of the best beers I ever tasted. Only the Sint Bernardus 12 seems to be close. The taste is very full and has a kind of wooden taste. The Westvleteren 8 is absolutely more fruity, but less exceptionnal. I absolutely recommend the beer and the website that helped me to get the beer for a good price (even if i don’t know if this is allowed in my review:

4001,Westvleteren 12,"Courtesy of Diane and CJ (thanks guys!).  They thought this was at least 2 years old but weren’t really sure.  I found it a bit thinner than I’d anticipated, I guess a byproduct of aging.  Of particular note there was little to no head here.  But the aroma, full of grapey fruitiness, promised something special.  And indeed the rich plum, fig, raisin character was especially enjoyable.  Smooth and clean.  I think this beer does benefit from its own mythology and lack of availability, but it is quite good.  (#3358, 3/28/2008)",3.8
3357,Westvleteren 12,"Bottle at pub italia- 
As expected, this is one hell of a beer. Pour is a dark brown with a quickly disappating off white head. The aroma was extremely complex, with dark fruit present. Apples also, figs and molasses. The taste was equally complex. Not overly boozy, considering. Great beer, definitely worth a try, but I think I’d rather have 3 rochefort 10s for the price.",4.5
3906,Westvleteren 12,"Big thanks to Jason for this one.  Pours brown with a little slightly off-white head.  Nothing too special to look at.

This one was much more complex and balanced. Will store my bottles for some time.",4.3
1399,Westvleteren 12,"Living up to the hype, it is in many ways a perfect beer. The perfection begins with the bottle without any label. Its an arrogant and bold move that indicate quality.

I always find myself comparing this IPA to that, this Imperial Stout to that, this Barleywine to that.  This beer is a category of its own and it’s time to get some more.",4.9
3200,Westvleteren 12,"This bottle was courtesy of lotsaswigs (thanks Eric!) at DLD. The bottle was from ’08. It poured a dark raisin brown, very cloudy, with a light cream colored head. The head was ultimately smooth and creamy and sat atop the brew in such a delicate manner. It looked exceptional! The aromas consisted of a lot of yeast, bananas, cloves, freshly baked bread, and it had a sweet and dry malty finish. The flavors were very full and consisted of bananas, yeast, freshly baked bread, and some type of nut (hazelnut perhaps). It was simply delicious. It was very full in body and quite thick. It was also exceptionally smooth. Wow, this is hands down the best Quad I’ve ever had. What an amazing beer. Thanks again Eric!",4.5

Taste is full of rich dark fruits, some roastiness, power of alcohol without taste, sourness and dry herbs. Overally, the taste is surprisingly dry. Full bodied, lots of smooth carbonation. Powerfull, dark and dry fruits with sourness and herbs. This bottle is too young and raw, smoothness, sophistication and harmony are currently missing with this bottle, but the potential is there.

Amazingly Smooth mouthfeel with a very pleasant coating of the palette and only a slight alcohol burn going down. Have to reiterate the smoothness here. Only traces of bitterness, dark soda bread, leather, and then a earthy umami finish.

The smell is dirt-like with hints of alcohol, raisin, yeast, and that Belgian horse-hair flavor common in many.  Flavor has some sweet dark candy sugar up front with a raisin/plum flavor coming in later. Very warming as the alcohol hits you pretty quick but is not overwhelming in the aftertaste as a sweetness re-enters.

1000,Westvleteren 12,"When I was young I did drink this beer almost every week. You could still buy as many crates as you liked. Now it became a kind of cult, phone the beer line, pay in advance etc. It's a great beer, but not in my top 20. I live the first impression full body, light sweet but not too sweet. I can't really describe it, but the after tastes reminds me vaguely about fermantated/ too ripe banana and that spoils it for me. The banana taste is also present in Stift Engelszell Gregorius Trappistenbier, one of the most disappointing Trappist beers. Most beers in my top 10 are at least 200 years on the market and all new Trappist beers lack something. St. Berbardus Abt 12 is in my opinion a good alternative if you like the aftertaste of Westvleteren 12 and the story that the yeast was stolen could be true. Both beers have a unique after taste...",4.0

Palate is medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, finishes sweet and slightly warming.   This is definitely a great beer, though the experience is not worth the price of admission.

Exceptional balance with no single flavour seeming to dominate and the beer going down far easier that a 10.2% beer should do. Despite the hefty price tag, this one was worth every penny & is definitely one I’ll be trying to find again, it was that good.",4.9
3253,Westvleteren 12,"Brown black with a plush beige head that stands for an hour. Aroma is dark fruits, banana with mild clove, and taste is the same, with raisins and light caramel, with alcohol bite almost completely absent. Mouthfeel is fantastic, because the head stays in place, but contributes to the velvety body as you drink, like a fine espresso crema. The example I had was young, but totally interchangeable with St Bernardus, and I may even prefer the latter.  €12 (#1300 7/7/’11)",4.2
3476,Westvleteren 12,"Review #500. Received from Raznug for as a BA Secret Santa Gift! Thought it would be appropriate to review the #1 rated beer in the world with this landmark review. Poured into my Chimay Chalice.

A- Body is a very hazy dark brown color. Pours with a minimally creamy off white head. Head subsides to a thick half-moon collar with no collar around half of it and an eggshell creamy remnants of the head in the center. When held up to the light one can see the thick, dynamic cloudiness of this brew.

S- The overall impression of the nose is slightly sweet. Raisins, figs, root beer, cola, grapes, plums are mostly upfront and have a background of slightly spicy Belgian yeast and a very subtle, sneaky alcohol background.

T-The initial flavors are exquisite and balanced. A perfect bland of spicy Belgian yeast, fig, malt, and and dark fruits such as sweet raisins and slightly tart plum mix perfectly and give off a root beer and cola-like flavor. The spicy yeast comes through a little more for the finish as well as a slight bitter alcohol bite. The flavor then turns around and ends with a sweet fruity note. A slight essence of spicy Belgian yeast lingers. Flavor is wonderful and complex.

P-Medium carbonation and wonderfully smooth and creamy body. Yeasty and smooth but with a touch of alcohol astringency.

O-This is a wonderful quadruple and it was truly and honor to try it. As far as pure drinkability is concerned; it is definitely a slow sipper. This, and other good examples of the style, IMO,are meant to be slipped slowly as you contemplate the complexity of what was produced. The ABV is quite noticeable and if you don’t take your time with this brew you surely won’t get a chance to appreciate it. Due to its $ and availability, its a beer that was definitely worth it for the first try/review but I will reserve obtaining it again for a VERY special occasion. A bit overrated (Its hard to be a perfect beer across the board)-but still an excellent, stand-out, well put together brew.

3333,Westvleteren 12,"Drink by date of 9/3/2005 date on the cap. Pours a dark brown, lots of carbonation and thin quick fading off-white head. Aroma started to emanate out of the bottle as soon as the seal was broken on the cap. Aroma is very complex with a strong estery nose composed of a mild banana presence, a mild toasted malt and caramel sweetness, lots of Belgian candy sugar sweetness, very low liquorish and raisin with an almost cookie like finish to the nose. Flavor is fantastic! Strong candy sweetness up front with a mild smooth toasted malt in the middle. Light notes of banana and a complex estery flavor are also in there. Smooth brown sugar, light raisin with a very long lasting combo of caramel and sugar finish. Body is pretty heavy and holds a lot of residual sugar feeling. Carbonation is very high and keeps the brew pretty lively. Overall - first and foremost I have to say thanks to JMerritt for this brew. I did have some reservations in trying this beer as it comes with such lofty expectations that I thought it would be difficult for the beer to meet what I have read and heard. It definitely did not disappoint. The quality and attention to details form Westvleteren shows. Aromas don’t overpower but do give the brew a very intense quality not seen in too many beers. The flavor is complex, well balanced and provides a full range of tastes throughout th drink. Just an awesome  beer and one I will look forward to having again at some point this lifetime.

Sweet, but tempered caramel taste with  darkish brown murky color.  Extremely complex in flavor, nose and palate. It has a smatter of four or five styles of beer  (as far as alcohol, taste and bitterness and balance): smooth then spicey and sweet then bitter on the tail; well balanced with hidden alcohol.  I guess hundreds of years of perfected brewing and high standards will do that for a beer.  Hard to get a hold of and very expensive, but well worth the investment.  If you get a chance to go to Belgium I highly recommend you make the trek and by a few cases to bring home.  Heaven in a bottle.  The best balanced as far as alcohol and taste.
