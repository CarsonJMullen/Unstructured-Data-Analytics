Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know As Ex-PM Calls For Strikes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/08/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-as-ex-pm-calls-for-strikes/,2024-10-08T21:39:57Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel, as a former Israeli prime minister argues for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel and Iran are archrivals with a history of terse relations dating back to Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. A corresponding decades-long shadow war -- fueled by Iran's years of supporting Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah and Islamist militant group Hamas -- has become a direct conflict as tensions spiked in recent years, particularly after Hamas' attack on Israel last year and Israel's intense invasion of Gaza. Israel -- alongside the U.S. and the U.N. -- has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Israel has spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected missions like stealing nuclear secrets, sabotaging explosions and launching drone attacks. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused the country of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grade nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

While hitting it would be viewed as a major escalation, Israel has long watched Iran's nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, an enrichment facility buried in the desert with thousands of centrifuges, according to the New York Times. Other facilities, like the enrichment plant buried under a mountain in Fordow, represent another potential target, yet U.S. officials have historically blocked Israel from getting the bomber planes and weapons powerful enough for an attack so deep underground, The Times reports. But Israel's methods have used other methods than bombings or missile attacks. Israel has a strong cyberdefense program -- exhibited recently when it launched an attack that exploded wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members. Another attack believed to be from the U.S. and Iran happened in the early 2000s -- called ""Olympic Games"" and known commonly the Stuxnet virus -- was a cyberattack that used digital ""worms"" to disrupt Natanz's facility operations.

Matthew Bunn, a professor of energy, national security and foreign policy at Harvard, told Forbes that there would be no nuclear fallout, or spreading of radioactive material, from attacking a uranium enrichment facility like Natanz or Fordow. These facilities deal with uranium that has not been irradiated in a nuclear reactor, meaning it's less radioactive. In an attack, some areas may suffer ecological damage, but the result would be isolated to the limited quantity of uranium at the locations, he said.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump was incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."" Trump said on Oct. 4 at a campaign event in North Carolina that Israel should ""hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later."" When asked in a 60 Minutes interview on Oct.7, Vice President Kamala Harris responded that Iran was the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary."
Islamic group calls out Jets for firing Robert Saleh after wearing Lebanon pin amid Israel war,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/islamic-group-calls-out-jets-firing-robert-saleh-after-wearing-lebanon-pin-amid-israel-war,2024-10-08T21:12:39Z,"Emmanuel Acho reacts to the New York Jets firing HC Robert Saleh after a 20-36 record and 2-3 start this season.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a statement on Tuesday addressing the firing of former New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh.

CAIR called on the Jets and owner Woody Johnson to explain reports that Saleh was escorted out of the building by security following his firing, and also brought up the fact that Saleh was fired just days after wearing a pin with the Lebanese flag amid ongoing attacks on the nation by Israel.

Saleh is of Lebanese descent and was the first Muslim head coach in NFL history.

""We commend Coach Robert Saleh for making history as the first American Muslim head coach in NFL history. Although no one should jump to conclusions about why the Jets fired Coach Saleh, the report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility -- especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks. We encourage the Jets to thoroughly explain its unusually hostile reported treatment of Coach Saleh,"" the statement read.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Jets for comment multiple times but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Both of Saleh's parents were born in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States ahead of his birth in 1979. Saleh previously wore the Lebanese flag on his arm during a game against the Giants, just weeks after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Saleh wore that patch during the week that NFL executive vice president of club business Peter O'Reilly released a statement encouraging players to represent their heritage via decals to the back of their helmets with their flags, while coaches added a patch to their team gear.

Saleh's decision to wear the patch in London on Sunday came amid Israel's ongoing strikes on Lebanon and Gaza as it seeks to combat Hamas and Hezbollah.

CAIR's point that Johnson ""has been accused of making racially charged remarks,"" references an investigation in 2020 that never confirmed whether Johnson made those remarks. Johnson was accused of making racist and sexist comments to staff while serving as an ambassador to the United Kingdom under the Trump administration. Johnson was investigated in July 2020 by the State Department watchdog after the allegations.

Johnson denied the allegations in a post on the official X (then known as Twitter) account for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. that same month.

""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times. These false claims of insensitive remarks about race and gender are totally inconsistent with my longstanding record and values,"" Johnson wrote.

The investigation's findings have never been made public.

At the time, Johnson was not involved with the Jets, as he was tending to his diplomatic duties for Trump. Still, the Jets released a statement regarding the allegations against Johnson and noted his denial of them.

""Since the Johnson family became owners of the New York Jets, the organization has consistently and actively supported, engaged and encouraged the development of many different social justice, diversity, women's, and inclusion initiatives,"" the team said in a statement. ""One of our fundamental principles is treating employees, players, coaches and fans with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, color, religion, or gender. These principles have been established by the Johnson family, which Woody implemented in our organization over the past 20 years.""

Saleh was hired by the Jets in January 2021 while Johnson was in the final month of his duties as ambassador to the U.K. Therefore, the owner did not make the final decision to hire Saleh. It was Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, who made the decision to hire Saleh.

When Trump left office and Woody Johnson returned to his duties as Jets owner, he kept Saleh employed for three straight seasons, none of which resulted in trips to the playoffs or winning records. Saleh went 20-36 with New York and never won more than seven games a year while at the helm.

Then, when Saleh was fired on Tuesday, the coach was reportedly escorted out of the team facility by security, according to multiple reports. The most recent head coach to be fired by the Jets, Adam Gase, was fired after the conclusion of his second season and was reportedly not removed by security.

The Jets were off to a 2-3 start this year after losing to the Minnesota Vikings 23-17 in London on Sunday, as New York is among the most penalized teams in the league this year. The Jets have struggled this year despite veteran star quarterback Aaron Rodgers starting all five games this season."
Prospects of a deal with Israel fade away as Saudis invite Iranian foreign minister to visit,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-foreign-minister-saudi-arabia-deal-israel,2024-10-08T20:45:15Z,"One year ago, Saudi Arabia and Israel were supposedly on the brink of a deal to normalize relations.

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

9/11 FAMILIES URGE TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""
Two Jewish Democrats reflect on Congressional efforts to combat surge in antisemitism,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5125793/jewish-democrats-antisemitism-congress,2024-10-08T20:41:44Z,"Reps. Jared Moskowitz, Kathy Manning, Josh Gottheimer, and Dan Goldman speak at a press conference in April about allegations of harassment and antisemitism against Jewish students at Columbia University. Stefan Jeremiah/AP/FR171756 AP hide caption

As Congress continues to deal with the policy and political implications of Hamas' attack on southern Israel one year ago, lawmakers are also reflecting on the rise of antisemitism in the United States.

Jewish Americans represent about 2 percent of the population and were the target of 16 percent of hate crimes in 2023 - a surge of over 60 percent from the year before, according to the FBI's hate crime statistics report. Current figures are likely higher, given reports that anti-Jewish animus has been higher since Oct. 7 and the report only captures a few months of data post-attack.

North Carolina Rep. Kathy Manning and Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz, two Jewish Democratic lawmakers, are working to address the issue despite political divisions within Congress and their own party.

""There's been a change in this country from, you know, the swastika on a wall that happened once in a while or someone being accosted on the street once in a while to the point where you can't even keep up with all the antisemitic attacks that are going on,"" Moskowitz said.

Manning, who co-chairs the House bipartisan task force for combatting antisemitism, said she's been tracking the rise in anti-Jewish hate over the last year.

""I think it's important to remember the attacks began before Israel had any response, before they sent any troops into Gaza,"" she said. ""We saw people being threatened. We saw violent language used against Jews. And, of course, we've seen the eruption of antisemitic behavior on college campuses across the country.""

The rise in demonstrations on college campuses last spring was the subject of various committee hearings in the halls of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought a Republican delegation to visit Columbia University. Manning and Moskowitz were part of a separate visit with Jewish Democratic lawmakers.

""We didn't go to Columbia because we had a problem with students protesting. They have every right to protest,"" said Moskowitz. ""We went to Columbia because Jewish students were afraid to go to school.""

Protesters on campuses maintained their aim was to show public support for the people in Gaza and to demand their universities divest from companies with ties to Israel.

""We've always been told that you can be anti-Zionist without being antisemitic. And I would say that you could. As it turns out, they're just not,"" Moskowitz said. ""And the reason why is they're not surrounding Israeli students going to class. They're surrounding a kid wearing a Jewish star going to class. They don't know his position on Israel. Maybe he's anti-Israel, but he's Jewish.""

He said the protests highlighted the need for Congress to step in.

""If what was happening on college campuses were not about Jews, if people in hoods were encircling Black kids, blocking them from class, or some right-wing extremist group was targeting the LGBT kids, we don't believe it would have gotten past lunchtime on the first day,"" Moskowitz said. ""We believe Congress would have acted.""

Congress has taken steps over the last year in response to rising antisemitism but there are ongoing divisions about what elements are most important to address at the federal level and which policies will actually lead to solutions.

In May, the House passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would see the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism when reviewing complaints of discrimination in programs that receive federal financial assistance. The bill goes further than an executive order former President Donald Trump signed in 2019 and opponents say it could restrict free speech. The measure has not been taken up by the Senate.

Manning spent nine months with House colleagues and counterparts in the Senate negotiating what she calls the ""most comprehensive bill"" on antisemitism that incorporates the guidance outlined in the Biden administration's national strategy to counter antisemitism. The result is the Countering Antisemitism Act, which would establish a position in the White House to coordinate federal efforts to counter antisemitism across various agencies and to conduct a study that analyzes the prevalence of online antisemitic content. The bill would also appoint a senior official within the Department of Education to be responsible for addressing antisemitism on college campuses.

That bill has yet to be brought to the floor for a vote by Republican leadership.

Moskowitz says the issue more broadly has highlighted what he calls schisms within his own party.

""It was real easy for Democrats, right, when it was just [GOP Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about Jewish space lasers to go call her out, or easy when Tucker Carlson has a Holocaust denier on his show to call him out,"" Moskowitz said. ""I didn't see the same level of interest on calling out the antisemitism when it was within your own tent.""

He said Democratic lawmakers weren't unified in their condemnation of some of the violent language being used on campuses.

""As soon as they saw there was division in our party, the Republicans jumped right in from a political issue, from a fundraising issue, and wanted to drive that wedge. We made it easy for them to do that, by the way, when there are people protesting in front of college campuses saying, 'go back to Poland, kill all the Zionists.' And like several of my progressive members are like, 'Oh, look, it's raining today.'

Manning said the events of the past year have brought Jewish members in the House closer together but support from colleagues has been uneven.

""What I have experienced is not antisemitism from my colleagues, but willful ignorance of what so many of us are experiencing,"" she said.

Moskowitz agreed.

""A lot of other members are scared to step out because they don't want to get targeted,"" he said. ""They don't want to get protested in their district and don't want police in front of their house, which I have 24-hours a day.""

He said that police protection began within weeks of October 7, based on death threats against him and his children, ages 7 and 10.

""It's not a pleasant time to be Jewish at the moment,"" he said. ""Almost every Jewish member has this story. My grandparents were Holocaust survivors. And there are bits and pieces of stories my grandmother's told me that are repeating themselves. Different - not the same, but similar threats. And Jews see and feel that. So we'll have to see what the new Congress wants to do. The schisms that exist on this issue are still going to exist.""

Manning adds she hears from Jews across the country worrying about what the future holds, and asking if Congress can help.

""I think so many Jews, particularly of my generation and older, carry all of those stories on their shoulders -- the history of the Crusades, and the Inquisition, and the pogroms and the Holocaust. When I talk to people about what the difference is today is all those other disasters that happened to the Jews were perpetrated by the governments of those countries. What's happening today in the United States, not only is it not perpetrated by our government, our government is trying to put into place structures to combat that antisemitism,"" she said. ""And that's the thing that gives me hope moving forward."""
"Trump says Gaza 'could be better than Monaco,' but 'they never took advantage of it'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gaza-better-than-monaco-israel-hugh-hewitt-rcna174475,2024-10-08T20:25:45Z,"Trump also claimed he has been to Gaza. An aide later suggested that visiting Israel counted because ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Donald Trump said that Gaza ""could be one of the best places in the world"" -- better even, he said, ""than Monaco"" and lamented that people ""never took advantage of it.""

In an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump said: ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,"" referring to the Palestinian territory, which has been bombarded relentlessly by the Israeli military for the past 12 months, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

""They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place -- the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,"" he said.

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Jewish Democrats and denigrated Palestinians while claiming to be Israel's staunchest ally, said that Gaza was ""a rough place ... before all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth of what's happened over the last couple of years."" The Republican presidential nominee also claimed that he had visited Gaza, despite there being no record of him doing so, as president or otherwise.

Afterward, a Trump campaign official given anonymity by The New York Times said that Trump has been to Israel, stating incorrectly that ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Trump's estimation of the real estate potential of the Gaza Strip echoes that of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who said in an interview with the faculty chair of Harvard's Middle East Initiative in February that ""Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable."" Kushner also suggested that, if he were in charge, he would ""try to move people"" from Rafah, in the south of Gaza, into the Negev desert, ""so you can go in and finish the job"" of eliminating Hamas.

Trump's comments speak to how he might approach the fraught and widening tensions in the Middle East if he wins the election. They are also deeply disconnected from the realities of life in Gaza under Israel's extensive blockade and what human rights experts have called the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. After Hamas assumed governance of Gaza in 2007, Israel removed its military presence and swiftly imposed an air, sea and land blockade. Israel has largely controlled who enters and leaves the Strip; severely limited the import and export of food, medical supplies, infrastructure materials and commercial goods; violently restricted access along the coast of Gaza; and cut off access to farmland. Before the current war, two-thirds of the population in Gaza was supported by food assistance.

Multiple conflicts between Hamas and Israel over the years have exacerbated those issues. Israel's current war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' attack killed 1,200 people in October 2023, has displaced more than 90% of the population in the Strip, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say at least 41,000 people have been killed."
Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-iran-biggest-us-adversary-china,2024-10-08T19:40:49Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told the women of ABC's 'The View' that she would put a greater emphasis on small businesses and crimes against women and children.

Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said the regime is America's biggest foe.

In a sit-down with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.""

""This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""

Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.

""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,"" she told Bill Whitaker.

The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows -- as China is thought by many to be foe No. 1.

""Iran is our biggest adversary, not China?,"" Mary Kissel, former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America's greatest adversary rather than China,"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.

""Really? It's not Russia? It's not China? A middle power is America's greatest adversary?"" Iranian nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.

Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel -- at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,"" she said.

Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,"" asserting it is ""without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""

Still, she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She added, ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

""China is the far greater threat just about, I think, everyone's estimation,"" said Rob Greenway, a former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as a threat, then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""

Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctions on Iran, which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period,"" and prompted the turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

During a rally last week, Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets from oil sales.

""If they have somebody who was kidnapped, it's always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump said. ""Somebody else gets like $4,000.""

Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on Monday.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But ""it's not enforcing any sanctions,"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion per year from oil sales.

Last week, Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv, many of them intercepted by both Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran's proxies have long attacked both Israeli and U.S. postures, it was the regime's first direct attack on Israel since April.

Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S. administration,"" Greenway said.

HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE

The Trump administration's policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""

After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran, the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb to 7,000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear weapon.) It went from exporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump administration's harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.

Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

Last week, Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was ""proportional,"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'"""
Opinion | A tit-for-tat war with Israel will not turn out well for Iran,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-regret-attack-israel-missiles-hezbollah-rcna174375,2024-10-08T18:37:58Z,"Last week, and for the second time this year, Iran launched a missile strike against Israel. This one, however, the military equivalent of poking a sleeping bear, is likely to provoke a fearsome Israeli response.

Iran's first direct attack in April, which targeted non-civilian areas and was telegraphed in advance, looked more like a demonstration project than a serious strike. It was Tehran's response to Israel assassinating a top Iranian general in Syria, but it appears to have been purposely narrowed to prevent a significant Israeli retaliation. Israel delivered a token response (attacking a single long-range air defense system) and, at least for a time, the threat of greater escalation diminished.

Last week's strike, a response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (a close ally of Iran) in a southern suburb of Beirut was qualitatively different. Iran fired missiles directly at civilian areas of Tel Aviv -- and sent millions of terrified Israelis into their safe rooms.

From a military standpoint, the Iranian attack accomplished little. While it caused some damage to targeted intelligence and military bases, there were few civilian casualties (A Palestinian man in Jericho died in the attacks, and two people were injured in Tel Aviv). More important, it barely put a dent in Israel's military capabilities.

According to Yonatan Touval, a foreign policy analyst at Mitvim, an Israeli think tank, ""Iran might have thought this was a measured strike it could get away with, and that at worst would provoke a symbolic counter-strike. But Israel perceives this differently and will likely launch a major retaliatory strike.""

As a geographically small country, deterrence has long been an essential element of Israel's strategic mindset. It has generally responded with disproportionate military force to acts of war. The response to Iran's missile attack will likely be no different. Touval said, ""Israel cannot let this pass if it is to reestablish deterrence and convey the message that it is not a sitting duck waiting to be hit at will.""

As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, Oct. 8, ""Iran made a big mistake tonight -- and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.""

But there's another consideration for Israel's leaders. For years, Israel has wanted to launch a military strike on Iran to diminish or even out wipe out the country's nuclear program. Successive U.S. administrations have consistently discouraged Israel from doing so. Indeed, the attention devoted to the Iranian nuclear program -- and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 by the Obama administration -- was motivated, in large measure, by a desire to avoid a conflict between Israel and Iran that could potentially drag in the United States.

But with last week's strike, Iran handed Israel a casus belli and legal basis for an attack, and the U.S. will be hard-pressed to stop Israel from responding. While it will be difficult for Israel to hit Iran's nuclear targets without direct U.S. involvement, one can imagine significant Israeli attacks on Iran's military and even economic infrastructure in an effort to humiliate the regime in Tehran.

So why did Iran do it?

Iran's decision-making seems to have been influenced not by military considerations but by reputational ones. Nayyera Haq noted last week in an MSNBC column that ""despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage.""

To be sure, Iran was in a difficult situation, but it was one it created. For a year, Iran has supported Hezbollah as it, unprovoked, sent thousands of rockets and missiles into Northern Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Perhaps Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran believed that Israel would not aggressively respond (yet another deadly miscalculation). But once Israel launched a major military attack, taking out Nasrallah and most of Hezbollah's leadership, and employed an audacious attack in which it blew up pagers that killed and wounded thousands of Hezbollah fighters, Iran's choices went from bad to worse.

""Doing nothing"" in response to the killing of Nasrallah would send a message that Israel could bloody its nose with no repercussions. But ""doing something"" risked unleashing another Israeli military strike. Iran chose the latter course -- and by doing so likely made a huge strategic error. Provoking a much stronger military rival is never a good idea. Iran has now opened the door to a military retaliation that will likely cause significant physical damage and could, ironically, undermine the regime in the eyes of Iranian civilians. What has Iran's expansionist foreign policy, support for terrorist networks and nuclear program brought the country other than economic devastation -- and now likely physical pain?

Iran's leaders likely believed they had no choice but to ""do something,"" but their apparent failure to fully consider how the missile strike would be viewed in Israel -- and the potential ramifications -- has put a target squarely on the country's back.

The same is true of Israel, it must be said. Any military response to last week's attack will need to be calibrated in order to prevent significant escalation. Ever since then-President Donald Trump foolishly pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, there has been no international monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. So it's impossible to know how far along Iran is in producing the fissile material necessary to construct a nuclear weapon. While it's highly unlikely that Iran is close to having a nuke that it can actually deliver, Israel may still want to tread lightly for fear of pushing Iran's leader into a desperate position.

Still, that doesn't mean Israel will sit this one out. Iran has provoked a far stronger military rival that has been itching at the chance to attack them. The consquences will be dire."
Netanyahu confirms Nasrallah's replacement dead: 'Thousands of terrorists' killed,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-confirms-nasrallahs-replacement-dead-thousands-terrorists-killed,2024-10-08T17:43:32Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Hezbollah's intended replacement of its former leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed late last month, has also been ""taken out.""

""Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years,"" Netanyahu said in a message tailored directly to the ""people of Lebanon.""

""We've degraded Hezbollah's capabilities, we took out thousands of terrorists, including [former Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of his replacement.""

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE HAS 'VERY LOW' TRUST IN NETANYAHU REGIME, URGES TRANSPARENCY: REPORT

Netanyahu said Iran has ""conquered"" Lebanon to ensure Hezbollah serves Tehran's interests in the region by turning it into a ""stockpile of ammunition and weapons"" serving as a pseudo ""Iranian military base"" on Israel's border.

""Now you, the Lebanese people, you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice,"" he continued. ""You can now take back your country. You can return it to a path of peace and prosperity.""

""If you don't, Hezbollah will continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense,"" the prime minister added. ""Free your country from Hezbollah.""

Netanyahu did not explicitly say what it would take to stop Israeli strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but earlier on Tuesday the group's deputy leader Naim Qassem suggested he may be open to a cease-fire without the inclusion of Gaza in the negotiations.

Netanyahu's announcement regarding the death of Hashem Safieddine, who sat as the head of Hezbollah's executive council and was most likely slated to be the group's next leader, comes as Israeli forces expanded their incursion westward along the border in Lebanon.

1 YEAR AFTER HEZBOLLAH STRIKES, ISRAEL REINFORCES TROOPS AND QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER 'LIMITED' OPERATION

Though Safieddine was not as well-known as Nasrallah, who served as the leader of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, his close ties to Iran and his outspoken behavior following the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7,2023 cemented him as a top target of Jerusalem's.

It is not clear how or where Safieddine was allegedly killed, though the announcement of his death followed an update provided by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) which said ""hundreds of terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" since the 98th Brigade first entered Lebanon last week.

The brigade, which is made up of paratroopers, commandos as well as top soldiers of the 7th Brigade and the Yahalom Unit, has been targeting and dismantling Hezbollah strongholds, weapons depots and tunnel routes used by Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces near the border with Israel.

The IDF has said it will carry out a ""limited, localized, targeted"" operation in Lebanon, but as Israeli forces continue to hit Hezbollah strongholds well north of the border including the capital city of Beirut, concerns are mounting that Lebanon could see similar destruction to that caused in Gaza, with one U.N. official referring to the strategy of bombardment as the ""spiral of doom,"" reported multiple outlets Tuesday.

Internally displaced people from southern Lebanon have been pouring into Beirut following Israel's increase in strikes three weeks ago, followed by the incursion earlier this month.

Beirut mayor Abdallah Darwich urged a cease-fire to be reached between Hezbollah and Israel and told the BBC on Tuesday there was ""no safe place in Beirut,"" warning that the capital city had reached the ""limit of its tolerance.""

""You do not know who is living in this building or that building, so you do not know if there is a target there,"" he said. ""You can no longer say Beirut is safe. Where the next Israeli target is, nobody knows.""

Roughly 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel escalated last month. More than 400,000 people have fled Lebanon into Syria, and roughly 1,400 have been killed based on numbers provided by the Lebanese Health Ministry and the number of combatants believed to have been killed by Israel. Some 70,000 Israelis have been forced out of the country's northern communities since the start of the conflict."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
"Biden White House has 'very low' trust in Netanyahu regime, urges transparency: report",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-white-house-warns-very-low-trust-netanyahu-regime-demands-transparency-report,2024-10-08T14:45:33Z,"Israel's air defense systems have been under pressure since Oct. 7 last year as the country fights a multi-front war against Iran and its proxies. (COURTESY: IDF Spokesman's Unit)

The Biden-Harris administration has privately warned of ""very low"" trust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's regime following several Israeli strikes the U.S. was not warned about, Axios reported Tuesday.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan reportedly told Israeli officials that the U.S. expects ""clarity and transparency"" about Israel's plans, specifically regarding any retaliation against Iran for last week's missile attack.

""Our trust of the Israelis is very low right now and for a good reason,"" one U.S. official told the outlet.

The report comes after weeks of the Biden-Harris administration growing more and more willing to criticize Netanyahu's regime. They have repeatedly stated that they support Israel's right to defend itself, however.

Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she thought the administration had influence over Netanyahu in an interview this week.

CBS' Bill Whitaker asked Harris about why Netanyahu seemed to be ""charting his own course,"" despite the billions of dollars of military aid the U.S. has provided to Israel. ""Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" he asked.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.

""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" Harris responded.

Trump picks an odd time to ignore the GOP's antisemitism problem,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picks-odd-time-ignore-gops-antisemitism-problem-rcna174455,2024-10-08T13:57:55Z,"The presidential candidate wasn't just wrong to pretend the Republican Party doesn't have an antisemitism problem. He also had incredibly bad timing.

Like many prominent political figures, Donald Trump recognized the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel. What was notable, however, was the Trumpian way in which he honored the day. The New York Times reported:

""The anti-Jewish hatred has returned even here in America, in our streets, our media and our college campuses and within the ranks of the Democrat [sic] Party in particular, not in the Republican Party, I will tell you,"" the former president said at an event held at one of his resorts.

Trump added: ""The Republican Party has not been infected by this horrible disease. And hopefully it won't be. It won't be as long as I'm in charge, I can tell you that.""

The rhetoric was obviously ugly and false, but it was also poorly timed.

As Trump pretended that the GOP doesn't have an antisemitism problem, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia continued to insist, over and over again, that ""they"" have a secret ability to ""control the weather"" -- and as my MSNBC colleague Ja'han Jones explained, ""Greene didn't specify whether 'they' are Jewish in this weather control scenario, but such claims about people nefariously controlling the weather have documented links to antisemitic conspiracy theories.""

A few days earlier, Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee thought it'd be a good idea to condemn George Soros as a ""money changer of the worst kind.""

It came against a backdrop in which the public learned that North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, allegedly described himself as a ""Nazi"" and praised Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf.""

Let's not forget far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, who received a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention, who recently interviewed and praised a Holocaust revisionist, and who nevertheless remains close with the party's presidential ticket.

And then, of course, there's Trump himself, who, just a few weeks ago, publicly suggested that he intends to blame Jews, at least in part, if he loses the 2024 race. A month earlier, after seeing Gov. Josh Shapiro's remarks at the Democratic National Convention, the former president decided to take a rhetorical shot at his critic. The Pennsylvania Democrat, the former president wrote online, is a ""highly overrated Jewish Governor.""

In context, there was no reason for the Republican to reference Shapiro's faith. Trump did it anyway.

It was not an isolated incident. As regular readers might recall, it was earlier this year when Trump also invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel.

It was part of a larger pattern. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, ""You're not gonna support me because I don't want your money. You want to control your politicians."" He added, ""I'm a negotiator -- like you folks.""

Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met ""in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.""

While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their ""loyalties."" Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council's national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign.

There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, ""Jews will not replace us.""

After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters ""don't love Israel enough,"" dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago, and arguing that Jews need to ""get their act together"" and ""appreciate"" Israel ""before it is too late.""

In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders ""should be ashamed of themselves"" over their ""lack of loyalty."" Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker.

And yet, there was Trump on the anniversary of Oct. 7, boasting that he'll ensure that his party isn't ""infected"" by antisemitism. What a relief that must be to the Jewish community."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
Morning Glory: Trump stands with Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-trump-stands-israel,2024-10-08T09:13:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump agreed to an interview on the first anniversary of the horrific massacre and mass kidnapping in Israel on October 7, 2023. The focus was primarily on Israel of course, but also on the explosion of antisemitism in the United States.

HH: Now Mr. President, when we spoke in April, you said to me that Israel needed to win and win quickly. They are winning, but they're still fighting, and they're now fighting in Lebanon. Do you think Biden and Harris have been holding back Israel from winning?

DT: I do. I think everything they do is the opposite. In particular, him. Now she's a dumber person than him, but he has the worst foreign policy of anybody in history, probably. You know what you do with him? I realized it the other day. You could be one of the greatest foreign policy presidents. All you do is listen to what he says and do the opposite. If you've done the opposite for 30 years with this poor guy, this poor, pathetic guy, if you've done the opposite for 30 years, you would have been successful. But he's never gotten it right. And you know, I don't have to go back into the old secretaries of state and all the people that talk about it.

HH: If Israel hits [Iran's] nuclear sites, will you applaud?

DT: Yeah. I dealt with Kim Jong-un. And he has nuclear weapons. And you tend to speak a little bit differently when they have nuclear weapons.

HH: Yes.

DT: Does that make sense to you?

HH: Yes, it does. Well, Nixon met with Mao, who was the greatest murderer of the 20th Century, because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.

DT: Right.

HH: I noticed you didn't meet with Khamenei, and he did not have nukes. Can they be allowed to have nukes?

DT: No, they can't have nukes. No, they can't have nukes. Nukes, if you would see the power of these weapons that I renovated and rebuilt at great cost, I rebuilt the whole military. And then, you know, they gave $85 billion of it away to the Taliban and to Afghanistan. Can you imagine? They gave $85 billion dollars away. They gave everything. This is the worst group of people, these are the worst negotiators in history.

Exchange three:

HH: Let me turn to antisemitism in the United States. Your daughter is Jewish. Some of your grandchildren are Jewish. Your son-in-law is Jewish. Jewish students are not safe on many American campuses. Your alma mater, my alma mater, Biden and Harris have ignored this. I mean, they really have ignored it. If you're president, will you send the DOJ to those campuses, the office of Civil Rights from the Department of Education to enforce the law?

DT: 100%. I mean, the law is being broken. 100%. You wouldn't think you'd even have this. Did you ever think two years ago, three years ago, that you'd ever have this discussion?

HH: No, I didn't.

DT: I'm unbelievable what's happening. And when you see these riots, and you see a lot of people, too. But you know, a lot of the people in that, a lot of those people are Jewish people. You know that. They're Jewish kids.

HH: Oh, yeah. There are some outliers, but most Jewish students are afraid to be overt on places like Harvard and Penn.

DT: Yeah, but then you have other Jewish students that are afraid. Yeah, that's true, and they should be afraid. I never thought I would see this in my life with the campus riots and what they're saying and what they're doing. And they have to put them down quickly. They really have to put them down quickly.

Some pro-Israel Americans would prefer that zero attention be given to the outliers, but as the excellent Commentary Magazine podcast occasionally mentions the insidiousness of Jewish Americans attacking Israel and defending, implicitly or even explicitly, Hamas, then it should not be shocking when the former president notices it too.

I highlight these three exchanges because the result in November's election will reverberate around the world but most especially in Israel.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

It seems clear to me that a President Kamala Harris will be the least supportive American president of the Jewish State in Israel's 76-year history.

By contrast, the argument is solid that Trump in his first term was at least the equal of any previous president when it comes to a record of support for Israel in peacetime. (Richard Nixon ordering the Pentagon to ""send everything that can fly"" to Israel in an arms resupply during the 1973 Yom Kippur War is the sole example of when an American president stepped up at a moment of existential peril to Israel and does everything to help it short of sending American forces. Trump did not face such a choice in his first term, but might very well in a second if Iran crosses the nuclear threshold.)

The choice should be clear for any American who supports Israel and for whom the continued existence and vibrancy of the Jewish State and the Middle East writ large is a priority: They should vote for Trump.

"1 year after Hezbollah strikes, Israel reinforces troops and questions mount over 'limited' operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-year-after-hezbollah-strikes-israel-reinforces-troops-questions-mount-over-limited-operation,2024-10-08T08:10:46Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One week after Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon and one year after Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in support of Hamas, Jerusalem reinforced its troops fighting inside Lebanon with a third division, prompting immediate questions over the extent of its ""limited"" operations in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday sent troops from its 91st Division, also known as the Galilee Formation, to join forces already in Lebanon hunting down Hezbollah strongholds.

The 91st Division, traditionally responsible for overseeing security for the entirety of the border with Lebanon, will reinforce efforts already being carried out by two other divisions.

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Israel's initial advance into Lebanon was led by soldiers from the 98th Division on Oct. 1, which encompassed paratroopers, elite commandos and the 7th Armored Brigade, who were transferred to northern Israel from the border with Gaza in early September for training, reported the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Long War Journal on Sunday ahead of the IDF announcement.

""Forces from the Commando Brigade, including soldiers from the Egoz Unit, located and destroyed a Hezbollah attack infrastructure, which included a rocket launcher, explosive stockpiles, and additional military equipment,"" the IDF said of the initial operation.

Though Hezbollah's response was fairly muted as many were believed to have retreated ahead of the incursion, at least nine IDF soldiers were killed between Oct. 1-2 during one of the opening battles in Lebanon, confirmed the Long War Journal.

Reinforcements from the IDF's 36th Division, including the Golani infantry, 188th Armored Brigade and the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade were then sent in, according to reports last week.

Following the Israeli incursion - a security measure that the U.S. and other international allies warned Jerusalem against - IDF spokesperson Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel would not push its ground forces north toward Beirut and would instead focus on securing the villages near the border.

Jerusalem has said the operation in Lebanon is necessary to secure the area so some 60,000 Israelis from northern Israel could return home, though data collected by the FDD shows that some 150,000 Israelis have evacuated from the northern border areas.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Hagari said the incursion would be ""limited"" and take ""days"" to ""weeks"" to complete.

But the renewed support of additional troops on Monday prompted questions over the scope of Israel's plans in southern Lebanon, including from the U.S. State Department on Monday.

In response to questions from reporters regarding Israel's operations in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, ""We're watching this very closely.""

""We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah's capability. But we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,"" he added. ""And ultimately, that's not the outcome that we want to see.""

Israel has not announced any additional plans for its ground forces and said the IDF Divisions have engaged in ""targeted, limited, and localized operations"" in southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure.

But one security expert with the FDD pointed out that Israel could be taking precautionary steps to build up its force in the region should Israel decide it needs to bolster its ability to go after Hezbollah even further.

""What the Israelis have been doing is gradually ratcheting up pressure on Hezbollah to make the price of continuing to attack in support of Gaza too costly for the organization,"" David Daoud, senior fellow at FDD specializing in Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital.

Daoud explained that in the wake of the Oct. 8 attacks, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ""mutual attrition,"" continuing to strike one another but rarely taking the level of attack beyond aerial bombardments, unlike the attacks carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.

ISRAEL'S GROUND INVASION INTO LEBANON IMMINENT AS CABINET APPROVES NEXT PHASE OF THE WAR

This level of engagement shifted after Israel's telecommunication device operation in which it allegedly detonated some 5,000 pagers previously distributed to Hezbollah operatives, killing more than three dozen and wounding nearly 3,000 others in a coordinated attack in late September.

Israel has not taken credit for the attacks, but according to open-source data compiled by the FDD in its latest interactive report dubbed ""Road to the Third Lebanon War, Mapping the War of Attrition,"" the event was a clear launching point in which Jerusalem drastically changed its modus operandi when it came to countering Hezbollah.

On Sept. 22, Israel carried out its most significant bombardment against the terrorist group than at any other point since the Oct. 8, 2023,attacks, firing some 1,182 strikes, nearly five times the number of attacks it fired during its second-heaviest strike campaign on Feb. 11, 2024, when 239 strikes were fired, the FDD found.

""I would call it a kind of proactive attrition,"" said Daoud, who co-authored the FDD report. ""The Israelis are no longer keeping a balance of attrition, they're really weighing heavily on Hezbollah without going to a full ground invasion.""

The expert explained that the IDF is ""ratcheting up pressure"" on Hezbollah in an attempt to get it to back off its support for Hamas, a similar strategy it has taken in Gaza in an attempt to persuade Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to hand over the hostages.

The merits of this approach are debatable as hostages remain in Hamas captivity despite the immense pains the IDF has caused in the Gaza Strip, and Daoud questioned whether this tactic would be effective against Hezbollah, an organization that is more sophisticated, better armed, better financed and more entwined in Lebanese society.

""I don't see Hezbollah backing down, even at this level of pain that the Israelis are inflicting upon them,"" Daoud said. ""So a ground invasion may become necessary, and you want to make sure that your forces are in place for that to move into effect immediately, if that becomes the case.""

The expert highlighted that Israel may once again be considering the establishment of a ""security zone"" in Lebanon in order to create a buffer between Hezbollah strongholds and the Israeli border, a move that would replicate steps Israel took between 1985 and 2000 and one that would require a prolonged IDF stay in Lebanon.

It is unclear if Israel could be considering another buffer-zone scenario, though it would likely prove unpopular not only with the Lebanese government but with the international community, which has increasingly urged Israel to reduce its footprint in the region by embracing a two-state solution with the Palestinians in the south and along Israel's eastern border.

But Daoud argued that the threat Hezbollah poses isn't going away and that creating a buffer zone combined with continued air strikes could be the solution that appeases the international community best by avoiding an all-out ground invasion across Lebanon.

""There are ways to avoid a ground invasion,"" Daoud argued. ""It will take much longer, but given where international opinion is, this is probably a better option for Israel now than a full ground invasion up to Beirut.""

Though Israel has not announced any plans to engage in a ground operation to oust Hezbollah forces from strongholds like Beirut, it has ramped up the number of strikes on suburban areas outside the capital city, and since late September the U.S. has organized the departure of some 700 Americans from Lebanon."

The home of University of Michigan president Santa Ono and the sidewalk were vandalized Monday, with anti-Israel messages spray-painted at the location on the first anniversary of Hamas terrorists' attack against Israel.

The words ""intifada"" and ""coward"" were spray-painted on the property in West Bloomfield, Michigan, according to The Associated Press. ""Intifada"" is an Arabic term for the Palestinian uprising against Israel.

West Bloomfield police did not identify the owner of the home, but the university acknowledged that Ono is the owner. This house is separate from his official campus residence.

The home of the university's chief investment officer, Erik Lundberg, was also vandalized on Monday, according to The Detroit News.

The university said it has no direct investments and less than $15 million placed with funds that might include companies in Israel, which is less than 0.1% of the total endowment.

Mark Bernstein, a member of the university's Board of Regents, said the vandalism was ""yet another assaultive act of intimidation by the antisemitic mob.""

This comes a year after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks against Israel, which led to retaliatory action from Israel's military and sparked the still-ongoing war in the region. Roughly 1,200 Israelis and more than 250 hostages, including some Americans, were abducted during the attacks. Many of them were released, rescued or killed, while dozens remain in Hamas' custody."

An imminent ballistic missile strike from Iran looms, but the current alarm is different - more immediate, more dangerous.

It's a terror attack in Jaffa.

The details are still emerging, but we know this much: Several people have already lost their lives.

In a rush, we load up our gear and protective equipment into our vehicle. Just as we're pulling out of the hotel, orders from New York come through: Get back inside. They don't want us on the road with Iran's attack approaching.

FOUR AMERICAN HOSTAGES REMAIN IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY A YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 MASSACRE

Before my producer can even hang up, the car fills with a new sound: the blare of alarms. Iran has fired ballistic missiles - headed straight for us.

It takes about 12 minutes for a missile to travel from Iran to Israel. How far into those 12 minutes we are is anyone's guess.

Our photographer, doubling as our driver, floors the accelerator, weaving through traffic as we race back to the hotel.

We make it back and join about two dozen others in the hotel's shelter. Many of them are Israelis. A father plays with his two daughters, rolling on the ground, laughing. Nearby, people chat calmly, unbothered by the threat of nearly 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel. I notice a young man standing calmly beside his girlfriend. He's missing a leg from the knee down but stands strong and composed.

""Hamas terrorists,"" he tells me when I ask about his injury. ""They hit us with an RPG.""

He credits his - and others' - composure during this attack to their faith in Israel's air defense systems.

From the shelter, I go live on Fox News Channel, describing those around me. As Israel's layered air defense - comprised of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow systems - intercepts incoming threats, it becomes clear why the soldier's confidence is well-placed.

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Iran is launching the largest ballistic missile barrage in history. Amid this, a Palestinian man in the West Bank dies from falling shrapnel, but not a single additional person in Israel is seriously harmed by the missiles.

It strikes me: the calm in the shelter is born of a tragic familiarity - being fired upon has become normal here.

Terror attacks, while common, rarely reach Tel Aviv.

When we're given the all-clear, we race to the scene of the attack in Jaffa, as originally planned.

Evidence of the brutality is everywhere along the light rail tracks: bloodstains and evidence markers hint at the horror that unfolded just before we arrived.

""When the train stopped and opened its doors, the terrorists walked inside, began firing their automatic weapons, then stepped back out and continued their killing spree,"" the Israeli Police International Spokesman, Dean Elsdunne, tells me.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

""I even saw an image where the terrorists stood over a civilian who had clearly already been shot, and they continued shooting him,"" he adds.

Seven people lost their lives in the attack.

My mind flashes back to what I witnessed 63 miles south of Tel Aviv, in the devastated city of Rafah in southern Gaza.

Weeks earlier, I had embedded with the IDF in the evacuated city, where soldiers exchanged gunfire with militants.

There wasn't a single civilian in sight, but remnants of life before the war were scattered everywhere - a child's superhero mask, clothes, household goods buried beneath the rubble from Israeli airstrikes.

Harris and Trump marked 1 year since the Oct. 7 attacks with tributes to the victims,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144699/kamala-harris-donald-trump-october-7,2024-10-07T22:25:41Z,"One year after Hamas attacked Israel, both major-party presidential candidates marked the date on Monday with promises of continued support for the Jewish state.

Vice President Harris remembered the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by planting a memorial tree at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., while former President Trump visited a sacred site for Hasidic Jews in Queens, N.Y.

""I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget,"" Harris said during a tree-planting ceremony on the grounds of the vice president's residence. ""We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took some 250 hostage in Gaza, according to Israel. A year later, more than 100 hostages are still unaccounted for. Israel's response to the attack has killed at least 41,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials.

Harris reiterated her support for Israel's defense, and promised the Biden administration would continue working to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. She then read the names of seven missing American citizens.

Harris also called for efforts to ""relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year.""

She appeared alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and and who has led White House efforts to fight antisemitism.

Trump met with members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York on Monday morning, and visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, an influential orthodox rabbi who died in 1994. Trump was then scheduled to attend an Oct. 7 remembrance event Monday evening with Jewish leaders, according to Trump campaign officials.

Hamas' stated goal is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the objective of the war in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas.

The war has exposed rifts within the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel. Those divides are particularly pronounced among younger voters -- a key voting bloc for Democrats and a group more likely than older voters to express sympathy for the Palestinian people. According to the Pew Research Center, voters ages 18-29 also are less supportive of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Trump has sought to capitalize on those tensions within his rival's party, saying recently that any Jewish voter who supports a Democrat is a ""fool."" Those remarks drew widespread criticism from Jewish organizations across the ideological spectrum.

He continued emphasizing the message in an interview Monday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""I did more for Israel than anybody, I did more for the Jewish people than anybody, and it's not a reciprocal, as they say,"" Trump said."

For Palestinian civilians caught in the middle of the ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and the Hamas militant group, the consequences have been unremittingly difficult, and deadly.

The death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza is now approaching 42,000 Palestinians, with another 39 deaths recorded Monday at local hospitals, according to Gaza's health authorities.

Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the United States and several other nations, has seen its control over territory in Gaza diminish over the past 12 months, leaving a political and logistical vacuum that international aid groups have struggled to fill.

Cease-fire talks between Hamas and Israel, brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, are on hold, so for civilians in Gaza, the forced displacement that for many began last October, still has no end in sight.

In the Deir al-Balah region of central Gaza, 58-year-old Abu Nidal Musleh lives in a makeshift tent, wearing mismatched shoes.

The father of seven comes from the same area of northern Gaza were civilians were once again ordered to evacuate Monday, and he's been displaced four times in the last year.

When Hamas-led fighters attacked communities in southern Israel a year ago, they killed more than 1,200 and seized about 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Musleh was a teacher on his way to school that day.

He told NPR on Monday he feels empathy for the Israeli hostages held by Hamas -- but he blames Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the suffering both sides have endured, and he insists peace will only be possible if Israeli citizens oust their premier.

""Rise up against Netanyahu,"" he said. ""Rise up -- so we can have normal relations.""

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, violence has worsened in the past year between Palestinian militants belonging to Hamas and other armed groups, and Israeli settlers and the Israeli military, which oversees the occupied territory with a vast network of checkpoints and military outposts.

Over the past few months, some of the heaviest Israeli airstrikes in decades have rocked Palestinian communities in the West Bank, killing dozens, alongside large-scale raids into cities including Jenin.

In Ramallah, the Israeli-occupied West Bank's biggest city, dozens of Palestinians gathered in the main square Monday, waving Palestinian flags and carrying anti-occupation signs.

Basma Abu Sway said she had come to mark one year since the war in Gaza began, and called last Oct. 7 one of the most important days in Palestinian history.

She said she hopes the sacrifices made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank will not be for nothing.

""All this blood, all this death is bringing peace to Palestine,"" she said. ""We deserve as Palestinian people to live in complete liberation.""

Settler violence and Israeli military raids into towns and villages in the West Bank have killed more than 730 Palestinians since the beginning of the war, according to a combined count of data from the United Nations and Palestinian health authorities.

On Monday the Palestinian advocacy group, Palestinian Prisoners' Club,, announced that Israeli military forces had arrested 45 people through Sunday night into Monday morning across the West Bank.

Rima Nazzal was also in Ramallah's Manara Square Monday, and said she felt concern and fear -- worried that Israel's occupation of Palestinians would grow stronger as a result of the its military's actions after Oct. 7 last year.

""The world says Israel has a right to defend itself,"" she said. ""As if it says Israel has a right to defend its occupation."""

Anti-Israel protesters set up an encampment outside the home of a Jewish Democratic House member on the eve of the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks, the congressman revealed on social media.

Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, posted on X overnight announcing that a group of people with their faces covered had congregated outside his house, prompting his family to get police escorts in order to exit and enter their home.

""A group of masked anti-Israel protesters assembled outside my home early Sunday morning and remained through the evening, forcing police to escort my family in and out of our house for safety,"" the lawmaker declared in a post that included a photo of the group. ""The protesters refuse to leave, setting up tents, cots, and sleeping bags in their encampment in the road, and are spending the night harassing my family outside our home. It's not clear if or when they will leave,"" he added in another tweet...Read more

Keren Nechmad & Swell Ariel Or Dive Into Netflix's 'Kissufim'  --  The Israeli 'Dazed And Confused',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2024/10/07/keren-nechmad--swell-ariel-or-dive-into-netflixs-kissufim---the-israeli-dazed-and-confused/,2024-10-07T21:01:28Z,"Keren Nechmad didn't set out to make Israel's answer to Dazed and Confused, but that's exactly what she's done with Kissufim.

""It's a happy coincidence,"" the first-time director, a graduate of NYU's renowned film school, tells me over Zoom when I bring up the comparison between her unforgettably confident feature debut and the Richard Linklater classic. ""My intention was just to give an understanding of what it is to live on a kibbutz and how time doesn't really move much. You're just going through life. I really wanted to do an ensemble as well; to show the different types of people there are in Israel.""

Now streaming exclusively on Netflix, the coming-of-age drama takes place on the titular, Gaza-adjacent kibbutz (a collective, agrarian-based community rooted in the country's founding Socialist principles), circa 1977, where a tight-knit group of young soldiers confront an uncertain future as they finish up their requisite military service through the volunteer program known as Nachal.

Grappling with the physical and psychological trauma of the Yom Kippur War four years prior, the soldiers dream of lasting peace with their neighbors, particularly in the wake of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat making a historic détente visit to Jerusalem. Embodying that sense of optimism is Eli, a free-spirited young woman loosely based on real-world terror victim, Elian Gazit, and portrayed by Swell Ariel Or (The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem). ""It's not a war film, except at the end,"" she says. ""You don't see blood and explosions and armies fighting each other. It's very delicate and it's more around the experience of Israelis. It's a film that humanizes Israelis without even trying.""

When it came to playing a real person, Or says she wanted to capture ""the essence"" of the individual rather than get bogged down in minutiae. ""It was more important to share her heart and how she would have lived her life if she didn't die. I focused more on that and after the film came out, her mother and sister approached me. That's the most important thing when you play a character based on [a real person] who still has living relatives; when they reach out and are moved by what you did.""

Like any great Bildungsroman put to screen -- whether it's American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused -- Kissufim eschews the traditional character arc format in favor of an anti-plot comprised of laid back vignettes centered around the bittersweet, yet intoxicating, milestones along the road to adulthood: first love, crushing heartache, wild rites of passage, playing pranks on friends, mocking authority figures, boozy parties, and everything in between. ""It worked against everything I learned and I loved it,"" Nechmad says of the unorthodox screenplay she co-wrote alongside Hadar Arazi and Yonatan Bar-Ilan. ""It freed me from the structure I was taught.""

To foster an organic sense of camaraderie that would show up on-camera, Nechmad made her cast spend as much time together as possible. ""I blamed Covid-19 and said, 'We need to be safe, so we need to just spend time with each other and nobody else,'"" she reveals. ""And they listened. Everybody was getting along so well and they became a core group. Because we spent a week-and-a-half filming on location [on the kibbutz], we all lived in the same cabins. Every night, we would sit together after filming and talk until someone came out of their room and shushed us.""

""It was a summer camp for grown-ups,"" agrees Or, ""which included a lot of going out and going to the beach and drinking and dancing. It was really fun.""

The key difference between this film and its genre predecessors, of course, is that these main characters are reluctantly forced to grow up before their time, having been born in one of the most embattled regions on the planet. It's something Nechmad hopes to impress upon viewers from countries lucky enough to avoid the specter of regular conflict.

""I grew up listening to my father's stories and, as child, I was like, 'Oh, another story from the army, another story of you growing up,'"" she recalls. ""But then I went to the army and I was like, 'Wait, all the stories he told me are resonating with what I'm going through.' This story of young people trying to find adulthood in Israel and maturity in the face of war is a multigenerational thing. You put your dreams on hold or process them in a different way and grow up and learn responsibility; learn there's something bigger than you -- for the good and the bad.""

To that end, Kissufim was always meant to be a timeless story. Despite its late '70s setting, Nechmad wasn't too worried about using period-specific lingo or music. ""I wanted the old meets the new to come to life in the film because it's telling a story that's outside of the timeframe in a sense. It could be anywhere, anytime. I think I could [set] it anywhere,"" the director adds. ""I think I could put it in 2050 -- I hope I'm wrong -- and it could resonate with that generation, [too].""

While it was originally filmed in 2021 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, Kissufim retroactively took on a tragic significance following the Hamas terror attack in the south of Israel last October, not least of all because the eponymous kibbutz was among the affected communities. As a result, the movie's release was delayed from fall 2023 to summer 2024. ""It's been very strange to see how close to reality it came, especially in Kissufim itself,"" Nechmad admits. ""I kept waiting for a phone call [from Netflix saying], 'Listen, it's too political -- we can't do it.'""

""I think they're probably the bravest streamer in the market right now in terms of films and shows that they're buying and broadcasting,"" echoes Or, who hopes the film can broaden ideological horizons beyond the echo chamber of news networks and social media. ""You get so many different accounts telling you so many different things. But if you read a book or watch a film or listen to an album ... the effort [to make them was enormous]. It took so much work to create this thing, that it's probably a little bit more truthful than a short video on TikTok.""

""We consume art from people that might not think the same way we do,"" Nechmad concludes. ""Our opinion changes all the time. It's not like we're constructed to one thing."""

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

NPR journalists have spent the past year witnessing, capturing and documenting the suffering and pain that war has inflicted on people in the Gaza Strip, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.

For Israelis, it began when Hamas militants stormed out of the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 last year, attacking soldiers, families in their homes and a rave packed with young people. The attacks killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

Israelis have been divided since: Many have spent the past year in rallies demanding a cease-fire that frees the hostages. Others have pressed their government to continue fighting Hamas, even blocking aid crossing into Gaza.

In Gaza, nothing looks the same a year into the war. Among the more than 41,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire this past year are hundreds of families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. More than half of those killed are women and children. Around 100,000 others in Gaza have been wounded, thousands of them children who have lost limbs.

A year on, nearly everyone in Gaza is displaced, huddling in bombed out schools and under makeshift tents without electricity, running water or safety.

Below is a collection of moments from the past 365 days of this war, captured by NPR photographers and others across the region."

The Minnesota Vikings released a statement on Monday remembering the one-year anniversary of the ""reprehensible"" Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

""We mourn the loss of all innocent lives from this ongoing conflict,"" the statement read. ""We stand against the rising antisemitism and Islamophobia and know we must steadfastly work towards combating hate in all forms. We pray for the 101 hostages who have yet to be freed, and our deepest hope is for a future of peace and safety throughout the region.""

Hamas launched an attack on Israel that sparked a massive conflict in the Middle East, which continues to rage on today.

The initial attacks had a large impact on the sports world, including the NFL as the war began in the middle of the 2023 season.

Many within the NFL, especially New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft with his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, spoke about after the Hamas attacks, calling Jewish hate ""out of control.""

VIKINGS' GREG JOSEPH TO WEAR 'I STAND WITH ISRAEL' CLEATS DURING NEXT GAME

The Vikings also saw their veteran kicker at the time, Greg Joseph, raising money to provide aid in Israel by starting a ""Kicks for Israel"" campaign on Oct. 17, 2023.

Joseph, who is Jewish and noted his religion ""absolutely"" guided him throughout his life, donated $54 for every extra point made and $180 for every field goal made to the non-profit organization Leket Israel.

Joseph now kicks for the New York Giants, who signed him after Graham Gano got hurt earlier this season. He wore cleats that said ""I Stand With Israel"" last season, and his campaign raised over $7,000.

As the Vikings' statement mentioned, there are still 101 hostages who remain in Gaza as the conflict continues.

The United States has helped Israel with military aid, while vetoing U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolutions.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed Monday that the U.S. ""will continue to work tirelessly"" to bring home the four American hostages who have now been held by Hamas for more than a year inside the Gaza Strip.

The four that remain -- Keith Siegel, 65, Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Omer Neutra, 22, and Edan Alexander, 21 -- were abducted by the Palestinian terrorist group exactly one year ago Monday on Oct. 7, 2023. The abductions took place alongside the murder of approximately 1,200 Israelis.

""Hamas also took 254 people hostage that day, including 12 Americans. Four of those Americans - Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Itay Chen, Judy Weinstein, and Gad Haggai - were murdered by Hamas. Four were released through an agreement the United States negotiated last November, but four remain in captivity in Gaza: Edan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen, and Omer Neutra,"" Blinken said in a statement.

""There are also an estimated 97 other hostages who remain held in Gaza today. They include men, women, young boys, young girls, two babies, and elderly people from more than 25 nations,"" Blinken added. ""Hamas should release these hostages immediately. Every single one of them must be returned to their families, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to bring them home.""

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Blinken, who on Monday called Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel the ""largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,"" also said ""It is time to reach a ceasefire agreement that brings the hostages home, alleviates the suffering of the Israeli and Palestinian people, and ultimately brings an end to this war.""

The youngest of the hostages, 20-year-old Edan Alexander, graduated from Tenafly High School in New Jersey in 2022 before volunteering to serve with the IDF.

""He was kidnapped Oct. 7th from his post, from the IDF post, and since then, we have no additional information about this abduction,"" his father Adi has said.

Adi and his wife Yael wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times in September saying that for hundreds of days ""the world has failed our son and his fellow hostages: The Israeli government has abandoned them, too many countries have turned a blind eye, and while we're grateful for the U.S. government's steadfast support, its efforts have yet to yield results.

Omer Neutra, 22, also volunteered to serve in the IDF, according to his parents Orna and Ronen.

""He's like an all-American kid. He loved sports. He was accepted to Binghamton University, but decided to defer this school. And he went to Israel on a gap year, and he connected deeply with the country, with his peers, and he decided to volunteer to the IDF, and he was taken from his post,"" his mother Orna has said.

She recently told the New York Post from her home in Plainview, New York, ""Our kid is a bargaining chip in this geopolitical nightmare, and we, the families, we're just floating on this wave. We're trying not to sink.""

HEZBOLLAH ROCKET ATTACK ON ISRAEL HITS HAIFA FOR FIRST TIME

Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose 36-year-old son Sagui is still being held in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" in September, ""It is absolutely clear, the only way to get hostages home alive is by some kind of negotiated agreement with Satan.""

Dekel-Chen was abducted by Hamas in Kibbutz Nir Oz one year ago, according to the American Jewish Committee. The organization said he made sure his then-pregnant wife and his two daughters were safe in a shelter before confronting Hamas terrorists who had broken into his home.

Last November, Elan Siegel, the daughter of 65-year-old Keith Siegel, wrote in a column for Fox News Digital, ""They forced my parents, unassuming people filled with kindness and a quiet sensitivity, into my father's car and took them to Gaza.""

Siegel's wife Aviva later was released from captivity.

""It's just cruel to think that he's in such terrible conditions for so long,"" Aviva Siegel recently told the New York Post. ""What they're going through is the cruelest thing on Earth.""

"Opinion | Here's how Israel, Iran and Hezbollah can avoid an all-out war",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/how-israel-iran-hezbollah-can-avoid-war-rcna174123,2024-10-07T19:40:18Z,"By Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as its sponsors in Tehran, appears to be spiraling completely out of control. An all-out war is looming with Israel, whose government is flush with victory and triumphalism and in little mood to suspend its attacks as Iran and Hezbollah vow to fight on.

The Biden administration sought to limit the post-Oct. 7 crisis to a war in the Gaza Strip, and especially prevent it from spreading into Lebanon. The policy has fallen apart, with Israel having invaded Lebanon, continuing to batter Hezbollah with air attacks and, most dangerously of all, tit-for-tat missile attacks between Iran and Israel. At the time of writing, the region is bracing for Israel's inevitable retaliation against Iran.

Yet, an all-out war on multiple fronts could still be avoided since there is an off-ramp for the warring parties.

A mutual drawdown could center on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1701, adopted in the aftermath of the last major Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. The resolution holds that Hezbollah should withdraw its fighters and heavy equipment from the south of Lebanon up to the Litani River, about 25 km (roughly 15.5 miles) into the country.

The resolution was accepted by Israel and the Lebanese government, but not formally by Hezbollah. Israel and Hezbollah settled into a ""new normal"" of routine clashes on both sides of the border limited to about a mile on either side, aimed at military targets and producing limited casualties.

This understanding persisted until last Oct. 7, when both sides' attitudes changed. While it didn't want a war with Israel, Hezbollah couldn't remain completely passive and preserve its reputation as a ""resistance"" organization. So it increased rocket fire, initially within the accepted understanding. But for Israel, that was no longer acceptable. Oct. 7 prompted a new border security doctrine, rendering the presence of an Iranian-backed militia to its north strategically and, especially, politically intolerable.

Israeli leaders needed to inflict strategic costs on Iran and its network, which had benefited while paying almost no price from the Oct. 7 attack and its aftermath. They also sought to recuperate the legitimacy of Israeli security institutions through a clear-cut victory over a major enemy, which was not available in Gaza. Hezbollah was a more strategically significant and conventional target, offering credible metrics of victory.

Discussion about an invasion of Lebanon began as early as Oct. 12, 2023, pushed by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. It was prevented by the Biden administration and the need to focus on Hamas. But as Israel began to run out of targets in Gaza, and Hezbollah's cross-border attacks had intensified over time, attention began to turn north.

While Hezbollah and Iran definitely did not want a war to defend Hamas (an unreliable ally) or Gaza (a place of no strategic significance), even ambivalent Israelis could see potential advantages to expanding the conflict. This gave them near-absolute escalation dominance, and the ability to control the scope and pace of the conflict.

As the U.S. election loomed, with Israel enjoying maximum freedom of action and impunity from U.S. pushback, it began a series of major attacks designed to cripple Hezbollah. Targets included the assassination of many of its key leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah, battlefield commanders, fighters and operatives, and heavy equipment including missiles and rocket launchers. Ignoring a week of U.S. efforts to organize a cease-fire, Israel suggested it would accept, it launched a major invasion of Lebanon's south.

Throughout this process, Hezbollah pulled its punches, never unleashing its most powerful precision-guided missiles at the most sensitive and strategic Israeli targets, avoiding the Dimona nuclear reactor and population centers such as Haifa. Iran remained passive, with the exception of a failed drone response to an Israeli strike on the Iranian Embassy annex in Damascus that killed several high-ranking Iranian generals. That all changed Oct. 1 -- when Iran unleashed its second significant missile barrage against Israel.

The ball is now firmly in Israel's court, as heavy fighting continues in southern Lebanon and the air campaign against Hezbollah proceeds apace. Israel will certainly respond militarily to Iran's attack, but much will depend on whether it attacks redline Iranian targets such as oil installations or nuclear facilities.

Many fear that Israel will seize the opportunity to launch a protracted air war against Iran that is intended to draw the U.S. into conducting a bombing campaign sufficient to knock Iran's nuclear program back by a decade or more.

Virtually no one in the United States wants to be drawn into a major war with Iran, even on behalf of Israel, but the Israelis probably lack the conventional firepower to do the job for themselves.

Fortunately, there is an offramp.

The Lebanese government, obviously acting pursuant to consultations with Hezbollah, is offering to implement 1701, with the militia pulling back and being replaced in the south by the Lebanese armed forces and U.N. observers.

Riding a wave of wins, Israel's ruling coalition may be in no mood to compromise. But sensible Israelis must realize that they are on the brink of being drawn into another prolonged occupation in southern Lebanon which would be the ideal context for Hezbollah to eventually rebuild its organization, power and legitimacy. Hezbollah would like nothing more than a return to the fight against Israel that began in 1982 when the organization was founded to combat Israeli occupation and culminated with Israel's retreat in May 2000.

In his final speech, Nasrallah said he would welcome an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Many dismissed it as bluster but Nasrallah was almost certainly serious, given Hezbollah's urgent need to recover and rebuild. Israel may be unwittingly handing them the opportunity to do that on their own terms.

Moreover, a war with Iran carries enormous risks, including the development of potentially serious resentment against Israel in the United States. It could sentence Washington to a prolonged pattern of routine bombing runs against Iran, just as occurred in the 1990s against Iraq. And Iran and Hezbollah both retain options, including more powerful missiles and the use of other proxies and even terrorists around the world to strike back. The danger of Israeli overreach, especially pursuing open-ended insurgencies to the north and south -- and potentially one that appears to be brewing to the east in the occupied West Bank -- is considerable.

The deal would look like this: Hezbollah agrees to pull back fighters and heavy equipment to beyond the Litani River, to be replaced by Lebanese and U.N. troops. Hezbollah also ceases rocket fire against Israel, with both parties agreeing to decouple the Lebanon conflict from the Gaza war. This agreement would also allow Israel and Iran to stop their extraordinarily dangerous tit-for-tat exchanges and spare the region, and the U.S., from a multifront regional war and a direct U.S. military confrontation with Iran.

Lebanon and Hezbollah seem willing to take this deal, and Washington is pushing it enthusiastically. Iran would surely welcome it to, as Hezbollah would not have greenlighted the Lebanese acting prime minister to make the offer without approval from Tehran. The main question is whether Israel's government, with the wind at its sails, is in any mood to compromise.

The Biden administration needs to remind Israel of the dangers of overreach, and potential for serious damage to bilateral relations if Israel is viewed as dragging the U.S. into another catastrophic ""forever war"" in the Middle East. Biden has already warned Israel not to make ""the mistakes we made"" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The parallels are unnerving. A national trauma followed by deceptively easy early victories, as the U.S. experienced in Afghanistan and Israel thinks it has accomplished in Gaza, is the perfect setup for catastrophic overreach.

Given the existence of an off-ramp, Iran and Hezbollah's apparent willingness to take it, and the urgent need for Washington to avoid getting dragged into another madcap Middle East adventure, one of Biden's most important final missions is to convince Israel to take a deep breath, and the deal, before it's too late."
"Kamala Harris courts disillusioned Arab Americans over Jewish groups, records show",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-courts-disillusioned-arab-americans-over-jewish-groups,2024-10-07T19:30:40Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the devastation from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel one year later. The 'Outnumbered' panel also discusses the tragedy as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.

Vice President Kamala Harris appears to prioritize winning back Arab American and Muslim voters who were dejected by President Joe Biden's handling of war in the Middle East over courting the Jewish voter.

That's according to an internal review of her calendar meetups with both groups since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

Harris met with Arab American advocates ahead of a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on Friday. That followed a meeting with activists with the Pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement, which has declined to endorse her, in Michigan in July.

Her public schedule hasn't included meetings with Jewish groups since meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately in July, after she declined to preside over his joint address to Congress.

In August, her campaign nominated Ilan Goldenberg as its liaison to the Jewish community, and on Aug. 15, Harris sent campaign officials to meet with Jewish leaders in Michigan. In September, she called the parents of the late Hersch Goldberg-Polin, the American hostage slain by Hamas. Fox News Digital could not find a record of any other face-to-face Jewish outreach by Harris.

Wa'el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, told CNN that Harris had told the Arab group on Friday ""that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.""

The Arab Americans told her she needed ""to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don't agree with.""

HARRIS REFUSES TO CALL NETANYAHU A 'CLOSE ALLY' ONE YEAR AFTER OCTOBER 7

Michigan, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, is a crucial battleground state this election. It has the second-highest population of Arab American residents, who make up around 3% of its population.

On the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, former President Donald Trump will speak to Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President's Residence in honor of those killed a year ago.

One year on from the outbreak of war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel is now entrenched in war on other fronts too. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recently launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, and last week missiles rained down on Tel Aviv -- though most were intercepted -- from Iran.

Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic -- in 2020, Biden won 69% of their vote. Trump won 30%.

Harris' focus on Arab American outreach could in part be due to shifting polling within the community and an aggressive outreach from the Trump campaign to capitalize on that.

Arab Americans also historically favor Democrats -- but new polling suggests that could change. Of likely voters in the community, Arab Americans favor Trump over Harris 46% to 42%, according to new polling by the Arab American Institute.

Trump has been airing ads aimed at Arab Americans in Michigan, and his former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell and his daughter Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman, have been leading his outreach to the community.

HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY 'SWAY' OVER NETANYAHU

""His outreach now is much better, much different than it was in 2016 and 2020,"" Adel Ayoub, leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Fox News Digital of Trump.

Biden won 60% of the Arab American vote in 2020, but support from that community has cratered since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023.

The National Uncommitted movement launched a campaign calling on voters to cast uncommitted ballots in swing state primaries to send a message to Democrats, and more than a million did so.

Harris spoke with leaders of the Uncommitted Movement in August. That same month, her campaign manager met with Arab and Muslim leaders.

Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for loosening sanctions on Iran, thus emboldening Iran's proxies to carry out the attack last year.

Trump has repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and that if he loses the Nov. 5 election, ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that."""

Today is Oct. 7, marking one year since the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel.

Hamas fighters killed over 1,200 people. In response, the Israeli government launched airstrikes and a ground invasion in Gaza, killing almost 42,000 people so far according to Palestinian health authorities.

Despite repeated attempts, the United States has failed to broker a ceasefire - in both Gaza and now at Israel's northern border as its military targets the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Last week, Israel said it secured $8.7 billion from the U.S. for its ongoing military efforts.

Typically, each week leading up to Nov. 5, we focus on the stakes of this election, for people, our country and our democracy.

Today's ""If You Can Keep It"" discussion will sound a little different.

What are the stakes of the U.S. election for the people of a Middle East in conflict?"
JD Vance hits Biden-Harris on hurricane response: 'Incompetence of the highest order',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jd-vance-hits-biden-harris-hurricane-response-incompetence-highest-order,2024-10-07T19:09:23Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, joins 'Fox & Friends' one year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel to discuss the Biden-Harris administration's leadership and the lack of funding for FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance slammed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the fallout of Hurricane Helene as incompetent in an interview Monday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Vance said FEMA has been ""distracted"" by illegal immigrants as a result of the Biden-Harris administration's ""incompetence.""

""I think the fundamental mistake that Kamala Harris' administration has made here, Will, is that from the get-go, you should have imposed military-style command and control,"" he said. ""You've got eight different bureaucratic organizations, you've got a lot of different bureaucratic fiefdoms that sometimes delay the provision of necessary resources, you need to empower a military commander on the ground to get helicopters to where they need to go, to get supplies ... to cut through some of the FAA bureaucracy.""

""The problem here, I really believe, it's like the DMV at industrial scale, and because of it, a lot of folks in North Carolina are suffering unnecessarily,"" he added. ""I hope to God you don't have unnecessary loss of life, but I fear that we do, and it all goes back to why do we have a president and a vice president, one of whom is on the beach, the other of whom is participating in fundraisers rather than doing their job. It is incompetence of the highest order.""

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CHURCHILL MOMENT COMES AMID MULTIFRONT WAR AGAINST IRANIAN TERROR, EXPERT SAYS

Vance discussed the claim that there is a bucket of money in FEMA that has gone to illegal immigrants and another separate bucket of money that goes to American citizens.

""I think that misses the fundamental point that the Biden-Harris administration has turned FEMA effectively into an agency that helps to resettle and helps to deal with illegal immigration,"" he said. ""That is just fundamentally going to distract focus from their core job of helping American citizens in their time of need.""

Vance continued, calling the administration's response following Hurricane Helene a ""complete failure of leadership,"" demonstrated by the contrast in previous responses to natural disasters.

""In 2010, there was a terrible earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,"" he explained. ""The 82nd Airborne was on the ground two days later. There was a disastrous hurricane an hour away from the 82nd Airborne headquarters. It took more than a week for the full deployment to arrive and start helping people out.""

""It's a complete lack of leadership,"" he added. ""When things like this happen, you need somebody in charge, you need somebody saying we're going to save as many lives as possible. Red tape be damned. Unfortunately, what you've had is somebody asleep at the wheel. Nobody knows who's in charge and I think it has delayed the provision of necessary resources to the people of North Carolina.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Vance said the area, the Appalachian region of the country, has been ignored by U.S. leadership for 40 years.

""They really feel ignored today,"" he said. ""The way you solve that problem is by having leaders who show up and focus on the people. Kamala Harris has failed to do that.""

FEMA has set up a fact-check page to respond to what it says are false claims about its response to the hurricane. In one, it responded to a claim that funding for its disaster response was diverted to support international efforts or border issues.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs,"" the site states. ""FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.""

A White House spokesperson didn't have a direct response to Vance but referred Fox News Digital to its comment about similar criticism by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

""A wide range of leaders in both parties and from every affected state have praised the bipartisan response to Hurricane Helene,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said. ""The Republican governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, has called the response 'superb.' Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said, 'They're doing a great job.' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said, 'We are seeing incredible help from the Federal government to the state.' The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he 'appreciated' President's Biden's offer to 'call him directly' with any 'other things we need.' The Republican governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, said he's 'incredibly appreciative of the rapid response.' Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said, ""The federal response has been nothing short of amazing. And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said, 'This is an incredible experience for me. So, to President Biden, thank you for coming. Thank you for paying attention to our needs. We have had a good working relationship between the federal government.'"""
Israel Soccer accuses Palestine of 'distorting reality' after suspension proposal,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/israel-soccer-accuses-palestine-distorting-reality-after-suspension-proposal,2024-10-07T18:52:45Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Israel Football Association (IFA) has responded to allegations of discrimination and a proposed suspension of its team from the Palestinian Football Association (PFA).

FIFA, the world's soccer governing body, launched an investigation into allegations of discrimination against the IFA last week. FIFA leaders made this decision when they ruled against suspending Israel from international play after the PFA proposed a suspension to Israel amid the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza earlier this year.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital by IFA head of communications Shlomi Barzell over the weekend, the IFA condemned the PFA for its recent proposal to FIFA.

""Whoever fantasized about the suspension of Israeli football from the international arena or sanctions through lies and false accusations, has suffered a defeat,"" the statement read. ""Again, we have acted over time in different channels, in a calculated and proactive manner in the face of the challenge of the Palestinian Association and its leader to distort reality, and the result today leaves no room for doubt.

""We respect the authors of the report submitted to the council members and the decision of the council members to consider transferring two issues to a legal examination, as long as there is any factual justification for it. Thanks to values that represent a glorious democracy and an independent and determined legal system of the Football Association, we have never violated and will not violate any of the FIFA/UEFA rules,"" the statement read.

The PFA has not responded to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

The PFA's original proposal claimed at least 92 non-professional Palestinian players have been killed in the war, football infrastructure has been destroyed, its leagues suspended and its national team required to play World Cup qualifiers abroad. The Palestinian federation wanted FIFA to adopt appropriate sanctions against Israeli teams, including the national side and clubs.

Katarina Pijetlovic, head of the PFA's legal department, addressed FIFA's decision not to suspend Israel in posts on X on Oct. 3.

""FIFA allowed Israel FA to continue using the Palestinian territory [occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem] as their own territory, and to use football under its umbrella as an instrument of colonial expansion,"" she wrote in a post on X. ""The decision is purely political. Will we wait 2 yrs again, as in 2015-17, for the committee to suggest the obvious and then have their suggestion rejected again? Why don't they just say it: Israel has impunity to destroy FIFA member associations & use their colonized territories.""

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CHURCHILL MOMENT COMES AMID MULTIFRONT WAR AGAINST IRANIAN TERROR, EXPERT SAYS

Gaza-based soccer journalist Abubaker Abed previously told Al Jazeera that the Palestinian Federation ""acts as a form of resistance"" and alleged that more than 50 Palestinian sports facilities had been destroyed.

""The people of Palestine know this team acts as a form of resistance and is conveying a message to the world,"" Gaza-Abed said. ""More than 50 sports facilities have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, including nine out of 10 of Gaza's stadiums. Almost every club has been destroyed in this war, while one stadium in Deir el-Balah has been turned into a shelter for thousands of displaced people.""

FIFA's disciplinary committee will now be asked to look into the allegations of discrimination. The PFA has specifically accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

The PFA's proposal of suspension was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

However, for the time being, it doesn't appear that Israel will be subject to a suspension. A suspension may have severely impacted its hopes to compete in the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in North America. The final will be played in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City.

Countries have been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past based on the actions of their governments and national team administrations.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

Israel has only ever qualified for the World Cup once, in 1970, and it didn't make it out of the group stage. Israel won a championship in the 1964 Asian Games. However, they were moved from the Asian Football Federation to the the European Confederation UEFA in 1994, where they have struggled to compete. The team suffered its most lopsided loss in its history in a 7-1 blowout to Germany in 2002.

Israel is currently in the midst of its UEFA Nations League schedule. It will play France on Thursday after starting off 0-2.

Meanwhile, Palestine is currently in the midst of group play for the FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers. It will play Iraq on Thursday after starting group play with one loss and one draw. Palestine has never qualified for the World Cup.

Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, which killed 1,195 people, including 815 civilians, and resulted in 251 people being taken hostage. At least 31 Americans were killed during the attacks and 13 others were missing.

On Aug. 15, at least 40,005 Palestinians were reported to have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Gaza's health ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but says at least 5,956 women and at least 10,627 children have been killed.

One year after the attack, Hamas marked the anniversary by firing a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.

Israel's war in Gaza rages on even as Israel is now fighting a new war against Hezbollah, escalating its bombing campaign in Lebanon the past three weeks. Last week Israel faced additional attacks from Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, in the form of missile strikes.

The strikes forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday, and even forced a pair of Israeli women's basketball teams to abandon their game and flee to shelter, per the Jerusalem Times."

Sen. JD Vance blasted the Biden-Harris administration on Monday for not doing enough to bring home the hostages that Hamas took from Israel during the deadly Oct. 7 attack one year ago.

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""I'm going to get a little political here. It is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who haven't done a thing,"" Vance said. ""Vice President Harris, our message is, 'Bring them home.' Use your authority to help bring them home. We can do it. We just need real leadership.""

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

The attack sparked a war in Gaza, where Israel has moved to eliminate Hamas and return those taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Harris came under fire Sunday for a lengthy ""word salad"" answer in which she appeared unable to fully commit to Israel during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

Meanwhile, Vance gave full-throated support for Israel, saying that former President Trump will make sure Israel has the right to protect itself and that the hostages are returned home.

""I speak for Donald Trump and saying that when he is president, America will protect our American Jewish brothers and sisters. We will stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals. And we are going to bring home American hostages wherever they're held and whoever is holding them,"" he said.

"October 7 hasn't ended. One year later, 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/october-7-hasnt-ended-one-year-later-101-hostages-still-being-held-gaza,2024-10-07T18:18:28Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

While visiting her boyfriend's family for the religious holiday of Simchat Torah, a young Israeli woman, Sapir Cohen, was taken hostage on October 7, 2023. She spent 55 days in captivity in Gaza before she was released in a deal with the Hamas terrorists who took her and hundreds of other Israelis captive. Cohen's boyfriend, Sasha Troufanov, has been held captive with one hundred others for exactly one year, today.

Cohen visited my children's overnight sleepaway program this summer, telling campers about the plight of those still left behind in Gaza while sharing her own experience.

She shared, ""Down there [in the tunnels] there is no light. Sometimes a terrorist would use a flashlight, but even then, I couldn't see anything. There is also no air."" She went on to explain the lack of oxygen, the prevalence of humidity and mold, and the lack of food. She experienced this for less than two months; Sasha and 100 others have for twelve months.

She goes anywhere she can to share her story in order to raise awareness about the hostages who have spent a year of their lives wasting away in the tunnels of Gaza, because she knows the world has lost interest. There are no yellow ribbons lining the trees of America's small towns in honor of the four Americans still being held hostage; nor were there large memorials for Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a young American boy who was taken hostage and executed in the tunnels in Gaza one month ago.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7, IRAN IS LOSING THE WAR. NOW, ISRAEL MUST SECURE PEACE

Even Troufanov's own employer has forsaken him. Despite working as an engineer on a pivotal project for Amazon, the Seattle-based company has been silent about his plight.

Amazon isn't alone in their disinterest in their imprisoned Jewish employees. One year ago, PepsiCo's subsidiary, SodaStream, had one of its employees, Guy Gilboa-Dalal taken captive as well, and Pepsi have maintained their silence. Pepsi has had no issues speaking up and ponying up on other social issues, yet, when it comes to their own staffer kidnapped from a music festival, they can't be bothered to advocate for his immediate and unconditional release.

On the anniversary of October 7th, hostage Emily Damari's mother Mandy spoke out about her daughter, violently taken from a Kibbutz on the Gaza border, Kfar Aza.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7 ATTACKS AND DEMOCRAT-RUN STATES HAVE LET THE PROBLEM FESTER

In her British accent, Mandy pleaded, ""I would like to feel that the British public were behind her, and the British government were behind her, and they were saying there is a British hostage held captive in the terror tunnels by Hamas in Gaza. I want them to know she's there, and to advocate for her release, unconditionally and immediately. She's a young woman, and who knows what's happening to her. If there's a way to put her on social media, and see her out there. Remind people that she's there, [and] make sure she's not forgotten.""

The worst fears of their families and loved ones have been realized; Sasha, Guy and Emily have been forgotten. Put simply and bluntly: Hostages and their families feel alone and forsaken because they have been. Their employers have abandoned them, and their governments have, too. The world community and organizations, tasked with advocating for the most vulnerable among us, have clearly indicated that Jews don't count in their hierarchy of victims.

Not only are the victims of October 7th forgotten, they have been transformed into oppressors by evil individuals and organizations who have decided that Jewish lives simply do not matter.

Amnesty International UK, in the days leading up to the anniversary, justified the massacre and reminded their followers ""Don't let anyone tell you that this all started on the 7th of October 2023.""

In response to Amnesty, pro-Israel influencer Hen Mazzig asked, ""So when did it start? In 2002, during the Second Intifada, when I was almost killed in a terror attack? Or in 1951, when my family was expelled from Tunisia for being Jewish? Or in 1941, during the Farhud, when my family members were killed and expelled from Iraq? Or the Hebron massacre in 1929? When did it start? When did the world become so apathetic as to deny Jews the right to mourn our dead and post videos like this on the day we commemorate the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust? And October 7th hasn't ended for us, because 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza for 365 days.""

A year on, millions of Jews, both American and Israelis alike, are all still trapped in October 7th, but the year is still 2023, not 2024. Life has moved on as we have scrambled to try to beg for sympathy, relevancy and attention while the world marks holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Easter and Passover, all the while we struggle to remind the world that we are still trapped in October. And here we are, back in October.

In her famous book, ""Anne of Green Gables,"" L. M. Montgomery wrote, ""I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.""

For Jews, our world has been nothing but Octobers for the last twelve months. Finding ourselves back in October is a painful reminder that our hearts, all 101 of them, still lay captive in Gaza. It won't stop being October 7th until they're all home."

Anti-Israel protesters set up an encampment outside the home of a Jewish Democratic House member on the eve of the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks, the congressman revealed on social media.

Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, posted on X throughout the evening of Oct. 6, announcing that a group of people with their faces covered congregated outside his house, prompting his family to get police escorts in order to exit and enter their home.

""A group of masked anti-Israel protesters assembled outside my home early Sunday morning and remained through the evening, forcing police to escort my family in and out of our house for safety,"" the lawmaker declared in a post that included a photo of the group. ""The protesters refuse to leave, setting up tents, cots, and sleeping bags in their encampment in the road, and are spending the night harassing my family outside our home. It's not clear if or when they will leave,"" he added in another tweet.

Landsman's communications director told Fox News Digital via email that as of Monday morning, the individuals were still outside the congressman's home in Cincinnati.

Landsman noted that Monday marks the grim anniversary of the heinous Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack against Israel in which Hamas committed atrocities.

""On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the October 7th terror attacks, when Jews were brutally murdered and kidnapped, these people came to the home of a Jewish family at night, dressed in all black and fully masked,"" the congressman said in a statement.

"1 year after Hamas attacked Israel, the conflict grows more dangerous than ever",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26381/hamas-israel-hezbollah-gaza-lebanon,2024-10-07T16:07:28Z,"A girl walks through the rubble of a collapsed building in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Oct. 2, amid the war in the Palestinian territory between Israel and Hamas. Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Thousands breached a border fence. Others arrived in speedboats. Some even came by paraglider in a dawn attack by Hamas fighters a year ago that caught Israel by surprise, leaving 1,200 people dead and another 250 as hostages. It also set in motion events that now threaten to turn Israel's long-running conflict with Iran's proxies into a direct and dangerous war with Tehran.

Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, marked the deadliest day in the history of modern Israel, triggering a devastating attack on Palestinians. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza. Beginning in the days after the Hamas attack, Israeli warplanes began punishing airstrikes inside the narrow strip of Palestinian territory that also lies adjacent to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. By the end of the month, Israeli forces had launched a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.

At the one-year mark in the Israel-Hamas war, here are four things that are key to where things stand today.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, as Israelis mourned those killed, they also feared for the safety of the hostages. A central plaza in downtown Tel Aviv, unofficially dubbed Hostages Square, was quickly transformed into a gathering place for the families, friends and supporters of the captives. ""Bring them home now!"" emerged as a potent rallying cry, and posters showing the faces and names of the hostages became ubiquitous. Many Israelis began wearing special necklaces, bracelets and T-shirts to show their support for the captives. Daily vigils in Hostages Square drew large crowds.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- already weathering intense criticism for intelligence failures in the lead-up to the surprise attack -- came under intense pressure to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages.

Although Israel and Hamas managed a brief cease-fire in November that allowed for the exchange of more than 100 hostages for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners, the truce lasted just a week. Hamas did unilaterally release four hostages, and eight others were rescued by Israeli forces. Israel's military also recovered the bodies of several hostages.

The fate of the remaining captives in Gaza has remained an open wound for many Israelis. Netanyahu's office believes that of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, about a third are likely dead.

The hostages question continues to shape Israel's public response to the conflict.

Since the start of Israel's military response, the country's attacks have killed at least 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16,500 children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another 95,000 people have been injured, the ministry says.

Israel's military began its assault on Hamas in the north of Gaza, and as Palestinian civilians sought to escape the fighting, most of them fled southward, displacing them from their homes and cutting them off from critical infrastructure needed for daily survival.

Recent data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials in Gaza indicate the attacks have damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's homes, 80% of its commercial facilities and 85% of the territory's schools.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""moral stain on us all,"" and the aid group Refugees International has said that Israel's military response ""has wrought disproportionate death and suffering among civilians in Gaza, generating famine-like conditions while obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response.""

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli authorities considered to be a Hamas stronghold, experienced some of the most intense bombardment of the conflict.

In the first few months of fighting, Rafah, near the border with Egypt in southern Gaza, was designated as a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military -- meant as a place where civilians could shelter and get access to desperately needed international humanitarian aid. Even so, Israel continued to carry out airstrikes on Rafah, some targeted at Hamas fighters or facilities, while others aimed to free Israeli hostages, according to the Israeli military. Some of those airstrikes hit homes, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, and others destroyed food distribution sites. More than half of Gaza's prewar population of 2.2 million was believed to be sheltering in Rafah. In May, Israel issued evacuation orders for the city and launched an offensive that sealed the border with Egypt, which until then was one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid.

Food, drinking water and materials for temporary shelters are in short supply and are being carried in by trucks operated by international relief organizations. People in Gaza are down to one meal every other day, and an estimated 50,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition.

U.S. efforts to speed aid to Gaza have also floundered. A special $230 million temporary floating pier known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) operated only intermittently as damage from high winds and rough seas in the eastern Mediterranean repeatedly rendered it inoperable.

Besides the brief cease-fire to facilitate a hostages-for-prisoners swap, repeated rounds of peace talks -- some mediated by Qatar -- have failed to make much progress. Deep-seated animosities and the fragmented nature of the Palestinian leadership have played a part in preventing any lasting peace deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has tried to walk a fine line between diplomatic and military support for its long-term ally, Israel, and a desire to mitigate the suffering in Gaza while trying to contain a wider war that increasingly has dragged Iran and Israel into direct conflict and could engulf the rest of the Middle East.

For the moment, cease-fire talks that at times sparked optimism have fallen silent.

In late September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken summed up the U.S. position, saying, ""Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.""

Meanwhile, public opinion in the U.S. has been split largely along partisan lines, with conservatives showing support for Israel, but some people, younger and more liberal, turning out for pro-Palestinian rallies on college campuses.

Among Democrats, more than half say that Israel bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war in Gaza, while only about 4 in 10 Republicans do, according to a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll published last week.

That political dichotomy could influence the outcome of a likely tight U.S. presidential race, with some Democrats suggesting that Netanyahu is ignoring the Biden administration's peace entreaties in an effort to tip the election toward former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, voters in key battleground states give Trump higher marks than his opponent, Vice President Harris, on foreign policy matters, according to a recent poll by the New York-based Institute for Global Affairs.

From the opening days of the conflict in Gaza, the Biden administration warned against allowing the Hamas attack to morph into a war that could bring in Hezbollah -- the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group -- as a primary combatant and could eventually lead to a direct conflict with Tehran.

But increasingly in recent weeks, that's exactly what seems to be happening.

On Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets against Israel in support of the Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza. Israel hit back, and for months, low-level conflict simmered along the Lebanon-Israel border. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, mostly stayed out of the conflict. But an Israeli attack in April against an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria that killed several of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers changed the dynamic. Less than two weeks later, Iran retaliated with a large-scale drone and missile strike on Israel. The attack, heavily telegraphed by Tehran in an apparent effort to contain the fallout, was easily repulsed by Israeli air defenses, assisted by the United States.

Fast-forward to last month: In an operation credited to Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, in synchronized attacks over two days, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded across Lebanon, killing more than a dozen people -- including two children -- and wounding thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Soon after, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes against southern Lebanon that it said were aimed at Hezbollah targets. One that hit a residential building in downtown Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander.

As Israeli airstrikes continued days later, multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut were demolished. On Sept. 27, Israel announced that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the militant group for more than three decades, was killed in one of the strikes. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

Israel also hit ports and power stations in Yemen operated by another Iran-backed group, the Houthis.

The United Nations says about 1 million Lebanese have fled their homes amid the Israeli airstrikes. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

On Oct. 1, Israel opened a ground offensive in southern Lebanon, a move that hearkened back to a similar 1982 invasion of the country's south by Israeli forces, which led to an 18-year occupation and to a monthlong war that Israel fought against Hezbollah in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. The country's extensive defenses -- bolstered by two U.S. destroyers deployed in the region -- intercepted most of the Iranian missiles. However, Israeli officials acknowledge that some of the Iranian missiles did hit an air base."

The Iranian-backed Hamas and its supporters unleashed a scale of unprecedented barbarism, including beheadings and burning bodies, within the territory of the Jewish state, resulting in the mass murder of nearly 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans.

The U.S. designated terrorist movement Hamas also kidnapped more than 250 people on that fateful day that jolted Israel like none of the numerous wars against Iran-backed proxies that the tiny Jewish state has fought within this century. As of Monday, 101 hostages still remain in Hamas captivity, .

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

After a year of intense war with Hamas, including the opening of six additional fronts against the Islamic Republic of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance,"" Netanyahu has bounced back to take on the threat to Israel's very existence. He is in his prime as a modern war planner and head of state, a number of Israeli experts told Fox News Digital, including Israel's top diplomat to the United Nations.

""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage.""

""Netanyahu was completely shocked during the first hours on the first day of the attack, but at the same time, he understood what was going on and controlled events. Netanyahu responded very quickly,"" Ariel Kahana, the senior diplomatic correspondent for the widely read Hebrew-language daily Israel Hayom, told Fox News Digital.

Kahana referenced Netanyahu's public announcement on Oct. 7, in which he declared, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war. This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens.""

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, said, ""This isn't a war Israel started nor is it a war Israel wanted. But, under the leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel has succeeded in mitigating the threat of Hamas by destroying its tunnel infrastructure and taking out its leaders. Israel is also successfully degrading Hezbollah in the north by eliminating its senior leadership and launching a targeted operation in southern Lebanon with the goal of pushing the group north of the Litani River and reducing the threat the terrorist organization poses to our northern border.""

Danon, who is a member of Netanyahu's conservative Likud party, added, ""While we are making progress, there is still work to be done. We still have 101 hostages who are held in brutal captivity in Gaza, and we still have 70,000 Israelis who are refugees in their own country, unable to return to their homes in the north.""

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS IN GAZA

Prior to Oct. 7, Netanyahu was an embattled prime minister. His right-wing coalition government had suffered public humiliation when his administration was forced to abandon its judicial reform plan because of massive civil society protests.

Now, with a string of tactical victories over Hezbollah and Hamas' top leaders, including Israeli control over most of the Gaza Strip, Bibi, as he is known in Israel by his nickname, has gained popularity in political polling.

""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls.""

One key turning point for Israel is the near total decimation of the leadership of the U.S. classified terrorist movement Hezbollah, including its leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon.

ISRAEL WAS BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS, AS NEW BLASTS REPORTED

The de facto ruler over the Lebanese state, Hezbollah, launched missiles at Israel one day after the Hamas invasion, on Oct. 8. Last week, Israeli ground troops entered south Lebanon, with a view toward rooting out Hezbollah terrorists and missiles that sparked the flight of as many as 70,000 Israelis from their homes in the north.

Kahana noted, ""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls. He is the only one to use the term victory. You don't hear that from the security establishment."" He cited the examples of Bibi's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and Herzi Halevi , the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who ""are not talking about a complete defeat of Hamas.""

The veteran Israeli commentator said Israel's seizure of the southern Gaza city of Rafah was a telling example of a clash between Bibi and his war planners, Gallant and Halevi. There was hesitation on the part of Gallant and Halevi while Netanyahu wanted to expedite the capture of Rafah, the last major holdout of sizeable Hamas terrorist forces. Kahana chalked up a possible explanation of delay from Gallant and Halevi to the Biden administration's interference in having expressed opposition to the IDF operation in Rafah.

After a four-month offensive in Rafah, the IDF, in September, declared victory over Hamas' Rafah brigade. The incursion into Rafah also secured the release of four Israeli hostages in June. From May to September, the IDF eliminated thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in Rafah.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

According to Kahana, ""Bibi had to push the army to act."" He compared Bibi to Britain's WWII prime minister, Winston Churchill, who demanded that his army do certain things but encountered resistance. Kahana noted, ""Netanyahu has full responsibility for what brought about Oct. 7, but he is leading the war better than Gallant, Halevi and Benny Gantz.""

""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

Gantz, a retired general and leader of the main opposition party, left Bibi's war cabinet in June.

Yet Bibi still has many critics who believe he should have tendered his resignation on Oct. 7 or a few months into the war against Hamas. Netanyahu has also been accused of forgoing the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and thousands of Israelis have protested on a near weekly basis against his policies since the war began.

Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, is one of Bibi's sharpest critics. Melman said, ""His performance is very bad."" He said Bibi has ""no vision and no strategy."" Melman asked, ""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

He claimed, ""Most of his decisions are about political and personal survival.""

Israel's then-attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a legal saga that started four years ago and is still unfolding. Netanyahu has vehemently denied all the allegations against him.

Melman also claimed that Netanyahu, along with his cabinet, military and security chiefs, refused to accept responsibility for Oct. 7.

As one of Israel's leading intelligence experts, he attributed the penetration of Hezbollah's leadership structure to the ""last four chiefs of the Mossad and the military chiefs. ""Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, built these abilities over the years,"" he said.

He also claimed that Netanyahu also ""strained relations with the U.S. in an unprecedented way. His performance is full of ungratefulness. The U.S. sent air carriers and the U.S. provided $14 billion in extra military aid and resupplied ammunition. Without that, Israel could not sustain one year against Gaza and now Lebanon and also Iran.""

Melman also noted that Bibi has failed to secure the freedom of 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

Caroline Glick, who served as an adviser to Netanyahu, took issue with criticism against him, pointing out, ""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage. Israel's other political leaders and military leadership all demanded that he capitulate to continuous pressure from the Biden-Harris administration to stand down and permit Hamas to survive and accept Hezbollah's continued presence on the border, sufficing with an entirely defensive posture.""

She continued, ""Had Israel agreed, its regional standing would have completely collapsed. He refused. His tenacious refusal to give up the fight and determination to fight to victory is the reason Israel has been able to turn the corner. Israel is winning today in a way that seemed unimaginable a year ago. We never would have made it to this turning point had it not been for Netanyahu."""
Harris' 'word salad' answer on Israel alliance confounds social media users: 'Someone please interpret',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-word-salad-answer-israel-alliance-confounds-social-media-users-someone-please-interpret,2024-10-07T13:03:40Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris did not directly answer a question about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's relationship with the U.S. and refused to say whether the U.S had any sway over him.

Vice President Kamala Harris was roasted on social media for a comment on Israel and how she ""can't make any sense at all"" in a new viral clip.

Harris gave a rare sit-down interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, where Bill Whitaker asked whether the U.S. has any ""sway"" over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war against Hamas continues. Monday marks one year since the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks,"" Harris responded.

She continued, ""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a cease-fire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

The lengthy ""word salad"" and her inability to commit to Israel as an ally shocked and frustrated several X users after the clip premiered.

""Kamala is asked about Israel, can't make any sense at all. Kamala is like a running team that's behind that can't throw the ball. After hiding her for months, they are now panicking and doing interviews everywhere. But that's going to get her behind more,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis, a supporter of former President Trump, wrote.

Former ESPN anchor Sage Steele asked, ""Someone please interpret what she just said here...""

""People talk this way when they have absolutely nothing substantive to say because they know next to nothing about the subject at hand,"" Federalist senior editor John Daniel Davidson said.

""Shocking,"" Fox News host Mark Levin exclaimed.

Comedian Tim Young commented, ""60 minutes asked Kamala if Netanyahu even listens to us after we give Israel weapons and money. Kamala replies with a pile of word salad. It would be easier if she just said that no world leader respects or listens to her even after we hand out money.""

""This is the real Kamala. And she's no friend of Israel,"" California Rep. Darrell Issa wrote.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik wrote, ""Israel is taking out Iranian-backed terrorists across the Middle East, making the world safer for Israel and the United States yet Kamala Harris refuses to say that Prime Minister Netanyahu is a strong ally to America. Kamala Harris is unfit to be the President of the United States.""

NEWT GINGRICH SOUNDS OFF ON KAMALA HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' INTERVIEWS, 'INSANE' POSITION ON ISRAEL-HAMAS

During the interview, Harris dodged repeated questions from Whitaker over her support for Israel.

Whitaker asked, ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

""I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes,"" Harris responded.

Harris was also criticized last month for providing scant details about whether she would change her policies on Israel as president.

Today marks one year since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, leading Israel to retaliate and catalyzing the war in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians.

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the U.S. and allies, the Middle East is on the precipice of a broader war as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. About 31% of Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who believe Israel is doing enough or should be doing more has fallen in the last 10 months.

The U.S. added far more jobs than expected in September, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. The Labor Department data delivered good news for investors on edge after July and August saw far weaker labor market expansion than expected.

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

One year ago today, Hamas launched an ambush attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. This unleashed the deadliest war in Palestinian history. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 41,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and fire. Now, Israel is bombing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Hear directly from people in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank as they describe how one year of this war has upended their lives. For more coverage marking this anniversary, check out NPR's special series page.

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""

Military officials say the Israeli Air Force ""intercepted five launches that crossed from the north of the Gaza Strip"" into Israel. The Jerusalem Post reported that two people were lightly injured after being hit with shrapnel.

""Sirens sounded in Israeli communities surrounding Gaza a few moments ago,"" the IDF wrote on X. ""At exactly this time last year, sirens were sounded all over Israel, marking the beginning of Hamas' October 7 massacre.""

The Israeli military said prior to the attack, its troops ""struck Hamas terror targets and launchers throughout the Gaza Strip"" in order to thwart ""an immediate threat.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a memorial in Jerusalem on Monday for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

""We remember our fallen, our hostages - whom we are committed to return - our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,"" he said.

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRAUMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

There are still 101 hostages who have been held in Gaza by Hamas since the start of the war. Thirty-six of them are declared dead and their bodies are being held by the terrorist group.

Idan Shtivi, a 28-year-old who volunteered to photograph the Nova music festival in southern Israel that Hamas attacked on Oct. 7, was declared dead on Monday.

Idan, an environmental sciences student, loved nature, camping, and music. He was planning to work in the energy sector to combat climate change and join an African volunteer program that aids children.

""On October 7, Idan arrived at the Nova Festival in the early morning to document his friends' performances and workshops. However, he never made it inside,"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. ""When the attack began, Idan helped two strangers he had just met escape from the site. This selfless choice ultimately led to his abduction.""

"Saving lives on 'Death Street,' how an Israeli kindergarten teacher became a battlefield hero on October 7",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/saving-lives-death-street-how-israeli-kindergarten-teacher-became-battlefield-hero-october-7,2024-10-07T11:32:10Z,"SOUTHERN ISRAEL - Tali Hadad is a 49-year-old mother of six and a kindergarten teacher whose days would normally be spent teaching basic reading, math and social skills to 5-year-olds. She never imagined that one day she would be forced to make life-or-death decisions while under fire in the middle of a war zone.

But on Oct. 7, 2023, she was thrust into unimaginable circumstances.

As Hamas launched its assault at 6:45 a.m., she awoke to the sound of sirens and gunfire in her hometown of Ofakim, a small, working-class city in southern Israel 15 miles from the border with Gaza. The piercing alarms that filled the air signaled this was not an ordinary rocket attack, to which much of the region had, over the course of many years, become accustomed.

ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS

Hadad instantly knew her family was in grave danger.

Her son, Itamar, a soldier in officer training, was home on leave for the weekend. As the sounds of gunfire grew closer, he grabbed his rifle, fully aware that there was fighting just outside their door. Without hesitation, he ran toward the terrorists. Hadad, still in her pajamas, quickly slipped on running shoes and chased after him, her instincts as a mother taking over.

""I ran toward the playground,"" Hadad told Fox News Digital. ""I hid behind a wall and saw a line of terrorists walking with rifles, heading in the direction where my son had gone."" Moments later, she heard gunshots. ""I knew Itamar was in the middle of it. I waited, hoping he would come out, but he didn't. So, I ran toward him.""

Dodging through alleys while gunfire rang out around her, Hadad saw the devastation unfold. ""People were yelling from windows, begging for help,"" she said. ""But there were no ambulances coming, no one to save them.""

Then, she saw Itamar. He had been shot multiple times - in the stomach, leg and thigh. Two of his comrades lay dead on the ground beside him.

""He looked at me and said, 'Mom, what are you doing here?' I told him, 'You're hurt, I'm going to take you to the hospital,'"" she recalled.

With gunfire still echoing around her, Hadad sprinted back to her house, jumped into the family car and drove straight back to her son. ""They put Itamar in the car, along with more of the wounded, and I drove as fast as I could, 120 kilometers per hour, to the Magen David Adom station (Israel's national emergency medical service) at the entrance to the city,"" she said. ""I knew if I drove slowly, the terrorists would shoot me.""

After handing Itamar over to the paramedics, she made a fateful decision. ""I told him, 'Mom isn't coming with you. You'll go in the ambulance, I'll join you later. I have to go back and help the others.'""

6 MONTHS ON, FAMILIES OF US HOSTAGES IN GAZA STUCK IN 'AMBIGUOUS TRAUMA'

Hadad returned to the scene of the fighting and made three more trips to rescue 13 people in total, all while under constant fire. ""People tried to stop me,"" she said. ""They told me it was too dangerous, but I took Itamar's rifle, and I knew this was something I had to do. I had no choice but to act.""

After hours of intense fighting involving police officers, forces from the Yamam special-operations unit, armed civilians and off-duty soldiers, Israeli forces regained control of the town. A helicopter arrived to evacuate the wounded. Only then was Hadad able to step away from her role as a rescuer and check on her son at the hospital. Itamar had survived, but his road to recovery would be long.

""Half of the rehabilitation is physical, and half is mental,"" Itamar Hadad told Fox News Digital, reflecting on the traumatic events of that day, the friends he lost in the battle, and those he has lost since in Gaza, where his unit, Sayeret Nahal, has suffered many casualties. Despite the pain, his dream remains to return to his unit and continue fighting.

AN INSIDE LOOK AT ISRAEL'S SPECIAL FORCES RESCUE UNIT FIGHTING TERRORISTS, RESCUING HOSTAGES: 'FULL ON FAUDA'

On Oct. 7, 47 of Ofakim's 50,000 residents were murdered, and the street where Hadad lives became known as Rechov Ha'Mavet - ""Death Street.""

A year after the attack, Ofakim is rebuilding. Death Street, once a symbol of horror, has been renovated. The city has built a memorial, painted murals and planted olive trees - a sign of life replacing the destruction.

""We've gathered the pieces, all the memories of the victims, and we're trying to bring life back to the place that was destroyed,"" Hadad said.

Ofakim was not among the many towns and settlements in the south that were resettled in other parts of Israel. But the psychological scars remain. The waiting list for trauma counseling has grown, overwhelming the available therapists. In response, the Israel Psychoanalytic Society and the NGO IsraAid established a multidisciplinary trauma center, offering free mental health support to survivors of the massacre.

Hadad, like many others in Ofakim, and in the entire country, continues to struggle with the emotional aftermath. ""We're still bleeding,"" she said. For her, the experience was life-changing. She hasn't returned to work since the attack, choosing, instead, to stay home and care for Itamar. Five of her six children are serving in the IDF, either on active duty or in the reserves. At the moment, two of them are fighting in Gaza. Her youngest daughter will enter the army in a month.

The community of Ofakim continues to heal, but the memories of Oct. 7 will never fade. ""We remember how our children ran through the streets barefoot, fighting like lions. No politicians come here anymore. No tour buses arrive. But we remember. We will always remember,"" Hadad said."

Opinion | Our son is still being held by Hamas. Bring him home now.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-hamas-hostages-october-7-anniversary-itay-chen-rcna173383,2024-10-07T10:15:04Z,"As the anniversary of the worst day of our lives approaches, we ask everyone to think of their own families.

We often think about the days before Oct. 7, 2023. Looking back now, we realize our lives were so simple and our problems were trivial. Our son Itay was just starting his adult life. While our lives have greatly changed over the past year, the tragedy we wake up to every morning has not. There are still 101 hostages, including our son, who remain captive in Gaza. Now, we spend each day in government meetings, protesting in the streets and running to the ends of the Earth to bring Itay and the rest of the hostages home.

Itay is an American citizen and Israel Defense Forces soldier who was stationed on the Israeli border with Gaza on Oct. 7. He bravely fought to protect Israeli civilians and was abducted and kidnapped into Gaza.

On March 12, we heard a knock on our front door that still rings loud in our ears. Our stomachs dropped as we opened the door and were told our precious son had been murdered by Hamas terrorists. With so much misinformation swirling around this conflict, we still don't know what to believe. We question whether or not he survived. We are holding out hope that Itay is still alive.

A year after Oct. 7, we wonder how much longer we have to beg world leaders to do their jobs and secure a hostage release deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government have failed our son and all the hostages. Each day a deal is delayed -- and our children, parents, brothers and sisters remain in the hands of ruthless terrorists -- is another second they are closer to death.

Prime Minister Netanyahu promised a deal was imminent when he addressed Congress back in July. His lies erode our sense of hope. Qatar and Egypt have failed to effectively pressure Hamas to accept a deal, and each time we are close, Hamas pushes the goalpost.

Will one year turn into two? Or three? Will this unimaginable nightmare continue forever?

Our family is deeply appreciative of the Biden administration's tireless efforts to secure an immediate and total release. But it is not enough.

Last week in Washington, we met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan for our 13th in-person meeting. We met with CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Although our meetings have been productive, we ask that key assumptions be challenged, methods be re-evaluated and new tactics be considered.

Itay and the 100 other hostages are depending on us. This administration is running out of time before the election and a changing of the guard. Nothing should hold them back from securing a deal to release the hostages -- who include seven U.S. citizens.

We just observed Rosh Hashanah -- the Jewish New Year. This holiday is a moment for serious introspection and anticipation for what is to come. We traditionally eat apples and honey to signify a ""sweet"" start. What could possibly be ""sweet"" about this new year? How many more holidays will there be an empty chair at our table? Our Rosh Hashanah wishes were simple: Do everything to bring the hostages home now. Before it is too late.

Our family forever broke on Oct. 7. Since then, we wear tape on our clothes reminding the world of how many days we have endured life without Itay.

As we prepare to write ""365"" days and tape that number to our chests, we ask: How much longer? The remaining hostages are being executed, and we are on borrowed time. As the anniversary of the worst day of our lives approaches, we ask everyone to think of their own families.

What would you do to bring your loved one home? Imagine the ends of the Earth to which you'd run to see them maybe just once more. Enough is enough. Our world leaders must get the deal done now."
"Opinion | On a grim Oct. 7 anniversary, the potential for wider war has never felt greater",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-october-7-anniversary-biden-netanyahus-iran-rcna174175,2024-10-07T10:14:59Z,"By Andrea Mitchell, NBC Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent; Host, 'Andrea Mitchell Reports'

A year ago, Israel and Saudi Arabia were talking with the U.S. at the United Nations meetings in New York about an agreement that could end hostilities between Israel and its Arab neighbors, reshaping the Middle East. Then Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, taking hostages and slaughtering around 1,200 Israelis. A year after the Oct. 7 massacre, most of the surviving hostages have not been released, more than 40,000 Gazans have died according to according to local health authorities, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's popularity at home is soaring because of his military successes against Hezbollah, and the Biden administration has less influence than ever over Israel's decision-making.

With Israel and Iran now teetering on the verge of all-out war, administration officials fear these escalating retaliatory exchanges could explode into a regional conflict -- exactly what President Joe Biden has been trying to prevent since the day after Hamas' surprise attack, when Hezbollah joined in and started sending rockets toward Israel.

Asked why the U.S. -- Israel's largest provider of weapons -- has so little leverage over its closest ally, a senior official told me, ""We have leverage, we haven't always used it."" And administration officials say Netanyahu now sees a brief window before the U.S. election to try to eliminate what he says is an existential threat to Israel's survival: Iran and its terrorist proxies' determination to eliminate Israel as an independent state.

So how did Netanyahu resurrect his political support at home, which had all but collapsed after his military and intelligence agencies failed to detect the Hamas attack? It's been a long and dangerous 12 months.

In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, there was worldwide horror and sympathy. But a few weeks later, when Israel bombed the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza in an effort to kill a Hamas commander, the videos went viral. Analysis from satellite images suggested Israel had used 2,000-pound ""bunker buster"" bombs, capable of causing massive damage to anyone within hundreds of feet of impact.

The Arab world, the European public and protesters in the U.S. were outraged. Leading Democratic senators and lifelong supporters of Israel told me privately they were horrified at what they saw as a disproportionate use of force. Foreign service officers at the State Department complained about the use of an American-made bomb in the strike, a potential violation of congressionally mandated restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons. Meanwhile Israel's initial siege of Gaza, which had cut off food, water and fuel, was creating a desperate humanitarian crisis.

For 11 months, CIA Director William Burns and Secretary of State Tony Blinken shuttled around the Middle East, negotiating with Israel, Egypt and Qatar -- which represents Hamas -- for a cease-fire and hostage release. There was one brief cease-fire in November, and more than 100 hostages from all over the world returned home. But every time Blinken anticipated or announced another imminent breakthrough, Netanyahu or Hamas -- or both -- would raise the stakes. On his 10th mission to the region, Blinken didn't even stop in Israel. There was no deal to be had.

And then Hamas executed American Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages, a devastating blow to their courageous families.

The dominos continued to fall. In April, Iran retaliated for Israel's bombing of an Iranian consulate in Damascus. Israel intercepted all but one of the drones and missiles with the help of the U.S. and other allies. Then, a rocket believed to have been fired by Hezbollah hit a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 youngsters. Israel again upped the ante, assassinating the Hamas political director in Iran's capital -- a dramatic display of Israel's ability to penetrate Iranian defenses.

Arguably Israel's most stunning demonstration of its reach was a coordinated operation that resulted in thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploding, often in public. Dozens died and thousands were injured, according to Lebanese health officials. This was followed by the targeted assassination of the veteran Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a killing Netanyahu approved from New York, just after addressing the United Nations General Assembly. Briefing reporters a few hours later, a senior Israeli official told us Israel would continue trying to eliminate Hezbollah, saying when your enemy is down, you don't let him up.

But today, as Israel commemorates the grim anniversary of Oct. 7, hostage families live in dread of their loved ones being killed. Meanwhile, Biden seems paralyzed. As one U.S. official told me, Netanyahu knows Biden is in a political straightjacket. An emboldened Netanyahu will yet again likely ignore the president's calls for a proportionate response; the Israeli leader may even take this moment to deal a decisive blow to Iran. A Saudi deal with Israel seems dead, for now. And the potential for a wider war involving the U.S. has never been greater."
Vigils and protests mark one year since Hamas attacks on Israel as fighting rages on,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26634/october-7-israel-gaza-lebanon,2024-10-07T09:59:01Z,"Two people embrace as relatives and supporters of Israelis killed in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack attend a ceremony at the Nova memorial near Kibbutz Reim in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2024.

Memorial services across Israel are taking place Monday, a year on since Hamas' attacks on communities close to the country's border with Gaza, and as the Israeli military extends its retaliation against the group in Gaza as well as on Hezbollah targets to the north in Lebanon.

Twelve months ago, fighters from Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and several other nations, killed around 1,200 people and seized more than 200 hostages from inside Israel, according to the Israeli government.

The ensuing war in Gaza has killed at least 41,900 Palestinians and wounded more than 97,300, according to Gaza's health ministry on Monday.

In Lebanon, where Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets on Israel in support of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza, the death toll has risen above 2,000, according to Lebanese officials. Israeli airstrikes continued to pound parts of the capital Beirut overnight into Monday, after rockets launched from Lebanon hit the Israeli port city of Haifa Sunday. The United Nations says more than 1 million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes, including tens of thousands who have fled across the border into neighboring Syria.

Across the world, candlelight vigils are taking place Monday to commemorate those killed in the surprise Hamas attacks one year ago, with thousands planning to gather, from Tel Aviv to Paris to New York, as well as marches and protests to demand a cease-fire, particularly in Gaza.

Talks to produce a cease-fire, which many Israelis hope would see the estimated remaining 101 hostages released by Hamas, are on hold.

Across Israel, memorial events will mark the deadliest day in the country's history. The government has organized one, another is being led by the family members of Israeli taken hostage or killed, and more are being held in locations close to Gaza where the attacks happened last year.

One of those is at the Nova music festival site, where Israelis gathered Monday to listen to the last track of music played there before Hamas fighters ambushed festival-goers.

A wail in the crowd pierced a moment of silence, as attendees remembered the more than 360 people killed at the site a year ago.

""We tried to wake up from this nightmare, but we cannot,"" said Ofir Duchovne, who was there to mourn his 26-year-old friend. ""I did not imagine that the war would be so long in Gaza. And now we have another front on the north and with Iran,"" Duchovne said. ""And we're stuck. Nothing has changed.""

Nearby, frequent Israeli artillery fire into Gaza was audible, and the Israeli military said it had responded with airstrikes to rockets had been launched out of Gaza at almost the same moment they had done a year ago, at the start of the current war.

At another rally in nearby Kibbutz Be'eri, a community close to Gaza where almost 100 residents were killed and more than two dozen hostages seized, the plight of those still held inside Gaza was central to the event.

""Wars do not end in absolute victory or a clear decision, wars end in agreements,"" said Merav Svirsky, whose brother Itay Svirsky was taken hostage and then killed in January in Gaza. ""The question is, with how many human lives will we pay by then? The lives of soldiers, the lives of civilians and the lives of civilians including our people who are currently hostage in Gaza and have been in immediate life-threatening danger for a year."""
One year after 10/7 attacks and Democrat-run states have let antisemitism fester,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-attacks-democrat-run-states-have-let-antisemitism-fester,2024-10-07T09:22:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

October 7th was the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas invaded Israel, murdering people at random, raping, destroying homes and kidnapping people back to Gaza. There are more than 100 still held hostage, including four Americans.

Raw and hurting, American Jews watched the streets of U.S. cities fill up with crowds. The people in the streets weren't marching to stand with the slaughtered and the raped. They were gleeful, exuberant and there were many of them.

In New York's Times Square, hundreds of people gathered on October 8, while Israel was still sorting through their dead, and counting how many children and elderly had been kidnapped, to flash swastikas and chant ""death to Israel"" as well as ""700,"" the number of Israeli dead counted at the time. That number was later revised to 1,195.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

In Los Angeles, it's been nearly a year of violent protests outside synagogues and in Jewish neighborhoods. One Jewish man was killed after a confrontation in November.

It seemed like antisemitism was festering all over the country.

But a closer look showed that it wasn't, actually, happening everywhere, it was very specifically happening in places primarily run by Democrats. It's not that antisemitism can't exist in red areas. It can, it does. Vandalism, verbal harassment, even physical assault can happen in Republican-led places. But the occurrence is far rarer and the real difference is the consequences.

According to the Anti Defamation League (ADL) ""The states with the highest number of incidents were California (1,266), New York (1,218), New Jersey (830), Florida (463) and Massachusetts (440)."" Four of those states are blue states. In my red home state of Florida, we had approximately the same number of incidents as Massachusetts while having about three times the population and a third of the incidents of New York despite having over 2 million more people.

The ADL is a left-leaning Jewish organization, and yet they admit, ""On a per capita basis, the states with the highest concentration of antisemitic incidents were New Jersey - with 8.93 incidents per 100,000 residents - followed by Vermont (6.64), Massachusetts (6.28), New York (6.23), Maryland (5.49) and Connecticut (5.09). On the city level, two cities - Manhattan (26.84 per 100,000) and Washington, D.C. (25.75 per 100,000) - stood out with far and away the highest levels of incidents per capita. Brookyln [sic], NY, stood out specifically in terms of physical assault incidents, with 1.16 assaults per 100,000 residents."" Again, all deep blue states and cities.

The argument to defend the blue states, and their rampant antisemitism, is that Jews primarily live in those blue states, so of course, antisemitism will be higher. But that doesn't explain Florida's low count. It's also hard not to notice that Mississippi had 19 incidents of vandalism and harassment while New Hampshire had 35 when they each have under 1% of their population being Jewish and Mississippi is nearly double New Hampshire's population. There is a pattern, and it's related to whom the population elects.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

Last October, Dr. Ahmed ElKoussa was fired from his job as a Miami dentist after ripping down posters of kidnapped hostages being held by Hamas. Anti-Israel agitators protested outside Real-Time Laboratories, an American company which is a subsidiary of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, in Boca Raton, but were met with even more pro-Israel protesters. When the anti-Israel protesters got violent, Boca Raton Police immediately took action and made arrests.

And in May, when anti-Israel protesters pulled their usual move of attempting to block a highway in Orlando, they lasted a total of 11 minutes before Florida Highway Patrol arrested them. Governor Ron DeSantis boasted, ""I think that's the world record.""

Meanwhile, in New York, the Manhattan district attorney has dropped all charges against the violent anti-Israel protesters who occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall. In California, protesters have spent the last year blocking traffic for the Palestinian cause. Only some incidents yielded arrests. In March, protesters stopped traffic outside San Francisco International Airport and blocked security lines inside for four hours. No one was arrested. This simply does not happen in red states.

School campuses in red states were relatively quiet, while Ivy League campuses in the northeast featured Jewish students being told to ""go back to Poland"" and assaulted. The protests that did spring up on red state campuses were quickly brought under control.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

It was obvious to the students at some of the red-state universities that the protests were about Israel, yes, but they were about America too. U.S. flags were often torn down and replaced with Palestinian flags. At the University of North Carolina, fraternity brothers protected an American flag from being defaced, while at Princeton University, protesting students halted a Memorial Day parade because it featured an American flag.

Open antisemitism exposes a deep rot in societies and the hatred of Jews for the last year has caused many to notice that the same people hate America too. History is filled with examples of governments and societies that no longer exist because succumbing to the world's oldest hatred was a clear sign that their civilization was on a downhill trajectory. What is happening in blue cities is exposing their own decay.

Cities, like New York, that had been prospering not so long ago have had a hard time bouncing back from the bad policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the rolling back of crime policies during the Bill de Blasio administration. Antisemitism is a symptom of a larger problem and places that control antisemitic activity can count on flourishing in a way that places that don't won't. Jew-hatred can happen anywhere, the acceptance of it does not."

One year ago, Iran took a gamble and started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostages

A year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.

For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won't back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He's that worried.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

You can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first is restoring Israel's security and carrying out the military destruction of Iran's terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.

Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.

Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

Iran couldn't stand it.

Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""

""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.

""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.

The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.

Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.

You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.

Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.

To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.

Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel's multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.

This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.

Officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.

And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.

Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn't ready.

Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.

Israel's systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah's leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.

A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran's power may be required.

Despite Israel's military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran's missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn't, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can't go on forever (although China would like it).

The path ahead depends on restoring Israel's security and taking out Iran's capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It's not easy - the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

And it's important for Americans to stay committed to Israel's security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by the shock unleashing of antisemitism. Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above. We Americans have to do better than this.

Don't forget that in the words of the Justice Department's Indictment of Hamas, the government of Iran's regional and global campaign of terrorism aims to ""weaken and ultimately destroy both the United States and Israel.""

America's best interest remains to support Israel - and take all military steps necessary to get back to the regional diplomacy that will shut down Iran for good."
New Jersey high school allegedly banned yellow ribbons honoring Israeli hostages: 'Deeply offensive',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-jersey-high-school-allegedly-banned-yellow-ribbons-honoring-israeli-hostages-deeply-offensive,2024-10-07T09:06:55Z,"October 7th Nova festival survivor Millet Ben Haim shares the harsh reality of the Israel-Hamas war as the one-year anniversary nears.

A New Jersey high school is accused of banning yellow ribbons, aimed at honoring Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas, at a club fair, a move critics described as ""deeply offensive"" and ""blatant antisemitism.""

Fair Lawn High School also prohibited Israeli flags at the event, because administrators believed the flags were too political, some parents and the group StopAntisemitism allege, noting that members of the Muslim Student Association were permitted to display a keffiyeh, a traditional headdress worn by men from parts of the Middle East, according to the New York Post.

The event, according to the report, was partly promoting a trip to Israel.

""What happened at Fair Lawn High School is an alarming case of hypocrisy and blatant antisemitism,"" StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez told the outlet. ""This incident is nothing short of a direct violation of Jewish students' rights to express their identity and humanitarian concerns.""

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Between 33% to 40% of the 35,000 residents in Fair Lawn are Jewish. Fair Lawn in Bergen County is located about 17 miles from New York City.

This comes a year after Hamas terrorists' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks against Israel, which led to military retaliation from Israel and sparked a still-ongoing war in the Middle East. More than 250 people, including some Americans, were abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks. Many hostages have since been released, rescued or killed, while dozens are still held by Hamas.

One parent said the school district's failure to address complaints about alleged antisemitism is not a new concern.

""The incident at Fair Lawn High School's Club Fair is not an isolated event but part of a disturbing pattern of antisemitism that I and other parents have been battling for years,"" Adi Vaxman, founder and president of Operation Israel, which provides humanitarian relief to Israel, told the New York Post.

""Despite numerous meetings with the board of education and the superintendent, promises of inclusion in anti-antisemitism efforts have gone unfulfilled,"" added Vaxman, whose daughter Maya attends the school.

Vaxman continued: ""The administrator's claim that the yellow hostage ribbon -- a humanitarian symbol calling for the release of innocent civilians abducted from their homes and held in subhuman conditions by Hamas -- is 'political' is deeply offensive and unacceptable.""

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRAUMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

Claiming a double standard, Vaxman said that the black-and-white keffiyeh, which she says is ""a symbol of the armed resistance against Israelis,"" was allowed to remain on display at the club event for hours.

""This glaring double standard exposes the bias of the school and the administrator in question,"" she said. ""It's alarming that the school supports the Muslim Student Association identifying as Palestinian while censoring the Israeli flag for the Jewish Student Union. Israel is the world's only Jewish state, naturally associated with Judaism and relevant to the [Jewish Student Union's] advertised trip to Israel.""

Fair Lawn High Principal Paul Gorski released a statement defending the school's response to ribbons and flags.

""We take pride in our Student Activities program as well as the leadership shown by both students and faculty,"" Gorski wrote. ""During this year's event, both the Muslim Student Association and the Jewish Student Union were asked to adjust items that were not part of their original displays. Both groups received the same instruction and were treated equally.""

Gorski said no students were disciplined in connection with their participation at the club fair.

The principal also said the high school participates in the Anti-Defamation League's ""No Place for Hate"" initiative and that the school was ""proudly recognized"" with a Gold Star distinction from the group during a ceremony earlier this year.

""We condemn antisemitism and remain steadfast in our commitment to creating an inclusive community where hate is not tolerated,"" he said. ""When we return to school after being closed for the Jewish holidays, we will engage in dialogue with our students and community. Hate has no home at Fair Lawn High School.""

Vaxman, however, maintains that the school discriminated against Jewish students during the club fair.

""This selective application of rules further demonstrates the discriminatory treatment of Jewish students,"" Vaxman said. ""The school's response is extremely disappointing and fails to address these core issues. Their participation in the 'No Place for Hate' initiative rings hollow when Jewish students face such blatant discrimination and intimidation in their school on a regular basis. We demand concrete actions, not empty platitudes, to combat antisemitism and ensure true equality for 'all' students."""
"The Israeli village grieving the biggest loss from Oct. 7, one year later",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-25787/israel-october-7-kibbutz-beeri-hamas-attack-anniversary,2024-10-07T09:02:50Z,"Gal Cohen, the head of Kibbutz Be'eri, stands with his daughter Mia, 22, in their home close to the border with Gaza. They survived the Oct. 7 attack locked in their home's safe room. Cohen's goal is to rehabilitate the kibbutz and bring all the survivors back within two and a half years. Maya Levin for NPR hide caption

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

KIBBUTZ BE'ERI, Israel -- The natural course of grieving is distorted here, a year after the Oct. 7 attacks.

This tight-knit Israeli community near the Gaza border is digging up its dead from temporary graves further away and reburying them back home, where it is safer to gather now, a year into the Gaza war.

""I'm so exhausted after every funeral that we have to deal with again,"" said Gal Cohen, the head of the kibbutz. ""Because it brings [back] everything, and we cry again.""

Israeli authorities say about 1,200 people were killed last Oct. 7, as Hamas led thousands of attackers bursting out of Gaza, ambushing Israeli towns and communities. Kibbutz Be'eri suffered the biggest loss of any single village: 102 people killed -- about one out of every 13 people living there.

The deadliest single attack in Israeli history led to the deadliest war in Palestinian history, with more than 41,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip this past year, according to health officials there.

This year, Kibbutz Be'eri has grappled with questions of death, memory, guilt and vengeance.

""Questions from [the] inferno, really,"" says Merav Roth, a prominent Israeli psychologist, and the sister of former Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid, who has counseled the kibbutz members all year long.

This is the story of some of their answers.

Silence is what helped keep the survivors of this small community alive the day of the attack. Silence is what they carried out of hiding from their safe rooms along the Gaza border to a hotel on the Dead Sea that took them in.

""It was the most quiet place I've ever seen,"" says Roth, who met them there. ""Everybody were quiet, defeated. Their bodies were, like, no air inside.""

She had heard their whispers on Oct. 7, carried live on the news.

""The Israelis, we all were on the radio, hearing them whispering to the radio people: 'Why doesn't anyone come? Where are everybody? Where's the army? They're in my house, they're shooting at me.' We will remember this for the rest of our lives, all of us,"" Roth says.

When the Israeli military eventually published its investigation into the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, it found about 340 attackers had infiltrated the community and that it had taken about seven hours for significant numbers of Israeli forces to arrive to fight off the invasion there.

It took many weeks to account for everyone: who was dead, who was captive in Gaza. Roth sat with the survivors of Kibbutz Be'eri in the Dead Sea hotel basement as the village secretary read the names of 27 identified bodies and 108 people unaccounted for.

""It's just name by name by name,"" Roth said. ""Everybody are, again, quiet, dead quiet.""

This year, Roth has helped the kibbutz make agonizing decisions.

""For instance, there is a boy in the kibbutz who lost four members of his family, two parents and two siblings. So do we tell him about each separately or do we tell him about all of them together?"" she says.

Roth has also counseled former hostages who returned from Hamas captivity in Gaza, families whose loved ones were killed in captivity, and Israelis who didn't experience a personal loss but still suffer from sleeping difficulties, anxiety attacks and depression.

""They are extremely anxious about the future of this place. Many of them leave the country. Because their parents told them that in the Holocaust, those who didn't leave, died,"" she says. ""Hopelessness and helplessness are so strong. The trauma is national.""

From the very first days after the Oct. 7 attack, Roth coached other therapists how to respond.

""When I gave guidelines to the therapists in Be'eri at the beginning, I said, smile and say, how are you? Because these people don't know that it still matters. You have to show them that their wellbeing is still relevant. The life instinct wants to see that someone calls him back.""

At Kibbutz Be'eri, one recent afternoon, teens and parents walked quietly out of the neighborhood cemetery after a funeral for a mother and her 15-year-old son -- two of the many reburials of recent months.

Reburied with the boy was his surfboard: his dying wish as he bled out in his home Oct. 7.

Batya Ofir attended the funeral. She recently reburied her own brother and his family in the kibbutz cemetery, after viewing his partially decomposed body be exhumed from its temporary grave.

""It was not easy,"" she says, ""but I had to see him.""

She wanted to be with his body at the moment it was unearthed. She had not lived on the kibbutz any longer and felt guilty she wasn't with her brother and family in their worst moment on Oct. 7.

Ofir says she made a decision, after her brother was killed.

""I said to myself, what do you want? To continue living? I can also not. I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she says. ""I have a family, I have children, I have grandchildren. I draw. I'm learning to kayak, to deal with all my fears. I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

A couple hundred families have moved back to Kibbutz Be'eri. Cohen, the head of the community, is overseeing an ambitious project to bring the residents back within two and a half years.

The kibbutz has broken ground on a new neighborhood of 52 homes.

A short walk away, though, are the homes that were attacked last year. Bullet holes, shattered windows, a pair of children's shoes in the debris: Oct. 7 frozen in time.

There's a debate in the community about what to do with these broken homes. Cohen says it will be put up for a vote.

""Some of the people say, let's make it like Auschwitz. Okay? And it'll be open for people to come and see what happened here,"" he says.

But he says others who survived the attack are taking sleeping pills to cope with the trauma and cannot bear seeing the destroyed homes. ""I believe we'll have to take them all down in the end.""

He doesn't want one person moving back to the kibbutz to see the remnants and relive the nightmare.

Yasmin Raanan, 56, waters her new plants on her patio. She and her husband moved back home to the kibbutz from the Dead Sea hotel a few months ago.

On Oct. 7, she grabbed her personal firearm, and she and her husband locked themselves inside their reinforced shelter room at home. They survived the attack because they had installed a sliding bolt on the safe room. The attackers tried but failed to open the door. Her neighbors' safe rooms only had the standard locks and were breached.

When she was finally rescued that night, and led out of her safe room, she found her living room floor covered in rows of grenades, gas canisters, explosives, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. She understood: Her home had been transformed into the attack headquarters. Neighbors all around her were gunned down.

Then she saw the man she had heard all day loading gun cartridges in her home. He was sitting outside, she says, stripped naked by orders of the military, and guarded by an Israeli soldier.

""I came with my gun to kill him,"" she recalls. ""A commando soldier said, 'Ma'am, we are a moral people.' I said, 'I have no more morals anymore.'""

The commando took away her weapon, and she says she took the attacker's face in her hands and demanded to know his name. He gave it.

One year later, the Israeli military has left much of Gaza in ruins. That gives her a measure of comfort.

And one year on, the passage of time has taken some of the edge off her anger.

""A year later, things sink in a bit,"" she says. ""Time heals."""

The 2023 attack perpetrated by Hamas terrorists saw about 1,200 die and hundreds be taken to Gaza as hostages.

There are roughly 100 hostages reported to still remain in Gaza, and it is believed that fewer than 70 of them are alive, according to the Associated Press.

In the lead-up to the attack's anniversary, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement warning of hate crimes or violence: ""Jewish, Muslim, or Arab institutions - including synagogues, mosques/Islamic centers, and community centers - and large public gatherings, such as memorials, vigils, or other lawful demonstrations, present attractive targets for violent attacks or for hoax threats by a variety of threat actors, including violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators,"" it stated.

A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), also released before the attack's one-year anniversary, revealed that after Oct. 7, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose more than 200% from the year prior.

According to the ADL, there were more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents after the Hamas terrorist attack, which was more than any other year since the ADL began recording them in 1979.

In a Hebrew message to Israeli citizens after Rosh Hashanah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recounted the months of war on multiple fronts and touted recent military successes in taking out key Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist leaders.

""Citizens of Israel, as the New Year dawns upon us, we do not forget, and I do not forget, our 101 hostages in Gaza, to whom we are fully committed to bringing back home,"" he said in a translated quote."
"One-year anniversary of Oct. 7 attacks arrives with lasting trauma for Israelis, American Jews: expert",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-year-anniversary-oct-7-attacks-arrives-lasting-trauma-israelis-american-jews-expert,2024-10-07T08:23:04Z,"Dr. David Fox, a director at Chai Lifeline International, spoke to the lasting ""traumatization"" of Oct. 7 survivors and the families of victims, as well as the lingering impact on civilian life, one year after the attacks.

Life in Israel one year after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks is far from a return to normal, as one expert explained to Fox News Digital what it's like dealing with the psychological fallout of the massacre while living near an active war zone - and even the lasting consequences for American Jews 12 months later.

Dr. David Fox, director of crisis and trauma services for Chai Lifeline International, a Jewish nonprofit and network supporting families living with illness or loss, said he's traveled to Israel multiple times over the last year to meet with hostages' families and consult with survivors' families on the ground.

""I think Oct. 7 will remain seared into the consciousness of Jews and of Israelis,"" Fox told Fox News Digital. ""It's sometimes just referred to as 'the seventh' or as 'October.' October is not an Israeli or Hebrew word, but that's what it's been called. So I don't think it will ever be forgotten as an infamous day of what has become an ongoing battle for survival.""

The Los Angeles-based rabbi described to Fox News Digital how daily life in Israel remains uprooted: Tens of thousands of Israelis are internally displaced, and Israeli families must adjust as parents who were in the Army Reserves are tapped again for active duty. With a cease-fire and hostage release deal still yet to actualize, Fox also explained the lasting trauma and constant fear of another attack -- especially in border areas.

Fox said he spoke to one of the country's most prominent infertility specialists who transitioned from his day-to-day life as a gynecologist and obstetrician back into military service.

The doctor now spends his days crawling onto the battlefield to rescue soldiers who have been hit and carry them back to ambulances to be transported to hospitals.

ISRAELI AIR FORCE STRIKES HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN WITH 'EXTENSIVE' OPERATION

""The families of those reservists who have now been activated and deployed, they may not see daddy for weeks or sometimes months at a time. Spouses may not see one another for a while... and there is that apprehension. Will he or will she return? So that has been a crisis for many individuals,"" Fox explained. ""On the other hand, those who serve in the IDF and the armed forces, they do it with a strong sense of conviction that we're doing the right thing, and we're doing really what God wants, but we're doing what our families need us to be doing right now. So those unfortunate separations don't end up fragmenting the family.""

""But I believe in most situations, the children will look up to that parent who has to be away,"" Fox said. ""They'll look up with love and admiration. But this has definitely been a change in what goes on on the ground, that family life has been changed.""

A heightened threat environment is especially palpable in moshavs, which are cooperative Jewish agricultural settlements in Israel. Fox cited a recent conversation with members of one moshav, which was ""surrounded by villages which were hostile,"" where settlers could hear messages broadcast from prayer towers or minarets calling out for attacks against Jews.

""Some of them are armed and many of them are not,"" Fox said of the Jewish residents. ""The army and security guards may not always be available at this point to shelter, to protect civilians. So there is a feeling of fluidity. The situation is changing.""

Over the past year, Fox said Chai Lifeline worked to expand its crisis hotline to provide ""around the clock"" support, as well as Zoom counseling, trauma intervention and other materials to Israelis or people who had family in Israel who witnessed the horrors of Hamas terrorists slaughtering approximately 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages on Oct. 7, 2023. Since then, the rabbi said he observed another societal change among young Israelis ""who are politically conscious"" as they look at the ""response or non-response of other countries, of the Red Cross or the United Nations"" and are ""rethinking their confidence in who we trust.""

""An ally who's with you in peace time, but who ignores you or turns against you in times of strife is not an ally,"" Fox said.

""The world does not expect the Jews to fight back,"" he added. ""The world does not expect a small country who has faced massacre and slaughter to get up and protect itself by going on the, let's say, the avenging offense. And we do have to face the condemnation of many of the sanctions of others. But I think a groundswell of understanding from still others that we are fighting to survive, and we are doing what any other country would do. If citizens were attacked and raped and mutilated and butchered, and their homes desecrated, I think we are doing what virtually any sovereign nation would do if its people were attacked.""

The trauma of the Oct. 7 attacks, Fox said, has remained for Israeli civilians and the families of hostages, including those who are still held in Gaza and are subjected to deprivation and torture.

Yet, Fox said there's also a bolstered sense of support among the Israeli people in supporting each other as the Jewish state continues its war effort.

""We know that there is a constant punctuation of the reactive grief by an intensification of horror and feeling terrorized,"" Fox told Fox News Digital. ""The attitude of the Jewish people historically and of the Israeli nation since its inception has been to react to oppression by displays of resilience coming together.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI IN HIDING WITH EXTRA SECURITY FOLLOWING HEZBOLLAH LEADER'S DEATH: REPORT

The rabbi told Fox News Digital that he has been directly in touch with Israeli families who've retreated from their homes in the north along the Lebanon border amid the Israeli military's escalating skirmishes and exchanges of rocket fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists, as well as people who have fled their homes in the south along the border with Hamas-controlled Gaza. Fox spoke to the continued need for intervention services, as people ""out of familiar territory"" have been finding ""it's very difficult to feel grounded emotionally and spiritually when you're not sure what's going to happen next, when you're not sure where to go.""

""There are families uprooted from their homes, nothing to go back to. All their belongings vanished,"" Fox said. ""But the country and its people, its blessed people, have absorbed those who have nowhere to go. And other communities have welcomed those in need of shelter. And we're finding ways to get them into schools with their children and to give them some type of financial support or even employment if that's needed.""

""There's also an upsurge in the principles that really have defined the Jewish religion in terms of loving kindness, charitable loss, compassion and caring for one another,"" the rabbi added. ""So there is this resounding feeling that we're in this together. We're going to help each other. Nonetheless, there's traumatization.""

""There's the abject traumatization of those who were part of the targeted massacres, who still have the imprint of what they saw, what they heard, what they witnessed, and some of them what they endured physically and mentally themselves,"" Fox explained. ""So there has been a definite need for trauma intervention services. We've been providing some of that.""

His work also extends to supporting Jewish Americans experiencing rising antisemitism in the United States.

Anti-Israel protests reached a fever pitch last spring at U.S. college campuses. With the return of the fall semester and the Oct. 7 anniversary approaching, Fox said there's a lot he unfortunately can't control.

""I think there's a lot we can't do,"" Fox said. ""Despite the fact that we're offering support, we can't get away from the fact that there is a new fear in the air, and it's based on a credible threat. And how that will pan out in the course of time, whether the bigotry and the prejudice will skyrocket again or whether it will come down. I don't think any of us can predict.""

Fox also pointed to attrition, as more Jewish students opt to transfer to Jewish institutions and out of major elite American universities. He made a parallel with what happened in Germany leading up to the Second World War and noted that, in the present day, leadership at universities seem to ""close their eyes"" or ""at times seem to condone"" antisemitism, causing Jewish students and parents to no longer feel safe.

""We saw this in Germany in the 1930s, where professors were fired from their positions if they were Jewish and students were, if they were Jewish, might not be admitted into the medical school or into the graduate school. So we've seen this before. That was because of the political governing of the state of Germany. What we're seeing here is not coming from the White House,"" Fox said. ""It's coming from other influences, other attractions. And the government or the police in some cases are just tolerating, and as I said earlier, at times, are condoning this. So it has some parallels, some echoes of pre-World War II.""

""There is a sea of change, I believe, in the attitudes shown toward Jewish people. We didn't think it would happen in America,"" he added."

""When was the last time you talked to your kid? Do you know where he slept last night? Do you know what he ate? Do you know if he had a blanket on him?"" Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen who was taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, asked in a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital.

""All those types of questions are questions that we ask ourselves constantly,"" he said. ""The feeling is that we've been failed.""

Itay,19 years old when he was taken, has remained a hostage held in Gaza for 365 days after his unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was attacked in southern Israel when Hamas terrorists flooded the border in a series of mass assaults.

Chen, a New York City native, said he and his wife have been given ""unprecedented"" access to the White House, the CIA and other top agencies throughout the last year to discuss ongoing strategies to try and get the hostages out of Gaza.

ISRAEL SAYS TOP HAMAS RAFAH BRIGADE 'DISMANTLED' ON PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR, 2,000 TERRORISTS KILLED

The Chens have not only met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan a dozen times, as well as CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, they also hold a weekly call with the White House.

But ultimately, these supportive efforts have fallen flat when it comes to the real needs of American families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas.

""We have been failed by the Israeli government, we, as U.S. citizens, feel we've been failed by the Biden administration despite all of the access that they've provided us,"" he explained. ""They share as much as they can. But at the end of the day, it's... very black and white.

""Where is he?""

Chen explained that following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the Israeli government pushed a strategy to secure the release of the then 251 hostages by bombarding suspected Hamas positions in Gaza.

In the initial weeks following the deadly Hamas attacks, Israel began pounding northern Gaza - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed would bring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ""to his knees"" and make him be ""willing to release hostages.""

A week-long cease-fire in November saw the release of 105 hostages. Twelve other hostages have been freed following negotiations during the immediate aftermath of the attack, or because of IDF rescue operations between February and August.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

None of the eight American hostages that were kidnapped have been released, and only seven continue to be held by Hamas after the body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was discovered by IDF forces in late August, after he along with five others were killed by the terrorist group.

More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip - 97 of whom were abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Chens, other American families and the international community have repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement and return all hostages to their families.

But disagreements over security corridors in Gaza have created a seemingly insurmountable hurdle as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari officials work to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement.

The father of the IDF soldier pointed out that so long as no one is discussing a ""day after"" plan for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians there, Hamas will continue to hold tightly to its most powerful bargaining chip, the hostages.

""Where is Hamas in the day-after? And if no one is willing to talk about it, then Hamas believes that they are better off holding on to the hostages until something changes,"" he explained. ""It's a jihad organization. They wish to have chaos. They are looking for a regional conflict.

""When they see that there's now a conflict with Lebanon, that does not motivate them to get into a cease-fire agreement. On the contrary, they wish to belong, and have other players join in this jihad against Israel,"" Chen continued. ""So I question, what is the plan?""

""I am very critical of the time,"" Itay's father said. ""The last 10 months, I've been asking Mr. Sullivan, What's plan B?

""I haven't heard of a Plan B. And that's unacceptable,"" he added.

BLINKEN TRAVELS TO EGYPT FOR CEASE-FIRE TALKS AS ISRAEL ADDS NEW WAR GOAL

Securing peace in the region became even more precarious last week after Israel, against the objections of the U.S. and its international allies, launched an incursion into southern Lebanon with the expressed intent of dismantling the threat posed by Hezbollah.

Chen pointed out that this second front not only added another dimension to securing the release of the hostages, but it also seemingly pushed talks with Hamas on the backburner as concerns remain high over a broader regional conflict.

""If you could follow the news, you could see that the hostage issue has been less prioritized,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult feeling for us and the families.""

Netanyahu has said his top priority is securing the release of the hostages, but his refusal to withdraw from the Philidelphi Corridor due to security reasons has created a negotiation impasse and questions have begun to mount over whether the prime minister is truly prioritizing the hostages over his push to ""eliminate Hamas.""

But the parents of Itay - who has been described as a ""fun-loving kid,"" the ""sandwich"" of the family with an older sibling and younger sibling, everybody's ""best friend,"" and a former Boy Scout turned a young man with a loving girlfriend - cannot allow for him, or the others still in Gaza, to be at the mercy of any political agenda.

""I'm a guy that comes from New York City - and we talk less, we look at actions. The actions of the last year show the opposite."" Chen said. ""He can say whatever he wants. I don't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth, I believe in what he does.""

The father of three also urged the Biden administration to question whether it is still in the U.S.'s strategic interest to unequivocally back Netanyahu.

""There is no accountability from either side for failed negotiation. You do not see any equation that says, 'OK, if you do not do A, then there's a consequence' on either side,"" Chen said in reference to both Israel and Hamas. ""There's no consequence associated with a negative action to a strategic interest of the United States.""

Chen also argued that ""effective pressure"" needs to be put on Hamas by reevaluating what other ""pressure points"" can be utilized.

The father pointed to the clear need for tougher economic and diplomatic involvement when it comes to international aid sent to Gaza - including tougher sanctions not only on adversarial nations but on partner countries that allow aid to flow into Gaza.

This includes stricter oversight of United Nations-provided humanitarian aid, which though intended for the Palestinian people, is falling into the hands of Hamas, a group that is not designated as a terrorist organization by the UN.

Hamas has long been accused of seizing basic goods in Gaza and then reselling them in a black-market scheme at exuberant prices.

Reports have further indicated that Hamas for years has had substantial access to monetary aid siphoned from funds provided by top organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has been directly used for combatant operations against Israel, including tunnel building and access to arms.

But aside from the substantial need to address aid-based concerns, Chen also argued that diplomatic solutions are not being fully recognized by the U.S.

Nations like Russia and Thailand secured the release of their citizens taken by Hamas, and Chen argued Washington - which was able to negotiate with its biggest adversary just months ago to free U.S. citizens from Russian prisons - should be working to do the same to secure the release of those held in Gaza.

""So, it's possible,"" Chen said. ""Complicated, yep. Doable, yep.""

""The assumption that was put in front of us at the beginning was that U.S. hostages will come out via a larger deal that Israel will be a part of. And if that assumption is not working out after a year, then yes, we need to challenge the administration and look at that assumption."

Israeli strike on Gaza mosque kills 19 as conflict widens in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5142440/israeli-gaza-lebanon-oct-7,2024-10-06T19:40:29Z,"Smoke billows from the site of an Israeli air strike that targeted a neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs on Oct. 6, 2024. Israel unleashed intense strikes targeting Hezbollah on Sunday almost a year since the attack by Palestinian Hamas militants that sparked the war in Gaza. Anwar Amro/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption

Israel has intensified its strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, as the expanding conflict in the Mideast approaches one full year since the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.

Israeli airstrikes this weekend have killed scores of people, according to health officials in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israel's government continues to mull a response to nearly 200 Iranian missiles targeting Israel last week.

In northern Gaza, the Israeli military dropped leaflets warning of a ""new phase of war,"" as commanders issued fresh evacuation orders for the several hundred thousand residents that remain in the northern part of the strip.

In the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, Israeli ground troops have encircled a sizeable swathe of territory, where they say they have launched a large-scale assault against Hamas fighters for the first time in months, forcing civilians once more to flee.

Meanwhile, just days after sending soldiers into southern Lebanon, the Israeli military has struck buildings and other targets it links to Hezbollah across Lebanon overnight.

Israel says its recent operations inside Lebanon are part of an attempt to prevent Hezbollah rockets that have landed in northern Israel for the past year, forcing tens of thousands of Israeli civilians to evacuate towns and cities in the region.

At least 56 people have been killed in Gaza this weekend, according to the local health authorities there, prompting a seemingly endless series of funerals after a strike on a mosque Sunday. The building was so close to a nearby hospital morgue that no ambulances were required, with bodies of the at least 19 dead simply carried by hand from one compound to the next.

Israel said it had been a ""precision strike"" on the mosque, targeting Hamas militants inside, but mourners said the approaching one-year mark of the fighting in Gaza was a horrible reminder of the costs families there have faced, with more than 41,000 deaths recorded in the past 12 months.

""Enough, world, enough, tomorrow will be a complete year,"" said Hakima Al Jamal, as she watched her dying father be carried out of the mosque. ""We are tired. By God, we're so tired.""

More Israeli troops are being moved to the border with Gaza to protect one-year commemoration ceremonies in communities affected by Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks last year that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 200 hostages taken into Gaza.

On the eve of those ceremonies, a knife and gun attack in the southern city of Beersheba has left one person dead and 10 others wounded, according to Israeli emergency services.

Police have not yet identified the attacker, who launched the rampage at the city's central bus station. But officials said they were treating it as a terror incident, with the country currently on high alert after several stabbing, shooting and ramming attacks in the past year, including one in Tel Aviv last week that saw seven shot inside and around a transportation hub.

In southern Lebanon, the Israeli military says it has lost as least nine of its troops and killed more than 400 Hezbollah fighters, as it ramped up destructive strikes on the capital Beirut. The strikes were concentrated in the city's southern suburbs that have historically served as a hub for Hebzollah, an Iran-backed militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other nations.

Israel says its latest strikes targeted ""weapons storage facilities and infrastructure sites,"" but in the past two weeks similar strikes have also killed civilians, including children. The total death toll in Lebanon has now topped 1,000, and the Israeli assault has displaced more than a million people -- around a fifth of the country's population.

In the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, new arrivals from the country's south -- some of them refugees from Syria forced to move on once more by another round of conflict -- have seen their lives shattered in a short period of time.

While local residents sit on blue plastic benches -- young men sharing videos on their phones, older couples whiling away the time -- the Israeli airstrikes penetrate further north into the country, leaving few secure locations for civilians.

One man, Riqad, who only gave his first name out of concerns for his safety, had arrived four days ago with his family from the southern suburbs of Beirut, after earlier fleeing Israeli attacks near their home in the southern city of Tyre.

""There is no safe place"" Riqad said Saturday. ""The Israelis are bombing everywhere."" As he spoke, two young children in his family asked an adult relative if the bombs would reach them at the hotel where a politician affiliated with Hezbollah had granted shelter to them and other displaced families.

A few hours earlier, Israeli jets had fired on a nearby refugee camp for Palestinians, close to Tripoli. The attack targeted a commander linked to the militant group Hamas, as well as members of his family, and represented the most northerly attack by Israel since the conflict began in Gaza, 200 miles to the south.

The devastating impact on Lebanese society has been shockingly swift. One pre-med student, who gave only her first name Yasmin, had started college only a month earlier.

""I thought it would be one of the best years of my life. I've worked so much to get to the university I am in,"" she said. ""Now, all I miss is my university days ... the coffee there, my friends, studying in the library. That's all I want now."""
Why The Israel-Hamas War Death Toll Is Uncertain -- 1 Year After Start Of War,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/06/why-the-israel-hamas-war-death-toll-is-uncertain-1-year-after-start-of-war/,2024-10-06T19:18:56Z,"A year after Hamas attacked Israel, prompting a counterattack on Gaza and a regional conflict that recently bled into Lebanon, the death toll continues to grow, but remains uncertain amid discrepancies in figures reported by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and logistical challenges in tracking the dead.

The Gaza Health Ministry has struggled to maintain accurate tallies due to the destruction of data-keeping technology and infrastructure in the war, according to analysis published by The Lancet, which noted an estimated 10,000 victims are likely still buried in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Some of the dead also go uncounted because ""what we've seen in Gaza is entire families just being wiped out,"" so there is no one to report them dead, Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, a watchdog group that tracks war casualties, told Nature.

The non-governmental organization, Airwars, has also determined the death toll is likely underestimated after finding some victims' names are missing from the list released by the Ministry. Some experts, including Israel-based independent researcher Mark Zlochin, believe the death toll is overcounted because it likely includes people who are missing, but not dead, he told the scientific journal Nature.

The Ministry updated its breakdown of the fatalities in May to clarify that approximately 25,000 of the 35,000 reported dead at the time were ""people who have been fully identified."" The Ministry revised its count of women and children estimated to be dead to about 60% of all reported fatalities, down from a previous estimate of about 70%, sparking allegations of inaccuracies from Israeli officials. The World Health Organization, however, expressed confidence in the new tally amid the dispute, noting that it's a ""step forward"" that 25,000 bodies have been identified, World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said during a press briefing at the time that it's ""normal"" for death tolls to shift in conflict.

Nearly every day. The death toll doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The death toll includes nearly 16,756 children and more than 10,000 people who are missing.

More than 97,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

1,139 have been killed and at least 8,730 have been injured, as of Sunday, according to Israeli officials.

At least 742 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and more than 6,250 have been injured.

Hamas invaded Israel in a surprise land, sea and air attack launched from the Gaza Strip in what was the deadliest day in Israeli history, and for Jews since the Holocaust, following decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Hamas militants took more than 240 people hostage; 154 of whom have been freed or rescued, with 97 remaining in Gaza, including 33 believed to be dead. Israel declared a state of war the day after the attack and launched air strikes, followed by a ground invasion, on Gaza. The Israeli invasion has spawned a humanitarian crisis as the dismantling of critical infrastructure and the Israeli occupation has blocked routes into Gaza, restricting the flow of aid. The outpouring of international support for Israel has dwindled since the start of the war as a broad coalition of its allies, including the U.S., have called for a cease-fire. The war has since expanded to Lebanon as tensions between Hezbollah and Israel reached a tipping point in July when a rocket attack Israel says Hezbollah carried out killed 12 children playing soccer in the Golan Heights region. Israel has retaliated with air strikes followed by a ground invasion, killing Hezbollah's' longtime leader and other top officials, and Hezbollah has vowed its strikes will continue unless there's a cease-fire in Gaza.

56%. That's the share of Israelis who want to see an end to the war if all hostages are returned, according to a July poll by the Israel Democracy Institute.

Iran Launches Missile Strike On Israel, Israeli Military Says (Forbes)"

John Fetterman, D-Pa., says he will not 'politicize' the Israel-Hamas during an appearance on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., on Sunday said that he will continue to ""support and follow"" Israel after seeing how the Jewish State has been able to humiliate Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.

Fetterman made the remarks on ""Fox News Sunday,"" telling anchor Shannon Bream that Israel knows best about how to take on Iran and the regime's proxies.

""Whatever they decide to do in response to Iran, I'm going to support that because Israel will have a better idea of the intelligence and the circumstances on the ground,"" Fetterman said. ""And that's why I'm going to support and follow that.""

The Democrat praised Israel for their effective responses against Hezbollah and Hamas that he said left the Iranian proxies ""cowering.""

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITE

""I also want to celebrate what Israel has been able to do,"" Fetterman said. ""They've demolished Hamas and now they have humiliated Hezbollah and they are now cowering. And Iran shot, you know, 200 missiles and [Israel] vaporized those. So, Iran now is left exposed and humiliated, and Israel has put them back on the ropes. And I am going to support what they continue to do.""

Iran bombarded Israel with 181 missiles last week in what the regime said was retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike in September and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.

Meanwhile, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have traded attacks with Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

Fetterman's comments come days after President Biden told reporters that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's missile attack against Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Biden said all the G7 leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Biden's response came under fire from former President Trump, who told Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin on Thursday that Biden's response on Israel attacking Iran was the ""craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.""

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday called out Western leaders who he said had called for an arms embargo on Israel over its airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza.

Under fire: Israel's Iron Dome winning but pressure's on as conflict with Iran escalates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/under-fire-israels-iron-dome-winning-pressures-conflict-iran-escalates,2024-10-06T16:37:38Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As rockets continue to rain down on Israel, Tuesday marked an unprecedented attack from Iran, which fired 181 ballistic missiles toward the country. For an hour, the entire nation took shelter; fortunately, there were no casualties or injuries, thanks to Israel's air defense system.

This system has been crucial in protecting Israeli civilians, intercepting thousands of missiles aimed at population centers. However, some missiles did land at several air force bases and near the Mossad headquarters, although they did not cause ""significant damage,"" according to the IDF chief of staff.

Israel's air defense strategy extends beyond Iron Dome. Systems like David's Sling and Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 provide defense against medium- and long-range missiles, and these systems have also been crucial in the current conflict. Israel Air Force Reserve Brig. Gen. Doron Gavish explains that the multi-layered defense structure was designed to handle a wide range of threats. ""We've used David's Sling to intercept rockets from Lebanon, and Arrow 3 to counter ballistic missiles from Iran. It's not just Iron Dome - it's a network of systems working together.""

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

While the Iron Dome wasn't extensively utilized against Iran, its operators have kept busy keeping Israel safe since the start of the war on Oct. 7 last year.

""The Iron Dome has done incredible work, but, like any defensive system, the extended, high-intensity fighting has taken its toll on it - it wasn't built for a conflict of this length and intensity,"" Hilla Haddad Chmelnik, an aerospace engineer who played a key role in developing Iron Dome, and who acknowledges that the system is being tested in ways it was not originally designed for.

Haddad Chmelnik, who also served as director-general of Israel's Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology, emphasizes the need for ongoing innovation to keep up with evolving threats.

And with Lebanon and Israel's escalating fight with Hezbollah, the need for the system is greater than ever, she says. Just this last week alone, hundreds of rockets, missiles and UAVs were launched against Israel from Hezbollah in Lebanon.

While Hamas's rocket supply in Gaza has been largely depleted, the situation in Lebanon is very different. ""In Gaza, we have significantly reduced the number of rockets left in Hamas' arsenal. But in Lebanon, the numbers have not dropped enough,"" she says. Hezbollah is believed to have perhaps 140,000 rockets, and they are much more sophisticated than those used by Hamas and can penetrate much deeper into Israel.

And then there is the question of Iran, and the possibility of the war widening to include direct conflict with that country. ""Compared to Lebanon, the threat from Iran is more manageable,"" she says. Staging a large-scale missile attack from Iran is a complex undertaking, which can be detected and preemptively targeted,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""Launching a ballistic missile 1,500 kilometers requires preparation, and that's visible. It's very hard to hide from satellites, and that gives us the opportunity to strike preemptively, in addition to preparing to defend ourselves.""

Haddad Chmelnik emphasizes that Israel's missile-defense systems, which were built in coordination with the U.S., are capable of withstanding Iranian attacks. ""The Iranian missile threat can be countered, and our second-strike capability is very significant. Israel has the upper hand in that respect,"" she says. ""That's why Iran is cautious - it has more to lose than to gain.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

Iron Dome was first deployed in 2011, following years of development in response to the growing threat of rocket fire from Gaza. What sets the system apart, Haddad Chmelnik says, is its innovation and simplicity. ""It's a brilliant technology that no other country has. Iron Dome was developed with the support of the U.S., and now we're seeing other nations buying it for their own defense.""

Indeed, the success of Iron Dome has attracted international attention. Countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Finland have purchased Iron Dome components or batteries. ""Israel is the most protected country in the world when it comes to air defense,"" Haddad Chmelnik explains. ""Now, we are seeing countries across the globe investing in it.""

Israel Air Force Reserve Brig. Gen. Doron Gavish, former commander of Israel's Air Defense Corps, recalls the initial skepticism surrounding the project. ""Before Iron Dome, we had no real answer to these types of rockets,"" he says. ""People doubted we could create an effective, cost-efficient interceptor. But the system has proven itself over the years. Iron Dome has intercepted thousands of rockets.""

Each Iron Dome interceptor missile costs around $50,000, while some of the rockets it is designed to destroy, such as those made by Hamas, can cost just a few hundred dollars. The cost of maintaining one Iron Dome battery, which requires dozens of soldiers to operate, is about $100 million. Currently, there are approximately 12 Iron Dome batteries spread out across the country, each capable of defending up to 60 square miles, providing vital coverage in strategic areas.

WHAT IS ISRAEL'S FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE, THE IRON DOME?

Half of Iron Dome operators are women, who agree to extend their service to three years - the same as is mandatory for men - to accommodate the long period of training. ""The experience these soldiers have gained under fire is invaluable. But the pressure is enormous,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says. ""It's not like a video game. You're making real-time decisions on which rockets to intercept. These soldiers know they're protecting their families, their cities - sometimes even their own homes.""

But the current conflict, which has seen more than 20,000 rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon since October 2023, has pushed the system, and its operators, to their limits. ""When we designed Iron Dome, we never imagined it would have to function under such continuous strain,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""The system was built for short, intense bursts of fighting - not for a war that lasts nearly a year.""

In recent months, some enemy rockets have slipped past the defenses, causing destruction in northern Israel. ""No system is hermetic,"" Gavish says. ""There is no perfect defense. The reality is, the longer the war continues, the more pressure the system is put under.""

Meanwhile, the enemy is learning. ""Every time Iron Dome successfully intercepts a rocket, our enemies are watching, learning and adapting,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""That's why we see more complex threats emerging, like UAVs, and drones, which are harder to intercept.""

While Iron Dome remains effective, the future is uncertain. ""The system is saving lives every day,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says. ""But as the war goes on, it becomes harder and harder to maintain the same level of defense.""

Despite these successes, Haddad Chmelnik points out that no defense system is foolproof. ""The way Iron Dome is built, it's about more than just about identifying individual threats; it's about adapting quickly as those threats evolve."" She emphasizes that while Iron Dome continues to play a crucial role, Israel's long-term security will depend on continued technological advancements.

Despite the challenges they face in the current situation, those operating Iron Dome continue their mission. ""The soldiers - men and women - are making complex decisions in real-time, protecting cities and families,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says, ""They are the key to Iron Dome's success."""
Anti-Israel protester lights himself on fire outside of White House,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/anti-israel-protester-lights-himself-fire-outside-white-house,2024-10-06T14:37:00Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports on Israel targeting Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters and his new book on 'Special Report.'

A photojournalist lit himself on fire outside the White House on Saturday in protest against Israel's war in Gaza and America's support for the regime.

The man, Samuel Mena Jr., lit his left arm on fire and was seen screaming in pain and shouting that the media was spreading ""misinformation."" Law enforcement officers quickly surrounded Mena and restrained him, putting out the fire.

One bystander could be seen pouring a bottle of water on Mena's arm after the flames were extinguished.

A blog posted to Mena's website shortly before the incident suggested he only intended to burn his arm.

""To the 10 thousand children in Gaza that have lost a limb in this conflict, I give my left arm to you. I pray my voice was able to raise up yours, and that your smiles never disappear,"" Mena wrote.

The blog also says Mena first tried to end the ""genocide"" in Gaza by making a documentary. He later gave up on the effort, however, convinced that it wouldn't make a difference.

Mena's social media profiles say he worked for the local CBS affiliate AZFamily and graduated from Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.

Authorities transported Mena to the hospital soon after the incident and confirmed that his injuries were not life-threatening.

""The District of Columbia has a long and proud history of peaceful first amendment activities and the Metropolitan Police Department handles hundreds of protests, demonstrations and other events every year,"" first responders said in a statement.

""We will continue to support those who choose to protest peaceful and safely, and we will continue to hold accountable those who commit criminal acts while in our city,"" the added.

The incident comes months after a member of the U.S. Air Force set himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in February. Senior Airman Aaron Bushnell, 25, also carried out the act in protest against Israel's campaign in Gaza, saying in a recorded video that he would ""no longer be complicit in genocide."""
New report finds nearly 200% increase in antisemitic incidents in US since Oct. 7 Hamas terror massacre,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-report-finds-nearly-200-increase-antisemitic-incidents-in-us-since-oct-7-hamas-terror-massacre,2024-10-06T14:09:32Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) found that antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose over 200% following the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre in Israel as compared to the same period the year before.

The report from the ADL Center on Extremism recorded over 10,000 antisemitic incidents following the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel - the most recorded in any single year since the group started tracking them in 1979. In the year prior to Oct. 7, the center recorded 3,325 incidents.

""Today, we mourn the victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel, marking one year since the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,"" Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, said in a press release alongside the report's publication.

""From that day on, Jewish Americans haven't had a single moment of respite,"" Greenblatt said. ""Instead, we've faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.""

Of the roughly 10,000 incidents recorded, the ADL broke them down into three different types: Over 8,000 verbal or written harassment, over 1,840 incidents of vandalism and over 150 physical assaults.

Around 12% of these incidents occurred on college campuses compared to around 200 incidents in the same period in the previous year.

Around 20% of those incidents occurred at ""Jewish institutions,"" which includes synagogues and Jewish centers, but around 30% of the incidents occurred during anti-Israel rallies. The ADL did not clarify how much overlap it found among these different groupings.

However, the group did clarify that it recorded 8,873 antisemitic incidents in 2023 alone, marking a 140% increase from the previous year, and that it will have finalized figures in 2025 as it continues to survey partners, law enforcement and victims - from which it expects the figure to continue rising.

Experts and watchdog groups have raised the alarm over the increasing number of antisemitic incidents, not just in the U.S. but in Europe as well: The Community Security Trust in the United Kingdom reported in March 2024 that it recorded at least 2,093 antisemitic incidents across the country between Oct. 7 and Dec. 13, 2023.

The group called it the ""highest-ever total reported"" across a roughly two-month period since it started recording such incidents in 1984.

""I think people are feeling tense and nervous, particularly with marches taking place every Saturday,"" Jake Wallis Simons, editor-in-chief of the London-based Jewish Chronicle, told Fox News Digital from England at the time.

On Saturday, thousands marched against Israel in London with observers complaining of the large amount of antisemitic imagery and slogans on display at the protests.

Canada has also seen a massive spike in incidents, focused around Jewish institutions, including schools, community centers and synagogues, as well as several of the country's universities.

In a statement on X, Israel's Consul General to Montréal Paul Hirschorn warned, ""Montréal is now ranked one of the most dangerous places in the world to be visibly Jewish. 9 times Jewish community buildings have been shot at or petrol bombed - synagogues, schools, community centers. Just this week people were identified with petrol-bombs near synagogues (and fortunately prevented from perpetrating what they had planned). The authorities released them to go home. I guess they said they would behave themselves.""

""Statistically, hate crimes in Canada have increased north of 132%, with the vast majority of those crimes targeting the Jewish community,"" Casey Babb, who teaches courses on terrorism and international security at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs in Ottawa, told Fox News Digital earlier this year.

""Indeed, this may be the most antisemitic time in our country's history,"" Babb said. ""I'd go as far as suggesting Canada, for a variety of reasons, has become one of the most hostile nations in the West for Jews.""

"On Oct. 7 anniversary, we remember this betrayal of silence",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/oct-7-anniversary-we-remember-betrayal-silence,2024-10-06T13:05:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Reflections on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel must not only consider the tragedy itself but the silence that followed.

That day, Hamas militants unleashed unspeakable violence, deliberately targeting civilians. Among the victims were hundreds of women and girls who were subjected to sexual violence - an intentional strategy designed to terrorize and degrade.

Yet, despite the horrific nature of these acts, international bodies, including the United Nations, took weeks - if not months - to even acknowledge what had transpired. Leaders who claim to stand for women not only failed women with their words; it was a failure to act.

Silence is not neutral.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

The use of sexual violence as a weapon in conflict is not a recent phenomenon. It is an age-old, barbaric tool of war, used to humiliate, destabilize and traumatize communities. However, the global community's muted response to the sexual atrocities of Oct. 7 reveals a troubling double standard.

Israeli women did not receive the swift and vocal condemnation for gender-based violence that is often extended in other conflicts. While many leaders and organizations, such as UN Women, eventually condemned the violence, it took them over 50 days to issue a statement denouncing these acts. This delay occurred despite a significant body of credible and corroborated evidence available at the time.

Even without an official report, every woman who saw that video of a young woman, her sweatpants stained with blood, instinctively knew the devastating reality behind those marks. That unspoken understanding crosses every boundary -- cultural, political or religious. It's a truth embedded in the experience of being a woman, a shared recognition of the raw vulnerability to violence that so many of us have felt, feared or survived.

ISRAEL BANS UN SECRETARY-GENERAL OVER ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIONS: 'DOESN'T DESERVE TO SET FOOT ON ISRAELI SOIL'

Yet, the willful delay of condemnation, combined with the relative silence from many women's rights organizations, reflects a larger issue where political affiliations seem to overshadow the fundamental responsibility to stand against rape as a weapon of war.

Silence in the face of gender-based violence is complicity. When leaders delay or fail to acknowledge such atrocities, they send a message that the suffering of women, especially in complex geopolitical conflicts, can be overlooked. It is precisely this neglect that fuels cycles of violence, making it clear that women and girls are collateral damage, their dignity expendable.

It also reflects a profound unwillingness to confront uncomfortable truths about the nature of this violence and who it is perpetrated against.

There remains a persistent reluctance in the West to confront and criticize cultures that subjugate women through practices like stoning for adultery or forcing women to cover their faces. Political correctness has led to a loss of moral clarity, and an inability to confront harmful practices and values that undermine human rights.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

This reluctance to offend has led to dangerous acceptance and moral relativism. Practices such as honor killings or female genital mutilation are undeniably violations of basic human rights. Yet, the guise of inclusivity shields these practices from criticism, framing them instead as cultural differences that must be respected.

Tacit acceptance has consequences. In fact, the United Nations, the same body that failed Israeli women so spectacularly, also reported a 50% increase in verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence from 2022 to 2023. When women are overlooked or targeted in this way, the global response must be swift and unequivocal. Whether in Israel, Ukraine, Sudan or elsewhere, we must demand accountability for those who weaponize gender-based violence.

Protecting women and girls requires a clear, unambiguous commitment to their dignity, safety and inherent worth. It means recognizing that sexual violence is not just an issue of war, it's an attack on the very identity of women.

We need leaders who are willing to confront these truths, who will stand up unequivocally against violence, and who will advocate for policies that protect the most vulnerable, not shy away from defining who they are.

This anniversary must serve as a call to action and a reminder that silence is not an oversight, it is a betrayal. If the international community continues to hesitate, it signals that the lives, bodies and dignity of women are negotiable.

Women and girls must not be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, and none of us should remain silent when women and girls' bodies are turned into battlefields."
Fox Nation's 'Black Saturday' with Trey Yingst takes viewers inside horrific events of October 7,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-nations-black-saturday-trey-yingst-takes-viewers-inside-horrific-events-october-7,2024-10-06T12:20:32Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst's new book, which is available now, provides a riveting, on-the-ground account of the devastating Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

A three-part docuseries of the same name, based on Yingst's book, is streaming now on Fox Nation, with a condensed version airing on Fox News Channel on Sunday night at 10 pm ET.

Yingst began writing ""Black Saturday: An Unfiltered Account of the October 7th Attack on Israel and the War in Gaza"" during the immediate aftermath of Hamas' horrific assault. At the same time, he was also working to provide Fox News viewers with the latest information from southern Israel and Gaza.

Yingst told Fox News Digital he feels the book is unique because it was penned in the field by a correspondent who was ""living this story"" in real time.

ANTONY BLINKEN DOES VICTORY LAP ON BIDEN-HARRIS 'STRONGER' FOREIGN POLICY SAME DAY IRAN ATTACKS ISRAEL

""'Black Saturday' is the gold standard in storytelling when it comes to what took place on October 7 in southern Israel and the war that followed,"" Yingst said from Tel Aviv.

""A massacre against the civilian population of Israel unfolded in the early hours of October 7, when Hamas militants crossed the border from the Gaza Strip into the communities that line Gaza in southern Israel, and it killed soldiers and civilians alike and dragged more than 240 hostages back into Gaza,"" he continued. ""'Black Saturday' talks about our experience, the Fox News team in Jerusalem responding to that attack.""

Yingst and his team reported from the Gaza border area as the attack unfolded.

""'Black Saturday' tells that story, and then the stories of the soldiers and the police officers and the civilians in southern Israel who were trying to make sense of what was unfolding, and then take the fight back to Hamas inside Gaza, along with the stories of Palestinian civilians who were directly affected by this conflict and continue to be affected today,"" he said.

Yingst has extensive sources inside the Israeli military, along with inside Hamas' senior leadership. He also speaks to Palestinian civilians in Gaza on a regular basis, and Israeli civilians who are waiting for their loved ones to come home after being taken hostage.

""This book really captures all of those angles. It is a book about Israelis. It is a book about Palestinians. It is a book about October 7 and the war that followed, and it is a book about humans,"" Yingst said.

He details the horrifying ordeal at the start of the book and shows readers the risks that reporters take to bring critical information to the world.

""The soldiers that we were with got lost, and they were driving through areas that hadn't been cleared, that Hamas was routinely operating in, firing RPGs, anti-tank missiles and small arms fire at Israeli soldiers in the weeks prior, and we had no way out. We were stuck in that moment, and as I open this book, 'Black Saturday,' I talk about this moment,"" he said.

""I truly thought this could be it,"" Yingst continued. ""This could be the moment that I die.""

For the project, Yingst interviewed a range of people to include multiple perspectives, including Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, high-ranking IDF soldiers, Hamas official Dr. Basem Naim and Gazan journalist Nael Ghaboun.

""I think that when you read it, you will learn more about what that morning was like for Israelis who were living through hell on Earth. You'll learn more about the behind-the-scenes reporting that we did to bring that story to our viewers under fire in real time,"" Yingst said.

""Black Saturday,"" the latest offering from Fox News Books, also includes 16 pages of full-color photographs.

The Fox Nation series based on the book of the same name includes Yingst and the Fox Jerusalem Bureau team racing to cover the devastating terror attack, the team experiencing the haunting aftermath of horrific massacres throughout the Israeli communities along the Gaza border and the Fox News chief foreign correspondent entering the Gaza Strip during the Israeli ground invasion."
A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Beirut,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26576/israel-bombards-northern-gaza-and-southern-beirut,2024-10-06T12:14:54Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Beirut in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region.

Displaced people were sheltering at the mosque that was struck near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. A further four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men.

Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza a year after the group's attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has also vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

The widening conflict risks drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, as well as U.S.-allied Arab countries that host American forces. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have already joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel.

The Israeli military, meanwhile, announced a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, home to a densely populated refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It circulated photos and video footage showing a column of tanks heading toward the area.

Israeli forces encircled Jabaliya as warplanes struck militant sites inside, the military said. Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup.

Israel reiterated its call, from the opening weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million fleeing to the south.

""We are in a new phase of the war,"" the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. ""These areas are considered dangerous combat zones.""

Palestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza. The Civil Defense -- first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government -- said several homes and buildings had been hit and they were not able to reach them because of the bombardment.

Residents posted about the airstrikes and mourned their relatives on social media. Imad Alarabid said in a Facebook post that an airstrike on his home in Jabaliya killed a dozen family members, including his parents. Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded and bleeding.

""Pray for us,"" he wrote on Facebook.

Hassan Hamd, a freelance TV journalist whose footage had aired on Al Jazeera and othr networks, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death.

The military says it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. Hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the humanitarian zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians.

Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little more than half were women and children.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and took another 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

In Beirut, airstrikes lit up the skyline and loud explosions echoed across the southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, throughout the night, as Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah militant sites.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the area was hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23 when Israel escalated its air campaign.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said. Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

Hezbollah said it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately."" It was not possible to confirm the claim.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from its border so that tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it said was a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

It is not possible to verify battlefield reports from either side."
"Oil's Security Premium Could Rise, But Is Unlikely To Persist",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2024/10/06/oils-security-premium-could-rise-but-is-unlikely-to-persist/,2024-10-06T11:41:51Z,"In summary, the worst case (for the oil market) would be an Israeli attack that reduced Iranian oil exports, and then the issue becomes whether the Saudis raise production to compensate or seek to draw down global inventories in support of prices, which would mean Brent stays over $80. Absent such an attack, the security premium will be only temporary and weakness in the fundamentals will reassert themselves; Brent would sink below $75 again.

At this point, it appears that the conflict in the Middle East is morphing into a 'forever war,' with Israel attempting to destroy Hamas and Hezbollah, something which is almost certainly impossible, and to cow Iran into reducing its support for members of the 'axis of resistance.' To date, the damage done in both Iran and Israel from ongoing missile attacks has been minimal, but concerns that the situation might escalate has been keeping oil prices elevated, our old friend the security premium making a reappearance. Prices that had been under pressure from fundamentals have instead risen by $5 to $8 a barrel in recent days. Given the possible direction of the conflict, what do the different paths mean for oil prices?

First, it's important to keep in mind that while fundamentals tend to move slowly, geopolitical events can change abruptly and drastically. Although oil supply sometimes drops sharply, demand evolves only gradually: next month, next quarter, will not be substantially different from current levels. In effect, geopolitics are fast, fundamentals slow but more persistent.

That said, consider the different political/military decisions going forward. It should be taken for granted that Israel will continue to prosecute the war against Hamas and Hezbollah, but their response to the latest Iranian missile attack remains unclear. There are four likely choices: a minimal attack, such as after the April barrage from Iran, would ease tensions and see oil prices pull back quickly. Israeli rhetoric at this point implies this is unlikely.

Next, a larger attack from Israel that targets Iranian military bases and infrastructure, such as weapons depots or factories, is possible. Given recent developments, Israel clearly has good intelligence on its adversaries, so such an attack is doable, although the long-term effects would be minimal. However, Iran would almost certainly respond with another missile attack which would mean that the tit-for-tat exchanges would continue the security premium on oil prices would remain elevated.

A third choice would be for Israel to go after Iranian nuclear facilities, something that Israel has supposedly long wanted to do but been restrained from attempting by the U.S. However, with U.S. influence clearly at a low point, Netanyahu might be tempted to undertake this, seeing a successful attack as a crowning achievement to his long political career. There is uncertainty about Israel's ability to launch such an attack without U.S. help and many caution that Iranian facilities are not vulnerable to air strikes. Even so, Israel might feel that inflicting minor damage on those sites would provide a demonstration effect and serve as a deterrent to further Iranian retaliation. Again, this would translate into continuing violence, keeping the oil price's security premium high.

Finally, some have been suggesting Israel might attack Iranian oil infrastructure, including refineries or export facilities. Reducing Iran's oil income would seem desirable from Israel's point of view, and while the U.S. would presumably discourage such a move, especially the Biden Administration which doesn't want an October surprise of higher oil prices, U.S. political clout appears at a low point.

Expectations of an Israeli attack on the Iranian oil industry explains much of the recent elevation in prices, since that is the only likely development that would have a direct impact on world oil markets. However, even the destruction of the Abadan and Bandar Abbas refineries, with 700 tb/d of capacity, while no doubt generating impressive videos of spectacular fires and explosions, would not have a major effect on world oil markets.

In 1951, the Iranian nationalization of BP's holdings and the shutdown of Abadan raised Asian oil prices by approximately 30%, because at that time, Abadan was providing a large fraction of Asian product demand. Now, those two refineries together provide less than 1% of world capacity and could easily be replaced. The figure below shows global refinery capacity and throughput with an implied 20 mb/d of surplus but overstates the available capacity. A more realistic estimate would be about 3-5 mb/d of surplus capacity, at any rate, more than enough to replace any disruption to Iranian operations. There would be some rebalancing and Iran would lose money, but aside from that the impact would be minor.

An attack on Iranian oil fields would also look impressive, generating massive blazes but having only a limited effect on supplies given the dispersed nature of production. Destroying the tanker loading facilities at Kharg Island would be more serious and could reduce Iranian oil exports by perhaps 1 mb/d in the worst case scenario. Then, the question becomes whether or not the Saudis replace the lost supply. They have ample spare capacity, but might prefer to let markets tighten, inventories drop, and prices firm. In that case, Brent would remain at or above $80.

In essence, there are three paths forward: the level of violence remains roughly constant or declines, in which case the security premium would fade as traders get crisis fatigue, Brent sliding back towards $70-75. Alternatively, an escalation with continuing missile attacks and/or assassinations would mean traders remain fearful of an oil supply disruption and the price would remain elevated, as it is now (Brent about $78). Finally, any attack on Iranian oil facilities would boost Brent above $80, if and only if Iranian exports dip significantly and the Saudis refuse to raise production.

Overall, then, the prospect is for prices to return to the levels of September, sooner rather than later, and the chances for Brent to remain above $80 for any period appears slim. Even so, wagering on peace in the Middle East is never for the faint-hearted."
'There is no life' after Oct 7: An Israeli mother grapples with grief one year after Hamas' devastating attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/there-no-life-after-oct-7-israeli-mother-grapples-grief-one-year-after-hamas-devastating-attack,2024-10-06T11:06:34Z,"Sigal Shemer, an Israeli mother from Lod, Israel, opens up about the murder of her eldest son on Oct. 7 and how she's navigating her grief one year later.

Sigal Shemer headed to the cemetery in Lod, a city in central Israel, in late September to wash her son's headstone and place flowers on his grave.

Ron, her eldest son, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, after the militant group launched an early morning attack on southern Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking more than 250 as hostages, according to estimates from Israeli authorities.

Numbers compiled by Fox News indicate an estimated 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, almost 365 days later, including seven Americans.

Sigal reflected on the death of her son and the enduring impact of Oct. 7, one year later, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Trauma has reshaped her life and left an indelible mark on her family, but she's found some solace and hope through the Jerusalem-based nonprofit OneFamily, which offers support and resources to victims of terror. Through community outreach, the organization has become a lifeline, helping her navigate the complexities of her sorrow while honoring her son's memory, amid a background of ongoing violence and loss.

Ron had been attending the Nova music festival in Re'im when the carnage unfolded, running with his friends to a car to escape the sound of gunshots in the area and the horror that was beginning to take place.

But the 23-year-old didn't want to leave without two of his close friends. He opted not to get into the car and instead went to look for Dan and Omar. Soon after he found them, the trio went inside a shelter not far from the festival.

HAMAS TERRORISTS 'SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY' COMMITTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING OCT. 7 ATTACK: REPORT

""He told to a friend, 'Don't be afraid. I will attack if someone will come in. I will attack them, and I will take care of you.' But the terrorists dropped three grenades into the shelter,"" his mother told Fox News Digital.

Dan was killed, Omar survived and Ron was taken outside, where he was heard fighting and struggling with Hamas militants. He wasn't heard from for days and his family feared he had been taken hostage.

""One week after, there was a knock on the door, and they told us -- the army and the police told us -- that Ron is... is not... is not alive because they shot him in the head,"" Sigal said.

She took a moment to remove her glasses and wipe away the tears from her eyes. The death of her son is still palpable and raw for the mother of two, who is survived by her husband Oren, and younger son Bari.

Sigal remembered Ron as a young man who loved people and animals, loved to travel and loved to help others.

He was a counselor at a Jewish youth summer camp in Pennsylvania, where he taught children Muay Thai, a form of boxing and the national sport of Thailand.

Since his murder, the Shemer family has returned to the camp, meeting with those who knew Ron and visiting all of his favorite places in the United States.

Before Oct. 7, Ron was on a 10-month trip to South America and Sigal feared for his safety.

""All the time, I was afraid that something will happen to him because it's, you know, in Brazil, the Amazonas, Colombia -- places that -- they're not so safe. And I tell him, please come home, please come home. It's not safe there. So, he came home and it's not safe here. It's not safe to be here,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The terrorists, the monster... came inside the country and killed and murdered and raped and burned a lot of people, innocent people.""

""There is no life. I think there is no life. There is no life from the 7th of October,"" she added.

Sigal was working as an event producer prior to the day that's now known as ""Black Saturday."" She's since left her job, consumed by grief, and now works two days a week taking care of dogs, something her son loved to do.

""I want people to know that my son and all of the murdered boys and girls on the 7th of October are lost for the world,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Many people in Israel lost their sons and daughters for nothing. Just for nothing.""

OneFamily Fund has provided support to many families whose loved ones were murdered in the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Naomi Nussbaum, OneFamily's executive director, told Fox News Digital how they use different types of therapy to help families cope with the loss of a loved one.

""We offer three types of support: Emotional support, financial support and legal aid. We've given out much, much more financial aid now than before because of the kind of devastation, you know, the nature of the attack on October 7th,"" she said.

""There's traditional therapy with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, trauma-informed therapists tackling PTSD throughout all the categories. Dealing with PTSD is the most insidious and difficult part of the terror attacks to deal with. Then, we have the social network, which is really the heart and soul of OneFamily.""

Sigal has met with other mothers whose children were murdered and said it's not an easy thing to do, but it's helpful to speak with someone who's suffering from a similar situation and going through the same stages of grief.

DOJ CHARGES HAMAS LEADERS OVER 'TERRORIST ATROCITIES' IN OCT 7 ISRAEL ATTACK

""We're like professional friends for life. And the other people in the group that we put her with will be there also. You know, she can call anybody at any time to have dinner or to go for a walk or for a birthday or the anniversary of a death. They'll be there for each other forever,"" said Nussbaum.

""It takes a lot of courage and strength to smile again for the first time or to take a little bit of joy to say, let's go out to dinner tonight. Sometimes, the guilt and the grief and bereavement is too strong, and people can't do that. So, OneFamily, really with open arms and a lot of love, does everything they can to get them to want to come back to life again.""

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in Israel's nearly 12-month-long war against Hamas, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 6,200 women and 11,300 children.

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in next month's election because of both candidates' support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Harris has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself and would not withhold weapons from the country, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Trump said recently he is Israel's ""protector"" and reaffirmed his support for the Jewish state.

In battleground Georgia, where Trump narrowly lost in 2020 to President Joe Biden, the Peach State could help determine whether Harris or Trump wins the presidency.

The Muslim population in Georgia could also impact which candidate wins the state's 16 electoral votes. Muslim voters across the country are virtually tied between Harris and Trump, with Harris only securing a single-point advantage, according to a recent poll by the Arab American Institute.

This comes just ahead of the one-year mark of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and took more than 250 hostages, which prompted retaliatory action from Israel's military.

The Hamas-run government's Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 41,000 people have been killed in the conflict, although it does not distinguish between civilian and terrorist deaths. More than 1,500 people have reportedly been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, with most of them being killed on Oct. 7 and its immediate aftermath.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

The growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia and across the country have said they will not vote for Harris or Trump due to both sides' vocal support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the conflict is now expanding to include Israel attacking Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon.

""What we're trying to say is we should really do away with the logic of voting for the 'lesser of two evils,'"" Kareem Rosshandler, Georgia co-chair of the ""Abandon Harris"" campaign, told Fox 5.

The ""Abandon Harris"" campaign group is urging Muslims to vote third-party to send a message to Republicans and Democrats that they need to earn the votes of the Muslim community.

""I think the main one is to say that the Muslim community in the United States won't be taken for granted,"" Rosshandler said.

Rosshandler said the group has already secured commitments from more than 10,000 Muslim voters to support third-party candidates. Some third-party candidates, including Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party's Jill Stein, have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza.

The loss of Muslim voters is expected to hurt Harris more than Trump, as the Republican candidate has previously struggled to secure Muslim votes.

""That would essentially have a greater adverse impact on the Harris-Waltz ticket than it would on Trump-Vance,"" Emory University assistant professor of law Alicia Hughes, who is also a voting expert, told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""Trump, historically, has not been able to count on those votes.""

Hughes also says that if Harris or Trump were more vocally critical of Israel, it may not help their election chances either.

""There's a great possibility that you would lose more from the change than you would actually gain,"" she said."
Israel expands its bombardment in Lebanon as thousands flee widening war,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26567/israel-expands-its-bombardment-in-lebanon-as-thousands-flee-widening-war,2024-10-06T07:14:31Z,"MASNAA BORDER CROSSING, Lebanon -- Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters.

Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza.

The strong explosions began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut's southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company Khaled Kaddouha.

Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.""

On Saturday, Israel's attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas' military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that ""we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon."" The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East.

Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary.

On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so."" On Lebanon, he said ""we are not done yet.""

Fleeing Lebanon on foot

Israel's military earlier Saturday said about 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Most were intercepted, but several fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured.

At least six people in Lebanon were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency.

Nearly 375,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee.

Associated Press journalists saw hundreds continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot, crunching over the rubble after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading to it on Thursday. Much of Hezbollah's weaponry is believed to come from Iran through Syria.

""We were on the road for two days,"" said Issa Hilal, one of many Syrian refugees in Lebanon who are now heading back. ""The roads were very crowded ... it was very difficult. We almost died getting here."" Some children whimpered or cried.

Other displaced families now shelter alongside Beirut's famous seaside Corniche, their wind-flapped tents just steps from luxury homes. ""We don't care if we die, but we don't want to die at the hands of Netanyahu,"" said Om Ali Mcheik.

The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon. It said troops dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border.

More evacuation orders in Gaza

Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the Health Ministry there, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Almost 90% of Gaza's residents are displaced, amid widespread destruction.

Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza on Saturday killed at least nine people. One in the northern town of Beit Hanoun killed at least five, including two children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four, Awda hospital said.

Israel's military did not have any immediate comment but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas.

An Israeli airstrike killed two children in Gaza City's Zaytoun neighborhood, according to the civil defense first responders' group that operates under the Hamas-run government.

Israel's military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza that was at the heart of obstacles to a cease-fire deal. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, a coastal area it has designated a humanitarian zone.

It's unclear how many Palestinians are in those areas. Israeli forces have often returned to areas in Gaza to target Hamas fighters as they regroup."
"Netanyahu calls Macron, other Western leaders who support arms embargo against Israel a 'disgrace'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-macron-western-leaders-support-arms-embargo-against-israel-disgrace,2024-10-05T23:13:33Z,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed French President Emmanuel Macron and other Western leaders on Saturday who he said had called for an arms embargo on Israel over its airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza.

""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side, yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them, ""Netanyahu said in a statement.

He continued, ""Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together, but countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel.""

Netanyahu called their stance a ""disgrace,"" adding that Israel would win ""with or without their support, but their shame will continue long after the war is won.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

He said, ""in defending ourselves against this barbarism, Israel is defending civilization against those who seek to impose a dark age of fanaticism on all of us. Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won - for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world.""

Netanyahu noted that Israel is defending itself on seven different fronts, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, terrorists in Judea and Samaria and Iran.

On Saturday, Macron said France would no longer supply arms to Israel, although the country will continue to send missile defense equipment.

""I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,"" Macron said in an interview, according to Euro News.

Also on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had raided and dismantled a Hezbollah underground command complex in Lebanon.

""The troops entered a terror tunnel about 250 meters long, located about 300 meters from the border and not crossing into Israeli territory,"" IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a press conference.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

He said a kitchenette and rooms that allowed for extended stays underground along with weapons and command rooms were found inside the complex.

""These compounds were intended to be used by Hezbollah terrorists in an attack on the communities of the Galilee,"" he said. ""This tunnel did not cross into our territory, and yesterday we destroyed it.""

The U.S. continues to supply Israel with arms, although President Biden has spoken out against the country's approach to its war with Gaza where tens of thousands of civilians have died.

""I think what he's doing is a mistake,"" Biden said in August, while continuing to call for a cease-fire. ""I don't agree with his approach.""

This week in a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing, Biden, in answering a reporter, said he wasn't sure if Netanyahu was holding off on a cease-fire to influence the November election.

""Whether he's trying to influence the election, I don't know - but I'm not counting on that,"" Biden said. ""No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none, and I think he should remember that."""

About 3 in 10 (31%) Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll, which shows a plurality of Americans, 36% to be exact, are unsure about Israel's handling of its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, 20% of Americans believe Israel is doing enough while 12% say Israel should be doing more -- but both of those numbers have declined in the past 10 months, from 25% and 16%, respectively.

The Pew Research Center poll also found more Americans in September said the U.S. should play a role in resolving the war diplomatically (61%) than they did in February (55%). And Republicans in September remained more likely than Democrats (25% vs. 13%) to say the U.S. should not be involved in the diplomatic resolution of the war, according to the Pew Research Center, a drop from the 32% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats who said in February there should be no U.S. involvement in the war's resolution.

A new survey from the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 25% sympathize more with Israelis, and 15% sympathize more with Palestinians. Most -- 31% -- claimed to have equal sympathy for both sides, and another 26% report having no sympathy for either. These numbers also have not changed much since before the attack on Israel last year.

The Associated Press-NORC survey marked an increase in the number of Americans who support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, up to about 29% now compared to 22% before the Oct. 7 attacks, in August 2023. Around half of the Americans surveyed said they neither favor or oppose an independent state (a drop from 58% in August 2023), while 17% were opposed, about what it was (15%) in 2023.

About 4 in 10 Americans say the U.S. is spending too much on military aid for Israel, very consistent with polls in February and November, according to the Pearson and AP survey.

Even before the Oct. 7 attack -- and Israel's two-front war in Gaza and Lebanon -- a whopping 79% of Americans were either concerned or very concerned about the Israel-Hamas war leading to a larger Middle East conflict, according to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published a year ago.

""The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides,"" the Associated Press reported, citing Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute. Poast added the conflict's nuances have lended to ""very strong views on both sides.""

The U.S. has remained a large player in the Israel-Hamas war despite stopping short of putting American boots on the ground in Gaza or Lebanon. President Joe Biden has laid out multiple ceasefire proposals in the last year that have largely failed to materialize, while also trying to walk the rope between supporting Israel's war against Hamas and providing humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, who continue to face strikes from Israel, famine and mass displacement. American concern about a larger conflict in the Middle East has proven relevant, as Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have raised the ire of Iran, which launched missile strikes at Israel this week. Biden has continued calling for ceasefires as the conflicts escalate, though it remains unclear how much influence the U.S. will have on Israeli military operations given that the two allies have seemingly been on different pages multiple times in the last year. The White House said last month it was not notified about Israel's strikes in Lebanon that killed longtime Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and provoked retaliatory strikes from Iran.

Iran Launches Missile Strike On Israel, Israeli Military Says (Forbes)"
Rising from the ashes: Israelis in nation's war-torn south move home a year after October 7 massacre,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/rising-from-ashes-israelis-nations-war-torn-south-move-home-year-after-oct-7-massacre,2024-10-05T15:27:58Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Before October 7, the communities of the mostly agricultural cooperative settlements, commonly known as kibbutzim, near the Gaza Strip, were considered some of the most picturesque places in Israel, characterized by green fields and carpets of vibrant red anemones. Yet, they were also among the most bombarded areas in the country. ""Ninety-nine percent of the time, it's paradise; one percent of the time, it's hell,"" was a common saying among residents.

""It's fair to say this year, we live in that one percent"" Ofer Liberman admits, reflecting on the harsh reality faced by his community. For 22 years, he has served as the spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Am, nestled in the Gaza envelope.

On October 7, it was Liberman's daughter, Inbal, the community's security coordinator, who displayed remarkable courage. She opened the weapons storage lockers and distributed arms to the community's rapid response team, sending them to various locations along the kibbutz fence. She and the team engaged in face-to-face battles with Hamas terrorists. Her quick actions prevented them from entering the kibbutz and prevented a massacre similar to what occurred in neighboring communities.

ISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS FORCE IS 'AT WAR' WITH HAMAS AS IDF HITS BACK AT TERROR TARGETS

On Wednesday, during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, Liberman celebrated with his family back in Kibbutz Nir Am. ""My wife and I were the only ones to come back in mid-November, while the kibbutz was under full military control. I manage the agriculture in Nir Am, and I had to be here. By the end of March, a small number of families returned, and on August 15, when government funding ended, everyone returned except for 12 families,"" he recounted.

""This was a sad holiday; some of our friends still have family members and friends held in Gaza. In the morning, we were informed by the IDF there would be loud noises coming from their fighting in Gaza,"" Liberman described the ongoing tension in the region. ""People got anxious because it reminded them of October 7 -- the booming and gunfire. But we're managing a routine. People go to work, and children go to school, living my life completely, with sounds of war.""

After October 7, 15,000 people were evacuated from the 21 kibbutzim in southern Israel, first to hotels and then into temporary housing across the country. Remarkably, about 70% have returned home, a significant achievement considering the ongoing war in Gaza and the devastating impact of the attack, which claimed the lives of some 1,200 people, 319 of whom were kibbutz members, and destroyed hundreds of homes.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

However, six of the communities where the impact was most severe have yet to return. In Kibbutz Be'eri, 98 men, women, and children were murdered, and 30 were kidnapped. In Kfar Aza, home to 700, 64 people, including women and children, were massacred, and 19 were taken hostage. In Nahal Oz, a small community of 450, 15 were killed and 8 were kidnapped.

""Only twenty members of Kibbutz Nahal Oz have returned to the kibbutz, while 330 residents -- eighty percent of our community -- are in Mishmar Ha'emek, a kibbutz in north-central Israel. They've been hosting us since October 8,"" Amir Tibon, a resident of Nahal Oz, told Fox News Digital. ""Being together as one community in this temporary housing has been significant, as we are surrounded by the people we love. Our children still go to school and kindergarten together, which makes a big difference.""

On October 7, Tibon and his wife Miri were rescued along with their two younger daughters, thanks to his mother Gali, and father, retired IDF Major General Noam Tibon, who drove from Tel Aviv to the kibbutz to rescue them. On their way, they rescued survivors of the music festival massacre and helped wounded Israeli soldiers. Hours after leaving his home in Tel Aviv, Amir's father battled a Hamas terrorist in Nahal Oz and saved his family. Tibon later chronicled his experiences in his new book, ""The Gates of Gaza: A Story of Betrayal, Survival, and Hope in Israel's Borderline,"" where he intertwines his personal story with the history of the kibbutz.

FOREIGN SURVIVORS OF BRUTAL HAMAS ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECALL TERROR MASSACRE: 'EVERYTHING WAS BURNING'

""The kibbutzim's key role in the history of Israel, in creating and protecting the borders of Israel, remains crucial. This way of life, with a strong emphasis on community and togetherness, is more important now than ever,"" Tibon believes.

""A kibbutz can be understood as a microcosm of collective living, where community, equality and shared labor play vital roles in the daily lives of its members,"" Ayelet Harris, head of the community division in the Kibbutz Movement, said of the leadership dynamics in these communities.

""The Kibbutzim institutional structure has been crucial in the process of recovery. I saw women and men leading their kibbutzim and prioritizing the mission of returning, even in uncertain times. They decided to focus on the mission of going, working through their emotional states while being part of the teams planning the return. This sense of ownership fosters a deeper sense of belonging than in other places where people feel less influence over future plans.""

Tibon reflected on the complexities surrounding the decision to return home. ""This is a conversation we have every day. The issue is about the sense of security that the government and IDF must provide, and overcoming the psychological barriers of returning to a place where such horrors occurred.""

The ongoing trauma is compounded by the uncertainty of their friends and family who remain in Hamas captivity. ""We received five of our hostages back alive in November, thanks to a deal orchestrated by President Biden. But we still have two friends, Omri and Zachi, in the hands of the enemy,"" Tibon explained. ""For me, going back to the kibbutz means living in a house where a neighbor was killed in the house in front of me, and another neighbor was murdered in the house behind. This is where I will raise my daughters. I believe I can do that, but I don't know if I can pass by the homes of these two friends and know they were left to die in the tunnels of Gaza.""

VIDEOS OF HAMAS BRUTALITY TOWARD ISRAELIS EERILY REMINISCENT OF ISIS TACTICS

Last week, while walking around Kibbutz Gvulot, the contrast between the children's laughter and the reality of their lives was striking. Children played soccer on the grass, joyfully unaware of the shadows cast by the shelters positioned every few meters, decorated with pictures of beloved cartoon characters. The regional school at the center of the kibbutz has been improvised from structures that existed prior to October 7.

""After the attack, we found ourselves in a hotel in Eilat with a large part of the traumatized community of the south,"" Lior Dafner, the chairman of Kibbutz Gvulot, recalls. ""Every day we received news about more people we knew being kidnapped or murdered- a truly incomprehensible situation."" Kibbutz Gvulot was one of the very few places that were not raided during the October 7 massacre.

""You see a slow deterioration of people into helplessness; there are no frameworks for children. We realized we needed to establish ourselves and figure out where to go next. We wanted to ensure that the children and staff started the year on September 1, like all children in the country, and finish on June 30, in the same classroom with the same teacher and group of kids -- all in a safe and stable environment. After everything they've been through, losing friends and teachers, seeing them now in school gives us hope. This is the future. It gives us hope for what lies ahead,"" Dafner said.

Throughout the communities that are back in their homes, there is a call for resilience despite the challenges. Liberman said, ""I think we had to return here and hold this place. We need to preserve our country. I was just in New York, sitting with Jews who lamented that they are not in Israel. You see the synagogue surrounded by police protecting them because they are afraid. We, the Jewish people, are unwelcome anywhere in the world. So, we have no choice but to remain in our state. I hope that after the fighting in the south and north ends, and once we bring our hostages home, we can return to living that ninety-nine percent of paradise."""

The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Friday warned that the upcoming one-year anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel could motivate some people to engage in violence within the United States.

In a public service announcement, authorities said the anniversary may motivate extremists and others to engage in hate crimes and provoke violence.

Trump national security advisors mock Biden's warnings to Israel to stick to 'proportional' Iran response,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-israel-response-iran-trump,2024-10-04T19:26:57Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joined 'Fox & Friends'

A ""painful"" Israeli response weighs over the heads of the Iranian regime after their ballistic missile attacks on Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden has insisted that an angry Israel should not strike Iran's nuclear sites - and should make sure its response is measured - proportional.

""Iran launched a war into Israel,"" said former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel.

""So to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

On Thursday, he revealed that he was ""discussing"" recommending Israel target Iran's energy facilities.

""That put the oil markets into a tailspin, even if we are talking to them about it. It's not something you muse about publicly,"" said former Trump deputy national security advisor Victoria Coates.

""If you've made a decision, and you have something to announce, fine. You want to level with the American people as much as you can. These random comments are really damaging and confusing to the Iranians, because . . . they don't have any guidelines or guardrails about what might be coming and so they might do something weird.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH KHAMEINI DEFENDS MISSILE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL

Israel's counterattack could come at any moment. ""We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.

Rather than its longtime goal of helping to negotiate a ceasefire, the Biden administration has now shifted its priority to containment - helping the region avoid all-out war between its two hegemonic superpowers.

""This is the 1930s all over again. G7 leaders - led by President Biden - are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital.

""The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality,"" he went on. ""Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?""

Former President Donald Trump has not said how Israel should respond to the attacks - which he insists never would have happened under his watch.

Striking Iran's nuclear facilities risks provoking all-out war on yet another front for Israel in the eyes of the Biden administration. The Trump team is caught between an anti-war mindset and a penchant for supporting Israel without conditions. It's unclear whether they still believe the two can exist in harmony.

Proportionality is ""clearly not what Israel is doing,"" according to Coates.

""It really seems to me that after the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] left Washington in July, after that visit, some factor, or combination of factors, really changed his calculus,"" she said.

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""He appears to have gotten home with the attitude of, 'I want to get everything I can get done before the election.' He's not really listening to the White House at all, which is unfortunate.""

After Iranian plots to assassinate him and the hacking of his campaign, Trump did say that if he were president, he would tell Iran, ""I'm going to blow you to smithereens"" if they harm any U.S. political figures.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he wished he had responded more forcefully after Iran fired dozens of missiles at U.S. forces stationed in Iraq in 2020, leaving many with traumatic brain injuries.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean? 'Injured' means -- you mean, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort,"" Trump said.

""So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq,"" Trump continued, saying 'Iraq' instead of 'Iran.' ""When you say not tough, they had no money. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. And when we hit them, they hit us. And they called us, and they said, 'We're going to shoot at your fort, but we're not going to hit it.'""

Defense officials have said more than 100 suffered traumatic brain injuries after the January 2020 attack.

That attack came after Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani due to an uncovered Iranian plot to kill American diplomats and service members.

Trump vowed to hit 52 Iranian sites ""very hard"" if Iran were to carry out the plot, representing the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days after being seized at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979.

Still, in January, Iran lobbed attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, including the Ain al-Assad military base, and a second facility near Erbil airport.

In March, three U.S.-led coalition forces were killed when multiple rockets hit Taji military base.

Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, has insisted to reporters this week that ""nobody [was] ever tougher on Iran"" than he was.

'Look at the World today -- Look at the missiles flying right now in the Middle East, look at what's happening with Russia/Ukraine, look at Inflation destroying the World. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT!' he wrote on Truth Social.

Alexander Vindman, the former Trump National Security Council Director for European Affairs for the United States, claimed that the former president was ""fearful"" of escalation with Iran.

""Iran struck first and early, during Trump's presidency, attacking US troops. Trump consistently recoiled in fear inviting further attacks,"" he wrote on X.

""Fact check: In 2020, Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in retaliation for the Soleimani assassination. 110 U.S. service members sustained traumatic brain injuries. Many administration officials remain on an Iranian hit list today,"" former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

But Patel argued the Biden administration's lifting of sanctions on Iran -- and the Obama administration's 2015 nuclear deal -- is what led to the attacks in the first place.

""The JCPOA, which was called the 'Iran nuclear deal' for a reason. It was never intended to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It literally gave them one on a timeline,"" he said.

""Now I believe they have one, because for four years they haven't stopped them or slowed them down. They've only been successful in politicizing national security."""

Taiwan's de facto U.S. ambassador is warning that China, Iran and Russia are forming an ""alliance"" that the rest of the world should be ready for.

It comes days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the three autocratic countries were working together but not an ""axis,"" as they have so often recently been called.

""They're working together, that's for sure, whether that's an axis or an alliance"" Alexander Yui, Taiwan's representative to the U.S., told Fox News this week.

""And as you know, it's up to anyone to define it. But there were certainly there are symptoms, signs that they're working together.""

During the interview, Yui also suggested that Taiwan's government was in touch with both Vice President Harris and former President Trump's circles to be prepared for whatever comes next in U.S. relations.

""The whole world is watching, and I'm sure the diplomatic community here in Washington, D.C., is also watching closely and [trying] to reach out to both candidates or to the people around the candidates,"" Yui said.

Blinken penned an op-ed in Foreign Affairs Magazine on Oct. 1 that said world powers were in competition to set the stage for a ""new age"" of international relations.

""A small number of countries -- principally Russia, with the partnership of Iran and North Korea, as well as China -- are determined to alter the foundational principles of the international system. While their forms of governance, ideologies, interests, and capabilities differ, these revisionist powers all want to entrench autocratic rule at home and assert spheres of influence abroad,"" the Biden administration official wrote.

""While these countries are not an axis, and the administration has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent that outcome.""

Meanwhile, national security hawks on the right and left have warned that those four regimes were forging an unholy alliance not seen since WWII.

Both House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called them a new ""axis of evil.""

Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., House Democrats' former majority leader, said after President Biden's address on Israel and Ukraine in October 2023, ""We face a new axis of evil today. The dictators, despots, and dealers of destruction leading Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Iranian proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah stand together in their assault on democracy."""
Soros-backed dark money network paid New York Dem candidate's salary: 'Incredibly problematic',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/soros-backed-dark-money-network-paid-new-york-dem-candidates-salary-incredibly-problematic,2024-10-04T17:05:32Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A top Democratic House recruit drew a salary worth tens of thousands of dollars from a left-wing dark money group heavily bankrolled by George Soros' political empire, Fox News Digital has learned.

New York congressional candidate Laura Gillen, a town supervisor in the Long Island town of Hempstead, drew a $40,000 ""fellow"" salary with the group Our American Future Foundation (OAFF) in 2023, according to her financial disclosures. The group and a sister nonprofit, Our American Future Action, help pay expenses for individuals -- overwhelmingly Democrats -- who plan to run for office in the future.

According to the Open Society Foundations, the umbrella of groups founded by Soros, its Open Society Action Fund has donated more than $18 million to Our American Future Action ""to support non-partisan policy advocacy and civic engagement.""

Tax filings show Our American Future Action is Our American Future Foundation's ""direct controlling entity.""

HOUSE OVERSIGHT PROBES FCC'S EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF SOROS PURCHASE OF 200+ RADIO STATIONS AHEAD OF ELECTION

Our American Future Foundation also received direct support from the Soros empire. It got an undisclosed level of funding last year from the Jennifer and Jonathan Allan Soros Foundation, a charitable group run by one of the left-wing billionaire's sons, tax filings show.

Jonathan and Jennifer Soros have also donated to Gillen's campaign directly, each contributing $3,300 this year. Another Soros son, Robert Soros, donated $2,900 to Gillen's unsuccessful 2022 campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito.

""It is incredibly problematic that George Soros is paying candidates to run for office through a program disguised as a 'fellowship,'"" said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""Voters should be seriously alarmed that Laura Gillen, who is claiming to run on ethics and transparency, is being personally propped up by a Soros group that is advocating for open borders, anti-police measures, and radical energy policies,"" Sutherland continued. ""This raises crucial questions about who Gillen will answer to if elected to Congress: the voters...or George Soros?""

Gillen has claimed that pointing out Soros funding for her campaign is responsible for ""antisemitic violence.""

Rep. Dan Goldman, a fellow New York Democrat, has also accused D'Esposito, whom Gillen is challenging again this cycle, of ""using a disgusting antisemitic trope"" by pointing out Soros' backing.

Soros' groups have heavily funded organizations behind antisemitic protests since last year aimed at delegitimizing Israel and stopping U.S. support for its military campaign against the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

The Open Society Action Fund's $18,055,000 in funding for Our American Future Action began in 2023 and was slated to finance activities stretching for 19 months, according to a grants database on the Open Society Foundations website. Tax filings indicate the Jonathan and Jennifer Alan Soros Foundation's donation also came in 2023, the same year Gillen drew her fellowship salary.

The fellowship program is designed to provide aspiring political candidates, overwhelmingly Democrats, with money to cover basic living expenses while they focus on future political campaigns.

Several Democratic candidates in competitive 2024 contests have received funding from the group, including California's Will Rollins, Nebraska's Tony Vargas, Arizona's Kirsten Engel and New York's Josh Riley, according to the Washington Examiner.

In March, the Examiner first reported that the nonprofit watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) was filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging OAFF's payments to future House candidates violated federal law. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit, OAFF is prohibited from spending money on political activity. However, FACT alleged its payments to eventual candidates for office were explicitly designed to advance their political prospects.

""The fellowship's true purpose was explicitly described by its founder as a way to give money to failed candidates (or prospective candidates) for personal expenses in the brief downtime before they are able to file again to run for another office,"" FACT wrote in its complaint. ""Thus, the fellowship is directly tied to a federal candidacy and not for bona fide independent employment. Any claim otherwise would strain credulity.""

Soros has also poured millions into several other groups and committees backing Democrats throughout the 2024 cycle. His two super PACs - Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II - have so far combined to shower left-wing groups with $53 million, Federal Election Commission records show.

Gillen recently benefited from one of the groups financed by the left-wing billionaire. On Aug. 2, Soros' Democracy PAC sent $500,000 to the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, which weeks later spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on independent expenditures backing her candidacy in the form of digital production, ad buys, and other items. During that time, the group also backed Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats.

Gillen's campaign, Our American Future Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment."
Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
Satellite images show dozens of Iranian missiles struck near Israeli Air Base,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140058/satellite-images-dozens-iranian-missiles-struck-near-israeli-air-base,2024-10-04T16:17:06Z,"Researchers counted around 32 points where missiles landed around Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel. Israel says no fighter jets were destroyed and the base continues to operate. Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey/Planet Labs PBC hide caption

Researchers have used commercial satellite imagery to identify more than 30 points where Iranian missiles appear to have impacted an airbase in southern Israel.

The imagery, taken the day after the strike by the company Planet, shows damaged hangers, buildings, taxiways, and a crater on one of the runways at Nevatim Airbase. Videos posted to social media showed multiple warheads striking the base during the October 1 attack by Iran.

Israel and the U.S. have downplayed the attack, which Israel says consisted of roughly 180 ballistic missiles. Israel said that many were intercepted by its missile defenses. Two U.S. destroyers also fired around a dozen interceptors to try and blunt the strike.

""This attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said shortly after the missiles fell.

""Our air force and air force bases remain operational,"" an Israeli military spokesperson, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said in a briefing on the social media platform X.

The Israeli military says no planes were destroyed in the attack.

But Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey who led the analysis, says his work ""complicates the picture a lot.""

""We see more than 30 craters and damaged buildings,"" Lewis says, ""suggesting that more than 30 missiles hit the base.""

Iranian missiles also struck another base, Tel Nof Airbase in central Israel, and a smaller number of missiles fell near the headquarters of Israeli's intelligence agency, known as Mossad.

Based on preliminary calculations of what happened at Nevatim, Lewis believes a substantial number of Iranian missiles may have reached their targets.

""If Nevatim is representative that would suggest that more than half got through,"" he says.

Their are several reasons why so many Iranian missiles may have penetrated Israel's air defenses. Israel's vaunted Iron Dome missile defense system can only intercept low flying, short range missiles of the type used by Hezbollah and Hamas. To intercept Iran's medium-range ballistic missiles requires Israel's more powerful and expensive Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missile defense systems.

It is possible that the Arrow system failed to preform as expected Lewis says, but he thinks it's more likely that Israel may have decided not to defend Nevatim, in order to save its interceptors to protect population centers like Tel Aviv.

""It may be that they just don't have that many Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missiles,"" Lewis says. If that were true, then ""the Iranians have succeeded in overwhelming the system and the Israelis have had to pick and choose.""

""That would be my guess,"" Lewis adds. ""It did not look like they were trying to defend this base.""

Lewis notes that although over 30 missiles landed inside the base perimeter, the damage caused was still somewhat limited. That's notable because Iran is believed to have used some of its most advanced Fattah missiles.

""Even these missiles, which look substantially more accurate, still struggled to do damage,"" he says.

Still, he thinks the attack has shown that Iran can strike at targets well inside Israel. ""They can definitely get missiles through,"" he says."
Iran Refuses To Back Down As Its Proxies Endure Unprecedented Attacks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/04/iran-refuses-to-back-down-as-its-proxies-endure-unprecedented-attacks/,2024-10-04T16:03:18Z,"Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, appeared in public on Friday to announce Iran will continue supporting its regional proxies against Israel despite them coming under unprecedented attack and pressure.

""The resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders,"" Khamenei declared at Friday prayers in Tehran.

The supreme leader, who has the final say in all affairs in Iran since 1989, also dubiously claimed that Israel ""cannot seriously harm"" neither Hezbollah nor Hamas and said the latter's fight against Israel provides a ""vital service for the entire region.""

His appearance came less than a week after Iran launched its largest-ever ballistic missile strike against Israel on Tuesday. It also follows a deadly Israeli air and ground campaign in Lebanon, suspected Israeli sabotage of Hezbollah communications with explosive-packed pagers, the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and airstrikes and a rare commando raid in Syria.

These actions badly hurt Iran's most militarily powerful regional proxy, prompting Tehran to lash out with Tuesday's strike, launching a massive barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles, including some of its most advanced models. That attack ultimately caused minor damage to Israeli homes and a large airbase but no casualties inside Israel -- although falling shrapnel did kill a 38-year-old Palestinian in the West Bank. While none of its military capabilities, the targeted airbase houses many of Israel's most advanced fifth-generation F-35 aircraft, were destroyed in the attack, Israel had to expend several multi-million-dollar Arrow interceptor missiles to counter the incoming missiles.

Following the attack, a senior Israeli military official said, ""We should expect to strike government centers and possibly eliminate figures like Khamenei in Iran."" Pro-government media in Iran lauded the supreme leader for appearing in public in light of such threats and Israel's more general track record of successfully assassinating senior figures inside Iran.

Khamenei reportedly warned Nasrallah in the days leading up to his September 27 assassination to leave Lebanon. Following the simultaneous detonation of thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies on September 17-18 -- injuring thousands of members and disrupting the group's communications -- Khamenei sent a brigadier general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Abbas Nilforoushan, to Beirut to convince Nasrallah. Nilforoushan subsequently perished in the same devastating Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah.

As Hezbollah's secretary-general since February 1992, Nasrallah was undoubtedly and the single most important figure in Iran's regional militia proxies, the self-styled Axis of Resistance. For Khamenei, his loss was as consequential, if not more so, than the US assassination of the IRGC extraterritorial Quds Force commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a January 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad.

Israel is also believed to have targeted Nasrallah's presumed successor, Hashem Safieddine, in heavy airstrikes on a bunker in Beirut on Thursday night.

Israel has also been busy afflicting potentially mortal blows against Hezbollah's powerful rocket and missile arsenal, estimated to number anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 surface-to-surface projectiles, including long-range and precision-guided munitions.

Israel launched its current offensive against Hezbollah -- dubbed Operation Northern Arrows -- on September 23, with the Israeli Air Force executing its most extensive airstrikes ever, using 250 fighter jets to strike 1,600 Hezbollah targets on that day. While undoubtedly devastating, the Israeli military said at the beginning of the campaign that reports of these airstrikes destroying 50 percent of Hezbollah's rockets were most likely exaggerated.

However, by October 1, senior Israeli and American officials assessed that the Israeli air campaign has destroyed half of the militia's missiles and rockets. However, they again noted that the surviving half of arsenal could still pose a significant threat to Israel.

For years, analysts assessed that a Third Lebanon War could see Hezbollah unleash an enormous missile and rocket barrage, overwhelming Israel's multilayered air defense and causing significant casualties and extensive damage. For example, veteran journalist and Hezbollah expert Nicholas Blanford predicted that such a scenario could see Israel's home front ""experience its greatest destruction and loss of life since the 1948 war"" while Lebanon would become a parking lot.

Since September 23, as it potentially faces a ""use it or lose it"" scenario with its arsenal, Hezbollah has mainly used short-range rockets, only launching a single ballistic missile toward Tel Aviv on September 25, which Israeli air defenses swiftly intercepted. Iran had helped Hezbollah to build up this arsenal primarily to deter an Israeli airstrike against its nuclear program. It's widely speculated that one reason Hezbollah did not unleash more missiles since it was awaiting authorization from Tehran. On the other hand, Israeli attacks on and sabotage of its command, control, and communications could have also been the primary factor.

While Israel is unlikely to prove capable of destroying this entire arsenal with airstrikes alone, it could severely cripple it, stripping Hezbollah of its main strategic asset and Iran of its main regional deterrent against Israel. Furthermore, Hezbollah may find it difficult to replenish its losses in the short term if the current fighting stops soon.

As The New York Times reported, the current Israeli campaign -- which also includes an ongoing ground incursion into South Lebanon that has already resulted in deadly clashes, with eight Israeli soldiers killed on Wednesday -- did not begin in Lebanon but next door in Syria.

More than a week before the pager explosions, Israel launched airstrikes against Syria on September 8, itself not unusual. However, this time, an estimated 100 helicopter-borne commandos raided an underground Hezbollah missile production facility deep near northwestern Syria's Masyaf, not far from the Lebanese border.

The facility previously belonged to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, which manufactured Syria's notorious chemical weapons. It was built too deep underground for bunker-buster bombs, like the ones believed to have been used to kill Nasrallah in his Beirut bunker, to damage sufficiently. So, the commandos raided the facility, planting explosives to destroy the equipment used to manufacture Hezbollah missile components. They were in and out in only 15 minutes.

""It initially looked to be a one-off attack on a Hezbollah weapons facility, but it now appears to have been the opening salvo in a covert-in-name-only campaign against the Iranian proxy group,"" the Times report noted.

How all of this ends is impossible to predict. Khamenei's reiteration on Friday that his regime won't back down comes as Israel has vowed to retaliate directly against Iran for Tuesday's missile attack, which could see this already deadly Middle East conflagration spread even further.

For now, it seems clear that Iran's regional proxies may well have endured their deadliest days ever and mightn't fully recuperate their former strength and many of the military capabilities they possessed just over a mere week ago."
Oil Prices Shot Up This Week. How High Will They Go?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/10/04/oil-prices-shot-up-this-week-how-high-will-they-go/,2024-10-04T12:44:49Z,"The only truly predictable thing about predicting oil prices is that they are stubbornly unpredictable. Anyone able to accurately and consistently predict the direction of oil prices would soon become a billionaire by trading in the commodity.

I learned that lesson for about the 100th time this week when, one day after I wrote a piece about the potential price-depressing impacts from an apparent shift in strategic direction by Saudi Arabia on October 1, oil prices began shooting up in the wake of Iran's decision to launch a ballistic missile attack into Israel. As of this writing on the morning of October 4, the international Brent price for crude oil is up 11% for the week and still rising in Friday trading.

Oil markets have remained unusually stable over the past year since the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas on Israel, mainly due to the lack of any threat to the free flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf. But the prospect of Israel launching a major retaliation that would target Iran's oil production and export infrastructure has traders on higher alert.

Where will oil prices go from here? As always, that is anyone's guess, and guesses are the only things available to us. Prices will rise or drop based on a wide variety of factors, including the following:

Will Israel retaliate, and what would such a countermove look like? - Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed to retaliate directly against Iran in the wake of the missile attack, saying his government will adhere to ""the rule we established: Whoever attacks, we will attack them.""

Should Israel decide to strike at Iran's refining and export infrastructure, oil prices would almost certainly rise significantly.

Would OPEC+ respond by raising exports? - It is certainly possible, perhaps likely that some or all OPEC+ participants would respond to a major disruption in Iranian exports by increasing their own export volumes to fill the gap. While many OPEC+ members would like to see prices rise back up into the $90/barrel range - a $12/barrel increase from Friday's opening level - a major price spike to higher levels could have long-term demand killing impacts that the cartel wishes to avoid.

Will rising crude prices further slow economic growth in China and other major importing countries? - One reason OPEC+ would likely seek to fill any major gap in Iranian supplies is the probability that a major price spike would further slow economic growth in China and across the rest of the world, thus further slowing oil demand growth.

What others are saying. - Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs, told the hosts of CNBC's Squawkbox Asia program Friday morning, ""If you were to see a sustained 1 million barrels per day drop in Iranian production, then you would see a peak boost to oil prices next year of around $20 per barrel,"" adding that price impacts would be less significant should OPEC+ step in to fill some of the gap.

Iran's exports have topped 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, their highest levels since 2018, as the US and global community have eased sanctions invoked during the Donald Trump administration. Obviously, a major Israeli strike that shuts down Iran's ability to export onto the global market would send oil prices soaring. But Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, told Reuters this week that, ""In theory, if we lost all Iranian production - which is not our base case - OPEC+ has enough spare capacity to make up for the shock.""

Andy Critchlow, EMEA head of news at S&P Global Commodity Insights, told CNBC's Street Signs Europe hosts that OPEC claims to have roughly 5.6 million bpd in excess capacity, with Saudia Arbia controlling most of that volume. ""These are dangerous times for oil markets at the moment,"" Critchlow said, ""It's hard for anyone in the market to really gauge the direction when you look at the amount of geopolitical risk that is out there.""

Critchlow's final comment really summarizes the bottom line on this situation: Many experts like those quoted here have keen insights to offer, and many observers have informed opinions on the future direction of oil prices. But the only thing we really know for sure about the question is that no one really knows for sure."

- As Oct. 7 anniversary approaches, Jewish students vow to 'walk proudly'

- CNN's Amanpour says Iran does not want to 'escalate' conflict even as Iranian rockets strike Israel

- Harvard went easy on students for antisemitic conduct, House committee finds

- Hugh Hewitt: How Kamala Harris' snub of Netanyahu only seemed to embolden Israeli leader

TOP STORY: With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning Monday.

VIDEO: Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it. Watch it here:

COME AGAIN, CHRISTINE?: CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour insisted Tuesday that Iran does not want conflict to escalate with Israel or the United States, and that Tehran felt it had ""no choice"" but to strike the Jewish state after Israel took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan disagreed, calling the attack ""a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event.""

GRADING ON A CURVE: Harvard University went easy on students whose antisemitic conduct violated its own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which probed anti-Israel college protests in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. Of 68 students disciplined, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not, and one is on leave. The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

HUGH HEWITT: Vice President Kamala Harris sent a very public message to her anti-Israel supporters when she skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit this summer. And ever since, Netanyahu has embraced a different strategy, from his fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, to taking the war to Hamas and Hezbollah.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: ""This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

6 ways Iran could strike US in the Mideast or here at home,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/6-ways-iran-could-strike-us-mideast-here-home,2024-10-04T11:10:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran's terror goons are in crisis mode right now. Having seen their missile attack on Israel fail yet again due to Israel's powerful defenses, Iran is now expecting an Israeli counterstrike.

""There will be severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday, October 1. All the G7 nations agree Israel has the right to strike back, President Joe Biden added Wednesday.

Iran wants blood. But they are running out of options. More than 40,000 U.S. forces were already deployed to U.S. Central Command in the Middle East, in locations from Syria to the Red Sea. Three more squadrons of F-15Es, F-16s and A-10s are on the way to U.S. Central Command, joining stealth F-22s, F-35s and others already in the region.

TRUMP SAYS IRANIAN PRESIDENT BEING GUARDED AT UN WHILE PLOTTING ASSASSINATION 'A STRANGE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES'

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is launching jets day and night and the USS Wasp, with a Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, is in the eastern Mediterranean. The submarine USS Georgia, carrying 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, is nearby too, along with a bevy of U.S. Navy destroyers.

Make no mistake. This is enough firepower to hit many types of Iranian targets. Guarantee you, Iran's military units are scrambling to prepare. While being very, very careful about using cellphones.

Whatever action comes will aim to weaken and contain Iran. Iran's proxies Hamas and Hezbollah have been mauled. But this conflict won't be over as long as the ayatollah holds power over Iran's people. That gang has been in the ideology and terror business for almost 50 years and won't go quietly.

Look for desperate Iran to consider six moves - including two here in the USA.

Already in massive violation of the United Nations inspection regime, Iran proclaimed in July they would install more than 1,400 centrifuges at the underground Fordow facility. ""Iran has managed to reach a point where it can not only produce nuclear weapons on-demand but produce large quantities of WGU [weapons-grade uranium] quickly in a very hard-to-destroy enrichment plant,"" expert David Albright noted. The best case is that Iran's new president wants more enriched uranium as a bargaining chip. The worst case is rapid production of three to five nuclear warheads.

Many of the recent deployments directed by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are beefing up security against direct attacks from Iran, like the January 2020 ballistic missile attack on U.S. personnel at a base in Iraq. U.S. outposts will be on guard against attempted strikes by Iran-backed militia.

The Houthis, supplied by Iran, will continue to menace Red Sea shipping. Iran has also been working a deal for Russia to supply upgraded P-800 ""Oniks"" anti-ship missiles to the Houthis.

Even after tactical failures on Apr. 13 and Oct. 1, more missile attacks from Iran remain a concern. Fortunately, U.S. Navy destroyers USS Cole and USS Bulkeley fired interceptors from the eastern Mediterranean against Iran's attack. This is sweet vengeance for the USS Cole, nearly sunk by al Qaeda terrorists in Yemen in 2000, with the loss of 17 sailors killed and 37 wounded.

Beyond this, U.S. Central Command is massing a powerful defensive and offensive force starting to serve a new deterrent role. Should Iran field nuclear weapons, this is the type of force array that will be necessary to deter their attacks. Iran's leaders must get the message that any nuclear-armed missiles they may build in the future won't get through.

Two more threats from Iran could aim directly at the U.S.

The FBI says threat indicators are spiking. In early September, the FBI warned Iran is targeting hospitals and healthcare in the US. Don't forget Iran almost opened the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye, New York back in 2013; by chance, the sluice gate was offline for maintenance. A 2023 bulletin from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps group ""CyberAv3ngers"" is still targeting wastewater management systems. Who knows what cyber tricks Iran may have learned from Russia.

The Director of National Intelligence has briefed former President and Republican nominee Donald J. Trump on ""real and specific threats"" to assassinate him. ""I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before,"" Trump posted on Truth Social last week. Sadly, violence against American leaders fits Iran's playbook.

Be assured the U.S. and allies are prepared to counter every one of these options.

Whatever violence Iran unleashes next, remember China is also to blame. China buys almost 90% of Iran's oil in what the Atlantic Council dubbed ""the axis of evasion"" and China's support is enabling Iran's lethal mayhem."

Putin's invaders are grinding out territorial gains at immense cost in casualties because the Biden-Harris Administration refuses to provide Kyiv the needed weapons systems and munitions to throw back the invaders. Why? Because the White House doesn't want to overly upset Putin, who thinks he can still win this war.

The same mindset has the Biden-Harris team constantly trying to force Israel into ill-conceived ceasefires with Hamas and Hezbollah and responding meekly to China's relentless efforts to establish control over the South China Sea.

This episode of What's Ahead makes the case that our weakness and lack of a strategic direction are creating conditions for war on a global scale."

With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States.

The anniversary of the devastating attacks by Hamas against Israel is likely to exacerbate already inflamed tensions at colleges - further heightened by Iran's unprecedented missile attack against the Jewish state.

Many anti-Israel groups are already planning demonstrations. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning on the October 7 anniversary.

Cornell undergraduate student Amanda Silberstein suggested that while many students are focused on honoring the memory of innocent lives lost throughout the Israel-Hamas war, SJP is ""choosing to celebrate the day and glorify violence under the guise of resistance.""

JEWS PREPARE TO OBSERVE ROSH HASHANAH AS GROUP STEPS UP TO SECURE COMMUNITY AMID HUGE RISE IN ANTISEMITISM

""This overt dehumanization of Jews not only disrespects all of the victims but also incites Jew hatred on campus,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It is disheartening to witness such a lack of empathy and understanding on a day that should be reserved for solemn reflection and unity - not for promoting hate and conflict.""

NSJP did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Bela Ingber, a student at NYU, also expressed concern about her local SJP chapter. The group is staging a walkout in Washington Square Park before joining larger protests throughout the city.

She noted that NYU has an open campus, meaning student protests can snowball into much more significant events. Not only do the protests attract students, but outsiders can agitate and take advantage of students to support a larger platform.

Ingber said that she is hopeful the NYPD, in conjunction with NYU campus safety, will attempt to keep the situation under control. Still, she is ""angry, frustrated and sad"" that fellow students will ""continue to justify the murder, rape, and kidnapping of Jews.""

However, Ingber stressed that she is also empowered and motivated.

""We are not going anywhere,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""We will not cower in fear and we most certainly will not be intimated. This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

Other students at campuses across the country told Fox News Digital they are preparing for the worst.

University of Pennsylvania student Noah Rubin said that campus leaders are putting together a vigil for the victims of October 7. But many peers, he said, are preparing for professors and fellow students to ""glorify and eulogize"" Hamas terrorism.

He recalled how last year, an anti-Israel encampment at UPenn shouted, ""They should do it again"" while playing footage of the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Just last week, after Israel eliminated Hezbollah's terror organization leader Hassan Nasrallah, Rubin claimed that students and professors at the school organized a vigil for him and other ""martyrs"" in Lebanon.

""There absolutely should be no place on college campuses to mourn the death of terrorists - and yet that is what we expect will continue on October 7 this year,"" he said.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum revealed to Fox News Digital that Jewish students at schools like Harvard, including Berkeley, Binghamton and the University of California-Los Angeles, have already hired and coordinated significant security operations to protect their October 7 commemorations.

While Berkeley has not released a statement on October 7 in particular, a school spokesperson told Fox News Digital that campus safety and inclusivity were addressed at the start of the semester in a video message from Berkeley's chancellor and UC's systemwide President, Michael Drake.

The spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that the school has been engaged in scenario discussions and planning.

""Student activism is nothing new on the Berkeley campus and we have established processes for planning and preparation,"" he added.

Kestenbaum called the need for security measures at several schools a ""damning indictment on the state of contemporary American higher education.""

""Many Jewish students don't feel safe because they are objectively not safe,"" he said.

For example, he pointed to the University of Pittsburgh, where five physical assaults against Jewish students have occurred in the last month. He also highlighted a recent attack against a Jewish student at the University of Michigan and a physical assault at Harvard Business School.

Columbia University was one of the major schools rocked by protests over the last year. These protests led to more than 200 arrests on campus and an incident in which agitators stormed into and occupied the university's Hamilton Hall for nearly 24 hours.

A Columbia spokesperson sent Fox News Digital a message from Interim President Katrina Armstrong to the campus community about the October 7 anniversary and recent demonstrations that occurred on September 5.

The other schools listed in this story did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment."
Disapproval mounts both at home and abroad as US avoids direct action against Houthi rebels,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/disapproval-mounts-home-abroad-us-avoids-direct-action-against-houthi-rebels,2024-10-04T08:09:52Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane joins 'Fox Report' to discuss the escalating tensions in the Middle East amid fears of a wider war.

While much of the world has eyes on Israel's battles with Hezbollah and Hamas, the U.S. Navy has its sights set on another of Iran's proxies, the Yemeni Houthi rebels.

With a mission to keep international waterways at peace, the Navy now finds itself fending off attacks from the shadowy gang of pirates who have gone from arming themselves with assault rifles, pickup trucks and motorboats - to a seemingly unending supply of drones, missiles and other weaponry.

The Houthis often attack unarmed Western ships carrying goods through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - while the U.S. has responded in kind with drone attacks on Yemen.

ISRAELI AIR FORCE STRIKES HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN WITH 'EXTENSIVE' OPERATION

That's led to perilous waters along a trade route that typically sees some $1 trillion in goods pass through it, as well as shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and the Yemeni people.

And as the attacks continue, some experts argue the U.S. response has not been strong enough to deter the Houthis from inflicting billions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.

""The U.S. response has been ineffective,"" Can Kasapoglu, a Turkey-based Hudson Institute fellow who specializes in Middle East political-military affairs, told Fox News Digital.

""We have very limited intelligence about [the Houthis] and they are in a different part of the world, in a distant corner of the Middle East. But that corner also happens to be right next to a choke point on global trade... The Houthis are the most daring of the Iranian proxy network. And the U.S. has never gone into a preemptive phase where they target the Houthi leadership.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

The U.S. has responded to attacks with air and missile defense efforts, drone and missile interceptions - only engaging the Houthis once an attack is imminent, said Kasapoglu.

""We never saw a high-yield targeted killing campaign by the United States, for instance, Israel killed [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah. Or just like Israel went after, for instance, the higher, high-level Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals, so this is what is missing - the U.S. acting against critical leadership.""

In addition to destroying goods destined for the West, the regular Houthi attacks drive up insurance costs: premiums for some shot up tenfold. They force some ships to travel the long way - down around the Horn of Africa, which can add $1 million in fuel costs for a round trip.

""They are launching relatively low-cost weapon systems, and inflicting major economic damage on the West on behalf of Iran. This is a very lucrative business,"" said Kasapoglu.

One argument for restraint could be the cost of action: Houthi drones are estimated to cost a few thousand dollars each. The Naval missiles the U.S. fires back at them can run around $2 million a shot.

Houthi attacks ramped up after Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, targeting 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones over the past year.

They've seized one vessel and sunk two and killed a total of four sailors. A U.S.-led series of airstrikes in May killed at least 16 people, the rebels said.

BIDEN ADMIN NEEDS 'MORE AGGRESSIVE' PLAN TO TAKE ON HOUTHIS

On Tuesday, the rebel group claimed it shot down a multimillion-dollar, U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone flying near Yemen. The U.S. acknowledged losing one of the drones, which costs around $30 million apiece.

In January, the Iran-backed militias killed three U.S. service members and injured 40 others in an attack on a U.S. base in Jordan. The U.S. responded forcefully to that attack with a barrage of airstrikes on 85 targets across Iraq and Syria.

""That response proved to be effective, and I think that we could do more of that certainly - take that approach,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, former security coordinator of the Israel-Palestinian Authority.

Since the Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military acknowledged the Houthis shot down two MQ-9s in September.

The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel. In response, Israel Defense Forces launched aggressive retaliatory strikes in Yemen's key port city of Hodeida.

The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign in Gaza against Hamas. But many of the ships they attack have little connection to the conflict - some were even bound for Iran.

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES

Last month, they attacked the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which was carrying 1 million barrels of oil in the Red Sea.

And last week, Houthi rebels fired half a dozen ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were intercepted by Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday.

""This gets resolved when we finish our dealings with Iran, whatever that looks like in the long term,"" said Seth Krummrich, a retired Army colonel and former chief of staff at Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT).

Sources say the U.S. lacks a will to put boots on the ground to fight the Houthis. Central to the Biden administration's global strategy is a concern over escalating tensions that could lead to a full-scale confrontation with Iran - a nation that, by many estimates, is only weeks away from having the capability to build a nuclear bomb.

""The Israelis have the will to fight the Houthis, but they have limited capability, and they're also engaged with two wars going on right now, so it necessitates American intervention if the West really wants to stop them,"" said Kasapoglu.

US FORCES DESTROY HOUTHI WEAPONS

""Avoiding escalation is an obsession right now. It is a psychological case, not a political case. And it is imprisoning American military capabilities.""

Krummrich argued that the Pentagon ""has been staring at the Houthi problem long enough to understand that there is a limit to what you're going to be able to do without putting boots on the ground.""

""That would be like a giant sponge. It can absorb an endless amount of our resources,"" he said. ""But the Houthis are also smart. They launch and then retreat quickly... if they stay outside of our rules of engagement, they will be less likely to be struck.""

But others say there is more to be done that does not amount to ground forces.

""Yemen has proven time and time again that they're willing to absorb a lot of lethal activity from the U.S. and the coalition and still attack vessels, still attack Israel,"" said Schwartz.

""There's this fear of escalation, doing something that's so provocative that we're going to have a broader war. Yemen is at war with the United States from their perspective, right? Just like Lebanese Hezbollah is at war and has been with Israel, and the same with Hamas prior to Oct. 7.""

""We overestimate our concern in terms of a broadening conflict, because at the end of the day, the Houthis in particular, they're not a viable military force,"" Schwartz went on.

""We could be much more aggressive in terms of our military response to the Houthis and find an overwhelming response that falls well short of getting the U.S. mired in some type of major conflict."""
Israeli airstrikes cut off a key crossing between Lebanon and Syria,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/g-s1-26287/israeli-airstrikes-lebanon-syria-crossing,2024-10-04T07:56:14Z,"BEIRUT -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."
"FIFA to investigate Israel, days after Iran attacks, for alleged discrimination due to Palestinian complaints",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fifa-investigate-israel-alleged-discrimination-after-palestinian-complaints,2024-10-03T22:49:54Z,"Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., says the Biden-Harris administration is ""out of step"" with the conflict in the Middle East.

FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, intends to launch an investigation against the Israel Football Association (IFA) over allegations raised by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), it announced on Thursday.

FIFA's disciplinary committee will be asked to look into allegations of discrimination as the PFA has accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

Fox News has reached out to the PFA and IFA for comment.

The PFA previously proposed a suspension for Israel over the war in Gaza. The PFA proposal to 211 member federations called for ""appropriate sanctions, with immediate effect, against Israeli teams,"" according to FIFA documents released this year.

The proposal cited ""international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza"" and cited FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

""All the football infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed, or seriously damaged, including the historic stadium of Al-Yarmuk,"" the PFA wrote, adding that it had support for the motion from the federations of Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Yemen.

The PFA's proposal was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

""FIFA will mandate as of now, independent legal expertise to [analyze] the three requests [from the Palestinian FA] and ensure the statutes of FIFA are applied in the right way,"" Infantino said. ""Due to the urgency of the situation, an extraordinary FIFA Council will be convened and will take place before July 20 to review the results of the legal assessment and to take the decisions that are appropriate.""

FIFA said on Thursday that it won't suspend Israel but that the investigation into alleged discrimination will be carried out.

The most recent and prominent example of a country to have its athletes banned from major international sports competition was Russia at the Paris Olympics this summer.

ISRAELI WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS FLEE GAME AFTER IRANIAN MISSILE STRIKES

Russia was banned because it had invaded Ukraine just four days after the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee considered this attack a violation of the Olympic truce, which is a resolution that calls for all nations to lay down arms and not engage in conflict starting one week before the Olympics begin and ending one week after the end. The Russian Olympic Committee lost its appeal against its suspension by the International Olympic Committee in February.

Belarus, which was used as a staging ground for the invasion, was also not allowed to compete in Paris.

However, a total of 32 athletes from Russia and Belarus competed in Paris as neutral participants; 17 previously represented Belarus and 15 represented Russia. They were not allowed to boast their country's flag, but they were able to attend the closing ceremony.

Countries have also been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past, but those nation's players were never allowed to compete as neutrals.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was even banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

FIFA's announcement comes the same week that Iran launched a massive missile strike against Israeli cities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday.

The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such potentially devastating attacks. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, per the Associated Press.

Iran also warned that a retaliatory strike could warrant further ballistic response.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said during the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit this week that Israel must not believe it can act with ""impunity,"" according to Reuters.

""Any type of military attack, terrorist act or crossing our red lines will be met with a decisive response by our armed forces,"" said Pezeshkian.

This Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists. Conflict between Israel and surrounding countries in the region since then has led to widespread tensions across the U.S. over concerns of a humanitarian crisis."
"Yazidi woman held hostage for 10 years in Gaza freed in Israel, US operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/yazidi-woman-held-captive-10-years-gaza-freed-israel-us-operation,2024-10-03T16:20:20Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Yazidi woman held captive by Islamic terrorists for the last decade has been reunited with her family in Iraq following her escape and safe evacuation on Oct. 1 in a coordinated effort between Israeli and U.S. officials, the State Department confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Fawzia Amin Sido, now 21, was just 11 years old when she was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists before she was sold and trafficked into Gaza, where she was forced to marry an alleged Hamas fighter.

Amin Sido was apparently able to escape after her captor was killed in what was believed to have been an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike, enabling her to flee to a ""hideout"" within the Gaza Strip.

CHILDREN ONCE HELD HOSTAGE STILL WORKING THROUGH TRAUMA: 'ARE THEY COMING FOR US AGAIN?'

""In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, she was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing,"" the IDF said in a statement Thursday. ""Upon her entry into Israel, she continued to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge Crossing and from there-returned to her family in Iraq.""

The operation was led by the IDF's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories unit along with help provided by the U.S. Embassy in Israel, as well as other international actors, though the IDF did not detail who.

""Her story is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq,"" a spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital. ""As Secretary [Antony] Blinken has noted, '2,600 Yezidis remain missing and unaccounted for. We are determined to find them, to learn their fates, and to rescue those who remain alive'.""

The IDF said the coordinated trafficking efforts in Amin Sido's case are ""further evidence of the connection between the terrorist organization Hamas and ISIS.""

WHY NO ISIS MEMBER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH GENOCIDE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE FOR CRIMES AGAINST YAZIDIS

ISIS attacked Yazidi populations in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar in August 2014, abducting some 6,400 people and killing another 1,200, according to a report by the Times of Israel.

Roughly half of the abductees have reportedly been able to escape or have been freed.

The growing ties between ISIS and other terrorist organizations like Hamas signify a growing shift in the Middle East in which extremist groups, despite prior differences, are increasingly expanding ties, often facilitated by the backing of Iran.

The IDF vowed to continue to counter the ""Hamas-ISIS terrorist organization"" by striking terrorist-based infrastructure sites and pledged to ""free all hostages in Hamas captivity.""

There are still 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including seven Americans, most of whom were taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, though four of them were abducted in 2014 and 2015.

This figure does not include other Yazidi abductees mentioned by Blinken who may also be being held in Gaza."
Here's the speech Biden should have given to a troubled United Nations,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/speech-biden-should-given-troubled-united-nations,2024-10-03T11:12:27Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly last week, President Biden proposed building a ""more effective and more inclusive U.N."" by ""bringing in new voices and new perspectives.""

What he should have said instead is that the U.N. has lost its way, and it will need to be seriously reimagined if it is to remain relevant.

To be sure, the creation of the U.N. system to reconstruct global order after World War II was inspired, and its specialized agencies, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization, have done important work for decades.

Today, however, the U.N. suffers from a fundamental flaw: it gives too much power to revisionist autocracies like China and Russia that want to tear down the U.S.-led global system. Beijing, Moscow and other revisionist authoritarians use their influence in the U.N. to turn the institution against its founding mission.

UN ABDICATES ROLE OF MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKER BY BACKING TERRORISTS

The list of abuses is long.

Russia chaired a U.N. Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine as it was launching an invasion of that country. China continues to prevent the World Health Organization from investigating COVID-19's origins, making a future outbreak more likely.

Russia and China also use their seats in the U.N. Security Council to weaken sanctions efforts against the illegal nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. The U.N. Human Rights Council includes repressive regimes - such as China - ensuring that these countries escape scrutiny for their barbaric human rights records.

And employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) participated in the Oct. 7 attacks against Israel.

These are only the most prominent examples.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

Nevertheless, the proceedings last week demonstrate that many still believe the U.N. remains the best possible forum to bring countries together to address shared global challenges.

This is wishful thinking.

Biden is right when he says we are at an inflection point in history, but we will only rise to this challenge if the United States and its allies can revitalize and adapt multilateral institutions to reflect new realities.

Instead of Biden's platitudes about global cooperation, the next U.S. administration should acknowledge that America's adversaries have transformed the U.N. into another arena for competition between free nations and an axis of revisionist autocracies.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

They should use speeches at the General Assembly to call out the bad behavior of U.S. adversaries, such as China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela, and encourage close allies to join in the condemnation. They should be unrelenting in opposing this axis' threats to their neighbors, their unfair trade practices and their abhorrent human rights abuses.

They should unrelentingly defend U.S. allies, like Israel, from unfair attacks, and acknowledge that the U.N. is becoming even more obsessively antisemitic.

In both 2022 and 2023, the number of U.N. General Assembly resolutions condemning Israel exceeded the combined total of those condemning all other countries. Yet, the body refrained from condemning Hamas after the abhorrent Oct. 7 attack - even after it fired nine UNRWA employees for likely involvement in an act of war.

To counter the U.N.'s capture by cynical autocracies, Washington and its allies should use their diplomatic weight to place U.S. and allied officials in leadership institutions in key U.N. bodies, including the Human Rights Council.

WHY BIDEN'S SPEECH AT UNGA SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS ACROSS THE GLOBE

The United States provides one-third of U.N. funding, giving it enormous potential influence if it is willing to use it. But the U.S. should move from mandatory assessments to voluntary contributions in order to prioritize programs that advance U.S. interests and defund others.

In addition, Washington should advance multilateralism by selectively routing around the U.N. system in favor of institutions that include America's democratic allies and exclude authoritarian regimes such Russia and China. These groupings, like the G-7 and NATO, are often the only places where genuine international cooperation happens today.

Finally, there is no need to cling to the preexisting system. After WWII, there was an explosion of creativity as Washington and its allies invented new bodies from scratch. The world needs a new burst of such innovative thinking now to design the multilateral frameworks necessary to meet contemporary challenges.

Priority should be given to frameworks that bring together U.S. allies in North America, Europe and the Indo-Pacific. NATO, the Quad, AUKUS, IP4 (Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea), and the American-Japanese-Korean trilateral pact are promising steps in this direction.

Last week's U.N. proceedings show that hope for multilateral cooperation remains alive. But to transform that spirit into effective governance, Washington will need to reimagine the U.N. and other global institutions to return them to their founding mission of promoting peace, prosperity and freedom.

Watch: Pro-Israel influencer recovers West Bank interview with Palestinian woman he was threatened to delete,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-israel-influencer-recovers-west-bank-interview-with-palestinian-woman-that-he-was-threatened-to-delete,2024-10-03T09:09:30Z,"Zach Sage Fox traveled to the West Bank to see if Palestinian people truly support the Hamas terror group, but he almost didn't make it out alive.

Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it.

Fox has been on a crusade to educate his followers since the terror attacks of October 7. He went viral earlier this year when his ""Gaza Graduation"" video featured anti-Israel protesters in New York City struggling to correctly answer basic questions about the Israel-Hamas war and decided to take his popular man-on-the-street style interviews to the West Bank, a contentious territory that Palestinians hope to establish as an independent state along with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

Fox, a ""loud and proud"" Jewish American, told anyone who asked that he was an Italian American and was able to cross the border into the West Bank without issue, because Israelis and Jewish people are not welcomed in the region.

INFLUENCER WENT TO THE WEST BANK TO SEE IF PALESTINIANS SUPPORT HAMAS - HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ALIVE

Fox found several people walking West Bank streets who were quick to express support for the Hamas terror group and declared Israeli hostages should not be released, but things got dicey when he tried to interview a woman whose hair was fully covered. A ""very upset"" Palestinian man approached him and asked him to delete the footage.

""They're not used to anybody questioning their narrative that they've been brainwashed to believe. And you can see it ... I'm interviewing that girl just for several minutes and these men watching it, they can't even accept that you would be asking questions because it's not a free society,"" Fox told Fox News Digital.

Fox recalled the man yelling ""something about modesty,"" and that females shouldn't speak for all Palestinians. Fox attempted to ignore the man, but he only grew more agitated and started calling additional Palestinian men for support. He explained that he caved and deleted the footage when his Muslim cameraman said the angry group was threatening their lives.

Fox initially enlisted a team of IT specialists who were able to recover some of the footage, and every interview that was salvaged made the viral ""Wild West Bank"" video. But his conversation with the woman who sparked the conversation remained lost.

""Dozens of cyberhackers,"" additional IT specialists and even an Israel Defense Forces veteran with a passion for technology all tried unsuccessfully to restore the video. Fox was beginning to lose hope, but was eager to show the world what this woman had to say because she was ""emblematic of the mindset"" in the region.

She was ""clearly educated"" and spoke perfect English, dressed in designer clothes and said she was an engineer. Yet, she believed all Zionist should be killed.

FOX NEWS MEDIA DRAWS 10.4 MILLION FOR SIMULCAST OF THE CBS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another technology expert caught wind of the story and offered to help recover the video. Fox thought it was impossible and was reluctant to set himself up for further disappointment but eventually said ""f -- k it"" and gave them a shot.

""A week later I got a call that they recovered almost all of it. It was a miracle,"" Fox said.

Fox then watched the footage and ""couldn't believe his eyes.""

""To see that interview back after three months was insane... I didn't know when my cameraman stopped filming, so I didn't realize, one, that you could see the men starting to pull the other men in the into the thing. I didn't realize you could see that behind me,"" he said.

""I also didn't realize that my cameraman kept the camera going long enough so that you actually saw the people cut the camera off and stop the shoot,"" Fox added. ""So, that was like wild to me.""

Fox then published ""Wild West Bank: Deleted Scenes Exploded,"" allowing the world to see the footage the angry Palestinian men tried to scrub.

VIRAL INFLUENCER ZACH SAGE FOX PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CLUELESS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 'NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING'

In the shocking video, the woman told him that most Palestinians support Hamas, she proudly declared being ""really satisfied"" with footage Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7. She also denied Hamas killed babies and women during the attack and said no Israelis are ""innocent civilians."" She suggested she is a ""refugee"" despite her family living in the West Bank for multiple generations and flatly dismissed a two-state solution. Along the way, Fox politely pushed back on antisemitic claims and absurd talking points.

""I am an educated person, it's either us or us,"" she said when suggesting Jewish people need to leave Israel for good. When Fox told her there would ""never be peace"" with that mindset, she fired back, ""It's their problem.""

As a man began lurking in the background, Fox asked if she believes Zionists deserve to die.

""Cut, cut real quick,"" the man said. ""What side are you on?""

Fox calmly responded that he was simply asking questions, but the man demanded to know where he was from.

""I'm from the states,"" Fox answered as the man demanded the cameraman stop recording.

The video abruptly cuts off.

NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED

Fox feels ""vindicated"" that he was able to share the footage.

""I just think this girl is really representative of how these people think,"" Fox said.

""I feel bad for her, I know that sounds crazy cause she's literally sitting there saying everyone who I love deserves to die,"" he continued. ""But my takeaway is that she's the perfect example of somebody who's not stupid. She's an engineer, she's a smart girl, but she's been brainwashed by the propaganda they're taught in Palestine.""

Earlier this year, the Department of State urged Americans to avoid the West Bank because of ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

Fox remains one of the only Americans to enter the West Bank and try to ask tough questions, but he doesn't believe State Department warnings are the thing keeping America journalists out of the region.

""I genuinely think that they know deep down, whether they want to admit it or not, that they would find... it totally negates their narrative, which is that, you know, 'Hamas is bad, but the Palestinians are separate,'"" Fox said.

""I wish that was the case. I truthfully didn't believe it myself until I went there that day,"" he added. ""They love Hamas."""
Biden says he would not back Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-would-not-back-israeli-strike-irans-nuclear-sites,2024-10-03T01:06:58Z,"President Biden said Wednesday that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's firing of 181 missiles at Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

On Wednesday, a day after the massive attack and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack, Biden briefly spoke with reporters before boarding Air Force One.

He said all the leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

""We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us [G7 nations] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond proportionally,"" he said.

But when asked whether he would back Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites as it has long threatened, Biden told reporters, ""The answer is no.""

Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak with Netanyahu soon.

""Obviously, Iran is way off course,"" he said.

Iran's missile attack escalated tensions in the region, where the Biden administration has for months led negotiations on a cease-fire in the nearly year-old Israel-Hamas war.

The recent assault on Israel follows the Biden administration souring on the prospects of an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""We aren't any closer to that now than we were even a week ago,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby previously told reporters. He called the prospects of a completed deal ""daunting.""

""No deal is imminent,"" one U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not sure it ever gets done.""

During Tuesday's vice presidential debate with Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Democrat nominee Vice President Harris' ""steady leadership"" in the region is necessary.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed,"" he said.

""And as the vice president said today, we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences,"" he said.

Vance voiced support for GOP nominee former President Trump's ""peace through strength"" policy toward Israel.

""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you need peace through strength,"" Vance said. ""They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

Vance said it is ""up to Israel"" how they choose to respond.

""Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question,"" he said during the debate. ""Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe,"" he said. ""And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.""

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) met on Wednesday following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel, but overshadowing the meeting was Israel's announcement that it had banned the U.N. secretary-general due to his failure to condemn Iran.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said about the decision to declare U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as persona non grata.

""This is an anti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists, rapists and murderers,"" Katz argued. ""Guterres will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come.""

Iran on Tuesday fired over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel after the death of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and after the Israel Defense Forces began focused incursions into Lebanon to hit the terrorist group.

ISRAEL URGES UN TO CONDEMN IRAN AFTER LATESTS ATTACKS

Guterres on Tuesday issued a brief statement following Iran's attack, calling it the ""latest attacks in the Middle East"" and broadly condemned the conflict as ""escalation after escalation.""

He also slammed Israel for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, claiming that Israel has ""conducted in Gaza the most deadly and destructive military campaign in my years.""

""The suffering endured by the Palestinian people in Gaza is beyond imagination,"" Guterres said. ""At the same time, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continues to deteriorate, with Israeli military operations.""

""Construction of settlements, evictions, land grabs and the intensification of settler attacks progressively undermine any possibility of a two-state solution, and simultaneously, armed Palestinian groups have also used violence,"" he said.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

Israel blasted Guterres for failing to ""unequivocally"" condemn Iran's attack or even name Iran while discussing the attack. Israel responded with the persona non grata declaration, effectively banning him from entering its borders.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,"" Katz said.

""This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7 and has not led any resolutions to declare them a terrorist organization,"" Katz continued.

""A secretary-general who provides support to the terrorists, rapists and murderers of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran, the mothership of global terror, will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come,"" he added. ""Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres.""

BBC NEWS SPURS OUTRAGE AFTER COMMENTATOR DEFENDS HEZBOLLAH, IRAN: 'OPENLY PRO-TERRORIST'

And while it took nearly a day following the attacks to condemn Iran, Guterres seemed to get the message, telling council members: ""As I did in relation to the Iranian attack in April - and as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed - I again strongly condemn yesterday's massive missile attack by Iran on Israel.""

Israel's decision to ban Guterres prompted anger from Algeria, which first expressed ""sincere gratitude... solidarity, admiration and support for the secretary-general.""

""This decision reflects a clear disdain of the U.N. system and the entire international community,"" the representative from Algeria said. ""For the Israeli authorities, no narrative nor truth exists except their own.""

However, some permanent members of the council expressed clear support for Israel and condemned Iran for the attack while urging Tehran to cease its support for terrorism through its proxy forces.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield ""unequivocally"" condemned Iran's attack and called for further sanctions against Tehran. She also explicitly tied Iran to the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, arguing that ""Iran was complicit... through its funding, training, capabilities and support for the military wing of Hamas.""

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS REGULAR INFANTRY, ARMORED UNITS JOINING LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

""After Hamas's horrific attack carried out nearly a year ago today, the United States sent a clear message to Iran: Don't exploit the situation in ways that would risk propelling the region into a broader war,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

""The IRGC flagrantly and repeatedly ignored this warning by encouraging and enabling the Houthis in Yemen to disrupt global shipping and launch attacks against Israel by supporting militant groups in Syria and Iraq,"" she continued.

""Iran's stated intention was to avenge the deaths of two IRGC-supported terrorist leaders and an IRGC commander by inflicting significant damage and death in Israel,"" she added. ""Thankfully, and through close coordination between the United States and Israel, Iran failed to achieve its objectives.""

""This outcome does not diminish the fact that this attack, intended to cause significant death and destruction, marked a significant escalation by Iran,"" she stressed.

The United Kingdom also condemned Iran's attack and expressed ""full support"" for Israel ""in exercising its right to defend itself against Iranian aggression.""

France urged Iran to ""abstain from any action that could lead to additional destabilization,"" going further to condemn the ""attack that targeted civilians in Jaffa.""

""Civilian populations are the first victims of this horrible situation,"" the French representative said. ""The situation is serious.""

Iran ultimately pleaded its case before the council, arguing that the Security Council has ""remained paralyzed due to the United States obstruction"" and accused permanent members France and the United Kingdom of acing as ""serious enablers"" of Israel who ""attempt to justify Israeli heinous crimes under the guise of self-defense, shifting the blame onto Iran."""
How Iran's missile strike on Israel appears to have hit some targets,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5135646/iran-missile-strike-israel-appears-to-hit-some-targets,2024-10-02T16:37:05Z,"Projectiles above Jerusalem, on October 1, 2024. Israel says Iran launched more than 180 missiles but that the assault did little damage. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption

Iran's strike on Israel appears to have been more effective at reaching its targets than an attack in April of this year.

Videos posted to social media and geolocated by NPR and the online investigations group Bellingcat show multiple warheads landing around two Israeli air bases: Nevatim Airbase in the south of the country and Tel Nof Airbase in central Israel. One video filmed near Tel Nof also appeared to show possible secondary explosions, indicating that ammunition or fuel may have been struck by a missile.

Videos also showed warheads landing in northern Tel Aviv, near the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. Those warheads appear to have missed their target, and did not inflict any real damage. One video showed a large crater around 500 yards from the spy agency's headquarters.

Experts say the attack was somewhat more successful than the one in April of this year, which was almost completely neutralized by Israeli and American air defenses.

""It looks like more missiles seem to be hitting targets in Israel this time around,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. That could be in part because ""the Iranians seem to be using newer, more sophisticated missiles.""

US Calls Strikes ""Ineffective""

Both the U.S. and Israel downplayed the strikes. ""This attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a briefing Tuesday. The U.S. said it had fired about a dozen interceptors from warships in an effort to blunt the Iranian assault.

According to reports in the Israeli media, the military acknowledged that the strike had damaged ""several"" airbases. However it said that no aircraft had been destroyed. Israeli media reported that the attacks had mainly damaged maintenance areas and office buildings.

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on casualties or damage resulting from the strike. The Israeli military spokesperson, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said in a briefing on the social media platform X that, ""We don't want to tip off Iran... Our air force and air force bases remain operational.""

Although the strike may have been limited in the damage it caused, it was a clear challenge to Israel's much-vaunted air defense systems. Israel's main system, called Iron Dome, has proven incredibly effective rockets from nearby adversaries like the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Iron Dome uses relatively cheap interceptor missiles together with state-of-the-art radars and high-speed computing to quickly determine which incoming missiles pose a threat. It only takes shots at the ones it determines are falling in populated areas.

Better missiles and more of them

But ballistic missiles from Iran travel much higher and faster than those fired from nearby Lebanon and Gaza. The missiles fly briefly into space before coming down on their targets near or at hypersonic speeds. Israel has a separate missile defense system known as Arrow, which is capable of intercepting missiles near or in space, but Arrow has fewer interceptors than Iron Dome.

When Iran attacked Israel in April, it used around 100 ballistic missiles in conjunction with roughly 200 low flying drones and cruise missiles, according to Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, Israel. The drones and cruise missiles were shot down easily by fighter jets, leaving the missiles for Arrow, he says.

This time, Iran launched around 180 ballistic missiles, putting more strain on the Arrow system. ""The job for the Arrow was much easier [in April],"" he says.

Moreover, images of the missiles being fired out of Iran, together with pictures of debris that fell in Israel, suggests more sophisticated ballistic missiles were used, Lewis says.

In the April attack, Lewis says Iran used primarily liquid-fueled missiles that were relatively inaccurate. Half of the missiles fell more than a half mile from their targets. ""It's pretty hard to destroy something with that level of accuracy,"" he says.

In this latest attack, Iran used new solid-propellant missiles that are more accurate, he says. Lewis and other researchers say at least some of the missiles used appear to be Iran's newest design, the Fattah, a medium-range ballistic missile that may have a degree of maneuverability as it enters the atmosphere, allowing it to alter course and avoid interceptor missiles.

Lewis says he believes Iran's latest strike was designed to show some restraint. The warheads fell primarily on air bases which may have been used in last week's attacks on Hezbollah's leadership, he points out. ""It's very typical to see Iranians pick military targets that are linked to the military strike that they're responding to,"" he says.

The strike also appeared to largely avoid civilian areas. The only publicly acknowledged death from the attack so far was a Palestinian man in the West Bank who was apparently struck by a falling missile body. A school in central Israel was also hit, though no casualties were reported.

Despite the attempt to control escalation, Israel is likely to respond with force, says Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Following the April attack, Israel knocked out an air defense radar near Iran's nuclear facilities in Natanz, he points out. That limited attack was designed to send a message: ""The Israelis can penetrate Iranian airspace, they've demonstrated that time and time again,"" he says. ""They can bring the hurt to Iran.""

Israel's military spokesperson Peter Lerner suggested that it would only be a matter of time before the nation struck back directly against Iran. ""One ballistic missile is an unacceptable reality for any sovereign state,"" he told reporters. ""One hundred and eighty means there will be consequences."""

""It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring,"" used to just be a nursery rhyme. Today it is the frightening reality of our lack of leadership in the White House, as President Joe Biden old-man shuffles his way to the end of his misbegotten and only term as president.

On Wednesday, October 2, Biden is finally set to visit the site of devastation in North Carolina wrought by Hurricane Helene, even if he has to skip a nap or two. This comes amid real concerns that the federal response is lackluster and insufficient.

Then there is the ongoing war in the Middle East, which on Tuesday, October 1, saw Iran launch the largest ballistic missile attack in human history against Israel. This, despite the fact that, on several occasions when Biden seemed half cogent, he warned the mullahs by sternly saying, ""Don't""

BIDEN HAS 'PRIVATELY COMPLAINED' ABOUT HOW QUICKLY DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED ON FROM HIM: REPORT

Well, they did anyway. And while, thankfully, owing to the military might of Israel and America, the Iranian onslaught carried all the devastation of a Nerf gun fight, it was still a slap in the face of our feckless president.

As if those two disasters weren't enough, this same week has also seen the International Longshoremen's Association go on strike from Maine to Texas, shutting down the supply line for everything from batteries to bananas, despite Biden's claim that a deal would be worked out.

Of all these crises, these latter may be the most devastating to Scranton Joe because it is something that, in his prime, Biden would have been able to clean up faster than a Swiffer.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

This is why president by committee doesn't work. Longshoremen might have trusted Biden; they do not trust the faceless deep state blob that rules us today.

Americans know they currently have no functioning president, and have for some time. In August, Sam, a restaurateur in San Francisco told me, ""I don't know who's running the country, but it's not him."" In Virginia, Sarah, a Democrat, simply said, ""It's sad, but he's just gone.""

To be blunt, this situation is incredibly dangerous. We heard almost nothing from our president as Iran attempted to start World War III. Instead, we saw National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the White House podium, the very man whose incompetence helped light the match of this conflagration.

You remember Sullivan, he was the guy who said days before the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that the Middle East was quieter than it had been in two decades.

Amazingly, Sullivan, who shouldn't even be managing a Dairy Queen, much less American foreign policy, still has his job. And why? Because he doesn't have a boss. Nobody in the administration does. I'm not convinced Biden can recognize Jake Sullivan, much less fire him.

It really is a fine mess the Democrats have gotten us into. The president is incapable of fulfilling his duties, and his vice president is now running for president. And by running, I mean as far away from Grandpa Joe as she can get.

In a sane world, our senile commander in chief would step down, and Vice President Kamala Harris would take the reins. But that can't happen because, if it did, she would suddenly be responsible for the haywire state of world and domestic affairs and might actually have to do a serious interview or two.

For all intents and purposes, the United States of America has no president. But what we do have is a host of crisis-level situations at home and abroad that are not being competently addressed.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

For four more months, until either former President Donald Trump or Kamala Harris is sworn in as president next year, our ship of state has no captain. And rudderless, it is at significant risk of capsizing.

Joe Biden has gone to bed, he's wrong in the head, and he doesn't start work until 10 in the morning. Our allies know it. Far worse, our foes know it, and as usual, it is the American people who are suffering.

In a normal world, Joe Biden would have stepped down by now, and he'd be free to lay on the beach in Delaware all day, which he does anyway. But these are not normal times, so until January 20, the best we can do is cross our fingers and hope for the best."
Will Netanyahu 'take the fight directly to Iran' after massive missile strike across Israel?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-weighs-israeli-response-irans-massive-missile-attack-amid-fears-all-out-war,2024-10-02T15:11:46Z,"JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Fox News Digital spoke to military and Iran experts about the growing chance of a wider confrontation between the Jewish state and the clerical regime in Tehran breaking out.

""After the Iranian missile attack against Israel there is no questioning anymore the basic understanding that Iran is the greatest generator of terror and death in the Middle East. Until now, Israel has been playing a whack-a-mole game with Iran's proxies - fighting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others,"" Yaakov Katz, the author of ""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission to Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power,"" told Fox News Digital.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

Katz, who is a senior fellow at the global think tank Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), added, ""With Iran again attacking Israel directly, the time has come to take the fight directly to Iran. The ayatollahs there need to be made to pay a price.""

The headline by military analyst Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper read on Wednesday: ""After an unprecedented Iranian attack, we are in a regional war.""

The Islamic republic has been recognized as the center of Mideast volatility, terrorism and jingoism for decades. In 2010, Saudi Arabian King Abdullah told the United States to ""cut off the head of the snake"" by launching military strikes to eradicate Iran's reported nuclear weapons facilities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday. The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks. The Israelis did not panic and stayed relatively calm under the pressure of the largely surprise attack.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

""Tonight Iran attempted to kill thousands of Israeli men, women and children but thanks to our miraculous defense system Iran failed miserably. Tehran is hurting after seeing its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen get crushed by Israel. Tehran made a huge mistake tonight and will pay a heavy price at the time and place of our choosing,"" Lt. Col. Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and an IDF special forces operator in reserves, told Fox News Digital.

IRAN'S 'NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN' IS 'FULLY SAFE' AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA

Chetboun was a decorated special forces operator from the second Lebanon war, when Israel fought the Iran-backed terrorist movement Hezbollah in 2006.

Prior to Iran's military strike on Israel in April, Fox News Digital reported that the Biden-Harris administration released billions in sanctions relief to Iran that will flow into its proxies' war machines, according to experts.

The topic of funneling billions to Iran's regime surfaced during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Republican Sen. JD Vance said, ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration.

""What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies. And God forbid, launching against the United States as well.""

BIDEN ADMIN UNDER PRESSURE TO STOP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SANCTIONS RELIEF TO IRAN

Lisa Daftari, an expert on Iran, said, ""The conflict between the Iran regime and Israel did not commence today, in April, or on Oct. 7 of the previous year. Its origins trace back to 1979, when the mullahs ascended to power, promulgating a doctrine that demonized the 'Great Satan,' a term for the United States, and the 'Little Satan,' referring to Israel.

""Over the past 45 years, the Iran regime has persistently targeted American and Israeli interests, orchestrating terror proxies to execute its strategic objectives against both nations. More recently, U.S. policies that have enriched the mullahs have facilitated billions of dollars on establishing a formidable encirclement around Israel, via the regime's various proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank.""

In April, Iran's regime launched a sprawling aerial attack, with over 300 suicide drones and missiles, on Israel. Jerusalem countered the Iranian swarm of missiles with a targeted strike against military installations in the Iranian province of Isfahan.

Daftari, editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk news website, added, ""Israel's recent military actions signal a departure from the more restrained posture observed in April, when the nation's defense capabilities against missile threats were deemed a victory. The recent strategic strikes in Lebanon underscore Israel's heightened efforts to neutralize enduring existential threats.""

She noted that it historically has engaged in tit-for-tat-like responses but noted, ""Israel is now poised to take decisive measures aimed at neutralizing this looming risk, with its focus now entirely on the regime in Tehran.""

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a war between Israel and Iran which began as a direct war on April 14. The war is a twilight struggle between a nation run by a tyranny that seeks to extinguish the other. Either Iran or Israel, but not both, will emerge from this war not only as victor but survivor.""

He said the so-called ""ring of fire that Iran built around Israel not only had an aggressive aim - to choke Israel to death by initiating a violent war of attrition and isolation, including closing ports and ending international airlines' flying to Israel - but also acted as a defensive deterrent against Israel, shielding Iran from any potential Israeli proactive action against Iran. With the destruction of Hezbollah, the strategic linchpin of the proxy network at the center of that ring of fire, as the greatest threat Israel faces, Iran was left fully exposed to the full weight of Israeli power.""

He echoed the strong language of Israel's military and political leadership, which ""promised to inflict severe pain on the regime of the Iran's supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ali Khamenei... Iran will surely now feel the vulnerability as the Israelis without fear any more of Hezbollah or Iran will take the war from the defensive to the offensive against Iran's regime, "" said Wurmser.

He added ""The mistake Iran made, as do its proxies and its minions in the West protesting on campuses, is not that they underestimate Israel's capabilities and its unity, but that they internalized their own ideology that Israel is a fake, fragile colonial entity rather than a deeply rooted civilization. Israel has shown that despite its mistakes and setbacks, its internal strength transcend that of any of their neighbors."""
Israel Considers Cancelling Lebanon Gas Deal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/10/02/israel-considers-cancelling-lebanon-gas-deal/,2024-10-02T14:11:27Z,"With the whole world watching events in Lebanon to see if Israel next launches a threatened ground invasion into that country, following its recent ""culling"" of the entire Hezbollah high command, another area that bears watching concerns what will now happen to the Israel/Lebanon natural gas deal reached in 2022 that, for a time, held a glimmer of hope for eventual peace in the Middle East, or at least between these two countries.

For those who may not recall that deal had demarcated the maritime border in the Mediterranean Sea between the two countries and gave Israel full rights to the ""Karish"" gas field and Lebanon most rights to the ""Qana"" field, with some revenue from the latter to go to the Israelis.

Recently, Israeli government officials have been broaching the idea of ""finding a loophole"" to invalidate the gas agreement. Even more recently, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen openly called the deal a ""mistake"" and urged it to be rescinded.

From the time it was signed, many in Israel thought the gas deal was merely a giveaway - that Israel had basically just accepted Hezbollah's position on where to demarcate the maritime border - and that Israel had gotten very little from it, especially considering that the deal, by itself, did nothing to resolve the decades of hostility between the two countries. Since October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing over 9000 rockets into Israel, ostensibly in support of Hamas in Gaza, calls in Israel's energy sector have been growing to declare the agreement invalid. Since Israel started aggressively hitting Hezbollah two weeks ago with the now infamous ""pager attack,"" those calls have now reached ministerial level.

Israel's critics claim that cancelling the deal would fit a decades long pattern of ""Israeli expansionism,"" and that Israel really wants to take all the disputed gas fields for itself. However, given the mood in Israel following the October 7, 2023, massacre, and the Hezbollah rockets, that criticism likely will fall on deaf ears. As TotalEnergies, the French energy consortium, is one of the developers of the Lebanese gas field, Israel might be prepared to scuttle that development as retaliation for what it perceives as untimely actions and certain comments on the situation by French President Emanuel Macron that are perceived, at least to some in Israel, to be pro Lebanese in nature.

Of course, such a move by Israel would come with substantial risks, both domestically and internationally. For one thing, it could make the Jewish State seem less reliable in its agreements and international business affairs generally. That could be economically devastating for a small country with a very limited domestic market. It also could make it more difficult for Israel to develop and find markets for its own natural gas in the future, with further unknown consequences.

In any event, the natural gas story is worth watching for any student of the Middle East or those whose lives are wrapped up in it. As events may continue to deteriorate, natural gas exploration on the Israeli/Lebanese maritime frontier, having once so promising a future for those who earnestly want to see the fighting and hostility replaced by a lasting peace, looks like it may become another casualty of the seemingly endless regional instability. One can only hope that, in the future, after a time when cooler heads and economic realities may eventually prevail, it will be among the first symbols of regional restoration as well."
"Israeli mom killed in Jaffa terror attack while shielding 9-month-old son, Israel says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-mom-killed-jaffa-terror-attack-while-shielding-9-month-old-son-israel-says,2024-10-02T14:06:10Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the alleged terror attack near Tel Aviv as fears of a direct Iranian attack continue to mount.

A mother who was ""murdered while shielding her 9-month-old son"" has been identified by Israel as one of the victims of yesterday's terrorist attack at a train station outside of Tel Aviv.

Israel says the actions of Inbar Segev-Vigder in Jaffa on Tuesday ""saved"" the life of her child Ari.

""There are no words. Only heartbreak,"" Israel posted on X. ""May the memory of the victims be a blessing.""

Israeli police said Wednesday that a total of seven people were killed in a shooting that unfolded just minutes before Iran started launching ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the recent killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS REGULAR INFANTRY, ARMORED UNITS JOINING LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

Two Palestinian men from the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron opened fire, including shooting directly into a light rail carriage crowded with passengers that was stopped at a station.

The suspects -- who police say had no prior arrests, although one had been involved in disturbing the peace at a demonstration -- were later shot and killed by security guards and armed pedestrians, according to The Associated Press. Police and paramedics who responded to the scene treated another 16 people injured from the shooting.

Segev-Vigder lived in Tel Aviv and operated a fitness and Pilates studio, while her husband, Yaari Vigder, is an Israeli reservist soldier, The Jerusalem Post reports.

""Ari was in a carrier that covered Inbar's entire upper body during the attack, he was not injured at all,"" the website cited Yaari Vigder as telling Israel's Channel 11 news.

""For the rest of his life -- may he feel the same love he received from Inbar,"" he reportedly added.

A witness told Ynetnews that the 33-year-old mother was gunned down while stepping off a train in Jaffa, according to The Jerusalem Post.

The website identified four other victims as Revital Bronstein, 24, Shahar Goldman, 30, Nadia Sokolenko, 40, and Ilya Nozadze, 42.

Sokolenko's family told Israel's TPS news agency that they were waiting for her to return home from grocery shopping Tuesday night and her friends started checking area hospitals after her phone stopped answering calls.

Sokolenko, a native of Moldova who worked as an office manager, was described by friends as ""a very creative person and very caring mom"" of a 6-year-old daughter, TPS added.

Greece's foreign ministry also said Wednesday that a Greek national who lived in Jerusalem was among the dead.

Israel Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X in the wake of the attack that ""I will now demand in the cabinet discussion that the family members of the abominable terrorists from Hebron who carried out the heinous attack in Jaffa be deported to Gaza tonight and their homes should be turned into ruins for them to see and see."""
Israel sends more troops to Lebanon as it vows a 'painful' response to Iran's missiles,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136592/israel-lebanon-iran-missile-attack-hezbollah,2024-10-02T14:00:21Z,"Smoke rises from the site of an Israeli airstrike in Dahiyeh, Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday. Hassan Ammar/AP hide caption

Israel says it is sending more troops into southern Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, as Israel also promised a ""painful"" response after Iran fired nearly 200 missiles at Israel Tuesday night.

The Israeli military said it is deploying more soldiers and an armored tank brigade to assist in what it called a ""limited, localized"" ground offensive against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

On social media, the Israeli military's Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, warned residents of an additional 24 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. ""For your safety, you must leave your homes immediately,"" he said, adding that any civilian near Hezbollah fighters, facilities or weapons risks their lives.

Residents were advised to evacuate north of the Awali River, about 30 miles from the Lebanese border with Israel.

Also on Wednesday, sirens went off across Israel's north after the Israeli military said around 100 rockets were fired from Lebanon. The military issues alerts to communities around the port city of Haifa and Western Galilee, both near the Israel-Lebanon border.

The Israeli military announced a soldier killed in combat in Lebanon, according to The Associated Press, which said Hezbollah claimed to have killed and wounded an unspecified number of Israeli troops.

Iran fired about 180 ballistic missiles toward Israel late Tuesday. The Israeli military said most were intercepted, but there were several hits.

The Pentagon said two U.S. destroyers also fired a dozen interceptors at the Iranian missiles headed to Israel.

The only confirmed death from the Iranian attack was in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a 38-year-old Palestinian man was killed after a missile fell on the city of Jericho, according to Palestinian civil defense.

Video footage shared on social media showed a large crater where a missile had landed near Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters.

Officials in Jordan said two people were lightly injured from falling shrapnel.

Now, the region is bracing for Israel's response and the risk of a wider war.

""This evening, Iran made a big mistake -- and it will pay for it,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said hours after the attack.

Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari called Iran's attack ""a severe and dangerous escalation,"" and promised, ""We will respond wherever, whenever and however we choose.""

And on Wednesday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said Israel's response will be ""decisive and painful.""

Iran's Revolutionary Guard said late Tuesday that the missile attack was in response to several recent killings, including the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah late Friday in Beirut; the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July in a strike widely assumed to be carried out by Israel; and an Iranian commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations said the attack was a ""legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime."""
"Amid soaring threats from Iran, Russia against US homeland, Biden-Harris must focus on protecting us all",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/amid-soaring-threats-from-iran-russia-against-us-homeland-biden-harris-must-focus-protecting-us-all,2024-10-02T11:15:19Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In his remarks during last week's United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, claimed that Iran wants to ""live in peace."" He demanded ""a world free of nuclear weapons,"" and declared that Iran ""is ready to disarm,"" if Israel does the same.

But just two weeks prior, Iran and its fellow dictatorship Russia were slapped with new economic sanctions by the Biden-Harris administration for Tehran's delivery of ballistic missiles to Moscow. In fact, the national security community is increasingly concerned about the growing relations between two of America's top adversaries. However, as Team Biden-Harris is hyper-focused on the threat this unholy alliance poses elsewhere in the world - Ukraine, the Middle East - what about us? Is anyone in charge of protecting our homeland?

As a former U.S. intelligence analyst who led Red Teams during war games, my team's job was to come up with, thinking like our adversaries, out-of-the-ordinary ideas - no matter how implausible - that Red Force (Russia, Iran, etc.) could use against Blue Force (U.S. and Allied militaries). The goal was to enable the president, the Pentagon and other decision makers to develop plans for countering our adversaries and protecting the homeland. Here are a few insights, from the intelligence perspective, that make the Iran-Russia threat even bigger than most Americans realize.

First, neither Russian nor Iranian leaders respect the Biden-Harris administration, making them more likely to act more aggressively against the United States. As a clear sign of indifference to Washington's ire, two days after the new sanctions went into effect, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with Ali Ahmadian, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran. In it, he praised the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, for fostering ""additional momentum"" in Russian-Iranian relations and thanked Pezeshkian's team for making the relationship a ""priority."" Five days later, Putin dispatched his top security official, Sergei Shoigu, to Tehran, where Shoigu held secret talks with Pezeshkian.

WHY RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA IS OBSESSING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION AND PRAISING WALZ

Neither Russia nor Iran is afraid of economic sanctions. They've used loopholes in the sanctions regime to circumvent them and found alternative ways to finance their policy priorities and military programs. Despite the fact that the U.S., European Union (EU) and its Western allies banned nearly all Russian imports at the start of the war in Ukraine, Western nations purchased $2 billion worth of Russian oil indirectly through Turkey.

In 2023, the Biden-Harris administration released $6 billion in unfrozen assets to Iran as part of the deal to release five American hostages in exchange for five Iranians held in U.S. prisons. It is almost a certainty that some of those funds were diverted by Iran toward its military programs and to train and equip its proxy terrorist groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.

Sanctions, therefore, are an optics instrument that politicians use to virtue signal that they are doing something in response to hostile foreign activities. They have not and will not change the behavior of our adversaries.

Second, both Putin and the ayatollahs understand that as Team Biden-Harris is focused on European and Ukrainian security, security inside the homeland isn't taken seriously, presenting a vulnerability to be exploited. Explaining the decision for the new sanctions package, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern that Moscow will ""likely use... Iranian ballistic missiles... against Ukraine."" Blinken characterized the weapons trade between Moscow and Tehran as a ""threat to European security.""

The Biden-Harris administration has approved billions of dollars for Ukraine to aid its defense against Russia, even as our own Secret Service is in crisis due to staffing shortages, high levels of turnover, inadequate training and incompetence of some of its personnel.

RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA RATCHETING UP THREATS AGAINST US. WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW

Two failed assassination attempts on former President Trump, during which would-be assassins were able to penetrate the security perimeter of the protectee, clearly demonstrate that the level of protection the Secret Service delivers is low. If security for a former president, with all the law enforcement personnel surrounding him 24/7, can be breached by an amateur, an operative trained and resourced by a state-actor like Iran or Russia, can do so much more damage. It also means that other targets - government buildings, military installations, critical infrastructure - are likely to be equally vulnerable. Saying nothing of soft targets, such as shopping malls and other public spaces.

Third, Russia and Iran have the capabilities and political will to conduct hostile clandestine operations inside the U.S. The recent arrest in New York of a Iranian-linked Pakistani man who plotted to kill American leaders, highly likely including Trump, is just one example of Iran's ongoing policy of infiltrating operatives inside the U.S. for nefarious purposes.

Moreover, according to a 2024 report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran has been developing ""surrogate networks inside the United States"" for ""more than a decade."" This assessment is consistent with a warning contained in another report about Iran's plans to attack strategic security assets and institutions in the U.S. The report, titled ""The Unseen Threat of the Mapping Project,"" claims that Iranian elements have identified 298 American strategic security assets and institutions, as well as personnel, for attacks, kidnappings and assassinations.

Couple this with the fact that Russia, for decades, has been running an ""illegals"" program aimed at maintaining networks of deep-cover sleeper agents inside the United States. In 2010, the FBI had to pull the plug on a 10-year counter-intelligence operation aimed at rooting out such a spy network inside the United States because one of the female spies was moving uncomfortably close in access to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her husband Bill Clinton, and members of their inner circle. The Russians almost certainly keep this program alive, now that the Biden-Harris open border policy has made it so much easier to infiltrate foreign operatives.

The Iranian regime has been funding anti-Israel protests on university campuses across the country. These ostensibly ""grassroots activist"" groups, which sometimes don't know who is behind them, present a vast pool of resources that could be weaponized, with the help of foreign clandestine operatives. What Putin and the ayatollahs want is to foment social unrest inside the United States, consistent with the Russian doctrine of ""controlled instability.""

Fourth, should Russia and Iran join forces in strategic capabilities, the threat to homeland security could be catastrophic. The U.S. government investigation in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks concluded that the government's principal error was a failure to ""connect the dots."" In other words, the pieces of the puzzle were to be found in many corners of the U.S. government. Yet no one connected the dots, making it impossible to predict and preempt the attacks.

We are now living in a similar period. Our security apparatus is stretched thin, with analysts being pulled in many different directions - Ukraine, the Middle East, China. The same failure of imagination that plagued our intelligence in 2001 could prevent us from visualizing an impending threat coming from Iran-Russia cooperation. Below, I will connect the dots.

Putin spokesperson Dmitriy Peskov acknowledged that the two countries are cooperating, including on ""the most sensitive"" areas,"" which he didn't specify. As someone who spent my intelligence career tracking threats to our homeland, here they are - cyber attacks, space warfare and WMD. We are vulnerable in these areas due to our reliance on technology in military operations and civilian life.

Russia has the world's most extensive nuclear know how, some of which it is likely sharing with Iran, which is already extremely close to operationalizing its atomic weapons. Russia is also sharing space launch technology with Iran, helping Tehran place its satellites into orbit. A multi-mission satellite network is a pre-requisite for missile warning, targeting, and command and control, including the employment of nuclear weapons.

Russia has developed a comprehensive suite of counter-space weapons to target U.S. satellites during wartime and electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt the functioning of U.S. satellites in peacetime. Moscow has already used some of these capabilities during its war on Ukraine. It probably will share some of these technologies with Iran, which already has demonstrated jamming capabilities.

U.S. airlines, which rely on GPS for flight navigation, are already concerned about becoming targets of GPS spoofing. Spoofing attacks have surged over the past six months, with most of them originating from electronic-warfare transmitters in Russia, Ukraine and Israel.

Russia already poses a chemical and biological weapons (CBW) threat and retains an undeclared chemical weapons program, having used them at least twice in recent years, according to a 2024 intelligence report. Iran continues ""research and development of chemical and biological agents for offensive purposes."" ""Iranian military scientists have researched chemicals, toxins, and bioregulators, all of which have a wide range of sedation, dissociation, and amnestic incapacitating effects.""

Military ties between Moscow and Tehran are indeed the closest they've ever been, having strengthened dramatically on Biden-Harris' watch. As we are nearing the presidential election and Team Biden-Harris continues to prioritize someone else's security, Americans must decide which future president is more likely to place America's security first."
Jews prepare to observe Rosh Hashanah as group steps up to secure community amid huge rise in antisemitism,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jews-prepare-observe-rosh-hashanah-group-steps-up-secure-community-amid-huge-rise-antisemitism,2024-10-02T11:08:29Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As the Jewish community approaches the High Holiday season, many are concerned about rising antisemitism in the U.S. stemming from Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel, which resulted in the murder of about 1,200 Israelis and hundreds of innocents taken hostage to the Gaza Strip.

This year's celebrations of Rosh Hashanah, Oct. 2-4, and Yom Kippur, Oct. 11-12, fall on either side of the one-year anniversary of the attack as Israel fights a multifront war that continues to stoke tensions at home.

The FBI hate crime statistics for 2023, released last week, demonstrate a considerable uptick in antisemitic hate crimes since Oct. 7. The FBI Crime Data Explorer shows a total of 1,951 anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2023, a 55% increase from 1,257 incidents reported in 2022. Of these, 980 incidents occurred between January and September. In the final three months of the year, 971 incidents were reported, an increase of more than 300% over the 318 incidents tallied during the same period in 2022.

GOV WHITMER CONDEMNS 'SQUAD' MEMBER'S 'ANTISEMITIC' ATTACK AGAINST MICHIGAN'S JEWISH AG: 'HATEFUL RHETORIC'

Amid this startling rise in hate, Community Security Service (CSS) CEO Richard Priem told Fox News Digital that he wants Jewish Americans to ""be reassured that there's a lot of competent organizations and individuals, both in government and within the community, proactively working to make sure that these High Holidays will be safe and enjoyable.""

The explosion of intolerance has spawned growth within CSS. It took Priem's nonprofit about a decade to train volunteers to support just under 300 Jewish institutions. Now, CSS partners with 470 institutions, an increase of ""30% over the course of 10 months,"" Priem said.

Some of CSS's new growth is on college campuses, where anti-Israel protests and encampments created hostile environments for Jewish students throughout the previous academic year and continue to cause chaos this year.

Priem said the CSS campus program, now present on a dozen campuses, is ""providing self-defense, awareness and de-escalation training for Jewish students"" as part of the larger CSS mission ""to make sure that Jewish life can continue unimpeded.""

The CSS model focuses on ""empowering Jewish community members to become experts"" in securing their institutions. Now, more than 5,000 volunteers stand ready to protect their facilities, which is up from the less than 3,000 last year. With this effort to respond to community needs, ""[W]e are stretching the resources that we have to the maximum,"" Priem said.

But the work has paid off. Priem noted that his team ""reports hundreds of incidents every year, many of which are being investigated by law enforcement, some of which actually lead to arrests and federal charges."" While most of those incidents went uncovered by the media, ABC 7 Washington, D.C., reported on Dec. 17 that CSS volunteers stopped an attack on Jewish worshipers outside the Kesher Israel Synagogue in Georgetown.

NEW YORK ANTI-ISRAEL RALLY AT UN FEATURES SIGN SUPPORTING TERROR GROUP HEZBOLLAH

CSS volunteers were outside the synagogue when a stranger stepped out of a U-Haul parked near the synagogue entrance, shouted ""Gas the Jews"" and sprayed worshipers with a substance that was later revealed to be merely fart spray. CSS volunteers documented the incident and engaged law enforcement, which arrested perpetrator Brent Wood. In August, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., secured an indictment charging Wood, now a fugitive from the law, with ""three counts of obstructing by force or threat of force a person's enjoyment of their free exercise of religious beliefs, while using a dangerous weapon.""

The primary force behind the escalating threat to the Jewish community since Oct. 7 is the spillover of hate from continued conflict in the Middle East.

""Because of what's going on between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, there might be people coming to target that synagogue because of something politically they disagree with around a foreign country, but they feel justified in targeting a Jewish institution to express their hatred,"" Priem said.

Priem said CSS volunteers have not taken their eye off other threats, like the homegrown extremism of white supremacists like Robert Bowers, who perpetrated an attack that killed 11 congregants at Pittsburg's Tree of Life Synagogue in October 2018. The radical Islamic threat posed by groups like ISIS and al Qaeda also remains a serious concern. On Sept. 4, a Pakistani man pledging support to ISIS was arrested in Canada as he traveled to the U.S. to carry out planned attacks on a New York Jewish center on either Oct. 7 or Oct. 11.

While these threats are diverse and serious, Priem said CSS volunteers are prepared ""to work with law enforcement and make sure that [members of the Jewish community] can still enter and arrive to synagogue safely"" during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur."
The seeds of today's Middle East strife were planted in Beirut,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/seeds-todays-middle-east-strife-were-planted-beirut,2024-10-02T10:16:36Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As Israeli forces prepare for what officials characterize as a limited ground incursion into Lebanon, the world is bracing for the possibility that the conflict will expand into a larger regional war, a greater likelihood in the wake of Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The two sides have clashed for close to a year, dating back to Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The skirmishes have led to hundreds of deaths along the border and the displacement of thousands more.

The violence reflects the damage that Iranian-backed militant groups, like Hamas and Hezbollah, have done in the Middle East for four decades. The roots of their capacity to inflict harm lie in the October 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut, which was the largest non-nuclear blast the FBI ever investigated.

Though the attack, which killed 241 soldiers, sailors, and Marines, horrified President Ronald Reagan, he never retaliated against the then-fledgling Hezbollah.

ISRAEL UNBOUND

This decision to forego a military response, coupled with America's withdrawal from Lebanon, sent a message that terrorism worked. Small and relatively inexpensive acts of extraordinary violence could effectively defeat major militaries and superpowers. This emboldened these groups, as well as their Iranian sponsors. The results have been catastrophic for the region and the cause of peace.

By the early 1980s, Lebanon had been torn apart by years of civil war and sectarian violence that had resulted from a political tug-of-war between the nation's Christians, Sunnis and Shiites. Adding to the bloodshed was the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had moved into Beirut after being driven out of Jordan in 1971.

The PLO, upset over the loss of land during Israel's 1967 war against its Arab neighbors, fought a guerrilla campaign against Israel in an effort to obtain a homeland for the Palestinian people.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

In June 1982, Israel invaded, pummeling Beirut with artillery in an attempt to eradicate the PLO, which had been attacking it from Lebanese territory. The rain of Israeli fire devastated entire city blocks. ""Even in Lebanon,"" wrote columnist Jack Anderson, ""a land inured to catastrophe, the bombardment of West Beirut was a horror beyond endurance.""

Israel's bloody war in Lebanon alarmed many, including Reagan, who worked to broker a deal to end the violence, remove the PLO, and send in U.S. Marines as peacekeepers to stabilize the region.

But American troops were not the only foreign military force to arrive in Lebanon that year. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shiite religious leader who rose to power in Iran in 1979, saw an opportunity to capitalize on the chaos, to export and propagate his revolution.

UN ABDICATES ROLE OF MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKER BY BACKING TERRORISTS

With that goal in mind, Khomeini sent an army of 800 elite Revolutionary Guards into Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, a lawless region near Syria. The Iranian soldiers fanned out through the impoverished Shiite communities in southern Lebanon, attending mosque, giving speeches, and recruiting disenfranchised young men to fight against American and Israeli forces.

These efforts helped produce two homegrown Shiite terror organizations: Islamic Amal and the Islamic Jihad Organization. These two Iranian-backed groups would soon merge, however, and become known simply as Hezbollah or the Party of God, aided by Iranian money, training and weapons.

Hezbollah's first strike against the U.S. came on April 18, 1983, when a suicide car bomber crashed into the front of the American Embassy in Beirut. The blast collapsed the entire front of the building, killing 63 people including 17 Americans.

IRAN'S OPTIONS DWINDLE AS IT PREPARES RETALIATION FOR DEATH OF NASRALLAH

But that attack paled in comparison to the one that would follow 188 days later.

At dawn on a Sunday morning in October 1983, a bomber in a Mercedes truck crashed through security and penetrated the lobby of the four-story Battalion Landing Team headquarters in Beirut, where some 350 American soldiers, sailors and Marines were asleep.

The blast, which investigators later determined exceeded 12,000 pounds of TNT, collapsed the building into a pile of broken concrete and twisted rebar. ""It was,"" as one survivor later recounted, ""like every atom in the universe blew apart.""

The screams from buried victims prompted one of the greatest rescue efforts in modern memory, as troops attacked the rubble pile with shovels, Ka-Bar knives and their bare hands.

IRAN SUPPORTS KAMALA HARRIS, BUT AMERICANS WHO WANT A SAFER WORLD HAVE A BETTER CHOICE

For those Marines trapped underground, it was hell. Among them was Chaplain Danny Wheeler, who spent five hours buried in a concrete crypt before rescuers finally found him. ""The next thing I knew, I felt a hand on my hand,"" Wheeler recalled. ""I held it.""

Wheeler was the last survivor rescued, and one of the lucky few. All told, the bombing killed 220 Marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers, wounding another 112.

The attack shocked Reagan, who initially resisted pressure from many in Congress and the public to pull American forces out of Lebanon. In a nationally televised speech on Oct. 27, the president instead recommitted America to stabilizing the area.

""Brave young men have been taken away from us. Many others have been grievously wounded. Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted?"" Reagan said. ""We're a nation with global responsibilities.""

WHY BIDEN'S SPEECH AT UNGA SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS ACROSS THE GLOBE

But that resolve faded in early 1984, when the Lebanese national government and military ultimately collapsed. On Feb. 7, Reagan announced that he planned to send American troops back to their ships.

In an effort to avoid drawing attention to America's sudden reversal and withdrawal, he skipped the televised speech, instead releasing a written statement to reporters. On March 30, Reagan notified Congress that he planned to officially terminate America's peacekeeping mission.

This withdrawal created a vacuum that Hezbollah capitalized on to gain power and influence, eventually becoming the dominant political party in Lebanon.

WHAT IF ISRAELIS COULD VOTE IN US ELECTIONS?

Additionally, America's abrupt departure coincided with the administration's refusal to retaliate for the bombing of the U.S. Embassy or the Marine headquarters. In the wake of the October bombing, members of the National Security Council drew up a plan to target Iran's terror camp in the Bekaa Valley.

Reagan initially supported it, but Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger convinced the president to backtrack, arguing that retaliatory action demanded the type of conclusive proof of the identity of the attackers that is often elusive in terror attacks. ""I'm not,"" Weinberger later said, ""an eye for an eye man.""

Whatever the merits of Weinberger's thinking, the results of Reagan's decision were calamitous. For the small cost of a truck, some explosives and the single life of a terrorist, Iran successfully drove the U.S. from Lebanon and suffered no consequences.

That was the critical lesson our enemies learned from this tragedy, a fact the CIA zeroed in on in a 1987 report. ""Many Iranian leaders use this precedent as proof that terrorism can break U.S. resolve.""

The agency also concluded that Iranian leaders exploited the uncertainty that had troubled Weinberger. ""Compared with overt military attacks, terrorism and sabotage also offer a degree of plausible deniability and present the United States with a less clear-cut justification for retaliation.""

America's failure to respond to the killing and wounding of hundreds of our diplomats and service members in Beirut served as a green light for Iran to continue and even escalate its proxy war of terrorism that menaces the region.

And it is a price America, Israel and our allies continue to pay four decades later.

Col. Timothy Geraghty, who was the commander of the Marines in Lebanon in October 1983 and later worked for the CIA, understands that better than anyone. ""Our timidity,"" he concluded, ""whetted the jihadists' appetite.""

Gen. Joseph Votel, former CENTCOM commanding general, discusses Iran's latest attack and Israel's potential response on 'Your World.'

BBC News was accused of being a ""pro-terrorist"" news organization after a guest on the British network defended Iran following its attack on Israel on Tuesday.

Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel, according to U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The strikes were ""ineffective"" but a ""significant escalation"" in the ongoing regional conflict. Iran says the attacks were in response to the deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. The move comes after weeks of Israeli strikes against Tehran's proxies in the region.

Middle East expert Dr. Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at King's College in London, cautioned Israel about escalating violence in its response to the attack during an interview on BBC World News.

He spurred outrage on social media after suggesting that Israel had been the aggressor and Hezbollah and Iran had been ""fairly rational"" in the ongoing conflict.

IRAN ATTACK ON ISRAEL 'INEFFECTIVE' BUT A 'SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION': WHITE HOUSE

""Something's gotta give. I mean, Israel has to send a response, but -- this is not for Israel to decide. I think the international community has to make sure that whatever Israel does is not upending the regional order, as we know it. And the U.S. has a responsibility. So we've been in this cause for 12 months now of, constantly red lines being crossed, mostly by the Israelis,"" he argued.

""Hezbollah and Iran have played it fairly rationally, trying to always be very cautious in how they respond, trying to leave off-ramps where they could,"" he added. ""The Netanyahu government has kind of lost the opportunity at every sort of junction to use an off-ramp that was given to them.""

BBC Radio 5 Live contributor Lee Harris shared part of the interview on X, calling the lecturer's comments ""disgraceful.""

""Thought I would check out how the BBC are reporting on what's happening. I would say I can't believe what I'm hearing, but it's pretty much what you would expect from them. The anti-Israel bias is insane. Disgraceful,"" he wrote.

""This is unf -- believable. Enough is enough. The BBC is now an openly pro-terrorist organization,"" UK presenter and The Sun columnist Julia Hartley-Brewer reacted.

""And there I was thinking the BBC couldn't stoop any lower,"" musician and former Mumford & Sons guitarist Winston Marshall said about the clip.

""In today's episode of 'No Matter How Much You Hate The Media, You Don't Hate Them Enough' @BBC is taking the side of Islamic fundamentalist terror groups and jihadist regimes,"" radio host Ari Hoffman reacted.

October 7th anniversary weighs heavy as Jews enter the High Holy Days,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5108867/october-7th-anniversary-jewish-high-holy-days,2024-10-02T09:03:56Z,"A table covered with a cloth featuring the Loyola Marymount Hillel logo in the front, and six portraits of hostages who were killed sitting on top of it. Jason DeRose/NPR hide caption

On the table outside Rabbi Zachary Zysman's office at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, six portraits of hostages killed by Hamas are weighed down by a small stone, placed there as an act of remembrance.

Nearby, a stack of brochures for a Krav Maga self-defense class leans against a pad of paper on which people can write prayers, eventually to be tucked into the Western Wall in Jerusalem.

Zysman, the chaplain for Jewish life at Loyola Marymount, has carefully prepared for the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sunset on Wednesday and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, later this month. In the middle of the Jewish High Holy Days comes the anniversary of October 7, the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust.

No matter when the one-year anniversary fell, it would have been difficult, but Zysman said it's particularly poignant ""at a time when we're thinking about repentance, renewal and hope.""

His flock is small but close-knit. Loyola Marymount is a Jesuit university with about 10,000 students, 375 of whom are Jewish.

""One of the messages I've repeated over and over to my students is: What is our responsibility to each other?""

Along with other chaplains on campus, Zysman has hosted speaker series, workshops and roundtables discussions on anti-Semitism and Islamophobia during this past year, but the days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur will be less about education and more about personal and communal religious devotion for students.

The motif of death is frequent during High Holy Days liturgies, and Zysman said The phrases ""Who shall live? and 'Who shall die?"" take on a deeper resonance this year.

More than 1,200 Israelis, not all of whom were Jewish, died in the Hamas attacks of October 7, and 100 Israelis remain held hostage by Hamas, according to the Israeli government. More than 41,500 people in Gaza have been killed during the Israeli bombardment that followed, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Loyola Marymount senior Maya Golban says she has been reflecting on the lives - and deaths - of so many people since October 7.

""I can't personally change the politics of the Middle East, but what I can do is honor the people who've lost their lives.""

Golban said she's become considerably more active in Jewish groups on campus over the last year, where she's sometimes felt on the defensive, having to repeatedly justify her beliefs.

As she enters the High Holy Days, she said she continues to pray for ""the peace and safety of everyone in the region: Israeli, Palestinian and Bedouin.""

During the weeks leading up to the High Holy Days, Rabbi Jocee Hudson has been teaching a lunchtime class on the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles. She's the rabbi at the Hillel Jewish Center, just across the street.

""Welcome everyone. Let's put our feet on the ground,"" Hudson said as students finished the vegan enchiladas Hillel provides, while others snuck in at the last minute. ""As we gather, the question for today is 'What's on your heart?'""

Hudson opened the class by leading the group of about ten through a centering exercise.

""We root ourselves in presence."" she said, ""We root ourselves in the right here right now. As we say the blessing for Torah study.""

Together, the class recited the Hebrew prayer which translates, ""Blessed are you, oh Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hallows us and commands us to study the words of Torah.""

Among those taking this class is senior Dylan Julia Cooper.

""Right in the aftermath of October seventh,"" she said, ""we held a memorial on campus, which was so beautiful. And it was also really hard because people came to protest. And it was really difficult in my grief to hold my friends crying in my arms and know that people were protesting 20 feet away.""

Cooper, who's majoring in anthropology and theater, said it's been a year of perseverance and that October 7 coming in the middle of the High Holy Days ""serves as a reminder of how much we can endure as a community, as a universe.""

Cooper said he's used the weeks leading up to Rosh Hashanah to figure out how to let go of disillusionment over protests.

""My Jewish friends, my Muslim friends, my Palestinian Friends, my Israeli friends,"" says Cooper, ""I want them all to feel supported and loved by me. And I don't think that holding on to my anger or holding grudges is a good way to do that.""

Sitting next to Cooper in class was Matan Marder Friedgood, a junior at USC. He described this past year as one on edge.

""I have a friend who's not Jewish who's taking a Jewish studies course"" he said. ""She goes, 'Oh, Matan, you're Jewish!' And I feel myself tense up. I'm like 'What is this going to be about? What's going to happen?""

But in this story, it turns out he was more worried than he needed to be.

""She's like 'What's a Shabbat morning service?' It's the most benign question,"" he said. ""That was the year in a nutshell: 'You're Jewish.' Uh oh.""

But for Marder Friedgood, that intensity has meant the discovery of something about himself that he finds surprising.

""My connection to Judaism has grown stronger,"" he said, ""because of the pressure that's been put on it. And my connection to other Jews has grown stronger because of the pressure. And I am much more willing to embrace it publicly.""

Marder Friedgood's been asking himself how he and his community can put aside the fear and apprehension of the past year and welcome the Jewish New Year with sweetness.

""How do we bring back the Jewish Joy?"" he wondered. ""How do we just reincorporate all the positive -- all of what it means to be Jewish, all of the great things, all of the reasons we love it -- and hold the sadness and the grief at the same time?""

These are questions many Jews are asking themselves in the lead-up to both the High Holy Days and the October 7th anniversary. They're questions with no easy answers.

""It is only through experiences of very real grief that I have come to understand the capacity for very real joy,"" said Hillel Rabbi Jocee Hudson. ""It comes in the context of time, following Oct. 7th where all of us in the Jewish community have experienced deep anguish.""

""As we have seen tens of thousands of Palestinians also killed, we have ongoing anguish,"" she said. ""And there are students who have deep reactions to that -- deep moral outrage.""

That outrage is also why preparing for the High Holy Days this year has been so intense.

""When our hearts are broken open in grief,"" Hudson said, ""there are two possibilities: One is pulling back. The other is reaching out. And that's the spiritual work.""

It's spiritual work that asks a lot of 19 or 20 or 21-year-olds. But it's spiritual work that college junior Matan Marder Friedgood wants to help his community do together, even on October 7 itself. He and a housemate are planning a vigil on the University of Southern California campus that day.

""We're both musicians and so we're trying to uplift the space through creating -- I think we have a 10-piece band to try and play Israeli and Jewish music -- an atmosphere that is holding all the sadness and holding all the grief and all the anger. And we're looking toward the future.""

It's a future - a new year - marked by the hope for peace rather than the carnage of war. Marder Friedgood plans to end the vigil by teaching those gathered to sing in Hebrew a prayer for peace.

It's the closing line from the Medieval prayer known as the Kaddish. One translation reads, ""He who makes peace in the heavens -- may He bring peace to us and all the people of Israel. Let us say, 'Amen.'"""
Israeli women's basketball teams flee game after Iranian missile strikes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/israeli-womens-basketball-teams-forced-flee-game-upon-iranian-missile-strikes,2024-10-02T02:26:05Z,"A basketball game between two Israeli women's teams was evacuated after Iranian missiles struck the country Tuesday.

Iran launched dozens of missiles against Israel in a barrage of strikes it says are in response to the deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

Hapoel Lev Jerusalem was playing Hapoel Kfar Saba in the 2024-25 Preseason Winner Tournament at Malha Arena in Jersualem when the attacks began, according to The Jerusalem Post. The explosions began in the second quarter, with Hapoel Lev up 20. Then sirens rang out, and the players and coaches fled to a nearby bomb shelter. There were no reported casualties for either team.

""It's a crazy situation and reality that we are in,"" said veteran Hapoel Lev player Shir Tirosh. ""It's crazy that we are still in this reality a year later, and it's tough to begin the new season like this. And it's very sad. There are sirens in Jerusalem, sirens in Tel Aviv, sirens in the entire country. It's just a crazy reality. I think that what is keeping me level-headed is the fact that I am helping the foreigners on the team stay calm, because they are certainly more nervous than we are. I'm here to help them and stay positive about the situation that we are all in.""

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome antimissile defense system works to intercept incoming rockets.

Tirosh added that she and her teammates have become more accustomed to preparing for attacks from foreign threats dating back to October 2023.

""The import players that are here are, for the most part, calm and understand what has been going on,"" she said. ""When they arrived, they spoke to us that they weren't that afraid to come to Israel despite the situation that the country has been in.

""We have been speaking to them a lot about what is going on. Last year, after Oct. 7, when we weren't really prepared with how to deal with the situation, we had to act on our instincts with the foreigners. So, now we are much more prepared to handle that aspect. We are always explaining to them what is going on.""

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said this latest barrage of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

LIVE UPDATES: ISRAEL ORDERS LEBANON EVACUATIONS AS LIMITED GROUND OPERATION AGAINST HEZBOLLAH IS UNDERWAY

Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

At least six Israeli people are already reported dead from Tuesday's attacks during a shooting in Tel Aviv.

Tirosh's teammate, Zoe Wadoux, said the fear of playing in Jersualem has been a strain on her and her family, but she wants them to know she is safe.

""I made the decision during the summer, and at that moment, the war wasn't that bad. And when I got here, it got worse. Obviously, it's tough on my family and friends and all of the people that love me at home to know that I am here. I tried to call them and reach out to them everyday to say that I am OK and that I am safe. But with these types of events, that will, of course, worry. But I am here, and I will try to do as much as I can to be safe and let them know that I am safe.""

Tim Walz has the capacity to be 'sharp' during the CBS Vice Presidential Debate on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz kicked off his debate against Ohio Sen. JD Vance on shaky footing when he was first asked about his foreign policy platform in the Middle East.

""Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the Situation Room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?"" CBS' Margaret Brennan asked Walz on Tuesday evening in New York City during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Walz thanked the moderators for hosting him before delivering a halting and stammering answer while calling for ""steady leadership.""

""Iran, our I, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. Getting its hostages back, fundamental. And ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States to have to steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today where along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack,"" Walz responded, taking a few pauses between words.

ISRAEL UNDER ATTACK: IRAN LAUNCHES MISSILES, GUNMEN KILL AT LEAST 8 NEAR TEL AVIV

Earlier Tuesday, Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles at Israel. War broke out in Israel nearly one year ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched attacks on the nation.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,"" Walz continued.

Walz continued his response by taking shots at former President Donald Trump and his former administration officials.

And both of his secretaries of defense and his national security advisers said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them... said he's unfit for the highest office.

Opinion | Iran's president just called for diplomacy. Then he launched missiles at Israel.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-mehsoud-pezeshkian-rcna173548,2024-10-02T00:44:16Z,"This is no longer a proxy conflict where Israel and Iran can plausibly hide behind the language of diplomacy.

Barely one week after calling for diplomacy at the United Nations General Assembly, Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, launched his own October surprise -- about 180 missiles aimed at Israel. Iran can now claim it has responded forcefully to what it sees as Israel's incursions on its turf.

It's no surprise that Iran responded to Israel assassinating a Hezbollah leader in Lebanon last week. The surprise is that the response came, not from proxies, but with a state-on-state attack targeting Israeli civilians. Tuesday marks the second state-on-state attack Iran has launched this year, both aimed at Israel and both predictably blocked by the American-funded Iron Dome defense system. The Israeli military said it was not aware of any casualties in this strike. In the before times, after Iran conducted a dramatic, terrifying, but less impactful face-saving operation, both sides would retreat to their corners. But, for reasons explained below, today's actions are unlikely to be an end. To the contrary, we're likely to see Israel and Iran continue to raise the stakes further, dragging their allies into deeper conflict.

Iran has been embarrassed twice now by Israeli leadership: the targeted assassination of a Hamas leader inside Iran this summer and the current ground invasion of turf run by Hezbollah in Lebanon. These actions, which Netanyahu's government argues are meant to de-escalate further war by eliminating Iranian-backed militants for good, are a strike at the heart of Iran's power in the region. Indeed, the Israeli prime minister has underscored that his statement at the U.N. that ""there is no place in Iran the long arm of Israel cannot reach"" was not a rhetorical flourish, but a promise he means to keep.

At the same time, despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage. Masoud Pezeshkian is a cardiac surgeon who in July beat out hard-liners and who told the world at last week's United Nations General Assembly, ""We're willing to have peace. We do not want to fight. We do not want war. In what other language do we need to express this to everyone?"" But even he must give way to the Revolutionary Guard in the wake of the decimation of Iran's ""forward defense system"" in recent weeks, that is, the armed militias operating near Israel's borders in Syria and elsewhere.

This is no longer a proxy conflict where Israel and Iran can plausibly hide behind the language of diplomacy to claim a degree of remove from military action and violence. In fact, Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon on Monday intended to eliminate the threat of Hezbollah and Iran, but it has also united the Israeli factions that have disagreed with one another about the treatment of Gazans. The United States has already followed through on its promised defense of Israel and moved warplanes and troops into position in the Arabian Sea. With Iran and Israel's leader both promising ""consequences"" and ""crushing attacks"" after each incident, this is no longer a game of chicken. It's a race toward disaster."

CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour insisted Tuesday that Iran does not want conflict to escalate between itself and Israel, or the United States.

Amanpour made the statement during network coverage of Iran launching missile strikes into Israel in retaliation for the country's airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week.

""Nobody, nobody - not the Lebanese nor the Iranians, want this to escalate even further. Iran does not want an Israeli or a U.S. war against it,"" Amanpour told CNN anchor Dana Bash on Tuesday morning, suggesting the current rocket barrage was calculated to prompt minimal response from Israeli forces.

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said this barrage of hundreds of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of the terror group leader Nasrallah in Beirut last week, and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.

The military group warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had vowed to strike back in retaliation for Nasrallah's death, saying, ""The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged.""

During her appearance on CNN, Amanpour reported that Iranian leaders have been trying to show restraint so they can avoid a larger war.

""It's incredibly important to be absolutely precise about what's going on. So far, there is no evidence that anything has landed, that it is being intercepted, according to our correspondents on the ground. And also, the United States and Israel said that they assessed that the targets would be three Israeli air bases, and an intelligence base,"" she began.

""That's very important to keep in mind,"" Amanpour said.

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari confirmed Tuesday that Israel's forces did carry out ""quite a few interceptions,"" and noted they're ""unaware of casualties."" Still, he revealed that there were ""some impacts in the center and areas in the south of the country.""

About Iran and Lebanon's perspective on this conflict, Amanpour continued, ""The Iranian foreign minister told me in New York during the United Nations that they were showing - and this is again before Friday's assassination - that they were showing restraint and that Hezbollah was showing restraint as well, and that it wanted, you know, to de-escalate all of this.""

The correspondent noted that, prior to Nasrallah's death, both countries felt they were ""being entrapped and they're trying to resist the notion of being trapped into this war.""

""So then comes the assassination of their client, Hassan Nasrallah,"" she said, adding, ""Hezbollah is meant to be the frontline troops of Iran. So this response from Iran is more likely because it feels it has been left no choice.""

Despite Amanpour's point that Iran and Lebanon don't want things to escalate, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called the attack ""a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event"" in a White House briefing."
"Trump blames Biden, Harris for Iran's attack on Israel: 'Very close to global catastrophe'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blames-biden-harris-irans-attack-israel-very-close-global-catastrophe,2024-10-01T22:37:42Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Hours before the vice presidential debate, former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at his campaign rally in Wisconsin and bashed the Biden administration over Iran's historic attack on Israel.

""A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel... I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. We're not going to make [predictions]... but they are very close to global catastrophe,"" Trump said. ""We have a non-existent president and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on.""

Trump's comments come after Israel said Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at the country, marking the largest ballistic missile attack in history.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

IRAN ATTACK ON ISRAEL 'INEFFECTIVE' BUT A 'SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION': WHITE HOUSE

Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

Trump accused President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of weak leadership on the world stage.

""That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore. The so-called enemy doesn't respect our country any longer,"" Trump said.

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

Trump claimed Biden and Harris made Iran rich in a very short period of time.

""They have $300 billion now. They're rich. I mean, they pay 6 billion every time they have somebody that was kidnaped, it's always $6 billion,"" Trump said.

""Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. They had no money left. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. The people they're fighting now, they would have been willing to make any deal. You could have made any deal. But Kamala flooded them with American cash and everything. Now, I mean, they're flooding them with cash. It's honestly not even believable,"" Trump continued.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to repel the strikes.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan characterized the attack as a ""significant escalation"" while speaking at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

Many missiles were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems, while others did hit the ground.

The Pentagon says the U.S. fired approximately 12 interceptors against Iranian missiles.

Ayman Mohyeldin: We're inching closer to a full-scale Middle East war. Can the U.S. stop it?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/lebanon-strikes-hezbollah-israel-hamas-middle-east-war-rcna173317,2024-10-01T21:46:19Z,"Tensions are rising in the Middle East following the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike on Friday. After days of anticipation of a possible Iranian response to Nasrallah's killing, Iran fired ballistic missiles into Israel on Tuesday. No fatalities have been reported. Israel is expected to retaliate imminently.

Israel has also continued its strikes on southern Lebanon, where they claimed to have killed another senior Hezbollah figure. On Monday, Israel's military forces pressed forward with a ground incursion to conduct what the government described as ""limited, localized and targeted ground raids"" against Hezbollah.

According to Lebanon's prime minister, as many as 1 million residents have been displaced already, with many forced to sleep on the streets. The Lebanese government says Israel's two-week aerial campaign has now killed more than 1,000 people, including women and children. Hezbollah has launched retaliatory attacks across northern Israel, which were mostly intercepted.

Meanwhile, Americans in Lebanon are feeling confused and anxious amid the bombardment, with many scrambling to find a way out. On Sunday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told ABC News that the State Department does ""not feel a need"" to evacuate Americans from the country, instead suggesting those worried about their safety use ""commercial air traffic."" This comes as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered U.S. forces to remain on standby as tensions flare up. And on Monday, NBC News reported that ""the Pentagon said it was sending a 'few thousand' additional troops to bolster the roughly 40,000 American forces in the area.""

With the threat of a full-scale regional war seemingly rising by the hour, many are now asking how we got here. For nearly a year, U.S. officials have urged actors in the region to lower the temperature and prevent the conflict from escalating. But those warnings apparently fell on deaf ears.

U.S. officials are growing increasingly concerned as strikes ramp up in Lebanon. Just two days before Nasrallah was killed, a handful of Western nations led by the U.S. put forward a 21-day cease-fire plan, expecting Israel to accept it. In fact, Kirby told reporters the cease-fire plan was published after consulting with Israel and that the Israelis ""were aware of every word"" in the statement. Kirby said he thought the Israelis were ""on board"" with the proposal and said the allies would not have made it public otherwise.

Despite that, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly rejected the deal on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week. The massive strike that killed Nasrallah went down just hours later.

Now, the fact that Israel agreed to a cease-fire deal in bad faith should surprise absolutely no one, especially U.S. officials, who have been strung along for months. The truth is, the situation playing out right now in the Middle East is being orchestrated entirely on the terms of one person and one person alone: Netanyahu.

As NBC News has reported:

In the absence of an arms embargo, America's leverage over Israel has been whittled down to nothing. By sacrificing its seat at the table, the U.S. has ensured that those deciding the next steps in this conflict are Netanyahu and the leaders of Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah -- not the American president."
Conflict in the Middle East is spreading. Is a wider regional war imminent? : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/1202891566/iran-missile-attack-israel-hezbollah,2024-10-01T21:42:56Z,"Fire erupts between Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv and the city of Modiin following an Iranian missile attack, on October 1, 2024. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said a missile attack under way against Israel on October 1 was in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last week as well as that of the Hamas leader.

The war in the Middle East appears to be widening, almost one year after Hamas launched its attack on Israel.

This comes after Iran launched a major missile strike that targeted sites across Israel, while Israel's air defenses attempted to shoot down the incoming fire, Israeli officials said.

NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi and Greg Myre reported that Iran has claimed the missile attack was in response to the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut Friday, which killed 39 people, according to Lebanese health officials.

There was no immediate word on casualties or the amount of damage caused by the Iranian attack on Tuesday night.

Al-Shalchi and Myre also reported that Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people in the past two weeks and forced many civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, as well as many civilians.

For more on what might unfold from here, Consider This host Ailsa Chang spoke with General Frank McKenzie, the retired Commander of United States Central Command.

Chang asked him if he had a sense of Iran's calculations, in launching Tuesday's attacks, and what it all might mean for the wider region.

""The long term goal of all Iranian foreign policy is regime preservation. They want to preserve the clerical regime. They don't get themselves into a situation where that regime is actually subject to direct attack by Israel or the United States or anyone else,"" he said.

McKenzie expressed his surprise towards the action taken by Iran.

""To be honest with you, I doubt their ability to have genuine success in this attack. And now the Israelis will have the option to retaliate and the Israelis possess far more retaliatory options against Iran than Iran does against Israel.""

The assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is a major factor, but even then, McKenzie says that this will likely not bode well for Iran.

""Things did not go well for them in April when they launched the last attack on Israel. So you could see that Iranian thinking could be that they need to do something now. You've got to be very careful if you're going to do something, it needs to have a meaningful effect. If it doesn't have a meaningful, meaningful effect, you're going to be in worse shape than you were when you began.""

As to whether or not McKenzie believes this will lead to more U.S. involvement in the Middle East, he says precedent will likely predict that outcome.

""Well, I think we did last time. I would assume we're doing it this time. So I don't know, it's certainly very likely, I'd be very surprised if that's not the case.""

His top concerns on what might come next?

""I think the thing that people's minds will turn to next, [is] what will be the Israeli response? It will be scoped to what happens in this attack, which is not yet complete. So if there's significant damage done in this attack, then I would look for a very large Israeli response, and they've demonstrated that they have the ability to do it.""

McKenzie says Israel has already demonstrated it has the ability to operate ""almost with impunity over Tehran,"" and that will likely factor into whatever their response may be."
CBS host grills Ta-Nehisi Coates on anti-Israel views in new book: Looks like it came from 'an extremist',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-host-grills-ta-nehisi-coates-anti-israel-views-new-book-looks-like-came-from-an-extremist,2024-10-01T20:50:22Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether he believed Israel had ""a right to exist"" in a tense interview on Monday.

Coates appeared on the show to preview his new book, ""The Message,"" which is a collection of new essays by the best-selling author about his travels to different parts of the world.

""In the book's longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary says.

Dokoupil confronted Coates on this section of the book, telling him bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

""I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,"" Coates replied.

""I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network, mainstream organization, in America with a Palestinian-American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part the world. I've been a reporter for 20 years. The reporters are those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out. But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel, what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories I have not heard. Those were the stories that I was most occupied with,"" he continued.

Coates also said the 260-page book was not meant to be a ""treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.""

Dokoupil continued to press the far-left author, claiming his book would leave readers questioning why Israel even existed.

""But if you were to read this book you would be left wondering why does any of Israel exist? What a horrific place committing horrific acts on a daily basis. So I think the question is central and key: If Israel has a right to exist. And if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes why do the Palestinians have a right to exist? Why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right to exist?"" Dokoupil asked.

Coates rejected the question, saying that countries are established by force, not rights, and that Israel already exists.

Dokoupil said the author's book ""delegitimizes"" Israel's foundation and ""seems like an effort to topple the whole building of it.""

""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state, that is a Jewish safe place, and not any of the other states out there?"" he asked Coates.

""There's nothing that offends me about a Jewish state,"" Coates retorted. ""I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.""

""Muslim included?"" Dokoupil asked.

""I would not want a state where any group of people laid down their citizenship rights based on ethnicity,"" Coates said. He explained how he personally witnessed the ""two-tier system"" in Israel, where Palestinians had less freedom and access to resources in ""occupied territories"" than Israelis.

""I'm working with the person that is guiding me, a Palestinian whose father, whose grandfather and grandmother was born in this town. And I have more freedom to walk than he does. He can't ride on certain roads. He can't get water in the same way that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away from him can,"" Coates said.

The two continued to spar as Dokoupil suggested Coates had portrayed a one-sided view of the conflict.

""But why is that?"" the anchor pressed. ""Why is there no agency in this book for the Palestinians? They exist in your narrative merely as victims of the Israelis, as though they were not offered peace at any juncture, as though they don't have a stake in this -- "" he asked.

Coates appealed to his own ancestry and America's history with racism to defend his particular viewpoint on the conflict in Gaza.

""I have a very, very, very moral compass about this. Again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. It's really, really simple. Either what I saw was right or it's wrong,"" he explained.

""I am against a state that discriminates against people on the basis of ethnicity. I'm against that. There is nothing the Palestinians could do that would make that okay for me. My book is not based on the hyper-morality of the Palestinian people,"" he went on to say.

Coates' new book was released on Tuesday, the same day that Iran launched dozens of missiles against Israel.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said its latest barrage of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system works to intercept incoming rockets."

The ""significant"" role the U.S. played in helping Israel fend off Iran's aerial assault on Tuesday came just hours after Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin assured Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that the U.S. had ""increased force readiness"" and stood ready.

""This is a significant escalation by Iran,"" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters Tuesday. ""It is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which no one was killed in this attack in Israel.""

The comments were made following massive missile strike fired by Iran in which some 180 missiles were fired at Israel.

According to Iranian state media, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said the attack was in retaliation for the Friday assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed alongside IRGC commander and military advisor Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, as well as Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas who was killed in July during a visit to Tehran.

""In response to the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah and Martyr Nilfroshan, we targeted the heart of the occupied territories,"" the IRGC said in a statement reported by Iranian media. ""If the Zionist regime reacts to Iran's operations, it will face crushing attacks.""

Following the attacks, Israel closed its airspace, residents in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were ordered to shelter in place and the Israeli security cabinet said it would convene Tuesday night in a bunker in Jerusalem, according to Israeli news outlet the Jerusalem Post.

It remains unclear if Iranian missiles had made contact with any targets, though the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) told Fox News Digital that no casualties were yet known.

In a statement to Fox News, a U.S. defense official said, ""[In] accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel's security, U.S. forces in the region are currently defending against Iranian-launched missiles targeting Israel.

""Our forces remain postured to provide additional defensive support and to protect U.S. forces operating in the region,"" the official added.

ISRAELI MINISTERS FRUSTRATED OVER US, IDF LEAK ON LEBANON OPERATION: REPORT

Earlier on Tuesday, the Pentagon said in a readout regarding the second call Austin has held with Gallant in the last 24 hours, that the secretary ""made it clear that the United States is well-postured to defend U.S. personnel, allies, and partners in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations and is determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict in the region.""

Three U.S. guided-missile destroyers have been positioned off the eastern Mediterranean to help defend Israel, including the USS Arleigh Burke, USS Bulkeley and USS Cole -- which reportedly played a closely coordinated role in defending against the Iranian attack on Tuesday.

""Today, Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel. The United States military coordinated closely with the Israeli Defense Forces to help defend Israel against this attack,"" Sullivan said. ""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles.""

In April, during the last major attack that Iran levied at Israel when it fired more than 300 drones and missiles, the USS Arleigh Burke and the USS Carney shot down more than 81 attack drones and at least six ballistic missiles using guided-missile destroyers.

The ballistic missiles were shot down using the SM-3 ballistic missile interceptors from the ships that were also positioned in the eastern Mediterranean at the time. The SM-3 has a range of up to 1,550 miles.

Israel has several of its own defense systems outside of what its offshore allies provide, including the infamous Iron Dome which is designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells fired from distances of two to 43 miles away.

But it also has systems that are capable of stopping missiles fired from greater distances, like its Arrow Missile Defense System, which can intercept missiles fired from up to 1,500 miles away and above the earth's atmosphere.

The air defense system known as David's Sling is also designed to intercept enemy planes, drones, tactical ballistic missiles, medium to long-range rockets and cruise missiles fired at a range of 25 to 190 miles away.

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that it was believed the Iranian strikes had stopped, and told Israelis it was safe to leave their shelters.

""During the defense, we carried out quite a few interceptions. There are some impacts in the center and areas in the south of the country,"" Hagari said Tuesday night local time. ""At this stage we are still carrying out an assessment [of the attack], but we are unaware of casualties."""

Jewish American leaders on Tuesday afternoon reacted to Iran's unprecedented missile attack against Israel.

The attack, which included more than a hundred missiles, according to Israel, came in response to the recent deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

""The United States stands with its only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel, as it defends itself and its people against evil,"" Ohio Republican Rep. Max Miller told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Iran and its proxies must stop threatening the world.""

In a Sept. 30 statement, Miller said that ""Israel's efforts to dismantle Hezbollah are making the world a safer place.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST ISRAEL

""I commend the effort to eliminate Hezbollah's Secretary General, Hassan Nasrallah, who is responsible for the deaths of Americans and countless innocent civilians,"" Miller wrote. ""Civilians in Lebanon continue to suffer as Hezbollah, acting under Iran's direction, drags the country into war. The responsibility for this death and destruction rests with Hezbollah and those who seek to sow chaos and dysfunction at the behest of Tehran.""

Democratic Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz said Iran ""made a mistake"" in a Tuesday post to his personal X account, adding that the country ""has put its nuclear facilities on the board as fair game.""

From his official congressional account, Moskowitz said his ""thoughts are with the people of Israel tonight.""

""Iran's horrific attack, so close to October 7th, is a reminder of the threat that Israel faces every single day and why America must stand with our ally against the Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies,"" the Florida congressman said.

New York Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman said in a Tuesday post on X that ""Hezbollah's presence at the border is in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which was the basis for a ceasefire in 2006.""

""If the UN and international community will not enforce 1701, then Israel must do so to prevent Hezbollah from continuing to attack Israel,"" he wrote.

Sullivan also expressed his condolences to the victims who were killed in a shooting in the Israeli city of Jaffa, located near Tel Aviv on Tuesday. At least eight people were killed and at least seven injured, local officials have told Fox News.

The incident, which is believed to be a terror attack, took place Tuesday outside a newly built light rail station on Jerusalem Street. Authorities say at least two individuals who opened fire on a crowd of people have been neutralized.

Houthis And Iraqi Militias Target Israel Amidst Lebanon Escalation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/01/houthis-and-iraqi-militias-target-israel-amidst-lebanon-escalation/,2024-10-01T17:05:25Z,"The Houthis in Yemen and the Iran-backed Iraqi militias that operate under the banner of the self-styled Islamic Resistance of Iraq, IRI, are continuing their long-range missile and drone attacks against Israel. Their latest attacks coincide with Israel's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and its ground incursion into South Lebanon. They are unlikely to weaken Israel nor substantially distract it from its Lebanon offensive.

Houthi spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree boasted in a televised speech on Tuesday that the group launched drones against military targets in Israel's financial hub, Tel Aviv, and the southern port city of Eilat. Israeli media speculated that Saree was referring to drones intercepted by the Israeli Air Force over the Mediterranean Sea off the country's coast.

Despite incurring Israeli retaliatory airstrikes, the Houthis have continued their drone and missile campaign.

The same day Israel assassinated Nasrallah -- Friday, September 27 -- Saree announced the group targeted Tel Aviv and Ashkelon with drones and missiles, vowing to continue such attacks until Israel ceases operations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Israel intercepted a missile launched from Yemen that same day.

The next day, Israel intercepted another missile. The Houthis later claimed they had fired it at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport to coincide with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's return flight from the United Nations. Israel responded Sunday by bombing Yemen in retaliation for those two attacks, killing four people and wounding 29.

The IRI also claimed Sunday that it dispatched a drone toward Eilat, its first since Nasrallah's assassination.

Even before the Hezbollah leader's demise, the IRI vowed to militarily support Hezbollah, especially following the September 17-18 Hezbollah pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon and Israel's intensified and devastating air campaign against the group.

For example, one of the most powerful groups in the IRI, Kataib Hezbollah, promptly declared it was ""fully prepared to go with them until the end, sending fighters and equipment and support, whether on the technical or logistical level.""

On September 20, a Kaitab Hezbollah commander, Abu Haider al-Khafaji, was killed by a suspected Israeli drone attack on his vehicle at Damascus airport.

When Hezbollah launched its first ballistic missile aimed at Tel Aviv on September 25, the IRI seemingly followed suit by launching drones at Eilat hours later. The IRI attack lightly injured two civilians and caused light damage. Israeli air defenses intercepted the lone Hezbollah missile.

Two days earlier, the IRI launched an estimated six attacks in 24 hours, using cruise missiles and drones. They were either intercepted or did not reach their targets.

The IRI primarily use Iranian-made Shahed 101 and Samad loitering munitions -- informally referred to as suicide or kamikaze drones -- and Al-Arqab cruise missiles, a variant of Iran's Paveh, in their attacks targeting Israel. Overall, the IRI claims it has launched more than 100 missile and drones against Israel since Hamas' fateful October 7, 2023, attacks ignited the current, ongoing hostilities throughout the region.

Iran also supplied these Iraqi militias with short-range ballistic missiles beginning in 2018. It doesn't seem the IRI has used any SRBMs, likely cognizant of the escalatory potential doing so could pose.

""The Iraqi armed factions are still cautious in getting fully involved in the conflict as they're well aware of the risks,"" wrote Middle East analyst Mohammed Salih in a post on X on September 25. ""But they seem to be steadily on course to intensify their attacks, based on their calculations, evaluation of the circumstances, and the level of support they believe is necessary to ease the pressure on Lebanese Hezbollah.""

Israel's first attack against Yemen targeted the Hodeidah port on July 20, killing 14 people, mostly port employees. It had launched the attack a day after a Houthi Samad drone struck Tel Aviv for the first time, killing one civilian. The drone had evaded Israeli air defenses by approaching Israel from its Mediterranean coast. Israel's intercept of a drone from that same general direction Tuesday morning indicates it learned from that fatal incident.

When the Houthis launched what they dubiously claimed was a hypersonic missile directly at Tel Aviv on September 15, Israeli air defenses also intercepted it. Netanyahu referenced the prior Hodeidah strike when warning the group it would pay ""a heavy price"" for such actions but did not launch any subsequent strikes until the one on Sunday mentioned above.

Unlike the Houthis in Yemen, Israel has not retaliated for any of the IRI attacks by striking those militias on Iraqi territory. It may seek to avoid making the situation for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who have come under repeated fire by the IRI since October 2023, more precarious, especially at a time when Washington is negotiating a troop drawdown with Baghdad. That could change if any of these attacks cause significant casualties or damage or if the IRI follows in the Houthis footsteps and fires SRBMs directly at Tel Aviv from Iraqi soil.

Following the IRI drone and cruise missile launches on September 22-23, reporters asked Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari whether Israel might retaliate with an attack in Iraq. ""We are following the threat from Iraq,"" he stated. ""We are looking at it during our situation assessment, collecting intelligence and we will do whatever is necessary to deal with the situation.""

The IRI and the Houthis claimed they carried out joint attacks against Israel in recent months, with the Yemen-based group recently opening an office in Baghdad. However, these moves seem more politically symbolic than strategic.

With Hezbollah under immense pressure in Lebanon, these groups are likely to continue firing their drones and missiles at Israel. While these attacks are an irritant for Israel, they are unlikely to pose a serious enough threat for it to divert substantial military resources away from the Lebanon front, at least in the short to medium term. For now, it will rely on its extensive, multi-layered air and missile defenses to shoot down incoming targets and, at least in the case of Yemen, its air force to launch occasional strikes in response."
Taylor Lorenz leaves Washington Post following her Biden 'war criminal' post controversy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-following-biden-war-criminal-controversy,2024-10-01T16:27:28Z,"Washington Post tech and online culture reporter Taylor Lorenz skewered Elon Musk's management of Twitter, calling ""disaster"" during a recent interview on BBC World News.

Reporter Taylor Lorenz announced she left The Washington Post on Tuesday after being absent for weeks following a viral controversy involving her calling President Biden a ""war criminal.""

Lorenz went viral in August after a screenshot obtained by the New York Post's Jon Levine appeared to show her calling President Biden a ""war criminal"" in an Instagram post while attending a White House event. Lorenz initially implied the caption was edited by someone else before admitting that she shared the post herself.

As part of the launch of her User Magazine Substack, she explained ""why I'm leaving legacy media,"" saying her type of reporting ""has become increasingly difficult to do in corporate media.""

The Post confirmed her exit.

WASHINGTON POST'S TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS BIDEN 'WAR CRIMINAL' POST WAS 'OBVIOUS MEME' AFTER CLAIMING IT WAS EDITED

""We are grateful for the work Taylor has produced at The Washington Post. She has resigned to pursue a career in independent journalism, and we wish her the best,"" a spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital.

For several weeks, The Post remained mum about whether Lorenz had been suspended from the paper over the controversy. Lorenz had not had anything published since Aug. 7. A spokesperson from the paper previously said it was ""looking into"" Lorenz's post but did not provide any updates until Oct. 1, confirming Lorenz's exit from the paper.

WASHINGTON POST LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS TAYLOR LORENZ PUBLISHED INSTAGRAM POST CALLING BIDEN A 'WAR CRIMINAL'

Lorenz previously told Fox News Digital that she was on an overseas vacation and implied she would be back to work at The Post the week of Sept. 30.

Meanwhile, Lorenz has remained active via her personal Substack newsletter as well as her podcast, which is produced by Vox.

It remains unclear whether Lorenz was officially suspended over her Instagram post.

The controversy began when Lorenz attended the White House Creator Economy Conference last month, where Biden made an appearance.

In the viral image shared by Levine, a masked Lorenz was seen taking a selfie with Biden speaking in the background. Included was a caption that read ""War criminal"" with a frowny face.

Fox News Digital learned the post was made in an Instagram story specifically using the ""close friends"" feature as indicated by the green star icon, meaning it was not posted publicly and could only have been seen by a select group of Instagram users of her choosing.

WAPO REPORTER SUGGESTS WHITE HOUSE CENSOR 'MISINFORMATION' FROM TRUMP-MUSK INTERVIEW DURING PRESS BRIEFING

Lorenz initially denied the post's authenticity, replying to Levine, ""You people will fall for any dumba-- edit someone makes.""

However, not only did Lorenz later admit it was real, she insisted it was a joke.

""I literally never denied it was real,'"" Lorenz told one critic on X. She told another that it was an ""obvious meme.""

There had been speculation online that Lorenz was making an obscure reference to musician Lucy Dacus, who called former President Obama a ""war criminal"" on social media last year, also with a frowny face.

NPR previously reported that ""four people with direct knowledge"" of the post ""confirmed its authenticity.""

""Only about 7 people saw the actual close friends post (I have very few people on CF) and almost all are my normie non-media friends. So [I don't know] who this guy is talking about [to be honest],"" Lorenz reacted to NPR's reporting.

Biden has been repeatedly attacked by the far-left for his handling of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, with many deriding him as ""Genocide Joe"" for continuing to provide military aid to the Jewish State following the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

Lebanon's government urges international community for support amid Israel's invasion,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5134606/lebanon-israel-invasion-hezbollah-international-support,2024-10-01T16:07:04Z,"A man documents destroyed buildings at the site of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburb, Lebanon, on Tuesday. Hassan Ammar/AP hide caption

Lebanese politicians urgently called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop its advance into Lebanese territory on Tuesday, as Israeli troops crossed into southern Lebanon in an operation targeting Hezbollah outposts.

Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, warned on Tuesday that his country was facing ""one of the most dangerous phases of its history,"" urging the United Nations for emergency funding for civilians impacted by the conflict.

Imran Riza, the U.N's deputy special coordinator in Lebanon, said the country was seeking $426 million in U.N. assistance.

""As violence escalates, we call on the global community to provide this much needed support and to ensure protection of civilians,"" Riza said. ""Without sufficient resources, humanitarians risk leaving the population of an entire country without the support they urgently require.""

Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the last two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The U.N. says around 1 million people -- nearly a fifth of the country -- have been displaced from their homes while fleeing this bombardment.

Israel's offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese militant group.

The conflict entered a dramatic new phase over the weekend, following Israel's killing of Hezbollah's longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as several other top officials.

And now Israel says it is running a ""limited"" incursion of ""targeted ground raids"" in southern Lebanon aimed at Hezbollah militants that pose a threat to communities in northern Israel. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

Israel used similar wording about limited raids at the start of its invasion of the Gaza Strip following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and the Israeli invasion of Gaza has since expanded and continued to grind on one year later. So Israel's latest comments have raised skepticism in Lebanon about the actual scope of the operation.

""This is not an incursion, this is an invasion,"" Najat Aoun Saliba, a Lebanese member of parliament, told NPR. ""We've been invaded by another country and we have to call on the international community to call it as such.""

Saliba urged world leaders to call on Israel to put an immediate end to its military offensive in Lebanon.

""We definitely keep saying violence cannot stop violence. We need diplomatic efforts to stop the violence,"" Saliba said. ""We don't want Lebanon to also turn into another Gaza.""

Israel and Hezbollah began trading attacks back and forth across the Israel-Lebanon border after the Oct. 7 assault on Israel led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

In support of Hamas, Hezbollah says it will continue firing rockets into northern Israel until there's a cease-fire in Israel's military campaign in Gaza."
"IDF meets little resistance from Hezbollah after weeks of hitting terror targets, officials say",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-meets-little-resistance-from-hezbollah-after-weeks-hitting-terror-targets-officials-say,2024-10-01T15:58:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Israel Defense Force (IDF) has met little resistance since announcing its ""limited"" invasion of southern Lebanon early Tuesday morning local time, a move aimed to subvert Hezbollah's buildup along the shared border.

Israel has been increasing its strikes for weeks against the terrorist organization in southern Lebanon, as well as with targeted strikes in Beirut.

On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed in a statement shared with Fox News Digital that since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel - after which Hezbollah began striking military posts along Israel's northern border - the IDF has conducted dozens of ""targeted operations"" to ""dismantle Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities"" that pose a threat to civilians in the north.

ISRAELI MINISTERS FRUSTRATED OVER US, IDF LEAK ON LEBANON OPERATION: REPORT

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that IDF special forces have entered Hezbollah compounds in ""dozens of locations"" along the Israel-Lebanon border, collected intelligence and dismantled positional strongholds.

""Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructures, exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapon caches, and seized and destroyed the weapons, including advanced Iranian-made weapons,"" Hagari said. ""Overall, IDF soldiers exposed and dismantled over 700 Hezbollah terror assets during these operations. And there's a lot more work to do.""

Since the war began nearly a year ago, Israeli special forces reportedly began conducting small raids in southern Lebanon, in some cases utilizing the very tunnels Israel seized from the terrorist group years prior, and renewed attention has been brought to how the Hezbollah network operates.

The terrorist group for years has relied on its heavy entanglement in civilian life, particularly in southern Lebanon, where it has rented civilian infrastructure to serve as weapons depots and even missile launcher sites. Civilian buildings have also been used to cover entrances to the group's sophisticated tunnel network that is estimated to stretch over 100 miles in length cumulatively across the region.

But despite the feared all-out war that had the potential to erupt upon Israel's invasion of its northern neighbor, Hezbollah's resistance has been minimal.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Security experts feared Hezbollah's longtime backing from Iran would enable it to levy as many as 8,000 rockets per day in a worse case scenario, and its more than 50,000 operatives, including the elite Radwan forces, could pose a significant threat against an Israeli ground campaign.

Hagari confirmed to reporters Tuesday that IDF forces were actively working to dismantle Radwan infrastructure near the border in southern Lebanon.

""We need to take care of it because we will not let another 7th of October occur next to our border,"" he said.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks, the IDF assessed that some 2,400 Radwan terrorists, along with another 500 Palestinian Jihadists trained by the elite force, were positioned in villages across southern Lebanon poised to attack.

But the IDF on Tuesday also highlighted that Hezbollah failed to mount a counter force in response to Israel's incursion.

Jonathan Conricus, former IDF spokesperson and current senior fellow for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah's near-complete lack of a counter force could be explained by several reasons.

""The IDF conducted hundreds of special operations during the last months to map and analyze Hezbollah's hostile infrastructure in civilian houses in southern Lebanon, as well as targeted aerial campaigns against Hezbollah personnel,"" he said. ""Hezbollah terrorists sustained severe casualties and started to flee from southern Lebanon.

""It remains unclear how many Hezbollah militants remain in the south,"" he added.

Given the unknown number of terrorists who fled the south, most likely to other strongholds in Beirut and in central Lebanon, reporters questioned the current IDF spokesman if this could mean that Israel will need to expand its operations north.

""We're not going to Beirut,"" Hagari told reporters, emphasizing Israel's stated goal to return its citizens to their northern homes. ""We are focusing in the area of those villages, the area next to [the] border. And we will do, in this area, what is necessary to dismantle and demolish Hezbollah's infrastructure.""

Hagari would not provide specifics on the operational timeline but said Israel's campaign in Lebanon would be conducted in ""days [to] weeks."""
"Iran preparing imminent missile attack on Israel, US says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-preparing-imminent-missile-attack-israel-us-says,2024-10-01T15:34:16Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst explains the 'significant developments' in the Middle East as Israeli forces push into Lebanon and Iran plans an attack.

Iran is preparing to ""imminently"" launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel, a senior White House official told Fox News on Tuesday morning, following weeks of Israeli strikes against Tehran's proxies in the region.

""The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel,"" the official said. ""We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.""

Another U.S. official told Fox News that Iran could launch its attack as soon as Tuesday afternoon, saying that the U.S. has seen additional movement of missiles in Iran to prepare for the now ""imminent"" attack.

The official added that Iran's attack could look like the one it launched in April against Israel, which had more than 300 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.

LIVE UPDATES: ISRAEL ORDERS LEBANON EVACUATIONS AS LIMITED GROUND OPERATION AGAINST HEZBOLLAH IS UNDERWAY

While the U.S. official did not know what the exact scope or size will be, the official said that Iran has been at a state of readiness to launch an attack on Israel within 12 to 24 hours since early August following the July 31st assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

Iran already launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April, though the regime's proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have traded attacks with Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

On Tuesday, Israel was beginning a limited ground invasion into southern Lebanon against Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the Middle East, has been reeling from weeks of targeted strikes that killed its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders.

""We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran,"" the official said.

The threat builds on tension across the region, as Israel fights with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and continues its war in Gaza against Hamas -- both groups backed by Iran.

Israel on Monday began a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it is targeting Hezbollah militants. The Israeli offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people in less than two weeks and forced many civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several top officials, but they have also killed many civilians.

Iran attacked Israel in April with over 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all of the weapons were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. A few missiles did cause some damage. A 7-year-old girl was severely injured and a military base in southern Israel suffered minor damage, according to Israeli officials."

JD Vance, R-Ohio, will likely be asked about his opinions on abortion and other major policy issues when he faces off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, amid controversy surrounding his stances since being named as former President Donald Trump's running mate over the summer.

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Israel begins ground offensive in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon,2024-10-01T10:06:47Z,"Tanks and troops gather in northern Israel on Monday in preparation for a ground invasion. Maya Levin/NPR hide caption

The Israeli military pressed its ground incursion into southern Lebanon on Tuesday, calling the operations ""limited incursions"" targeting Hezbollah militants.

The military said late Monday when it began its operations that it is aimed at Hezbollah targets that pose an immediate threat to communities in northern Israel. The incursion follows Friday's airstrike that killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The operation, approved by political and security officials, involves ground raids by Israeli commandos against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure in villages in southern Lebanon. The Israeli air force and artillery troops are providing back up to the ground forces.

The Israeli military has closed off the area of three Israeli towns near the border with southeast Lebanon. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire, and the U.N. says about one million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes fleeing Israeli airstrikes.

An Israeli security official, speaking anonymously, told NPR that Israeli troops have entered Lebanon targeting Hezbollah military compounds close to the border. The official said the military is ""acting in a limited area focusing on the villages right by the border. Some homes are 100 meters from the border, some dozens of meters from the border, and some hundreds of meters from the border."" The official said that a ground incursion into Beirut is ""not on the table.""

On Tuesday an IDF spokesperson asked residents of a number of villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate and move north of the Awali river.

On Monday, Hezbollah's deputy leader, Naim Kassem, said in a televised address that ""the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement."" That was despite a series of devastating Israeli attacks on Hezbollah leaders and members in recent weeks.

The Lebanese army had moved back from some checkpoints at the southern border with Israel amid intense artillery shelling by Israeli forces. A Lebanese army official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR this was a ""redeployment"" from forward positions vulnerable to an Israeli incursion.

A White House official told NPR the U.S. supports the incursion but is warning Israel about ""mission creep."" The Israeli ambassador to the U.S. told Israeli public radio the U.S. has not restricted the duration of Israel's incursion but that it is concerned about a regional escalation.

A senior U.S. official told NPR that the Pentagon will send a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East, focused on air defense capabilities.

The Israeli offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli strikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people in less than two weeks and forced many to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing leader Hassan Nasrallah and several top officials, but they have also killed many civilians.

Israel and Hezbollah began trading attacks back and forth across the Israel-Lebanon border after the Oct. 7 assault on Israel led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In support of Hamas, Hezbollah says it will continue firing rockets into northern Israel until there's a cease-fire in Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

Israeli officials say that the goal of this incursion is to push Hezbollah back from the border, to create what they call a ""buffer zone."" Israel says it will keep targeting Hezbollah until Israeli residents can safely return to their homes in northern Israel after fleeing attacks from militants on the Lebanese side of the border.

The Israeli military is now engaged in warfare on multiple fronts. Israel's operation in Gaza continues with deadly strikes. On Sunday, Israel's military said it sent dozens of fighter jets more than 1,000 miles away to Yemen, where it said it bombed power plants and a seaport used by the Houthis to import oil for military purposes. The Houthis said the areas hit were civilian targets and that at least four people were killed and dozens wounded in the Israeli strikes.

Israeli security analysts said Israel's bombing campaign in Yemen was a message to Iran, showing Israel's long-range flight capability as a tacit warning to Iran that it, too, was within Israel's reach.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning Monday to Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas: ""There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.""

On Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israel's defense minister about the ""serious consequences for Iran"" if it launched a strike against Israel. The U.S. is concerned about Iran-backed groups threatening U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria as the conflict between Israel and Iran-backed groups intensifies. Defense secretary Austin said the U.S. supports Israel dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure along the Lebanon Israel border so Hezbollah cannot threaten Israeli border towns. But he called on Israel to ultimately pivot to diplomacy."
State Department diplomat worked on project claiming Hezbollah's aim is to 'achieve social justice',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/state-department-diplomat-previously-wrote-puff-pieces-on-radical-islamic-terrorists-social-justice,2024-10-01T09:23:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A U.S. State Department diplomat was previously involved in a project spotlighting influential figures in the Middle East, which included descriptions of some designated terrorists as individuals aiming to achieve ""social justice.""

Usra Ghazi is a foreign service officer, who got her first stint in the department during the Obama administration in 2015, briefly leaving in 2018. She returned again in 2019 as a diplomat.

The State Department's security clearance process for this role is rigorous; Fox News Digital asked the State Department how Ghazi's process went. ""Due to privacy considerations, the Department cannot provide any information regarding any current or former employees' security clearance,"" they said in a statement, which also confirmed she is currently an employee.

From 2009-2010, Ghazi edited and prepared two of the first editions of a textbook publication called ""The 500 Most Influential Muslims."" The text harshly criticizes attempts to reform traditional Islam, calling modernism ""an object of derision and ridicule [that] is scorned by traditional Muslims and fundamentalists alike.""

STATE DEPARTMENT MANDATES SUPPORT FOR DEI IDEOLOGY AS PREREQUISITE FOR PROMOTIONS: 'YOU ARE JUDGED'

Ghazi worked on the textbook while she studied abroad in Amman, Jordan, at the ""Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre"" from 2009-2010, according to her LinkedIn.

Ghazi went abroad as a participant in an international exchange program sponsored by the Clinton Global Initaitive and the office of Queen Rania of Jordan.

The academic work at times used soft language surrounding America-hating terrorists, like Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

The publication Ghazi worked on described the terror group Hezbollah as a ""social justice"" movement and an ""International Symbol of Resistance Against Israel,"" according to the publication.

""Hezbollah is a Shi'a Islamic political party and paramilitary organization based in Lebanon. Hezbollah's ideology is based on seeking social justice through Islamic ideals,"" the publication spotlighting the influence of Hassan Nasrallah said.

The long-time Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed last week in an Israeli airstrike.

""Political and military successes have made Nasrallah a vastly influential figure in Lebanon, and in the Middle East more broadly. Nasrallah and Hezbollah are also controversial; the US and Canada list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization,"" the description continued.

It then went on to tout Hezbollah's social justice mission.

""Israel remains a key issue for the Muslim world and Hezbollah's aim to achieve social justice there is central to its activities,"" the text said.

""Hezbollah has also won significant grassroots support by cultivating a social welfare system that provides schools, clinics, and housing in the predominantly Shi'a parts of Lebanon, and also in others. These welfare activities are run with efficiency and rival those carried out by the state, giving the organization even broader appeal,"" it continued.

The State Department said its position on Hezbollah was ""quite clear"" and referred Fox News Digital to Monday's State Department briefing, where spokesperson Matt Miller condemned the group as a terrorist organization and stressed Israel's right to defend itself.

PENTAGON EQUITY CHIEF PRAISES BOOK CALLING 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS 'MENACES' AS SHE PUSHES FOR 'REVOLUTION'

The 2009 edition of ""500 Most Influential Muslims"" spotlighted Khaled Mashaal, describing him as one of the most prominent leaders of Hamas, as a ""Fighter for Social Justice"" and ""Pioneer."" The blurb did mention, as the one noted above, that the U.S. considers Hamas a terrorist organization.

""Since becoming head of Hamas, Mashaal has seen the organization through multiple attempts at a roadmap to peace and a major Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip,"" it said.

""Mashaal has been recognized for his persistence with Hamas's efforts -- at present leading in exile from Syria. His determination is combined with a unique effort at diplomacy,"" it said. ""Mashaal has been one of the most direct, and candid leaders in dialogue and confrontation with Israel and this has garnered international recognition.""

In addition to working at the State Department, Ghazi is currently involved in ""America Indivisible"" as a senior adviser, according to her LinkedIn. She was previously its director from 2018-2019. America Indivisible currently promotes its publication from 2020 on its site, recommending that people read ""credible sources"" like ""MuslimGirl"" in order to combat religious intolerance.

MuslimGirl's objective is to draw awareness ""to the Qur'an's message of gender equality and Islam's principle of peace,"" according to the website's description.

Fox News Digital's previous review of MuslimGirl found that it was filled with articles containing pro-Palestinian propaganda from 2016 to the present.

NEW STATE DEPARTMENT DIVERSITY CHIEF BELIEVES US IS A 'FAILED HISTORIC MODEL' WITH A 'COLONIZING PAST'

For example, one week after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, MuslimGirl published an article which said, ""Was it plausible to believe that [the Palestinians] would remain passive forever?""

The piece also questioned whether associating Hamas with terrorism was political.

""The term 'terrorist'... warrants careful consideration,"" the article said. ""How... can this label be applied to those defending their homeland...""

""MuslimGirl Staff"" published an article in May 2021 that said that evangelical Christians were a ""threat,"" while also claiming that evangelicals are more dangerous to Jews than Palestinians.

Fox News Digital contacted the State Department for comment in March asking questions about Ghazi's affiliation with America Indivisible, particularly given its recommendation of MuslimGirl. In the months that followed, Ghazi had not changed her public affiliation with America Indivisible."
Morning Glory: Israel unbound,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-israel-unbound,2024-10-01T09:20:06Z,"'Special Report' panelists discuss the latest presidential polling in key battleground states as Election Day inches closer.

When Israeli Prime Minister visited the United States at the invitation of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) this past summer, the Congressional leaders intended the visit to be a gesture of support for our embattled ally.

But Vice President Harris, who ought to have presided at the joint session of Congress in her role as President of the Senate along with Speaker Johnson -- with both seated behind Netanyahu -- instead skipped the Israeli PM's address to the joint session of Congress on July 24. Harris thus sent a very public message to her supporters -- she did not care to reschedule previous commitments though Netanyahu's visit was long in planning -- and then met with Netanyahu privately as did President Biden.

Whatever the President and Vice President said to the Prime Minister after what the Vice President did by way of very visible messaging, Netanyahu embraced a different strategy for Israel after his return to Jerusalem. Two months later, when Netanyahu returned to the states to deliver a fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, that new strategy had already rolled out in large part in the region, though it is crescendoing still.

First, Israel took the war everywhere in Gaza, and Hamas is all but obliterated as an organized fighting force though 101 hostages remain in the terrorists' tunnel network and the condition of Yahya Sinwar is unknown. Sinwar's military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an Israeli air raid in southern Gaza on July 13, though that news was not confirmed until after Netanyahu's visit to Congress.

Not long after Netanyahu's return to Israel, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated on July 31 along with his personal bodyguard while in the Iran's capital of Tehran.

Fuad Shukr, a senior commander in Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was killed by the Israeli Air Force a day earlier, on July 30. Hezbollah's top military commander thereafter, Ibrahim Aqil, and 10 other senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite ""Radwan Force"" -- structured as special operation forces trained to invade Israel and hold terriroty -- were killed in an air strike on September 20.

On September 28 the leader of Hezbollah, its ""Secretary General"" for four decades, Hassan Nasrallah, and at least 10 other senior members of the terror organization were killed in a massive Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Among the dead was also at least one senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iranian state media confirmed General Abbas Nilforoushan, 58, had been at the doomed conference in Nasrallah's underground bunker.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

In the middle of these strikes at all of the senior terror leadership in Lebanon, hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah terrorists and their accomplices in Lebanon were killed or wounded in the beeper and walkie-talkie attack that astonished the world. (Israel has not claimed responsibility for this attack.)

Over the weekend, strikes continued on the remaining senior leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and other terror groups and a second round of punishing air strikes on significant assets in Yemen were conducted by the Israeli Air Force in reprisals for that country's ruling terrorists attacks on Israeli via ballistic missiles.

There were also reports on Monday that the Israeli special forces had been conducting raids in southern Lebanon, including inside of Hezbollah's vast tunnel network, in preparation for ground operations to secure northern Israel from the threat of ongoing attacks against the Jewish State which began on October 8th, the day after the barbaric Hamas massacre of 1,200 inside the southern border of Israel (and the kidnapping of 250 more, more than a hundred of whom have been rescued or released via negotiations last fall.) A desperate and disorganized Hamas seems incapable of even responding to proposals for hostage exchanges and the IDF is going about methodically destroying Gaza's 500 miles of terrorist tunnels.

Netanyahu and his governing coalition got stronger this weekend as a former ally turned rival became an ally again as Gideon Saar brought his ""New Hope"" party into the governing coalition led by Netanyahu and his Likud party.

What this week and the next four that follow right up to the United States presidential election will bring in Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and the entire region is unknown, but what is clear is that Israel does not feel in the least constrained by President Biden and his team and their mantra of ""de-escalation.""

Israel tried every tactic requested by the United States, did its best to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage deal, and was repeatedly spurned by the terrorists in Gaza. (The consequences of the U.S.-enforced delays will be assessed after the wars conclude.) Though Vice President Harris had ""studied the maps"" of Rafah and publicly concluded that Israel could not evacuate the more than a million Palestinians taking refuge there, Israel in fact did just that, and without loss of innocent life save those of the soldiers of the IDF killed in the Rafah operations and six hostages Hamas terrorists ruthlessly executed, including an American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

At the same time as the Gaza War intensified, Israel hammered Iran's other proxies in Lebanon and Yemen, both of which -- Hezbollah and the Houthis -- had kept up a barrage of rocket, drone and missile strikes on the Jewish State.

After Netanyahu's visit to the Congress and his snub by the possible next president, it seems clear he returned to Israel resolved to prosecute Israel's seven front war on his terms, not those of the United States, which itself continues to be subject to missile and drone barrages against its fleet and land forces in the region and to reply only intermittently. Nothing the United States has done can compare with Israel's withering counter-attacks. Israel is restoring deterrence in the region and Iran, which threatened to strike back against Israel, has not yet attempted a reprise of its direct assault on Israel in April.

Whatever Biden and Harris and all their senior officials intended Israel to do, unless they recommended Netanyahu do all of the above, then Israel has shrugged off the demands made of it by the appeasement-driven Biden-Harris administration.

Perhaps Netanyahu is simply unwilling to risk what are widely expected to be the anti-Israel policies of Harris should she win. Perhaps he took the measure of President Biden and concluded the American Commander-on-Chief is spent and not really in command at all.

Correlation is, of course, not causation. But whatever Biden and Harris said to Netanyahu in July, unless it was ""Go get them,"" the Israeli Prime Minister has decided to protect his people and not his friendships with the clueless foreign policy blob inside the Beltway."
"Hezbollah terrorists engaged in sex slavery, rape, mass murder of Syrians",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-terrorists-engaged-sex-slavery-rape-mass-murder-syrians,2024-10-01T08:07:05Z,"JERUSALEM -- Photos of Syrians celebrating the assassination of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah last week put the spotlight on the brutal activities of the terror group's role in sex slavery, mass starvation and kidnappings in the Syrian civil war which led to the deaths of over half a million Syrians.

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Israel's targeted assassination of Nasrallah last weekend has prompted greater interest in the inner workings of the Shiite terrorist organization that is widely considered the de facto ruler over Lebanon.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist entity is mainly known in America for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people in 1983, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut also in 1983, resulting in the murders of 241 U.S. military personnel.

A new investigative video series by the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) shines a rare light on the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah's role in sexual slavery, rape and mass murder. The shocking expose about Hezbollah's enslavement of a Syrian woman aired days after Israel reportedly launched devastating explosions of pagers held by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon in September.

CPC President Joseph Braude told Fox News Digital ""Hezbollah's war on Israel obscures its larger war to subjugate much of the region -- as a tyrant in Lebanon, an occupier in Syria, a mafia of sex and drug trafficking, and the nerve center of Iran's Arab empire. Millions of Arabs whose lives have been shattered by the militia want a different future. Hezbollah does not want the world to hear their voices.""

CPC's previous series, called ""Whispered in Gaza,"" which was viewed over 20 million times, led to a Fatwa being issued against Hamas by Iraqi and Pakistani clerics. It was used by Gaza anti-Hamas activists during the July 2023 street protests against the terror organization's rule.

He added ""'Hezbollah's Hostages,' an eight-part series produced by the Center for Peace Communications and presented by The Free Press, features the actual recorded testimony of Lebanese and Syrian civilians in Hezbollah's grip. To protect their identities and honor their lives, each recorded interview is accompanied visually by creative images and animation.""

One video depicts the kidnapping and sexual enslavement of Alya, a married 20-year-old woman from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. She reveals how Yusuf, a member of Hezbollah, ""stalked"" her for months and eventually took her hostage.

Hezbollah took the side of the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad after civilians launched a protest movement in 2011 to secure democracy in the highly repressive nation.

Hezbollah terrorists aided Assad in his scorched-earth campaign to wipe out opposition to his regime, resulting in the killing of over 500,000 people. Syria is now a fragmented and war-ravaged country.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Hezbollah's ally, the Sunni terrorist movement Hamas, engaged in rapes and sustained sexual assaults of Israeli women and men after the jihadi terrorist organization invaded Israel on Oct. 7.

Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel on Oct. 8 when it launched rockets into northern Israel. Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7, including over 30 Americans.

The fundamental corruption and mafia-style criminality of Hezbollah's global organization has been examined by Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute.

He published a 2018 report on ""Hezbollah's Corruption Crisis Runs Deep."" Levitt noted that ""some prominent figures in Hezbollah are involved in horrific criminal enterprises, including trafficking in sex and human beings."" He cited the example of Hezbollah official Ali Hussein Zeaiter, who according to media reports, was linked to ""a large prostitution network, mainly employing Syrian women.""

Hezbollah's criminal enterprise and terrorism continue to impact Americans.

HOW LEBANON'S HEZBOLLAH GROUP BECAME A CRITICAL PLAYER IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Zoya Fakhoury, executive director of the Amer Foundation, told Fox News Digital that ""Hezbollah is a proxy group of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that has the blood of thousands of innocent individuals, including American citizens, on their hands. The death of Hassan Nasrallah is a significant step towards accountability for many individuals but particularly for my family. My father, Amer Fakhoury, was a former U.S. hostage unlawfully detained under direct orders from Hassan Nasrallah.""

She continued, ""He was used a political pawn by Hezbollah and died because of the torture he faced in Lebanon. We hope to see the Lebanese government take this opportunity of the dismantling of Hezbollah to free Lebanon from the occupation of the Islamic Republic and work towards a path of peace.""

In August, Fox News Digital reported the new book by Fakhoury's four daughters covering a first-hand account of his detainment and the harrowing rescue operation to bring him back home to the United States in their book, ""Silenced in Beirut: American Businessman Amer Fakhour's Six-Month Ordeal as a Hostage In Lebanon.""

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Phares, who has advised U.S. presidential candidates on Mideast foreign policy, said the Hezbollah jihadis defend their hostage taking of women as under Islamist Sharia law that they can take women from the ""enemy camp.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He said there is no doubt that if Hezbollah captured Israeli women, they would treat them the same way as the enslaved Syrian women. Phares added that if Hezbollah captured a kibbutz, village or town in Israel, one ""can expect that they will kill the males and the capture the women. Some would be raped and killed and other Israeli women would be kept by Hezbollah.""

Hezbollah is not different from the Islamic state in applying jihadi ideology, said Phares. Hezbollah ""is a global threat. Look at how they treat their own women and how they separate them and organize them in the service of jihadists.""

Braude said that ""'Hezbollah's Hostages' debuted on Sept. 16, one day before pagers exploded across Lebanon. A new episode debuts every Monday through Nov. 4. In forthcoming episodes, we will probe the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh, just outside Beirut, with help from Shi'ite civilians who live there.""

He added ""Dahiyeh is the shadow capital of Lebanon -- home of Hezbollah's intelligence apparatus, politburo, and prisons -- as well as the central node to all Iran's proxies in the region, from the Houthis of Yemen to Iraq's militias to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Yet the same landscape is also home to some of Hezbollah's many opponents - and in later episodes, we meet them too: Shiite veterans of the countrywide 2019 street protests, who dared to demand a different future; civic activists striving to end the war on Israel, liberate young minds, and restore the rule of law in Lebanon."""
Pennsylvania deadlock: Why Kamala picked the wrong running mate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/shows/media-buzz/pennsylvania-deadlock-why-kamala-picked-wrong-running-mate,2024-10-01T07:07:51Z,"Harris 2024 senior adviser Ian Sams reacts to reports Tim Walz is 'nervous' about the vice presidential debate and discusses VP Kamala Harris' stance on the looming port strike on 'The Story.'

If Kamala Harris loses Pennsylvania, Donald Trump is the 47th President of the United States.

Now you could say the same about Michigan or Wisconsin, but it especially seems that a Democratic candidate should be able to carry the Keystone State.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN 'UNDERWATER' IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE, DEM REP WARNS DONORS

And that's why, in my view, Kamala should have picked Josh Shapiro, its popular governor.

I have nothing against Tim Walz, of football coach fame, but I don't see what he's done for the ticket. There's a reason the campaign hasn't let him do any solo interviews - a stark contrast with JD Vance, who is constantly doing interviews and holding press conferences.

In fact, Vance now frequently takes reporters' questions in front of supporters, who boo the journalists, sometimes even before they start speaking.

We'll find out whether Walz can think on his feet when he faces off against Vance in tonight's VP debate. The most generous thing I can say is that the Coach will be rusty.

Let's look at the latest numbers.

The Real Clear Politics average has Trump leading Harris by a miniscule margin, 48.1% to 47.9%, which of course is a statistical tie.

At 538, the micro-margin in Pennsylvania is flipped, with Harris averaging 47.9% and Trump at 47.1%, another tie.

Now imagine that Shapiro, who is more of a moderate liberal than the uber-progressive Walz, was the running mate. And let's say Shapiro had brought in another 50,000 votes as the home-state guy. You can see where that would tip the balance.

Kamala didn't pick Josh for two reasons. They had a rough conversation when she interviewed him, with the governor insisting on an influential role if he were to relinquish his current job. But so what? Presidents and their veeps often don't see eye to eye. She preferred the image of Walz, hunter and fisherman, to the prospect of two East Coast lawyers.

But the more important reason is more troubling. Harris was under pressure from the anti-Israel faction in her party not to tap Shapiro, who is Jewish and a strong supporter of the Jewish state.

So the vice president effectively handed veto power to this minority faction, which basically backs the Hamas terrorists who would wipe out Israel, and would have faced a week or two of controversy as a result. I said at the time this would be a world-class mistake if she lost Pennsylvania.

The reason Harris has spent so much time in the Pittsburgh area is that the western end of the state is much more conservative than the eastern section anchored by Philadelphia. Her goal is to hold down Trump's margin in a part of the state that he'll easily win.

KAMALA HARRIS IS GETTING 'OUTHUSTLED' AND 'OUTCLASSED': JESSE WATTERS

One problem Harris faces right now is that she makes little news. By picking ""friendly"" interviewers, such as MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who has trashed Trump as a danger to democracy, she avoids tough questions and followups.

Visiting the Mexican border was a smart move, not just because Trump has a major lead on immigration, but because Harris broke into the news cycle, where images can count more than words, and attempted to position herself as tougher than Joe Biden on the issue.

Otherwise, I'm just hearing chunks of her stump speech in response to questions, starting with how her mother raised her. Repetition is important in politics, but if you don't throw in a few new lines, the press is left without a headline.

Meanwhile, Trump over the weekend called Harris ""mentally impaired,"" saying Biden just got old but she was born that way. He also said Harris should be impeached, and maybe prosecuted, for the way she helped run the country.

Now that is classic Trump. By using over-the-top rhetoric, he sparks a media debate about whether he's gone too far, and that debate revolves around the words ""Kamala"" and ""mentally impaired.""

IN HYPERPARTISAN ENVIRONMENT, MSNBC DRAWING FIRE FOR ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-HARRIS PROGRAMMING

Harris has wisely not responded to every Trump jab. But remember, Trump benefits from negative coverage as much as positive coverage because he's driving the news agenda.

Here's a pool report from Harris at a West Coast political event over the weekend: ""She then switched her remarks to talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. VP Harris remarks on the issue were very similar to her remarks in Arizona on Friday."" In other words, no news.

Think about this: Trump has been absolutely pummeled by a hostile press corps, is a twice-impeached convicted felon and carries the burden of Jan. 6. Harris has been riding an extraordinary wave of positive press, and yet she's slipped slightly in the polls and is tied in Pennsylvania.

And there's no question that if she loses there, the election is over."
Pentagon sending a 'few thousand' personnel to Middle East day after Biden said he wouldn't add combat troops,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-sending-few-thousand-us-troops-middle-east-one-day-after-biden-promised-he-wouldnt,2024-10-01T02:00:03Z,"DOD spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Monday the additional troops are to augment U.S. forces already there on heightened alert.

The Pentagon announced on Monday that it is sending a ""few thousand"" U.S. personnel to the Middle East to support Air Force squadrons a day after President Biden vowed not to send combat troops to the region.

Speaking at a press gaggle with reporters on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the U.S. was sending a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel, if needed.

Biden gave a firm ""no"" when asked Sunday if he planned to deploy additional combat troops to the Middle East.

This increased presence is to include multiple warplane squadrons, complimenting the F-15s, F-16s, A-10s and F-22s already stationed in the region.

ISRAEL WILL LAUNCH 'LIMITED' GROUND INVASION IN LEBANON 'IMMINENTLY' US OFFICIAL SAYS

The planes were initially supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons stationed there. Instead, both the current and new squadrons are to remain in place to double the available airpower because of increased tensions in the region and concern that Iran might respond to Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader last week in Lebanon.

Singh said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ""increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies. And DOD (Department of Defense) maintains robust and integrated air-defense capabilities across the Middle East, ensuring the protection of U.S. forces operating in the region.""

The few thousand additional personnel are not combat troops but rather maintenance crews and those who can help with the air defense mission and refueling. The additional forces would raise the total number of U.S. personnel in the region to as many as 43,000.

The Pentagon's announcement follows word that Israel has already launched limited raids across its northern border into Lebanon amid an anticipated wider ground invasion.

It also follows recent strikes into Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist organization. Israel is also engaged in an ongoing war in the south against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian terrorist group sparked the conflict with its bloody incursion into southern Israel in October 2023.

Secretary Austin announced Sunday he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. A U.S. official said the extension would be for about a month.

HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT WILL CHOOSE NASRALLAH'S SUCCESSOR 'AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY'

A second U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, sailed from Virginia last week and is en route to Europe. It will head to the Mediterranean Sea and again provide a two-carrier presence in the broader region. It's not expected to arrive for at least another week.

Biden told reporters on Monday, ""I'm more aware than you might know"" about reports that Israel is planning a limited ground campaign in Lebanon after nearly a year of trading attacks with Hezbollah in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, and he said he wants an immediate cease-fire.

On Sept. 16, Israel's Security Cabinet updated its objectives of war to include ""returning the residents of the north securely to their homes,"" and warned it would continue to act to achieve the goal. Around 60,000 residents of northern Israel communities have been displaced following Lebanon-based Hezbollah attacks that began on Oct. 8, 2023, one day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and have continued since, The New York Times reported. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the only way to achieve the goal was ""via military action,"" NBC News reported.

President Joe Biden said earlier Monday he was ""more aware than you might know"" of Israel's plans to launch a ground operation, and said he's ""comfortable with them stopping,"" calling for a cease-fire. The Biden administration had been discouraging Israel from invading Lebanon, Axios reported, and has privately expressed concern that doing so could increase support for Hezbollah among Lebanese people.

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated recently, leading to heightened concerns about the war expanding into a broader Middle East conflict. Israel has spent recent weeks targeting southern Lebanon and Beirut, attempting to ""strike and eliminate"" Hezbollah leadership. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has launched strikes into Israel. Israel recently blew up pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, injuring thousands of people and killing at least 32, and increased its bombings and strikes in Lebanon. The U.S. has warned Israel against escalating its fighting in Lebanon, though State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday the U.S. was aware of Israel's ""limited operations"" and he said ""military pressure can at times enable diplomacy."" Miller said the U.S. still supports a cease-fire, and a 21-day cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah that was presented last week is still on the table.

On Saturday, the IDF announced it killed Hezbollah's longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was ""not just another terrorist, he was the terrorist."" On Sunday, the IDF announced the death of Nabil Kaouk, commander of Hezbollah's preventative security unit, whose death marked the seventh death of a Hezbollah leader in a little more than a week, the Associated Press reported."
Israel's ground invasion into Lebanon imminent as cabinet approves next phase of the war,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-ground-invasion-lebanon-imminent-cabinet-approves-next-phase-war,2024-09-30T23:00:33Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The international community is bracing for Israel's imminent invasion into southern Lebanon, as troops from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are expected to step foot into the country on Tuesday morning.

A senior U.S. official confirmed the invasion plans to Fox News on Monday. It is believed that the ground campaign will be smaller in scale than the 2006 operation Israel conducted in its war with Hezbollah, and is also expected to last a shorter period of time.

The ministers of Israel's political security cabinet approved the next phase of the operation in Lebanon, according to the Jerusalem Post, but it is unclear when the incursion will begin. Israel launched strikes into Lebanon on Monday night into Tuesday morning, but the ground invasion had not begun as of 1:30 a.m. local time.

Following the confirmation of an imminent Israeli invasion on Monday afternoon, the Pentagon told reporters that it is sending a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East to augment U.S. forces already there on heightened alert - just one day after President Biden said he would not deploy more troops to the region.

PENTAGON SENDS MORE TROOPS TO THE MIDDLE EAST AMID CONFLICT

Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters the increased presence will come from new troop deployments as well as by extending the deployment of fighter jet squadrons previously set to be replaced.

The fighter jet squadrons of F-15 Strike Eagles, F-16, A-10 and F-22 fighter jets will now remain in the Middle East, though the Pentagon did not detail for how long.

Singh said the increased force presence is not in support of a potential evacuation.

""They are there for the protection of U.S. forces, and they are there, should they be needed, for the defense of Israel,"" she added.

Israel's top commander on Monday once again hinted that Jerusalem was readying its troops for a campaign in southern Lebanon.

""In order to ensure the return of Israel's northern communities, we will employ all of our capabilities, and this includes you,"" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers in the Israel Defense Force positioned on the border with Lebanon.

Gallant told the troops that the Friday killing of Hezbollah's top leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the terrorist organization for more than 30 years, was ""an important step, but it is not the final one.""

""We trust you to accomplish every mission at hand,"" Gallant added.

ISRAELI STRIKE KILLS HAMAS COMMANDER IN LEBANON, 3 PALESTINIAN MILITANT LEADERS KILLED IN SEPARATE STRIKE

The world first braced for an Israeli invasion into Lebanon last week when Israeli security officials moved reservist forces to the north and advised troops there to be ""prepared.""

Though no official order for a ground invasion has been given by Jerusalem, Israel has over the last week carried out a significant aerial campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon, as well as targeted strikes in Beirut.

Biden on Monday responded to questions by reporters regarding the ""limited"" invasion and said, ""I'm more aware than you might know.""

When asked if he was comfortable with the operational plans, he said, ""I'm comfortable with them stopping. We should have a ceasefire now.""

Special forces have also allegedly been carrying out small raids in southern Lebanon over the ""past months"" using tunnels constructed by Hezbollah but seized by Israel during Operation Northern Shield, which began in 2018.

The tunnels, which were made with the backing of Iran and assistance from North Korea, connect southern Lebanon to northern Israel.

BIDEN SAYS HE WILL TALK TO NETANYAHU AS ISRAEL PUMMELS SUNNI TERROR TARGETS IN BEIRUT

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal on Monday, unnamed sources said these ""targeted"" raids have been carried out in order to collect intelligence on Hezbollah as well as to damage the group's ability to attack Israel.

Israeli officials have said the intended goal of these increased attacks against the terrorist group, is to ensure the safe return of some 60,000 residents who have fled the northern border out of concern that an Oct. 7-style attack could be repeated.

As fighting in the area has increased and the ambiguity surrounding what Hezbollah and Iran's response could be to the killing of Nasrallah, it remains unclear when Jerusalem believes these residents will be able to actually return to their homes.

""Our goal is to ensure the [safe] return of Israel's northern communities to their homes,"" Gallant told Israeli troops on Monday, according to a statement provided to Fox News Digital by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. ""We are prepared to make every effort necessary to accomplish this mission.

Trey Yingst: Redefining War Correspondence In The Digital Age,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/09/30/trey-yingst-redefining-war-correspondence-in-the-digital-age/,2024-09-30T20:59:45Z,"In an era where traditional media is rapidly evolving, Trey Yingst stands out as a trailblazer, redefining the role of a foreign correspondent for the digital age. As the chief foreign correspondent for Fox News, Yingst has not only excelled in conventional reporting but has also emerged as a pioneer in leveraging social media to deliver real-time, impactful journalism to a global audience.

The Journey to Fox News

Yingst's journey into journalism began during his college years at American University in Washington, D.C. In 2016, while still a student, he co-founded a company called ""News to Share,"" which allowed him to report from conflict zones around the world. This early experience sparked a passion that would define his career.

""This was my first taste of international journalism,"" Yingst recalls. ""I traveled all over the world, from Ukraine to Gaza to Sub-Saharan Africa. This is when I think my passion was really sparked for what I'm doing today.""

Now, a decade later, Yingst finds himself at the pinnacle of his field, serving as the chief foreign correspondent for Fox News. His role involves leading all foreign coverage for the network, not just from the Middle East but also from hotspots like Afghanistan, Ukraine, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iraq.

Embracing Social Media in Journalism

What sets Yingst apart is his innovative approach to using social media platforms as an extension of his reporting. Recognizing the changing habits of news consumers, particularly younger audiences, Yingst has adapted his journalistic style to meet viewers where they are - on their phones and social media feeds.

""You know, there are millions of people who want to watch on TV, and they have cable, and each day or night they sit down and they sit in front of their TV and watch the news,"" Yingst explains. ""A new generation of people, they're consuming news in a different way. They're consuming it on social media. They're consuming it on their phones, on the go.""

To cater to this evolving audience, Yingst uses a variety of platforms including TikTok, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook. He tailors his content to each platform, ensuring that his reporting reaches the widest possible audience in the most engaging formats.

Innovative Content Formats

Yingst's social media strategy involves a mix of different content types, each designed to give viewers a unique perspective on the stories he covers:

1. Selfie Videos: These short, personal videos allow viewers to feel as if they're on the ground with Yingst. He recalls a viral TikTok video of him riding in the back of a pickup truck with the Taliban, which resonated strongly with younger audiences who hadn't seen this type of raw, immediate reporting before.

2. Raw Footage: On platforms like Instagram, Yingst shares unedited video from the field, such as rockets being intercepted or scenes of destruction in Gaza. This gives viewers an unfiltered look at the realities of conflict zones.

3. Real-Time Text Updates: On X, Yingst provides rapid-fire text updates, taking advantage of the platform's features to bold or italicize key information. This creates a newsletter-like experience for followers seeking the latest developments.

4. Photography: Through his Instagram page ""Experience Humans"" Yingst shares powerful still images that humanize the individuals caught in conflicts, fostering empathy and understanding among his audience.

Ethical Considerations in Real-Time Reporting

With the immediacy of social media comes heightened responsibility. Yingst is acutely aware of the ethical considerations in reporting from conflict zones and sharing potentially sensitive content in real-time.

""For me, ethics is of the utmost importance,"" Yingst emphasizes. ""When we're covering an active war zone where things are changing very quickly, you have civilians involved. Oftentimes people are killed or injured in front of you, and so you have to think about that as you are reporting.""

Yingst maintains a strict policy of aligning his social media journalism with the high standards of television reporting. He's transparent with his audience about the information he chooses to withhold for ethical reasons and provides content warnings when sharing graphic or potentially disturbing material.

""Black Saturday"": A Journalistic Milestone

Yingst's commitment to comprehensive, balanced reporting is perhaps best exemplified in his new book, ""Black Saturday."" The book provides an in-depth account of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and the subsequent war, offering perspectives from all sides of the conflict.

""Black Saturday is the gold standard in journalism about the October 7 massacre, Black Saturday and the war that followed,"" Yingst states. ""It is a book like no other, because it takes the reader into that day, not just from the perspective of my team on the ground in southern Israel as the attack is unfolding, but you also hear firsthand accounts from police officers, from soldiers, from survivors, from hostages who were taken from their homes and dragged into Gaza and then later released as part of the November ceasefire deal.""

The book also includes accounts from Palestinian civilians, doctors, journalists, and Hamas officials, providing a 360-degree view of the conflict. This approach aligns with Yingst's commitment to objective, informative journalism that follows in the footsteps of industry greats like Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite.

The Mental and Physical Toll of War Reporting

""Black Saturday"" also touches on an often-overlooked aspect of war correspondence: the mental health challenges faced by reporters in conflict zones. Yingst is candid about the difficulties of processing the traumatic events witnessed in the field while maintaining professional composure and meeting the demands of real-time reporting.

To cope with these challenges, Yingst emphasizes the importance of preparation. ""I am a big believer in preparing mentally and physically for war during times of peace,"" he says. His regimen includes daily gym visits, running, meditation, a healthy diet, and practices like cold exposure to maintain mental discipline.

The Future of Journalism

Yingst's approach to journalism represents a new paradigm in news reporting. By combining traditional journalistic values with innovative use of social media, he's creating a model for how reporters can engage with audiences in the digital age.

""I think you'll continue to see a shift in the industry as a whole, as social media gets more and more popular in the way that people consume videos changes,"" Yingst predicts. He envisions a future where audiences can curate their news diet across various platforms, from traditional TV broadcasts to streaming services and social media updates.

For aspiring journalists looking to follow in his footsteps, Yingst offers two key pieces of advice: set a long-term goal and put in consistent, disciplined work. ""Understand that I didn't have more than 400,000 X followers overnight. I've been on X for more than 10 years,"" he says, emphasizing the importance of persistence and hard work in building a following and credibility as a journalist.

As the media landscape continues to evolve, Trey Yingst stands as a prime example of how traditional journalism can adapt and thrive in the digital age. His innovative approach to reporting, commitment to ethical standards, and ability to connect with audiences across multiple platforms make him a true pioneer in the field of modern journalism."
Israel-Hezbollah Fight Offers A Chance To Reset The Region's Balance,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melikkaylan/2024/09/30/israel-hezbollah-fight-offers-a-chance-to-reset-the-regions-balance/,2024-09-30T19:42:36Z,"In the previous installment dated September 25, this column discussed the repercussions of Israel's hammering of Hezbollah on the stability of Lebanon as a whole. In other words, the column outlined the chance of a renewed Lebanese civil war as a result of Shiite refugees flooding other neighborhoods that didn't want them - notably Druze and Maronite Christian areas. But the column's main argument centered around a positive outcome: a major shake-up in which Lebanon could rid itself of domination by Hezbollah and Iran, something many Lebanese (including many Lebanese Shiites) would quietly welcome. At the time of writing, Nasrallah was still alive.

Some parts of that column, with a brief foray into Lebanese civil war (1975 - 1990) history, also discussed the wider regional implications of a Hezbollah collapse in the present. The fact is the US and the West accepted the ultimate control over Lebanon by anti-Western rivals - Syria/Iran - in exchange for stability in the Middle East, a strategic, oil-producing region. But times have changed. Energy-wise the US has become effectively self-sufficient. It has no pressing need for Mideast oil. Therefore no urgent motivation to accept stability in undesirable configurations. The other side of that coin is that the US has no particular reason for imposing peace or getting over-involved directly. And so, longterm, a vacuum obtains. At first glance, it seems nobody has the clout or incentive to co-ordinate a wholistic peace - not the US, not Moscow, not Tehran, not the Chinese.

For the West though, despite its reluctance, the opportunity may be too good to overlook - eventually. For now though, as the previous column noted, this moment offers Israel itself a rare chance to undertake a quiet diplomatic offensive alongside the military one so that conditions don't return to status quo in Lebanon where another war with Hezbollah will erupt anew in 15 or so years (the last one was in 2006). There are voices aplenty, not least in Israel itself, who argue that Netanyahu has no interest in carving out peace from chaos because conflict is keeping him in power. Maybe so, but conditions have never been so opportune and it may be his only chance for saving his reputation among the Israeli population after such a long war. And after the massive intelligence failure of October 7 that led to so much bloodshed.

Why are conditions uniquely opportune? Let us itemize. All the opposing forces are historically absent. The Soviet Union is gone. Russia is too distracted in Ukraine to play a spoiler role. Saddam is gone. Gaddafi is gone. Syria has fragmented and Assad's government remains barely functional. Iran keeps refusing the invitation to all-out war - largely because it knows that any pressure from outside will reinvigorate domestic rebellion and could collapse the regime. In effect, actively anti-Israel regional powers are weaker than ever before. Furthermore, the Sunni states roundabout would welcome any chance to disrupt Iran's hegemony.

We are talking about Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the like. Which is why the diplomacy must be conducted ultra-quietly. No such leaders in the current climate can openly participate in making peace with Israel after all their criticisms of Gaza. For that reason, the Abraham Accords lie in tatters - a despoliation very deliberately aimed at by Iran and Hamas via October 7. They and Russia were very sore at being left out by the Accords in shaping the region's future and crafted a way to turn things around. But the Middle East is a very hard-headed place. All the above Sunni countries' leaders, despite their public outrage over Gaza, will jump at the chance of creating a new regional order sans the domination of Iran - and participate in restoring the primacy of Sunni over Shia. Present popularity and a place in the history of Islam should prove sufficient incentive for each to grandstand as peacemakers and unifiers of the faithful.

So what's needed now is an expanded reconfigured version of the Accords in which additional Sunni countries, those with the capacity to do so like the above mentioned, share a stake in the stability of Gaza and Lebanon. American participation is unlikely to be a factor until after the US elections. Certainly, Israel cannot expect US help in any direct war with Iran until then at least, if at all. And Iran is unlikely to enter such a face-off for the reason cited above but also because its main ally Russia will discourage a distraction from the focus on Ukraine. (Moscow cannot afford Iran to be diverting its military resources - Shahed drones - en masse elsewhere.) So, the proxy wars will continiue. Sadly, we will likely see for the next few months Hezbollah and Lebanon enduring increased Israeli punishment, likely in the form of an extended invasion and incessant bombing. Syria and even parts of Yemen will taste the wrath of the Israeli war machine. In the meantime, Netanyahu will have a historic opening for rearranging the balance of power in the region with lasting security for Israel if he proceeds with a simultaneous diplomatic initiative."
"Pentagon plans to shrink US 'footprint' in Iraq, but declines to say by how much",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-plans-shrink-us-footprint-iraq-declines-say-how-much,2024-09-30T17:25:33Z,"National security analyst Rebecca Grant joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the attack on the U.S. airbase in Iraq and why she believes Biden is nearing war with Iran as tensions escalate.

The Pentagon has finalized plans to wrap up the U.S.-led mission to fight ISIS by next year, with many U.S. troops leaving the bases they have occupied for much of the past two decades.

The Biden administration insists their plan is not to fully pull out of the nation but declined to say how many of the 2,500 troops currently stationed in Iraq will remain.

""I think it's fair to say that, you know, our footprint is going to be changing within the country,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday.

The Iraqi government announced earlier this month it had reached a deal with the Biden administration to remove most U.S. troops from its nation over the next two years.

U.S. officials disputed characterizations of the plan as a withdrawal, prompting confusion about what the American presence there would look like over the coming months.

""I'd like to emphasize that this is an evolution of the military mission in Iraq,"" a senior Biden administration official said.

The current mission is now set to end by September 2025.

The notion of pulling troops out of Iraq has prompted concerns about a lack of support for the 900 troops currently stationed in Syria.

US, IRAQ TEAM UP TO KILL 15 ISIS OPERATIVES

""Not only will it undercut the fight against ISIS, but more importantly, in the effort to restrain Iran, forces in Iraq -- particularly in the Kurdish north -- are very important. We need Iraq forces in order to support our troops in northeast Syria,"" Ambassador James Jeffrey, former presidential envoy to the coalition to combat ISIS in Iraq, told Fox News Digital.

""We have a very effective ally there, the Kurds, the Syrian Kurds, that we want to not abandon,"" he went on, adding that a U.S. withdrawal would allow space for Russia and Iran to tighten their grip on the nation.

""At the end of the day, it's a decision of the Iraqi Government, and if the Iraqi government is being pressured by the Iranians, just as they were in 2011, and want us out, then we have no choice.""

Tehran and its influence have infiltrated the Iraqi government in a way that some say means a U.S. presence indirectly benefits Iran.

""With the current Iraqi government heavily influenced by Iranian-backed Shia factions, including the Popular Mobilization Front, maintaining U.S. troops doesn't effectively counterbalance Iran. In fact, our resources end up indirectly benefiting those aligned with Iranian interests, making this a misguided strategy,"" director of Concerned Veterans for America and Iraq War veteran Jason Beardsley told Fox News Digital.

""ISIS may be a challenge, but it's a challenge that the government of Iraq should be handling themselves.""

HARROWING FOOTAGE SHOWS US TROOPS BEING FIRED AT

Baghdad and Washington have ""reached an understanding"" that U.S. forces in Syria will be supported from a presence on the Iraqi side of the border through at least September 2026.

U.S. Central Command announced over the weekend that forces in Syria had conducted two targeted strikes in Syria that killed 37 terrorists, including leaders of ISIS and Huras al-Din, an al Qaeda affiliate.

U.S. forces in Iraq, Syria and Jordan have come under increased attacks since the eruption of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza nearly a year ago.

Three U.S. troops were killed by a drone attack in January at a U.S. base in Jordan supporting operations in Syria.

American forces have responded with periodic airstrikes in response, such as in July near Baghdad, which have drawn sharp rebuke from the Iraqi public.

Last month, seven U.S. troops were wounded in an operation to target ISIS in western Iraq.

At the same time, troops are planning to depart Iraq, elsewhere in the Middle East the U.S. military presence is growing. U.S. officials announced Monday a ""few thousand"" more troops would be added to the roughly 40,000 service members deployed in the region."

"Hamas leader killed in Lebanon was UN employee, agency confirms",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hamas-leader-killed-lebanon-un-employee-agency-confirms,2024-09-30T14:21:06Z,"Fox News' Nate Foy on IDF killing another Hamas leader and Iran vowing revenge for Hezbollah leader's death.

A U.N. human rights group confirmed Hamas' leader in Lebanon, who was recently killed by Israeli strikes, was their employee.

Fateh Sherif was killed Monday in an airstrike on the al-Bass refugee camp in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, along with his wife and children.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) noted that Sherif had been on suspension with the organization since March but had not been fired.

""Fateh Al Sharif was an UNRWA employee who was put on administrative leave without pay in March and was undergoing an investigation following allegations that UNRWA received about his political activities,"" an UNRWA spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

At the time, his suspension sparked widespread protests and strikes by teachers in Lebanon.

""Sherif was responsible for coordinating Hamas' terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives. He was also responsible for Hamas' efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons,"" the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) said in a joint statement.

""He led the Hamas terrorist organization's force build-up efforts in Lebanon and operated to advance Hamas' interests in Lebanon, both politically and militarily.""

Israel alleges UNRWA is overrun with terrorist sympathizers, a claim the agency denies.

Sherif was the principal of the UNRWA-run Deir Yassin Secondary School in al-Bass and head of the UNRWA teachers' union, which has around 2,000 teachers.

""Through that position, and as principal of a large UNRWA school, he was able to recruit operatives, and to brainwash generations of Palestinians to engage in terrorism,"" Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, told Fox News Digital.

Neuer and his organization had long pushed U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini to fire Sherif and said they provided both with a dossier proving his involvement in Hamas.

""Everyone at UNRWA knew. Yet they refused to act,"" Neuer said.

""Even as school principal al-Sharif openly incited terrorism on social media for over a decade, UNRWA did nothing. They failed to fire or even condemn their school principal for being a Hamas terror chief. Only this year, when there was intense scrutiny of UNRWA, did they finally slap him on the wrist with a suspension - while for months insisting that they were conducting 'an investigation.'""

The Sherif killing unfolded as another terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said three of its leaders were killed in an airstrike that hit the upper floor of an apartment building in Beirut, according to Reuters.

Israeli officials said Monday they will ""continue to operate against anyone who poses a threat to the civilians of the State of Israel.""

Israel over the past few days has expanded its attacks on Iran-backed militant groups in the region, also killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike over the weekend.

While it weighs a full-on ground offensive, the IDF has been launching small special forces operations in southern Lebanon.

An NPR investigation: A murder in Hebron,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/g-s1-17637/hebron-west-bank-israel-asylum-ahmad-abu-markhiya,2024-09-30T10:05:03Z,"Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence.

HEBRON, West Bank -- Around sunset on Oct. 5, 2022, two 24-year-old men drank tea on a terrace overlooking the hills of their ancient holy city. The evening ended with one of them decapitated and the other under arrest.

Palestinian law enforcement officers in Hebron, the largest Palestinian city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, say they have witnessed many crime scenes, but never one with a severed head. The city's historical core -- a militarized zone with Palestinians, Israeli settlers and the tomb of the patriarch Abraham, revered by them both -- has seen some of the ugliest violence and injustices of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but that was not this story.

Images of the crime scene quickly spread on social media, as did the suspect's last name. A mall and butcher shop belonging to the suspect's extended family were vandalized. ""A horrific crime,"" read one Palestinian news headline. The Palestinian police called it a ""new type of crime to be seen in the Palestinian areas."" A Palestinian talk show asked the victim's cousin what happened. ""This thing,"" he said, ""cannot be discussed in the media.""

In Israel, news of the murder was reported very differently. ""Kidnapped to the Palestinian Authority territories and murdered because of his sexual orientation,"" read one Israeli report. ""A bloody reminder of the LGBTQ situation in the Palestinian Authority,"" read another.

Ahmad Abu Markhiya was among a rare group of Palestinians from the West Bank granted the temporary right to live in Israel: those deemed to face threats to their lives because they are gay.

His gruesome murder received international attention and then faded from headlines. During the Gaza war, it has come to light again. Pro-Israel campaigns have cited his killing as an example of Palestinian savagery. Pro-Palestinian advocates say Israel weaponizes gay rights to distract from its actions in Gaza.

A one-and-a-half-year NPR investigation into the life and murder of Abu Markhiya -- drawing from police files, court documents and more than 40 interviews in Israel and the West Bank -- reveals a far more complex web of circumstances surrounding the killing than has previously been reported.

This is the story of a man in search of home, caught between two societies that never fully granted him one. For some, his murder was to be weighed against the shame he caused in life. For others, his murder robbed him of the chance to extricate himself from a society that refused him dignity and freedom.

Our investigation traces the victim's escape from the West Bank to Israel, probes the mystery of what drew him back and identifies his accused killer for the first time. It also explores the parallel justice systems -- official and traditional -- that have examined his murder but have yet to resolve it.

Two years -- and one war -- later, justice remains deferred for Ahmad Abu Markhiya.

It was the spring of 2021, a year and a half before his murder, when Abu Markhiya sent a Facebook message asking for help.

Rita Petrenko answered it. At the time, she ran The Different House, an Israeli nonprofit organization advocating on behalf of LGBTQ+ Palestinians seeking safety in Israel. Homosexuality is largely shunned in Palestinian society. Palestinians contacted her to say they were fleeing life-threatening persecution from their families, and she helped them secure official papers to stay in Israel.

Abu Markhiya told her he had been on the run from city to city in the West Bank for more than a year, ever since his uncle caught him being intimate with another young man, and men in his family beat him. (His family denies it threatened him.)

He told Petrenko he fled to the streets of Hebron, then to the West Bank cities of Beitunia, Ramallah and Tulkarem, as men in his family pursued him. He told her a relative opened fire on his car, so he took the risk of slipping through Israel's network of concrete walls, wire fences and military checkpoints -- built after a wave of Palestinian bombings in Israel two decades ago and designed to control Palestinian entry into Israel. Then he slept in a Tel Aviv parking lot for two weeks.

In a previous life in her native Russia, Petrenko worked for the police, training dogs to detect clues at crime scenes, so she considered herself a good lie detector. She believed there were some Palestinians who pretended to be gay to seek asylum abroad -- and others who were indeed gay and fabricated threats from their family to gain access to Israel and live a freer life. But Abu Markhiya's story struck her as credible. It didn't seem likely he would suffer weeks on the streets to back up a false story. ""That's not a life worth making something up for,"" she said.

Palestinians and Israelis who knew him say there was no doubt he was gay.

Petrenko submitted Abu Markhiya's testimony to the Israeli defense unit that grants Palestinians permits, and officers summoned him to an interview at a military facility. They concluded that sending him back to the West Bank would put him at risk.

But Israel would not grant him permanent asylum as a Palestinian. Historically, Israel has granted non-Jews asylum only in rare cases. It is especially opposed to an influx of Palestinians. But over the years, Israel has taken in Palestinians who spied for Israeli security agencies and needed cover, and in the last few years, it has granted protection to a couple of hundred Palestinians facing threats to their lives in the West Bank because of their gender or sexuality.

Israel granted Abu Markhiya a temporary residency permit, on condition that he apply for resettlement abroad through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. On June 1, 2021, Petrenko applied to the UNHCR on Abu Markhiya's behalf. She hoped Canada or Australia would accept him, as they had taken in Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum-seekers in exceptional cases. But other categories of Palestinians seemed to be given priority, she said, like people with academic degrees and women facing immediate threats to their lives. (The UNHCR said it does not comment on individual resettlement requests.)

While Abu Markhiya waited for an answer, he lived in at-risk-youth shelters and worked restaurant jobs illegally. At the time, Israel would not grant LGBTQ+ Palestinians work permits or health care. Given their tenuous status, many gay Palestinian asylum-seekers were coerced by their circumstances into sex work. Israeli welfare programs offered them -- including Abu Markhiya -- housing and rehabilitation programs to escape sexual exploitation, said Asma Alssaad, one of his shelter counselors.

In Israel, Abu Markhiya chose the nickname Esso. Alssaad said it was Arabic for Esau, the grandson of Abraham in Islamic and Jewish tradition. ""Many young Palestinians who escape to Israel choose an alias for themselves. It serves the purpose of dividing between the life they used to have in the West Bank and the life they have in Israel. Of course, it's also for reasons of confidentiality,"" Alssaad said.

Israeli shelter volunteers said Abu Markhiya was more mature than other young residents. He was clean-shaven and well-groomed, and he kept his locker organized.

He had plans for his future.

""To rent a house with a friend. To be loved,"" said Maiyan Price Zohar, 28, his primary Israeli counselor at the shelter. ""He wanted to live.""

In the summer of 2022, an Israeli Supreme Court petition by human rights groups prompted Israel to grant work rights and health care to LGBTQ+ Palestinians with Israeli permits. By then, Abu Markhiya had been in Israel for a year. Israeli defense officials renewed his permit but sought answers from the UNHCR: How much longer would it take to resettle him abroad?

In late August 2022, Petrenko asked the UNHCR to expedite Abu Markhiya's request for resettlement. Out of all the Palestinians she represented, he had waited the longest. He was receiving threatening calls and was eager to move abroad.

Weeks later, Abu Markhiya was dead.

The day after his murder, his community of gay Palestinian asylum-seekers and their Israeli advocates held a small memorial ceremony in Tel Aviv. They lit candles arrayed to spell out his name, Ahmad, in Hebrew.

His counselors and friends at the shelter were distraught: How did he disappear from Israel to the Palestinian city of Hebron? They were certain he would have never gone willingly to the same city where he was under threat.

Many were convinced he was kidnapped or lured there, and all were convinced his killing was an anti-gay attack. But the Israeli police did not contact them to seek their testimony. They heard no word about any formal investigation, nor did they expect to. His Israeli counselors didn't think Israeli police would care about a murder of a Palestinian in the Palestinian territories, and they didn't think Palestinian police would bother to investigate the murder of a gay man.

""It's a black hole,"" said Ofir Zweigenbom, one of Abu Markhiya's Israeli counselors.

In the twilight zone between Abu Markhiya's conditional life in Israel and gruesome death in the West Bank, they thought there would never be answers.

What his supporters in Israel did not know was that the chief Palestinian prosecutor of Hebron was pressing charges against the suspected murderer.

In a gleaming new limestone courthouse funded by the Canadian government, Nashat Ayoush sat at a large desk dressed in a white shirt and tie, in front of framed photos of the late Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat and the current leader, Mahmoud Abbas.

Ayoush had spent his entire career in the Palestinian state prosecutor's office, part of the civil justice system set up in the 1990s, as Palestinians built the institutions they hoped would eventually form the core of a country independent from Israel.

He collected all the details of Abu Markhiya's murder -- witness testimony, the autopsy and a photo of the 24-year-old defendant taken shortly after his arrest -- in an orange file folder held together by a black cord, Criminal File 2725/2022.

The evening of the murder, according to a copy of the indictment obtained by NPR, a family of four heard a commotion outside the old stone house they were renting in Hebron. ""When they looked out of their window, a few meters from the crime scene, they saw the suspect stabbing the victim with a knife in his neck and then dragging him,"" the indictment says.

They called their landlord, Mohammed Abu Eisheh, a respected dentist who lived in a stately house next door. He rushed home from his dental clinic downtown and alerted police, who arrived moments later. They found a young man standing under an oak tree next to a decapitated body. ""Upon seeing the police, he attempted to flee but was arrested, his hands and clothes stained with blood,"" the indictment says.

It was the dentist's son, Anas Abu Eisheh. The crime took place in his backyard. ""We caught him red-handed,"" Ayoush said.

A trail of blood ran from a storage room attached to the stone house, where the victim was killed, to the side of a hill under the oak tree some 20 yards away, where Anas Abu Eisheh had dragged the body and tried to hide it, according to the indictment.

The cause of death, according to the autopsy report reviewed by NPR, was 10 stab wounds to the chest and lower neck. Only after he died had he been beheaded.

""It was a shock for us,"" Ayoush said.

As news reports spread about a gay Palestinian murder case in Hebron, officials from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights raised the case with Ayoush, and a U.S. diplomat inquired with the Palestinian Authority's attorney general. The Palestinian Authority has long been scrutinized for lax prosecution of family violence against women and girls. A gruesome anti-LGBTQ+ killing would be a stain on the Palestinian leadership, which was reliant on international support.

""We explained to them that our investigations did not indicate any link between his being gay and the murder,"" Ayoush said. In fact, Ayoush said, the question of the victim's sexuality never came up in the Palestinian police interrogations, despite all the press reports alleging Abu Markhiya had faced anti-gay threats in the West Bank. Homosexuality is taboo in the West Bank's traditional Palestinian society, but it is not outlawed, he told us repeatedly.

Documented anti-gay killings are rare in the West Bank. LGBTQ+ advocates say some killings are framed as accidents. Others are shrouded in accusations of treason. Six months after Abu Markhiya's murder, a 23-year-old Palestinian was killed by militants who accused him of spying for Israel. In a purported confession video, he claimed Israeli agents blackmailed him with video footage of him having sex with another man.

In 2014, an anonymous group of former Israeli intelligence officers said they were instructed to extort gay Palestinians to spy for Israel or be exposed.

In 2019, after years of quiet activism, the Palestinian queer group alQaws staged a public demonstration in Haifa, a city in Israel with a large progressive Arab community, to protest the stabbing of a gay teenage Palestinian citizen of Israel. Weeks later, Palestinian police banned the queer group from holding events in the West Bank, saying it violated Palestinian values.

The Palestinian activist community saw this public struggle as progress; there were other countries in the region that had no queer organizing at all.

But then the community faced a setback in the months before Abu Markhiya's murder. Vigilantes in the West Bank attacked a venue hosting an openly gay Palestinian singer and disrupted a march perceived to be associated with the gay community. Palestinian police failed to prosecute the suspects. The Palestinian LGBTQ+ activist community has maintained a low profile ever since. No queer organization in the West Bank issued a statement about Abu Markhiya's murder.

The chairman of the Palestinian Psychiatric Association, Dr. Tawfiq Salman, has counseled West Bank families whose children have come out as gay in recent years. ""I'm convincing the families how to accept their sons, their daughters, as they are,"" he said. ""They have to deal without violence."" He said one client said he was moving his family to the U.S. to protect his gay son from repercussions from his community.

In our conversations with Abu Eisheh, he did not deny his son Anas, a law student at Hebron University, killed Abu Markhiya. But he said the killing had nothing to do with homosexuality. He said that his son, a longtime friend of Abu Markhiya, was mentally ill -- and that Abu Markhiya was to blame.

A few years prior, he said, Abu Markhiya had given Anas drugs, which he claimed induced schizophrenia that his son was treated for with antipsychotics. Abu Eisheh said his son began engaging in violent outbursts against his family. He believes on the day of the murder, Abu Markhiya gave his son an illegal substance that interacted with his medicines, triggering a psychotic episode that resulted in the gruesome crime. His son told investigators he had no recollection of the killing.

NPR was unable to verify that Anas was being treated for mental illness at the time of the crime. Abu Eisheh provided two psychiatric reports citing his son's aggressive behavior and religious delusions about resembling an Islamic messianic figure, but one document was dated three years before the killing and the other, written at the request of the family, was dated three days after the murder.

Salman, the psychiatric association chairman, said some Palestinian murder suspects' families claim mental illness to protect the family's reputation and prevent revenge killings. Ayoush, the Hebron prosecutor, said the suspect's motive in this murder case was irrelevant.

""We have sufficient proof against him. ... We are not obliged by Palestinian law to search for the motive,"" Ayoush said. He said he was treating the case like any other. That was the essence of justice he was hoping to prove the Palestinian government would be able to pursue.

On March 29, 2023, the Palestinian public prosecutor charged Anas Abu Eisheh with premeditated murder. The prosecutor said it was a crime punishable by life imprisonment.

NPR attended a hearing at the Hebron First Instance Court on Sept. 6, 2023, five months into the proceedings. The courtroom was covered in sleek wooden paneling, and the judge sat high atop a raised bench. The mood was tense: Guards were spread throughout the room, separating the defendant's brother and the victim's cousin.

Abu Eisheh, handcuffed and flanked by more guards, was ushered into the defendant's glass cage. He stood tall and appeared attentive but showed no emotion. In a raised voice, the counsel for the prosecution read the charge against him.

Earlier that year, the defendant had been transferred from detention in Hebron to a Bethlehem psychiatric hospital for an examination. The judge had requested a psychiatric evaluation as to whether the defendant was aware of his actions at the time of the crime. The judge read aloud the hospital's response: It was inconclusive. The judge ordered the hospital to conduct a repeat psychiatric evaluation, and court was adjourned.

Outside the walls of the courthouse, a different kind of justice was being pursued.

Sheikh Walid Tawil sat in his downtown Hebron office wearing a brown shawl with gold embroidered trim, a red-and-white-checked keffiyeh headscarf and a thick gold and silver watch. In his hands he held a chunky chain of shiny wooden prayer beads. He is a member of the Tawil tribe, one of 176 tribes or family clans present in Hebron. The 52-year-old sheikh leads an ultrareligious Islamic life -- four wives, 20 children -- and is a central figure in a parallel justice system of community reconciliation called sulh.

The tradition, practiced since before the creation of modern Palestinian criminal courts, centers on the asha'er, the family clans that play powerful roles in Palestinian society. Crimes between individuals become disputes between families. The goal is to prevent retaliation, assign responsibility, restore civil peace and reintroduce the offending family back into society.

Four days after Abu Markhiya's murder, Tawil presided over a large mediation ceremony as the representative of the defendant's family. Another sheikh, Fayez Al-Rajabi, represented the victim's family.

The two men brokered the traditional one-year atwa -- a written admission of guilt and a truce to prevent a blood feud between the families. The defendant's family paid the victim's family the standard compensation of 100,000 Jordanian dinars, the equivalent of about $141,000 -- a sum pegged to the currency of Jordan, which ruled the West Bank before Israel occupied it. The two families agreed to hold negotiations to determine whether the victim's family was owed any more money, in order to reach a final reconciliation before the truce expired a year later on Oct. 9, 2023.

Unlike the Palestinian civil justice system, which played down the question of homosexuality in this murder case, the traditional system appeared to place it front and center.

""Gays have no rights in society, religion or family,"" Tawil told us. The Quran condemns sex between men, according to traditional readings of the text, and some sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad prescribe the death penalty for it, but Islamic scholars have debated the topic for centuries.

Tawil was not suggesting that Abu Markhiya was killed because of his sexuality. But proving that he was gay would be a mitigating circumstance for the perpetrator. It could compel the victim's family to drop any further demands for financial compensation and to reach a final resolution.

""We are an Islamic society in Hebron,"" the sheikh said. ""If the victim has a bad reputation, the reconciliation fee is less.""

Both Palestinian justice systems, official and traditional, seek to avoid strife between family clans. A compromise between the families is preferable. Whatever the families decide in the traditional arbitration process affects the sentencing in the official criminal case. With a homicide, a family reconciliation agreement can reduce a prison sentence by a third, according to Ayoush, the prosecutor.

The first time we met, Abu Eisheh, the defendant's father, welcomed us into his dental clinic in downtown Hebron. He sat behind his desk wearing blue scrubs. The wall next to him was covered in diplomas and certificates.

He did not condone the murder. But it was a family feud to resolve, and rumors about the victim's sexuality gave the defendant's family the advantage.

""When the event took place, everyone denounced it and were very upset with the event, with Anas,"" his father said.

That changed when the Israeli media reported that Abu Markhiya was a gay asylum-seeker.

""The Israeli media provided us with a free service and broadcasted videos and broadcasted reports that the boy was gay. Within 24 hours ... the entire public opinion flipped from being against Anas to being with Anas. The pressure let up on us a lot, as a family,"" Abu Eisheh said.

He let out a small laugh.

""If we prove that Ahmad is gay, the problem will resolve more easily,"" Abu Eisheh explained. He said the victim's family ""will try to finish the issue quickly because this would be considered a shame for the family.""

On the outskirts of Hebron, on the side of a scraggly mound and up a set of exposed concrete steps, is the small home of Awatef Abu Markhiya, Ahmad Abu Markhiya's mother. His father died some years ago, and she remarried. She has the same angular jaw and almond-shaped eyes as her late son.

Her family advised her not to speak about her son's murder. Whatever she said could prejudice the reconciliation negotiations.

""Ahmad had a very, very good heart,"" she said. She cried, describing a beloved son, and repeatedly denied he was gay.

""We know he was not gay,"" Al-Rajabi, the Abu Markhiya family's arbitrator in the mediation, told us. ""We don't have homosexuality in Hebron. This is Abraham's city.""

Why did Abu Markhiya return to the city he had fled?

""I know the whole story from the beginning to the end,"" a man in his early 20s from Hebron told NPR in the summer of 2023.

This young man was both a friend of the victim and a relative of the defendant. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is also gay and had run away from home after the murder, afraid of being targeted for his sexuality.

He said Abu Markhiya had been haunted by a case of blackmail from the time he fled to Israel until the end of his life.

He said there was a man in Hebron who had pursued Abu Markhiya for sex and threatened to release an intimate photo of him. Abu Markhiya knew the man personally and complained to the police three weeks before fleeing to Israel, and he filed an additional complaint against the alleged blackmailer several months later, according to police records reviewed by NPR.

In a phone interview with NPR, the alleged blackmailer, whom NPR is not naming due to possible repercussions against him given the intense taboos in the West Bank against homosexuality, said he was detained and denied the allegations, and he said that his family convinced Abu Markhiya to withdraw the complaint a few weeks before his murder.

Abu Markhiya arrived in Hebron. His family said that he was there to seek Palestinian health insurance coverage for a work-related injury (at the time, it was still difficult for gay Palestinian asylum-seekers to access Israeli health care) and that he intended to withdraw his police complaint (though the Hebron prosecutor's office said he did not end up withdrawing it). He told his family he needed to settle his affairs because he planned to move abroad. His advocate in Israel -- Rita Petrenko -- had asked the U.N. to expedite his resettlement request.

Hours before the murder, the young man said he saw Abu Markhiya: He had gotten a haircut in downtown Hebron. Then he went to meet Abu Eisheh.

The young man said that Abu Eisheh had also been pursuing Abu Markhiya, wanting to be in an intimate relationship together and promising to protect him, but that Abu Markhiya refused.

It remains unclear why the two met that evening and what compelled the killer to murder and behead Abu Markhiya. The accused killer's family denies that Abu Eisheh is gay or that his relationship to the victim was more than just friendship.

But what compelled Abu Markhiya to return to the city he had escaped appears to have been the hope of tying up loose ends and getting a fresh start.

On Oct. 7, 2023, almost exactly one year after Abu Markhiya's murder, Hamas carried out the deadliest single attack on Israelis in history, and Israel began its deadliest Gaza offensive in history.

In the global debate over the Gaza war, LGBTQ+ rights have taken center stage. Groups like Queers for Palestine have been a fixture at anti-war rallies, accusing Israel of embracing gay rights to ""pinkwash"" war crimes.

Israel's advocates have fired back, criticizing queer protesters for condemning Israel rather than Hamas Islamists, who reject gay rights. ""Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a joint meeting of U.S. Congress in July. ""They might as well hold up signs saying 'Chickens for KFC.'""

Abu Markhiya's story has been resurrected in this firestorm by pro-Israel campaigns online. One of them, Queer in Gaza, cites his killing and states: ""Protect LGBT Palestinians. Only Israel does.""

During the war, Israel revoked all Palestinians' permits in Israel, citing security concerns. In a survey of 73 Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum-seekers, conducted three months into the war by the Association for LGBTQ Equality in Israel, most said they lost their jobs, were assaulted and were arrested. Some said they were also deported to the West Bank. Human rights groups intervened, and Israel reversed the deportations of protected LGBTQ+ Palestinians.

The war also brought sweeping Israeli crackdowns to the West Bank, putting the Abu Markhiya murder proceedings into a deep freeze.

About six months had passed since Abu Eisheh was charged with premediated murder for the killing and beheading of Abu Markhiya. Ayoush, the Hebron prosecutor heading up the case, could not reach his own courthouse for a month due to Israeli roadblocks. (He was later reassigned to another role in the justice system and is no longer on the case.) Lawyers were kept waiting hours at Israeli checkpoints when traveling from one city to another. The Palestinian Bar Association went on strike for six months due to the movement restrictions. Neither the accused murderer nor his lawyer appeared at court hearings during that time.

The court proceedings are still dragging on, with no progress a year and a half after they began. Abu Eisheh remains in a Hebron detention center, where he is allowed weekly family visits. Whether due to a high sensitivity around this murder, incompetence, indifference or some other reason, the Bethlehem psychiatric hospital has not heeded repeated court requests to submit an evaluation of the defendant and whether he is fit to stand trial. In May, the director of the hospital told NPR, ""We will contact the court soon.""

To this day, it has not submitted its evaluation.

While the official West Bank criminal justice system was paralyzed at the start of the Gaza war, the traditional justice system thrived. Fresh tragedies sidelined older ones, and families resolved pending disputes. The war offered an opportunity to put the Abu Markhiya murder case to rest as well.

The atwa, the truce between the Abu Markhiya and Abu Eisheh families, had expired on Oct. 9, 2023, two days into the war. On Oct. 16, the Abu Eisheh family paid a visit to the Abu Markhiya family home. They asked the victim's family to reconcile, but the victim's family demanded more money as compensation for the murder. The two sides agreed to convene a council of city dignitaries to reach a final reconciliation, saq al-sulh, by January 2024.

That committee has never convened.

Sheikh Tawil, the Abu Eisheh family's arbitrator, was not concerned. He was confident the Abu Markhiya family would not seek revenge or more money. He was convinced by the documents attesting to the defendant's mental illness, and he held up his phone to show us Israeli news articles that identified the victim as gay and photos of the memorial candles in Tel Aviv spelling out his name, Ahmad, in Hebrew.

""This of course in our society is completely forbidden. We cannot allow any homosexual person to have any kind of rights in society,"" he said.

The arbitrator for the Abu Markhiya family insists the case remains unsettled. But convening a council of city dignitaries would only resurface the central question of the unresolved case -- whether Abu Markhiya was gay. Answering that question could risk the family's reputation by association. It also would weaken the family's ability to make further claims for accountability for their son's murder.

By this logic, in Hebron's communal justice system, the scales are now balanced.

""Ahmad deserves accountability and he deserves dignity,"" said Sa'ed Atshan, an associate professor at Swarthmore College and a Palestinian LGBTQ+ human rights advocate who authored a book on queer Palestinians and has been following the murder case. ""What a travesty. He was so close to freedom.""

One spring evening, several months into the war, Abu Eisheh walked across his rocky backyard to the old stone house where the murder took place. An Israeli warplane rumbled in the sky; Hebron is a short distance from Gaza.

It was sunset, around the same time his son drank tea with Abu Markhiya on the terrace before the stabbing. From there, the young men had looked out onto an expansive view of the hilly city.

On the horizon were the onion domes of Hebron's Russian Orthodox church, the city's only surviving church. Thousands of years ago, according to tradition, the patriarch Abraham came to the city and pitched his tent near an oak tree that still stands on the church grounds.

A much younger oak tree marks the spot where the victim's head and body were found. He was buried in the center of Hebron, not far from the tomb of Abraham.

Nearly two years have passed since Ahmad Abu Markhiya was killed. His mother, Awatef, still denies he was gay. She still does not know why he was killed or whether the murder case will ever be laid to rest. She prays for justice of a different kind."
Senate GOP teams up to take on Harris policy pitfalls in pre-election video series,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-gop-team-up-take-harris-policy-pitfalls-pre-election-video-series,2024-09-30T08:45:55Z,"FIRST ON FOX: Senate Republicans teamed up to lay out their closing arguments against the Biden-Harris administration and its policies in a new video series that addresses the border, the high cost of living and foreign policy.

Featuring more than 20 Republican senators, the Senate Republican conference is releasing a three-part video series with specific emphasis on Vice President Harris amid her run for the presidency on Monday. The videos will take viewers through the years of President Biden and Harris' administration, reminding them of past blunders.

One video focuses on the southern border crisis, with Republican senators appearing on site at the border cut between footage of Harris responding to concerns over her administration's inaction.

AS LEADER RACE LOOMS, JOHN THUNE TAKES SENATE MAP BY STORM TO BOOST GOP CANDIDATES

It notes Harris was put in charge of addressing the root causes of the border crisis and stemming the flow of migrants to the southern border by Biden as the administration's ""border czar."" However, in recent days, both members of the media and Democrats have suggested Harris was never actually tasked with managing the border crisis or in the position of border czar.

Another video serves as a reminder of the enduring global crises and conflicts that began under the Biden-Harris administration, including the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia's attack on Ukraine and terrorist group Hamas' attack on Israel.

KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONE

High prices and Americans' struggles to make ends meet is addressed in the third video, and the evolution of the administration's explanations for inflation is laid out. Footage of Harris touting ""Bidenomics"" is featured. The administration quickly stopped mentioning Bidenomics after the phrase proved unpopular.

SENATE PASSES FUNDING BILL WITHOUT SAVE ACT, AVOIDING POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said, ""This series shows Americans a clear timeline of Kamala Harris' failures. They will see how Harris' tie-breaking vote led to record-high prices - 20% higher than when Harris took office. They will hear how Harris' open-border policies led to more than 10 million illegal immigrants pouring across the border. They will see how Harris played a pivotal role in the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to the death of 13 Americans.

The video series comes after the departure of the Senate for a month-long recess. Lawmakers won't return until after the November election. It serves as a final argument from the Republican conference against the Biden-Harris administration's policies and leadership while also looking to pin that record on downballot Democrats seeking election or re-election.

Republicans are favored to take the majority in the Senate, keeping all of their current seats and adding seats in West Virginia and Montana. This would put them at a 51-member majority, but there are several additional contests that are considered within reach, giving them a chance to expand on it."
An airstrike hits a Beirut residential building as Israel expands attacks in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25396/israel-beirut-lebanon-hezbollah,2024-09-30T07:30:35Z,"JERUSALEM -- The first apparent Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in nearly a year of conflict leveled an apartment building early Monday. It came after Israel hit targets across Lebanon and killed dozens of people, as Hezbollah sustained heavy blows to its command structure, including the killing of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The airstrike hit a multistory residential building, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene. Videos showed ambulances and a crowd gathered near the building in a mainly Sunni district with a busy thoroughfare lined with shops.

A Palestinian leftist faction in Lebanon said three of its members were killed in the airstrike. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement early Monday that its military and security commanders in Lebanon, and a third member, were killed in the attack.

The group has not played a significant role in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah.

An official with Lebanon's Civil Defense had earlier said that a member of the al-Jamaa al-Islamiya was killed in the strike and that 16 other people were wounded, but the Sunni militant group, which fights alongside Hezbollah, has not confirmed the death of any of its members.

Also early Monday, another strike killed a commander with the militant group Hamas, which has a presence in Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps. Hamas said Fatah Sharif and his family were killed in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre.

In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence -- including a major strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah -- but had not hit locations near the city center.

Israeli officials had no immediate comment.

Earlier, Hezbollah confirmed that Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of its Central Council, was killed Saturday, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader killed in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. They include the group's founding members who had evaded death or detention for decades.

Hezbollah also confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in the strike that killed Nasrallah. Israel says at least 20 other Hezbollah militants were killed, including one in charge of Nasrallah's security detail.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 105 people were killed around the country in airstrikes Sunday. Two strikes near the southern city of Sidon, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Beirut, killed at least 32 people, the ministry said. Separately, Israeli strikes in the northern province of Baalbek Hermel killed 21 people and wounded at least 47.

Lebanese media reported dozens of strikes in the central, eastern and western Bekaa and in the south, besides strikes on Beirut. Israel says it targets militants, but the strikes have hit buildings where civilians were living and the death toll was expected to rise.

In a video of a strike in Sidon, verified by the AP, a building swayed before collapsing as neighbors filmed. One TV station called on viewers to pray for a family caught under the rubble, posting their pictures, as rescuers failed to reach them. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 14 medics were killed over two days in the south.

President Joe Biden said Sunday that he would speak soon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. ""It has to be,"" Biden told reporters at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware as he boarded Air Force One for Washington.

Meanwhile, wreckage from Friday's strike that killed Nasrallah was still smoldering. Smoke rose over the rubble as people flocked to the site, some to check on what was left of their homes and others to pay respects, pray or simply to see the destruction.

In response to the dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, Hezbollah significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week, from several dozen to several hundred daily, the Israeli military said. The attacks injured several people and caused damage, but most of the rockets and drones were intercepted by Israel's air defense systems or fell in open areas.

The army says its strikes have degraded Hezbollah's capabilities and the number of launches would be much higher if Hezbollah had not been hit.

Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said dozens of its aircraft struck Houthi targets in Yemen in response to a recent attack. The military said it targeted power plants and sea port facilities in the city of Hodeida.

The Houthis launched a ballistic missile attack toward Israel's Ben Gurion airport on Saturday when Netanyahu was arriving. The Houthi media office said the Israeli strikes hit the Hodeida and Rass Issa ports, along with two power plants in Hodeida city, a stronghold for the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the strikes killed four people and wounded 40 others.

The Houthis claimed they took precautionary measures ahead of the strikes, emptying oil stored in the ports, according to Nasruddin Ammer, deputy director of the Houthi media office. He said in a post on X that the strikes won't stop the rebels' attacks on shipping routes and on Israel.

Meanwhile, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had ""wiped out"" Hezbollah's command structure, but he warned the group will work quickly to rebuild it.

""I think people are safer without him walking around,"" Kirby said of Nasrallah. ""But they will try to recover. We're watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It's going to be tough. ... Much of their command structure has now been wiped out.""

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Kirby sidestepped questions about whether the Biden administration agrees with how the Israelis are targeting Hezbollah leaders. The White House continues to call on Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a 21-day temporary cease-fire floated by the U.S., France and other countries during the U.N. General Assembly last week.

A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon have killed more than 1,030 people -- including 156 women and 87 children -- in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes. The government estimates around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets.

Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran, Israel's chief regional rival, rose to regional prominence after fighting a devastating monthlong war with Israel in 2006 that ended in a draw.

Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel. The United States announced sanctions against him in 2020.

Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies that consider themselves part of an Iran-backed ""Axis of Resistance"" against Israel.

The conflict has steadily ratcheted up to the brink of all-out war, raising fears of a region-wide conflagration.

Israel says it is determined to return some 60,000 of its citizens to communities in the north that were evacuated nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its rocket fire if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which has proven elusive despite months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt."

President Biden said on Sunday that he intended to talk to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu imminently, shortly before the Israel-Hamas war intensified in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched an airstrike on the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Sunday evening, marking the first time the Israeli military implemented an airstrike on the central part of the city amid the yearlong Israel-Hamas war.

Speaking from Dover Air Force Base earlier that afternoon, Biden confirmed to reporters that he planned to speak with Netanyahu. The conversation took place hours before the airstrike began.

""Yes, I will be talking to him,"" the Democrat said. ""And I'll tell you what I say to him when I talk to him.""

""And, but, we're not there yet, but we're working like hell with the French and many others to avoid [more] war.""

The Associated Press first reported the airstrike on Sunday evening, citing witnesses in central Beirut. The airstrike came the same weekend that the IDF systematically targeted Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist group that supports Hamas.

The IDF had only targeted south Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold, before Sunday's strikes. Dozens of people in Lebanon were killed by the IDF over the weekend, including Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The Israeli military also confirmed that Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council, was eliminated by IDF forces.

The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is conducting strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed.

The IDF said in a statement that its air force struck Houthi targets in Yemen approximately 1,800 kilometers from Israel.

The Israeli military described ""an extensive, intelligence-based aerial operation"" involving dozens of IAF aircraft, including fighter jets, midair refueling aircraft, and intelligence aircraft, striking ""military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime in the Ras Isa and Hudaydah areas of Yemen.""

The IDF said targets included power plants and a seaport used to import oil, ""which were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil.""

The operation was conducted in response to recent attacks by the Houthis against Israel, the IDF said.

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI IN HIDING WITH EXTRA SECURITY FOLLOWING HEZBOLLAH LEADER'S DEATH: REPORT

""Over the past year, the Houthis have been operating under the direction and funding of Iran, and in cooperation with Iraqi militias in order to attack the State of Israel, undermine regional stability, and disrupt global freedom of navigation,"" the IDF said. ""The IDF is determined to continue operating at any distance - near or far - against all threats to the citizens of the State of Israel.""

The campaign against the Houthis in Yemen comes amid already heightened tensions in the region after Israeli strikes outside Beirut, Lebanon, killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Houthi leader Adul Malik al-Houthi vowed revenge for Nasrallah's killing, according to Tazpit Press Service (TPS), an international Israeli news agency.

""We will move toward escalation and developing our military performance,"" al-Houthi reportedly said.

As the one-year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war approaches, Houthis have continued a campaign to target ships traveling through the Red Sea as U.S.-led airstrikes earlier this month pounded their positions in Yemen. That's imperiled a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion of trade pass through it, as well as crucial shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and Yemen, according to The Associated Press.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who reportedly has gone into hiding in his country, has also warned of potential retaliation from Iran and its terrorist proxies in response to Nasrallah's killing.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that Hezbollah's command structure ""has been nearly decimated,"" after Israel destroyed thousands of the terror group's missiles and drones over the last few days. On Sunday, however, Israeli air defenses reported downing two drones coming from Lebanon.

TPS reported that the two unmanned aircraft ""crossed from Lebanese territory into Israeli waters and were intercepted by a missile and an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) combat helicopter.""

In a statement on Saturday, the Pentagon press secretary, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ""stressed that the United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict.""

""The United States retains the capability to deploy forces on short notice. The Department of Defense continues to maintain a significant amount of capability in the region and to dynamically adjust our force posture based on the evolving security situation.""

One year ago, Biden administration national security adviser Jake Sullivan praised the administration's success at keeping the peace in the Middle East just one week before the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

""The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades"" Sullivan said during a Sept. 29, 2023, appearance at the Atlantic Festival.

At the time, Sullivan pointed to a list of positive developments in the Middle East, including a truce in Yemen, a decrease in Iranian attacks on U.S. troops, and a ""stable"" Iraq.

But just one week later, Iranian-backed Hamas launched a terrorist attack against Israel, with the militant group firing rockets at the Jewish state while thousands of militants breached the Gaza-Israel barrier and attacked Israeli civilians.

The attack resulted in over 1,100 deaths, over 250 people taken hostage, and sparked the ongoing conflict between Israel and the militant group.

The Biden administration has attempted to grapple with the conflict ever since, weighing the concerns of some wings of the Democratic Party more sympathetic to Palestinians while continuing to show support for longtime ally Israel.

Meanwhile, Iran has vowed retaliation for multiple Israeli strikes in Lebanon, one of which reportedly killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and spread greater turmoil throughout the region as the administration attempted to call for a three-week cease-fire to head off a potential all-out conflict.

Those tensions with Iran have caused Sullivan to backtrack on some of that optimism from last year, acknowledging fears over escalating tensions in the region while still expressing optimism about a potential resolution to the almost year-old conflict.

""While the risk of escalation is real, we actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure,"" Sullivan said last week, according to a report in Reuters.

The U.S. wants to stop Iran and its allies from spreading conflict in the Middle East following the killing of Hezbollah's leader in Lebanon, the Pentagon said on Sunday.

""Secretary Austin stressed that the United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement.

The Department of Defense also said it ""continues to maintain a significant amount of capability in the region and to dynamically adjust our force posture based on the evolving security situation.""

Kaouk's death was reported one day after the IDF announced Nasrallah's death. Israeli leaders had reportedly been tracking Nasrallah's whereabouts for months before the strike, and he was killed in a strike targeting Hezbollah's ""central headquarters"" in southern Beirut. Nasrallah was Hezbollah's secretary general for 32 years, the New York Times reported, and supported Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, strike on Israel. After his death, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on X, ""Nasrallah was not just another terrorist, he was the terrorist,"" adding: ""As long as Nasrallah was alive, he would have quickly rebuilt the capabilities we took from Hezbollah."" In response to news of Narallah's death, Iran said the attack ""will not go unanswered"" and said the U.S. was ""complicit in the crime,"" NBC News reported.

Hezbollah supported Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and orchestrated an attack of its own the following day ""in solidarity"" with Hamas. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has gotten significantly more intense in recent weeks as more than 600 have been killed and 2,000 injured in Lebanon, according to the Associated Press. Israel has largely been targeting southern Lebanon and Beirut, trying to ""strike and eliminate"" Hezbollah's leadership. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has been launching strikes into Israel, sending a missile last week into Tel Aviv targeting the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency -- though Israel claimed to have intercepted it.

Hassan Ammar/AP hide caption

Israel's military says it carried out ""dozens"" of additional raids on Hezbollah targets early Sunday, as reports circulated that another two senior Hezbollah commanders were assassinated following the assassination of the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah in a southern suburb of Beirut.

In a statement, the IDF said it had eliminated Nabil Kaouk, head of Hezbollah's preventative security council.

Hezbollah did not comment on Kaouk's whereabouts, but it separately confirmed the death of another senior commander, Ali Karaki.

At least 11 people were killed in the latest strikes, according to Lebanon's National News Agency.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel earlier than expected from his trip to the United Nations as Israel was said to be preparing for an invasion into southern Lebanon after reservists were called up to Israel's north.

In a statement on the messaging app Telegram, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its air forces targeted ""buildings where weapons and military structures of the organization were stored.""

The IDF says it has attacked hundreds of Hezbollah targets since Saturday, aiming its attacks in Dahieh, a densely populated southern suburb of Beirut and Hezbollah stronghold.

""The IDF continues to attack with force, damage and degrade Hezbollah's military capabilities and infrastructure in Lebanon,"" the Israeli military said in a post on X.

Israeli strikes left another 33 people dead on Saturday, according to the Lebanese health ministry, and an additional 195 people wounded.

Meanwhile, the IDF also said it had intercepted eight projectiles launched from Lebanon into Israel on Sunday, hitting open areas near Tiberias in Israel's north.

The latest exchanges of fire, combined with Israel's preparations to invade southern Lebanon has mounted fears that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was heading toward an all-out war.

Israel's killing of Nasrallah, in particular, represents another dramatic new development for a conflict that has metastasized across the Middle East region since last October.

In a statement on Saturday, Netanyahu stood by the move, calling it necessary to ""change the balance of power in the region for years to come.""

""Nasrallah was not a terrorist; he was the terrorist,"" Netanyahu said in a statement, warning of challenging days ahead.

Even as Israeli forces prepared for a response to retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah, Lebanon's Information Minister said on Sunday that negotiations for a ceasefire with Israel were still ""underway"" even as cross-border exchanges of fire continued.

The U.S., France, the U.K. and other allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, even as the prospect of any such agreement appears less and less likely.

""It's time for a ceasefire now,"" President Joe Biden told reporters on Saturday as he left a church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

Asked about Nasrallah's killing, however, Biden said the longtime Hezbollah leader's death was ""a measure of justice"" for victims of his four-decade ""reign of terror.""

In a separate statement, Biden noted the operation to take out Nasrallah happened within the wider context of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks against Israel.

""Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel,"" Biden said in a statement.

On Saturday, the U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated calls for a ceasefire, saying in a post on X that he had spoken with the Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati.

""We agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the bloodshed,"" Lammy said. ""A diplomatic solution is the only way to restore security and stability for the Lebanese and Israeli people.""

Mikati told reporters on Sunday that he ""welcomes"" a ceasefire, adding that if one were to occur, it would need to apply to both Gaza and Lebanon."

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has moved into hiding and remains at a secure location within the country, sources told Reuters.

The decision came in response to Israel's strikes outside Beirut on Friday that killed the leader and founding member of the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.

Two sources also told Reuters that Iran reached out to Hezbollah and other proxy forces in the region to determine what action to take in response to Nasrallah's killing.

In a statement Saturday, Khamenei said, ""The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront.""

ISRAELI FORCES SAY HEAD OF HAMAS IN SOUTHERN SYRIA KILLED IN STRIKE

While announcing five days of public mourning, Khamenei called Nasrallah ""the flag-bearer of resistance"" in the region.

""The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged,"" Khamenei said, according to Reuters.

Iranian media reported on Saturday that the Israeli strikes outside Lebanon's capital also killed the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' deputy commander, Abbas Nilforoushan.

Israel has killed several other top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut, especially in the past two weeks, in addition to the attack that killed Nasrallah.

Earlier this month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing at least a dozen people and injuring thousands, according to officials in Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack but has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility.

Reuters cited one Iranian security official as revealing that the Revolutionary Guards is carrying out a large scale operation to inspect all communications devices.

Most of the devices were made in Lebanon or imported from China and Russia, the official said, as Iran is conducting a thorough investigation centered on mid- and high-ranking members of the Revolutionary Guards.

Iran is considering the possibility of infiltration by Israeli agents, including Iranians paid by Israel, the official told Reuters.

In response to Nasrallah's death, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Tehran, waving Hezbollah flags and chanting, ""Death to Israel,"" and, ""Death to Netanyahu the murderer,"" the Associated Press reported.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian partially blamed the United States for Nasrallah's killing, given that Washington has been providing weapons to Israel.

""The Americans cannot deny their complicity with the Zionists,"" he said in a statement aired by state media, according to Reuters.

ISRAEL TARGETS HEZBOLLAH LEADER NASRALLAH IN STRIKE ON BEIRUT HEADQUARTERS

Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 as hostages.

Since then, the two sides have been engaged in escalating cross-border strikes. Iran's proxies include Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen, as well as other forces operating in Iraq. The Houthis have been launching missiles at Israel and ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea along the Yemeni coast following the Oct. 7 attacks.

In his first public remarks since Nasrallah's killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's targeting of Nasrallah was ""an essential condition to achieving the goals we set.""

""He wasn't another terrorist. He was the terrorist,"" Netanyahu said.

Netanyahu said Nasrallah's killing would help bring displaced Israelis back to their homes in the north and would pressure Hamas to free Israeli hostages held in Gaza. But with the threat of retaliation high, he warned the coming days would bring ""significant challenges"" and warned Iran against trying to strike.

Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani wrote a letter to the heads of the United Nations and the Security Council on Saturday calling for an emergency council meeting over the attack that killed Nasrallah.

""Using U.S.-supplied thousand-pound bunker busters,"" he wrote, Israel killed Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, among others.

He warned Israel not to attack any of its diplomatic or consular premises, or its representatives, according to the AP.

""Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,"" Iravani wrote."
IDF announces death of another senior Hezbollah official following Nasrallah death,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-announces-death-another-senior-hezbollah-official-following-nasrallah-death,2024-09-29T11:51:51Z,"Former U.S. four-star general Jack Keane reacts to the killing of a Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah from an IDF strike and a possible response from Iran.

Israel's military says it has killed yet another high level member of Hezbollah with an airstrike on Sunday.

The IDF says the strike killed Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council, though they did not offer details on where the strike took place. The claim comes just days after an IDF strike killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

Israel and Hezbollah have continued to fire barrages of missiles and rockets toward one another as they appear to be on the brink of all-out war.

Hezbollah began its offensive immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, in which some 1,200 Israelis were killed or captured. Israel has responded by launching its own airstrikes and massing forces at its northern border with Lebanon.

Israel was forced to evacuate some 60,000 citizens who were living near the border with Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that the campaign against Hezbollah will not stop until those citizens can return safely to their homes.

Meanwhile, Hezbollah says it will only cease its hostilities once Israel has agreed to a cease-fire in Gaza, a deal that has proven almost impossible in recent months.

Hundreds of thousands of people have likewise been driven from their homes in Lebanon. The government estimates that around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets, Environment Minister Nasser Yassin told The Associated Press.

Israel has killed a slew of top Hezbollah and Hamas commanders with airstrikes throughout the conflict.

On Friday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told reporters, ""The United States was not involved in Israel's operation,"" noting there was ""no advance warning,"" from the Israelis about the strike on Nasrallah.

Netanyahu cut short his trip to New York following his speech to the United Nations General Assembly where he warned Hezbollah about Israel's right to go on the offensive.

""As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely and that's exactly what we're doing,"" he said.

The IDF later released a graphic suggesting that nearly all of Hezbollah's top commanders have been killed.

Why the U.S. government is hailing Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader as 'justice',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25322/biden-nasrallah-hezbollah-israel,2024-09-29T10:31:10Z,"Shiite Muslims light candles during a protest against the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Karachi, Pakistan on Saturday. Fareed Khan/AP hide caption

The death of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday could reshape the war in the Middle East in ways not yet known. The civilian death toll from the strikes is likely to rise. And the Iran-backed Lebanese militacnt group is known for its resilience and retaliation.

But many U.S. leaders have united in their support of Israel's killing of Nasrallah for what they see an appropriate action for the longtime decision maker of an organization that killed many innocent lives.

President Biden said the death of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday was ""a measure of justice for his many victims.""

""Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror,"" Biden said in a statement.

Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson also added their support for the attack.

Harris called Nasrallah ""a terrorist with American blood on his hands"" whose leadership ""destabilized the Middle East and led to the killing of countless innocent people in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and around the world. Today, Hezbollah's victims have a measure of justice.""

Biden and Harris reiterated their support for Israel's right to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.

Hezbollah has been linked to several anti-U.S. terrorist attacks since the 1980s. Hezbollah was formed in 1982 in response to Israel's invasion of Lebanon and three years later pledged allegiance to the supreme leader of Iran and called for the destruction of Israel.

The groups attacks against Americans and U.S. interests include the suicide truck bombings in 1983 and 1984 in Beirut that targeted the U.S. embassy, the U.S. Marine barracks and the U.S. embassy annex. The death toll of those attacks was more than 300 Americans and Lebanese.

In 1985, a Trans World Airlines flight was hijacked by an alleged Hezbollah member who fatally shot a U.S. Navy diver.

During the Iraq War, Hezbollah members reportedly armed and trained Shia militias that carried out attacks on U.S. forces during their deployments between 2003 and 2011, according to a U.S. congressional report published last week.

In the Middle East, more than 500 Lebanese and over 30 Israelis have reportedly been killed in recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to the report.

The Lebanese militant group and Israel have been trading attacks since the current conflict in the Middle East began nearly a year ago. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group governing Gaza and is also backed by Iran, carried out an attack on Israel on Oct. 7. That attack killed around 1,200 Israelis and Hamas militants took some 250 hostages. Israel responded with what's become a months-long assault in the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians.

The 2024 annual threat assessment put out by U.S. intelligence agencies states that Hezbollah ""maintains the capability to target U.S. persons and interests in the [Middle East] region, worldwide, and, to a lesser extent, in the United States."""
Hezbollah leader's death sparks joy and rage across the Middle East,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/nx-s1-5132098/hezbollah-nasrallah-world-reaction-israel-us-lebanon,2024-09-29T09:05:47Z,"Demonstrators hold pictures of Hassan Nasrallah, late leader of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, during a protest vigil in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon on Saturday.

Israel's killing of Hassan Nasrallah was met with joy and rage across the Middle East, opposing reactions that expose the deep divisions in the region.

Hezbollah confirmed that its leader of 32 years was killed in Lebanon by an Israeli airstrike, and offered condolences for others killed with him, after what the group called a ""treacherous Zionist raid on the southern suburb"" of Beirut.

It described Nasrallah as ""a great martyr, a heroic, bold, brave, wise, insightful, and faithful leader,"" and would remain, despite his death, ""still among us with his thought, spirit, line and sacred approach.""

In Washington, President Biden in a White House statement said Nasrallah and Hezbollah ""were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror.""

The president called Nasrallah's death ""a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians."" He also reiterated full support for ""Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups.""

The Israeli military said the Hezbollah leader was killed at his main headquarters underneath a residential building in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. It said Hezbollah's acting deputy, Ali Karki, and other Hezbollah commanders were among those killed as they were planning further attacks on Israel.

To highlight the attack's potential to ignite an even wider Middle East conflict, the semiofficial Iranian news agency, Mehr, reported that an operational head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan, had also been killed in the strike. Iran has long financed and supported Hezbollah, while also supplying weapons and missile technology to the group.

The attack on Hezbollah's headquarters took place just after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N. General Assembly. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with protocol, said Netanyahu greenlit the strike before he delivered his address.

In his first public remarks on Friday's attack, Netanyahu said the assassination of Nasrallah, who he described as ""the architect"" of a plan to ""annihilate"" Israel, was an ""essential condition"" for Israel to achieve its war goals.

The mood among Israelis was jubilant. One Tel Aviv apartment building blasted a song with the Hebrew lyrics: ""Oh Nasrallah, we'll take you down, God willing, and send you back to God along with all of Hezbollah."" At a beach in southern Israel, a lifeguard announced to beachgoers over a loudspeaker: ""With happiness, joy and cheer, we announce officially that the rat Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated yesterday. The people of Israel live.""

The Israeli military ordered limitations on public gatherings in central Israel in a sign that the country was preparing for possible retaliatory strikes by Hezbollah or other Iran-supported militias.

In the past few days, thousands of reservists have also been called up and deployed to the country's border with Lebanon, as Hezbollah continues to trade rocket fire with Israeli ground forces using artillery and tanks.

Meanwhile, senior figures across the Israeli political spectrum and the country's military leaders praised the assassination. ""He was an immediate threat to the lives of thousands of Israelis and other citizens,"" said the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant. ""This action closed a long-standing account with the arch-murderer Nasrallah, whose hands were covered with the blood of thousands of civilians and soldiers.""

""Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorize the world,"" said Daniel Hagari, the spokesperson for the Israeli military. ""Justice has been served.""

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned what he called an Israeli massacre in Lebanon, and vowed that the fate of the Mideast will be determined by ""the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront."" Iran announced five days of mourning for Nasrallah.

Khamenei told Muslims to stand by the people of Lebanon and Hezbollah to confront Israel. Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, called Nasrallah's killing a war crime.

Since Hezbollah began sending missiles into northern Israel on Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel, the group has fired 9,300 rockets, killing 49 people and wounding 372, according to the Israeli prime minister's office. The Lebanese health ministry separately announced Saturday that more than 1,000 people had been killed in Lebanon over just the past 10 days, including dozens of women and children. More than 6,000 had been wounded, it said.

Tens of thousands of Lebanese have fled the country's southern and eastern regions that have borne repeated Israeli strikes in the past week. And many have also been pouring over the border to neighboring Syria, Syrian journalist Danny Makki told NPR, speaking from the capital Damascus.

""Syrians are more concerned at the moment with getting them to safety, and helping them in the humanitarian sense,"" Makki said, while acknowledging the broader impact of the Hezbollah leader's death. ""Nasrallah is a very huge individual in the region and has been part and parcel of the politics of the Middle East.""

In Syria, where Hezbollah has backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's brutal civil war, people in Idlib province celebrated on the streets, Syrian journalist Fared Al Mahlool told NPR. ""People are happy to hear it. ... Too many people have been displaced, killed, and lost loved ones because of Nasrallah's support to the Syrian regime. They took part in destroying several cities and displacing so many people,"" he said.

Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main militant groups in Gaza that have been labeled as terrorist organizations by the United States and several other nations, were defiant. Islamic Jihad said it was ""fully confident"" that Nasrallah's death would ""increase the strength, steadfastness and determination of the resistance in Lebanon, Palestine and the region,"" while a statement released by Hamas said history showed the deaths of leaders such as Nasrallah meant they would be ""succeeded on the same path by a generation of leaders who are more valiant, stronger and more determined."" Hamas senior figure Khalil al-Hayya, speaking on Al Jazeera, said the souls of Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh -- assassinated in July -- ""are inside the birds of heaven.""

In Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, there were massive demonstrations Saturday night, with people vowing to continue resistance.

Iraqi state television announced a three-day period of mourning to honor the martyrdom of Nasrullah. On the station's official website, it said: ""This heinous crime will enhance the spirit of resistance in people's hearts and enhance the will of victory in facing the mean Zionist entity.""

Some members of Iraq's parliament cried on television on the news of Nasrallah's assassination. One lawmaker vowed that his death would ""open the gates of fire against Zionists.""

Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the killing of Nasrallah, saying it ""is fraught with even greater dramatic consequences for Lebanon and the entire Middle East."" Moscow called on Israel to stop hostilities aimed at Lebanon.

Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, in a post on X, said he had spoken with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Saturday. ""We agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the bloodshed,"" Lammy said, adding that ""a diplomatic solution is the only way to restore security and stability for the Lebanese and Israeli people."""
Analysis: Hassan Nasrallah's killing transforms an already deadly regional conflict,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25311/analysis-hassan-nasrallahs-killing-transforms-an-already-deadly-regional-conflict,2024-09-28T17:59:35Z,"Israel's killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the long-time Hezbollah leader, has transformed an already complex and deadly regional conflict, with a broad array of potential outcomes for Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and beyond.

Prior to the powerful series of airstrikes that hit several residential buildings in southern Beirut on Friday, analysts in the Mideast had speculated that Nasrallah had left Lebanon following the widespread pager explosions earlier this month, but then soon after returned, as the United States presented an initiative that would lead to a 21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel.

Those thousands of remotely detonated blasts -- subsequently sourced to walkie-talkies too -- had targeted members and allies of Hezbollah, and represented a significant blow to the group. A subsequent Israeli airstrike had then killed Hezbollah's chief of staff, and by Friday the Israeli military says Nasrallah was meeting with several other senior commanders.

Amer Al Sabaileh, a Jordanian security expert and close observer of Hezbollah, said the fact Nasrallah was willing to take the high risk to his life of gathering with other Hezbollah commanders amid Israel's campaign indicates the group was in crisis after two weeks of crippling Israeli attacks.

""The level of shock among Hezbollah cannot be measured,"" Al Sabaileh said. ""Simply, they never expected that Israel would initiate and would continue, and does not stop attacking Hezbollah.""

And the regional consequences could be significant too, according to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the British think tank Chatham House.

""Iran will be looking for some way to turn the tables and save some face,"" Vakil wrote in a long series of online posts about the killing and its impact on Iran's so-called ""axis of resistance"" that includes Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups like the Houthis in Yemen. ""The axis has not proven effective at providing Iran deterrence against Israel, or a Gaza cease-fire.""

But Orna Mizrahi, an Israeli security expert from the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said Israel's successes in degrading Hezbollah's leadership structure and military capabilities could be leveraged to reach a lasting agreement that would force Hezbollah forces back from Lebanon's border with northern Israel.

""The weakened and battered state of Hezbollah provides a short window of opportunity to diminish its strategic capabilities further before civilian harm prompts international pressure on Israel to cease operations,"" she wrote in an analysis. ""Simultaneously, Israel must develop a coordinated exit strategy with the U.S. to end the northern conflict.""

Hezbollah's succession plans and the process by which Nasrallah may be replaced are opaque, but should follow a blueprint that saw his own elevation more than 30 years ago, according to Nick Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Middle East Programs and long-time expert of Hezbollah based in Beirut.

""The morale blow is going to be massive for Hezbollah, but technically it should be a repetition of what happened in '92,"" says Blanford. ""The Shura Council sits down and they elect somebody else."""

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher took aim at rapper Macklemore over his ""F--- America"" declaration at an anti-Israel event.

The Grammy-winning artist went viral this week for his appearance at Seattle's ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" which raised money for various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which Israeli officials have declared is strongly tied to Hamas, leading to the firing of nine UNRWA staffers allegedly involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" he said, sparking cheers from the audience.

BILL MAHER: TRUMP IS 'RIGHT' ABOUT THE DANGEROUS RHETORIC AIMED AT HIM, 'BUT HE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!'

That didn't sit well with Maher, who addressed the rapper's declaration during his closing monologue.

""I'm sure it was a big hit with the Queers for Gaza crowd, literally advocating for a government that would imprison you or kill you for being queer from the safety and security of a country that doesn't do that,"" Maher said.

""Yes, America. The only place in the world where a White guy from the suburbs could become a millionaire rapper because here, every person, regardless of race, class or gender has the right to be talent-free,"" he added.

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

In a follow-up statement on Instagram, Macklemore seemed to back down from his attack on America: ""My thoughts and feelings are not always expressed perfectly or politely."" He added, ""Sometimes I slip up and get caught in the moment. Saturday night was one of those times. I strive to always lead with love in an effort to bring people together and never to create more division.""

He concluded, ""Unfortunately, the historic event in my hometown that brought thousands of people together to raise awareness and money for the people of Palestine has become overshadowed by two words. I wish I had been in a better place with my grief and anger. But the truth is I'm not ok. I haven't been.""

Maher began his monologue by praising Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for helping Democrats be more patriotic at this year's DNC convention, but lamented their sentiment hasn't resonated with younger people.

""The protests that started off as justice for Palestine have morphed into a broader kind of America is the problem, 'We f---ed up the whole world' thing,"" Maher said.

""Guess what document allows you to chant 'Hey hey, ho ho' followed by something really stupid,"" Maher asked them before answering with the Constitution.

BILL MAHER MAKES THIS BOLD 2024 PREDICTION AFTER TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE

After citing a study alleging four out of ten Gen Zers believe the Founding Fathers are ""better described as villains,"" Maher noted that how young some of them were including 18-year-old James Monroe, 21-year-old Alexander Hamilton and 25-year-old James Madison.

""They were the Gen Z of their day, and when they were your age, they started a country. What the f--- have you done?"" Maher asked.

""History is complicated, and Gen Z reasoning is not. They think they're pure, but they're really just simplistic. They know two things: White people did some very bad things and- no, that's it. That's all they know,"" Maher said, later adding ""The citizens of Gaza cannot assemble in protest of their own government, cannot do or say what they want or practice whatever religion they want, or have a free press, all rights guaranteed in just our First Amendment! The irony in all of this is that the world the founders birth, flawed though it may be, provides the bedrock for everything that makes life good for the very people who hate them so much.""

""It's so easy to take for granted individual liberty, a bill of rights, the rule of law, checks and balances, getting a trial by jury, the peaceful transfer of power, protecting minority rights and democracy itself, but those are the things that make our pampered, privileged, bratty lives so relatively cushy. No one starves here, even our poor people are fat,"" he continued. ""Why do millions of people every year risk their lives to come here? Because they want what we got! The founders were flawed, but they did build a place the whole world wants to break into. No one is paying a coyote to smuggle them into India or Russia. Immigrants don't see us as the problem.

In a statement released by the group, it said that Nasrallah ""has joined his fellow martyrs."" The official Iranian news agency reported on Saturday that a commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards was also killed alongside Nasrallah.

The Israeli military said it had killed the 64-year-old leader of Hezbollah in what it called a ""targeted strike"" on the group's headquarters on Friday in the southern Beirut neighborhood of Dahiyeh.

A long-time leader of the Iran-backed militia, Nasrallah was born in 1960 to an impoverished family in the north of Lebanon. He was the eldest of nine children and went on to briefly study theology in Iran in 1989.

Before co-founding Hezbollah, Nasrallah learned the ropes in the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary movement. He was chosen to be Hezbollah's chief two days after its leader, Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed by the Israeli military in 1992.

Under Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah became one of the most powerful militias in the Middle East, boasting a military force stronger even than the Lebanese army. Funded by Iran, Hezbollah trained troops from Hamas. His organization also provides social services

Nasrallah led his group into a war that pushed Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an 18-year occupation. His son, Hadi, was killed in fighting with the Israeli army in 1997 -- the same year the U.S designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization.

For much of the last two decades, Nasrallah was only ever seen on TV and never in public for fear of assassination attempts.

But in Lebanon and across the region, Nasrallah has had many admirers. A 2020 report by a London-based think tank, the International Institute of Strategic Studies, estimated that Hezbollah had up to 20,000 active fighters. They see him as someone who stood up to Israeli and Western forces that try to weaken the Middle East."
Israel strikes Hezbollah in blast targeting the militant group's leader,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25272/israel-strikes-hezbollah-in-blast-targeting-leader,2024-09-28T07:58:55Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings.

At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon's health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.

The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.

After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue -- further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.

Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.

The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut's Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon's national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.

Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.

Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made ""Bunker Buster"" guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.

Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.

Israel's air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles.

Israel's military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.

To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah's senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah -- successful or not -- would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.

Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations.

The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah's main headquarters, though it is located in the group's ""security quarters,"" a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.

Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was ""in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.""

The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.

The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people.

The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.

An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military's goals are much narrower.

In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas' military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border -- ""not a high bar like Gaza"" in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women -- 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan -- from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.

""That's Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,"" one man cried out as her body emerged.

Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah's weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel's military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.

But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.

Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut's suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group's drone unit, Mohammed Surour.

People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, ""We will never accept humiliation,"" as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag.

Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.

""We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,"" Fadlallah said. ""There is no place for neutrality in this battle."""

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) announced Saturday morning that it eliminated the head of the Hamas terrorist network in southern Syria.

The Israeli Air Force struck Ahmad Muhammad Fahd following intelligence conducted by the IDF.

Fahd was responsible for carrying out terror attacks against IDF troops and Israel from the area of southern Syria, including by firing projectiles toward the Golan Heights area, according to the IDF.

Pamela Smith/AP hide caption

In a fiery speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is ""winning"" on multiple fronts and would attack Iran and its proxies anywhere in the Middle East, even as Israeli air force jets were preparing to pound a complex of buildings in central Beirut that Israel says serve as a headquarters for the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Many of the delegates inside the U.N. hall stood at the start of his speech -- in which he called the U.N. a ""swamp of antisemitic bile"" -- and swiftly left the room in a public snub.

For days, Arab leaders including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had been assailing the behavior of the Israeli military in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.

Abbas told delegates that Israel did not deserve its U.N. membership, given that its government has, in his words, ""exploited"" the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in Israel to ""launch a comprehensive war of genocide on the Gaza Strip, and committed and continues to commit war crimes recognized by the international community."" Israel has denied committing genocide or other war crimes, arguing that it is fighting to defeat militant groups and defend itself from further attacks.

Netanyahu insisted he traveled to New York after he ""heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium.""

But his trip had been planned well in advance, and though his arrival in New York for the annual General Assembly had been slightly delayed due to domestic considerations, he told the audience of dignitaries and world leaders that he had ""decided to come here and set the record straight.""

""Israel yearns for peace,"" Netanyahu continued during his address Friday. ""Israel has made peace and will make peace again.""

His office soon after his speech confirmed that he would be returning to Israel early from New York.

But nearly a year into Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, the Israeli leader's behavior during many months of on-again-off-again cease-fire negotiations has not only infuriated his political opponents and a sizable chunk of his own citizens, but has confounded many world leaders too.

Critics have often in recent months said that Netanyahu -- whose political savvy has helped him survive repeatedly to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister in history -- will agree to show negotiating flexibility during private meetings, before issuing public statements that block progress during peace talks.

Such contradictions have repeatedly occurred during negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar over a cease-fire in Gaza. And now -- according to Israeli media outlets -- this form of dissembling obstruction has reoccurred in the recent cease-fire proposal developed by the U.S. and France.

Danny Danon, Israel's U.N. ambassador, said the government is pushing for certain terms in any deal. ""If we can achieve the goals of the war through diplomacy, we prefer that,"" he said outside the U.N. Security Council on Friday. ""And the goals are to allow the citizens of Israel, 70,000 refugees to move back to their homes. And to push Hezbollah from the southern Lebanon area.""

In the meantime, Israel has continued its military campaign. Danon said Israeli forces carried out a ""precise attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters"" in Beirut Friday.

As the Israeli military calls up further reserves close to the northern border and responds to Hezbollah rocket fire with dozens of airstrikes in Lebanon, Netanyahu also remains at the center of a high-profile demand for an arrest warrant against him, issued by the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands.

The Israeli premier met with his Dutch counterpart during one of several meetings in New York this week, and raised the proceedings currently underway at the court. According to Netanyahu's office, he insisted during the bilateral conversation that the prosecutor's actions constituted ""a political proceeding based on false libels that endanger every democracy defending itself against terrorism."""
US warships come under attack in Red Sea as nearly two dozen incoming missiles and drones shot down,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-warships-under-attack-red-sea-nearly-2-dozen-incoming-missiles-drones-shot-down,2024-09-27T19:42:40Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst provides details on Israel's latest attack on Hezbollah, as it remains unclear whether Hassan Nasrallah was killed.

Three U.S. warships came under attack Friday off the coast of Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have disrupted commercial shipping in the region, but no one was hurt, officials said.

The warships shot down nearly two dozen incoming missiles and drones while transiting a narrow entrance into the Red Sea. None of the vessels was hit, and no sailors on board were hurt, a U.S. official told Fox News.

The USS Stockdale and USS Spruance, along with a littoral combat ship, the USS Indianapolis, were transiting the Bab al-Mandab Strait when the naval warships came under attack from a barrage of incoming ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones, the officials said.

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""We did see a complex attack launched from the Houthis that ranged from cruise missiles and waves,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday. ""My understanding is that those were either engaged in, shot down or failed.""

The Stockdale and Spruance are part of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group that recently arrived in the Middle East from the Pacific.

U.S. forces have struck back at Houthi militants on multiple occasions for nearly a year. The rebel group has routinely attacked commercial and military vessels at sea over Israel's war against Hamas.

The number of commercial ships passing through the Red Sea has dropped by 90% since the attacks began after the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. Since then, U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack dozens of times. In January, three American soldiers were killed in Jordan.

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

The Houthis recently attacked a Greek-flagged oil tanker, which carried four times the amount of oil that spilled from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. No major oil spill occurred, and officials said the fires on board the vessel were contained.

The ship was towed into port after being adrift in the Red Sea for days with flames visible on deck.

During her debate with former President Trump, Vice President Harris claimed, ""As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.""

At the time of Harris's comments, elite American commandos had just conducted a raid into western Iraq, days prior, to kill ISIS leaders. A number of soldiers were wounded, including one who took shrapnel to his leg, which required surgery.

The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft strike group returned to Norfolk, Virginia, in July after dropping 420 bombs on Houthi targets in Yemen. Warships in the strike group fired 155 interceptor missiles to shoot down incoming Houthi missiles and drones.

Israel says it struck Hezbollah's headquarters as huge explosions rocked Beirut,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5131238/israel-strikes-hezbollah-headquarters-beirut-lebanon,2024-09-27T16:28:26Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said Friday it carried out an airstrike on the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut, where a massive explosion leveled buildings in a southern district, sending clouds of orange and black smoke billowing in the skies.

The strike in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel's campaign against Hezbollah would continue. Not long before the explosion, thousands were massed in the suburb for the funeral of three Hezbollah members, including a senior commander, killed in earlier strikes.

There was no immediate word on casualties in the strike. The Israeli army spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said it targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, located beneath residential buildings. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV said four buildings were reduced to rubble in the blast, so powerful it rattled windows and shook houses some 30 kilometers north of Beirut. Ambulances were seen headed to the scene of the explosions, sirens wailing.

Earlier in the day, an Israeli airstrike killed a family of nine in a Lebanese border village, authorities said, as Lebanon struggled to deal with a rising death toll, a wave of tens of thousands fleeing their homes and the possibility of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel has moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals, further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

That has Lebanese fearing a repeat of the last Israel-Hezbollah war, in 2006, which lasted a month and caused heavy destruction over parts of their country. Or worse, they fear, Lebanon could suffer devastation on the scale caused in Gaza by Israel's nearly yearlong campaign against Hamas.

At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes early Friday, Health Minister Firass Abiad said, bringing the death toll in Lebanon this week to more than 720. He said the dead included dozens of women and children.

The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes over the course of two hours around the south on Friday, including in the cities of Sidon and Nabatiyeh. It said it was targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure. It said Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward the northern Israeli city of Tiberias."

""If you strike us, we will strike you,"" Netanyahu said. ""There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East: Far from being lambs led to the slaughter, Israel's soldiers have fought back with incredible courage and with heroic sacrifice.""

Netanyahu took the podium in front of a partially empty General Assembly, with some delegates walking out, but those gathered to hear him offered raucous applause ahead of his speech. Seemingly absent from the speech was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was hosting a global health security event on the sidelines of UNGA.

He revealed that he almost didn't attend the U.N. High-Level Week, but that he felt a need to ""set the record straight,"" which included laying out the choice the world faces.

Netanyahu brought several families with loved ones held hostage by Hamas terrorists in Gaza to New York and once again called for their freedom, noting that, ""I'll say this one more time, we remain focused on our sacred mission, bringing our hostages home. And we will not stop until that mission is complete.""

THE ONLY THING NETANYAHU CAN DO IS EXUDE STRENGTH IN THE FACE OF HIS ENEMIES: ELIZABETH PIPKO

""Israel seeks peace,"" Netanyahu said. ""Israel yearns for peace. Israel has made peace and will make peace again - yet, we face savage enemies who seek our annihilation, and we must defend ourselves against those savage murderers.""

Netanyahu framed the issue as a choice between ""a blessing or a curse,"" with Iran's ""unremitting aggression"" as the ""curse"" against the ""blessing"" of reconciliation between Arab nations and Israel.

""A normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel seemed closer than ever. But then came the curse of Oct. 7,"" Netanyahu said. ""Thousands of Iranian-backed Hamas terrorist from Gaza burst into Israel in pickup trucks, on motorcycles. And they committed unimaginable atrocities.""

The prime minister hammered again on Iran's aggression, warning that if left unchecked will ""endanger every single country in the Middle East and many, many countries in the rest of the world.""

""Iran seeks to impose its radicalism well beyond the Middle East,"" Netanyahu warned. ""That's why it funds terror networks on five continents. That's why it builds ballistic missiles for nuclear warheads to threaten the entire world.""

""For too long, the world is appeasing Iran. It turns a blind eye to its internal repression. It turns a blind eye to its external aggression,"" he added. ""Well, that appeasement must end, and that appeasement must end now.""

Netanyahu called on the U.N. Security Council to ""snap back"" sanctions against Iran and do everything in the organization's power to ""ensure that Iran never gets nuclear weapons.""

However, he lamented that the organization has an apparent bias against Israel and in favor of the Palestinians, citing the ""automatic majority"" of countries that will vote in favor of any policy that hurts Israel.

""For the Palestinians, this U.N. House of darkness is home court,"" Netanyahu said. ""They know that in this swamp of antisemitic bile, there's an automatic majority willing to demonize the Jewish state on anything in this anti-Israel, flat Earth society. Any false charge, any outlandish allegation can muster a majority.""

""It's always been about Israel, about Israel's very existence, and I say to you, until Israel, until the Jewish state is treated like other nations, until this antisemitic swamp is drained, the U.N. will be viewed by fair minded people everywhere as nothing more than a contemptuous force,"" he added.

""I think it's a clear show that Europe has lost its ability to project geopolitical power, especially into Africa and the Middle East, because we are basically not able to do any kind of measures to stop this irregular migration,"" Lipavsky said.

""When somebody who really has no right for asylum is in Europe, there are no true mechanisms ... so they will need to put more effort into that, definitely,"" he added.

Czechia, also known as the Czech Republic, sits in the middle of Europe and still considers itself the continent's ""natural crossroads,"" which places it in a unique position to discuss matters regarding immigration and conflicts on the border.

Despite that prominent perspective, Lipavsky noted that ""the leadership must come from the big"" countries, as ""that's how things are done in international politics.""

Lipavsky argued that this lack of leadership has made the conflict between Ukraine and Russia more difficult, but he admitted the war helped waken the bloc's members to certain issues they had ignored.

""We have rediscovered our ability, at least in the east, to protect Ukraine, but, still, we need to do more, honestly,"" Lipavsky said. ""I would not say it's a dire situation, but certainly the lack of leadership also could be visible.""

""As minister of foreign affairs from Czechia, I'm trying to come up with proposals. I'm trying to call for common action,"" he continued. ""For example, we are delivering a lot of ammunition to Ukraine. We have this ammunition initiative.""

""Those are hundreds, thousands of shells, which then make a difference on the battlefields - more than words,"" he added.

Lipavsky framed the current state of international politics as one of ""global confrontation,"" with conflicts across multiple regions that impact all nations due to their effects on everything from energy to food supplies and general shipping.

""We see many conflicts in the Middle East,"" Lipavsky said. ""It's not only Gaza or now Lebanon, where the north of Israel is being shelled by rockets for many months, but it is also the navigation in Red Sea, which is being endangered by Houthis, and those are supported by Iran.""

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BACKS UN CLAIM RELIEF WORKERS ACCUSED OF AIDING HAMAS ARE IMMUNE

""This is a very complex matter, and we need to de-escalate,"" he added. ""We need to put a lot of effort into peace, but also not forget that Israel has a right to defend itself.""

Czechia earlier this year voted against the Palestinian States gaining expanded powers in the United Nations and last week was one of 14 countries that voted against a Palestinian-drafted resolution that adopted the International Court of Justice opinion that demanded Israel leave Gaza and the West Bank. Lipavsky explained that the resolution ""skewed in one direction,"" which was ""a very basic reason to vote against"" the resolution.

However, he stressed that Russia remains ""definitely"" the most important crisis facing Czechia and other European countries.

""Russia wants to destroy the complete Ukrainian nation. They want to include them into Russia and ... It's like Hitler during the World War. It's absolutely similar,"" Lipavsky insisted.

""We know that we used to be in a sphere of influence of Soviet Union during Czechoslovakia ... after the Second World War until the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" he said. ""I don't want to happen to Czechia again that some dictator will tell us what to do and what to not and to exploit us.

""So we have to defend from this, from this Russian trust, and then of course, to be a good ally to U.S., and good to NATO,"" he added."

Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.

IN TODAY'S NEWSLETTER:

- Patricia Heaton leads campaign against antisemitism on college campuses

- DOJ backs UN immunity claim of relief workers accused of aiding Hamas

- Gov. Whitmer condemns 'Squad' member's 'antisemitic' attack against Michigan's Jewish AG

TOP STORY: Seeing the stomach-turning Hamas body-cam footage from Oct. 7 prompted beloved ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" star Patricia Heaton to take action. ""I couldn't believe it, and I was outraged,"" the devout Christian told Fox News Channel. She started the October 7th Coalition, or O7C, to encourage people of all faiths to stand up against anti-semitism.

VIDEO: An anti-Israel protester in New York City was seen holding a sign supporting the Hezbollah terror group during a rally as world leaders convened at the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan. In footage captured by FNTV, a masked and hooded protester holds a sign in one hand that reads: ""New York for Hezbollah"" with two red hearts drawn next to the words. In his other hand, he waved a Hezbollah flag.

NO LEGAL RELIEF: Victims of the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and their families don't have the support of The Justice Department in their lawsuit against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). At least nine employees of the UN agency were allegedly found to have participated in the attack, but the DOJ sided with the UN in the federal case, filing a brief stating that the agency is immune and the New York federal court hearing the case lacks jurisdiction.

'HATEFUL RHETORIC': After facing backlash for refusing to defend her state's attorney general against a suggestion of religious bias, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a statement Monday condemning Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for the ""antisemitic"" allegation. ""The suggestion that Attorney General Nessel would make charging decisions based on her religion as opposed to the rule of law is antisemitic,"" Whitmer wrote in a statement

GUEST EDITORIAL: Danny Danon, Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, writes that the global body has forfeited its power to bring peace to the Middle East by repeatedly siding with Iran-sponsored terror groups.

Against the backdrop of Israel's four-front war for its very existence, the United Nations, with the support of anti-Israel elected officials in the U.S. and elsewhere, are circling the wagons to ensure that UNRWA will continue to brainwash generations of Palestinian children to deny the 3,500-year link of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and the Jewish state's legitimacy.

A new bill launched by anti-Israel members in Congress demands that the U.S. resume its funding of UNRWA, which is currently blocked under U.S. law. This initiative comes as the United Nations insists that all UNRWA employees are legally immune from any prosecution.

This presumably includes UNRWA employees who were members of Hamas and who participated in the Oct 7 Hamas crimes against humanity in southern Israel, where 1,200 Israelis, among them entire Jewish families, were mass murdered and mutilated. Young Israeli women in peaceful communities and at the Nova Peace concert raped, with hundreds kidnapped - dead and alive - to be brutalized and bartered by Hamas for the release of thousands of Palestinian terrorists held by Israel.

The audacity and hypocrisy of a renewed pro-UNRWA campaign is breathtaking. The United Nations has done less than zero to gain the release of innocent hostages taken by Hamas on Oct 7. In fact, U.N. officials and special rapporteurs were eerily silent or, worse, excused Hamas' brutal pogrom.

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT. 7

And when it comes to the United Nations, words - spoken and unspoken - do count.

Top U.N. officials we recently met with refused to label Hamas a terrorist organization. That policy allows UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini to insist that, for the U.N., ""Hamas is not a terrorist group... it is a political movement"".

Lazzarini has refused to say whether UNRWA even considers Hamas a ""militant or armed group."" He hasn't said that membership in an armed group is a sufficient cause for not hiring a person by UNRWA or terminating his or her employment.

Lazzarini has not taken any action to enforce the prohibition on membership in armed groups, let alone take steps to ensure to its donor states that it will identify and dismiss employees who are members of armed groups.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

He has neither investigated, suspended nor fired 100 UNRWA staff whom Israel submits are Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad's military operatives.

The bottom line is that the day after the war in Gaza ends, unless there is strong opposition from the United States, Hamas is still well-positioned to take back the reins of power over the lives of the people of Gaza and over the minds and hearts of Palestinian children.

Some months ago, I had the opportunity to speak directly to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department. I told him that UNRWA cannot be part of the solution for ""the day after"" in Gaza when it has been a core problem for decades.

As of now, the plans of the U.S. for the day after in Gaza remain unclear.

MSNBC's Jen Psaki sat down with Doug Emhoff in Wilmington, North Carolina, following a campaign event about Vice President Kamala Harris' economic plans.

Psaki shared a preview of the interview, which focused on Emhoff's connection to his Jewish faith and his efforts to fight antisemitism on ""The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell"" on Thursday night.

The wide-ranging interview will air in full at 12 p.m. Sunday on ""Inside with Jen Psaki.""

Here are four takeaways from the first look:

The second gentleman spoke about how important his faith is to him and how difficult it is for him to publicly confront antisemitism and speak out on behalf of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

""It's something that I've been working on ... speaking about, meeting with released hostages [and] hostage families,"" Emhoff said. ""It's intense, and a lot of times I don't want to do it. It's too raw. It's too emotional for me.""

Emhoff shared that Harris has pushed him to be even more vocal about antisemitism.

He emphasized Harris' dedication to the issue, adding that ""she is the one who keeps pushing me out there because of the responsibility that I have in this role and because she cares about these issues.""

Emhoff also spoke about his commitment to continuing the fight against antisemitism during Harris' administration if she is elected.

""I take being the first Jewish White House principal ever very seriously,"" Emhoff said. ""So when we win, and I am the first Jewish first gentleman, I'm going to continue to speak out very loudly.""

Emhoff said former President Donald Trump should be taken at face value when it comes to his increasingly hateful rhetoric.

Asked by Psaki whether he worries Trump is putting a target on the backs of Jewish Americans, Emhoff said: ""He is. I mean, take him at his word. He lies about a lot of things, but you've got to take him at his word on things like this.""

Emhoff also shared his unvarnished thoughts about North Carolina GOP gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson's racist comments and Trump's refusal to disavow him, saying ""it's pure cowardice"" and adding that Robinson is ""clearly unfit [and] unhinged.""

""The fact that Donald Trump was right here in Wilmington, right where I'm sitting, where he couldn't disavow Mark Robinson ... it's just shameful,"" Emhoff said. ""Donald Trump's the guy who said, 'This guy is a star.' He said, 'He's Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids.' [He] hasn't disavowed any of that. ... Those are the types of candidates that he's supporting, and we can't have it. This shows you yet another of the many, many examples of why Donald Trump is just unfit for any job, let alone president of the United States."""
Serj Tankian Talks New EP 'Foundations' & The Importance Of Recognizing Genocide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/quentinsinger/2024/09/27/serj-tankian-talks-new-ep-foundations--the-importance-of-recognizing-genocide/,2024-09-27T10:41:11Z,"Quentin Singer is music journalist who covers rock and heavy music.

While System of a Down has only continued to grow as one of the most prominent and respected metal outfits, despite not being as active as they were in the early 2000s, vocalist Serj Tankian has remained a prolific artist throughout the several years. In this year alone, the SOAD frontman has published a New York Times best selling memoir, Down with the System, opened his own art gallery café, Kavat Coffee Café and Eye For Sound Gallery, and most recently he's released his brand new EP Foundations, under Gibson Records.

While his new five track EP might not seem as grandiose or ambitious of a project as these other creative endeavors, it's one of the most painstaking and protracted projects Tankian has ever produced -- many songs on the EP were written and recorded over two decades ago, some dating back to early System of a Down and even prior.

For instance, the song ""A.F. Day"" on his new EP resonates with an exhilarating energy that's reminiscent of early SOAD albums like Toxicity, and that's in part because Tankian's vocals on the track were recorded nearly three decades ago. While there's a number of unearthered tracks on Foundations, including ""Cartoon Buyer"" and ""Life's Revengeful Son,"" both of which were recorded prior to 2010 for different solo records of Tankian's, the entire EP is brought together for its cohesive and thought provoking themes.

""Justice Will Shine On,"" might just one of the most important songs of Tankian's musical career, as he recalls the atrocities of the Armenian Genocide that his family and so many other families were victims of, including the families from members of System of a Down. The track is easily the highlight of the EP, and it's haunting melodies brilliantly accentuate it's dark yet poignant subject matter.

Speaking more on the significance of Foundations and how this project along with his many other creative endeavors came together, Serj Tankian discusses his new EP and why songs like ""Justice Will Shine On"" are unfortunately so relevant today.

A big theme of this EP is retrospective, provided many of the songs date back to several different eras of your life. When did you realize you wanted to put together this project?

Serj Tankian: When I was writing the book [Down with the System], I was referencing a lot of music from the past and at the time I was also trying to mix a lot of songs because I had this old car, a Prius, with a sound system that I knew really well. I was using it as a reference monitor. After I would mix in my studio, I would use the Prius as a reference monitor to know how my mix was. So, you know, I was mixing a bunch of songs after releasing the book and I thought to myself god, the book is referencing so many songs. There's all these songs I haven't released from the past and they really speak with each other, there's some comrodary between the book and some of these songs. And these were rock songs that popped out specifically that I really liked and they just came together in an EP.

Despite the title of this EP being Foundations, this EP is not your first release as a solo artists. What's the inspiration behind the title for new EP?

SJ: Interestingly enough, two things one because a lot of the songs hark back from a long time ago, and again with the book, I was talking about my foundational theories and the story of my parents and my life, my foundation. The foundation just kind of made sense as far as a theme. I'm also practicing this training program called foundations training, which is a really great muscle strengthening program for the body that I'm in love with right now, and so it was kind of both, you know. It just made sense. Foundations was something that was in my head and in my life basically.

Songs ""AF Day"" and ""Justice Will Shine On"" you wrote during the early days of System of a Down. Were these songs initially intended for System of the Down or did you always have a different project in mind for them? What ultimately made this EP the right fit for these tracks?

SJ: It's very likely both these songs were actually written prior to System of a Down or in the early System of a Down days. I don't remember, because they're so old to be honest. What I do remember is I don't remember ever bringing ""AF Day"" to System and I don't know why, or maybe I did and we didn't use it. I don't even remember, to be honest. With ""Justice Will Shine On,"" I did bring it in 2015 because we were thinking of doing a few songs. Darren had a song and I had this song for the 100th year commemoration of the Armenian genocide and we worked on it together with the band, but we decided at the time not to release it. So I have worked on it with the band before, but I've released it solo for ""Justice Will Shine On."" The other one I've never worked with the band on and it could predate the band, or at least in the early days of the band. You know, they're so old I can't remember.

In the single ""Justice Will Shine On"" you address some deeply personal and historical trauma tied to the Armenian Genocide. How do you go about channelling such intense emotions and themes into a song such as this, and what impact do you hope this song has on listeners?

SJ: I think, you know, my music's always laden with truths when I write lyrics. I don't write lyrics for people to sing, like most songwriters, I write lyrics for people to listen. So sometimes they're not sing-along-y, but somehow they become sing-along-y, even a thing like ""Prison Song,"" for example, which is a thesis on the three-strike system in the United States, but people sing along to the verses and I'm just like wow, like how is that possible? So I mean, that's just a part of what I do.

Genocide is happening today, as we know. It's happening around the world. In many places there's ICC condemnation and arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu. There's ICC arrest warrants against the leaders of Hamas. Genocide is happening today not just in Israel and Palestine, but also in Artsakh, which is, you know, part of ancient Armenian lands where Azerbaijan came and attacked and basically ethnically cleansed the area of its 120,000 inhabitants only a month before October 7th when the whole Hamas invasion started. So it's something that's happening now, there's indiscriminate killings of civilians, as you can see in Russia and Ukraine. So it's like we haven't learned the lesson. I keep on putting out songs about genocide and I wish there was no need for it, but originally it was for remembrance of my own grandparents, the grandparents of the other guys in System of a Down, all survivors of the genocide and for their memory, but also for the importance for recognition in countries that had not recognized the genocide.

Foundations is being released under the newly established label Gibson Records. What was the experience like working with Gibson Records for this EP? How did Gibson initially get introduced to this project?

SJ: So Gibson Records put out Slash's record [4], a couple of years ago which was really cool. They did a great job doing so, and the CEO of Gibson Records, Cesar Gueikian, is a personal friend of mine, and so I remember when I was mixing the songs I sent him ""Justice Will Shine On"" because he's also Armenian and I thought he would appreciate the messaging, and he loved the song. He goes ""oh my god, I love this song. This is incredible,"" and I said, ""yeah, I'm putting together an EP,"" so it just started in a very kind of friendly, organic way and, yeah, that's really about it.

Between your work as an artist and activist it seems you're always finding ways to keep busy. Between your new memoir, this new EP, and the opening of Kavat Coffee Café and Eye For Sound Gallery all in one year, how has it felt to hit so many creative milestones in 2024?

SJ: I love it. As an artist and as a creator having the diverse avenues of creation within the same limited period of time and being able to kind of almost put them together as a puzzle, like the EP has one of my artworks as the cover and there's just so many elements, and then we do events here for releases at the cafe gallery. So, you know, once the EP, once the vinyl is out, we'll do a signing here, and so it's really great. I just love working here, it's where all of my creative efforts kind of collide in a way, in a positive way, and it's the best thing as an artist.

You only recently opened Kavat Coffee Café and Eye For Sound Gallery. How has curating an artistic space differed from performing or creating art for you, and what ultimately inspired you to create this community hub?

SJ: Well, you know, I've been doing exhibitions with my art for a number of years in different places, but mostly Los Angeles and New Zealand, two places where I paint. Although we've gotten out a little as well and so we were looking for a space for the coffee shop, because I've had my own coffee brand Kavat Coffee, since 2018, and I found this space that we found looks more like an art gallery than a coffee shop, and so the idea of kind of merging those worlds came together.

We have a beautiful merch booth as well, so we have signed merch from myself and from System of a Down. We have an incredible coffee shop that's doing really well, people are loving the coffee. We have an event space in the back, a beautiful space to hang out on a couch and use the ping pong table and stuff. So we've been doing art events, we've been doing book signing events, we've been doing record release events and coffee and new coffee there's just so much going on."

4 Known Unknowns that could scramble the presidential race,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/4-known-unknowns-could-scramble-presidential-race,2024-09-27T09:19:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""Events, dear boy, events."" That's what the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan said remain the greatest challenge facing a political campaign. Back in January 2023, I wrote that the 2024 campaign would likely hinge less on the actual campaigns than on a set of ""Known-Unknowns,"" - the economy, Ukraine, and the Middle East wind up playing out.

At the time, it seemed that President Joe Biden would be running and the GOP nominee wasn't known. Two years later, Biden has been replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump easily sailed to the nomination - but those Known-Unknowns remain, even as polls show minimal shifts in public opinion.

There are four that are likely to change voter's behavior - or not - in the coming weeks.

THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE: TEAMSTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS SUPPORT TRUMP OVER HARRIS

Will further actions by the Federal Reserve change views of the economy? The Fed just announced a 0.5% cut in interest rates, which helped cause Wall Street to achieve an all-time high, and suggested that the economy has done better than many thought just a few months ago. Polls that had recently given Trump the edge in who the voters trust more on the economy now suggest that Harris and Trump are at parity.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

Does Israel's multi-front war further deteriorate and make the Biden-Harris administration look feckless? Following the October 7th massacre of 1,200 Israelis, the Biden administration has sought to facilitate a deal to free the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza - and prevent the war from fully engulfing Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iran, which funds both Hamas and Hezbollah.

Despite multiple trips by U.S. representatives in the region, the U.S. has failed to achieve a ceasefire, nor has it been able to achieve the release of the remaining hostages. A negotiated end to the current war would possibly help Harris, but that seems highly unlikely at this late date. Conversely, if the conflict expands to a full-scale war with Hezbollah, it would give Trump an opportunity to highlight the incumbent administration's inability to control the situation.

Does the Ukraine War look to be better than a stalemate and a war of attrition with Russia? In recent weeks, Ukraine's decision - without the U.S. blessing - to invade and capture territory in Russia seems to have allowed Ukraine to appear more like the plucky successful defenders that initially pushed Russia back in 2022. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been visiting Biden and Harris at the White House.

Given that Trump has claimed that he could end the war quickly, and given that he pointedly chooses not to say that he wants Ukraine to win the war, and given that polls continue to show that most Americans support the Ukrainian war effort, any signs that the Biden-Harris administration is having an impact in helping them achieve that could redound to Harris's benefit.

Appalachian Aggression vs. Minnesota Knice™ on October 1. The conventional wisdom is that vice presidents don't matter. That's the conventional wisdom, but in three of the last six elections - 2000, 2012, and 2016 - the Vice Presidential Debate actually changed the trajectory of the election.

Republican Dick Cheney (2000) decisively won his debate against Democrat Joe Lieberman; then-vice President Joe Biden (2012) was able to arrest Obama's falls after his bad first debate; and similarly, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence was able to change Trump's polling trajectory after his bad performance in the first debate against Hillary Clinton.

This year, while GOP Candidate JD Vance seems to be polling poorly, he's proven himself highly effective in many interviews, his legal background may help him make the case against Democrat Tim Walz, and he knows how to embody the grievances that have fueled the MAGA movement.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

That said, Walz may appear folksy, but he knows how to throw a populist punch as well (How often does he mention Vance and Yale in the same sentence?). Both these Midwesterners are shrewd - and they'll be armed to try to affect the trajectory of the race.

Those are just the Four ""Known-Unknowns."" Then there's always the possibility of ""Unknown-Unknowns"" - for example a terrorist act that might bring into focus the sense of the different approaches to terrorism that Trump and Harris appear to represent. One has no idea how it - or something else - may play out.

Political analysts like to focus on the dynamics of campaigns: fundraising, digital and television ad spending, press conferences, and so-called ""Get-Out-The-Vote"" efforts. But, if one really wants to know what's going to happen in an election, it's usually worth looking outside the campaign and study what the voters are experiencing."
"Harvard went easy on students for antisemitic conduct, House committee finds",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/harvard-went-easy-students-antisemitic-conduct-house-committee-finds,2024-09-27T08:07:24Z,"Jewish activist and recent Harvard graduate Shabbos Kestenbaum, a registered Democrat, tells Fox News Digital he's decided to endorse former President Trump in 2024 because Kamala Harris ""does not deserve our support.""

Harvard University failed to crack down hard enough on students for antisemitic conduct that violated the Ivy League school's own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which has been investigating anti-Israel demonstrations that gripped American college campuses in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel.

Harvard brought disciplinary cases against 68 students related to an April 24 to May 14 campus encampment, according to documents obtained by the committee. Of those 68, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not in good standing due to disciplinary probation, and one is on leave.

The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

""Harvard failed, end of story,"" Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""These administrators failed their Jewish students and faculty, they failed to make it clear that antisemitism will not be tolerated, and in this case, Harvard may have failed to fulfill its legal responsibilities to protect students from a hostile environment. The only thing administrators accomplished is appeasing radical students who have almost certainly returned to campus emboldened and ready to repeat the spring semester's chaos. Harvard must change course immediately.""

JEWISH DEMOCRAT SUING HARVARD OVER ANTISEMITISM CHASTISES HIS PARTY FOR INACTION, ENDORSES TRUMP

According to a summary of its findings provided to Fox News Digital, ""Harvard investigated and documented student violations of its policies, some of which were deemed to warrant semesters-long suspensions, but ultimately failed to enforce its own rules and impose meaningful discipline.""

The committee added that discipline ""would have been consistent with the Harvard Corporation's pronouncement that 'calls for violence' and academic disruptions would 'not be tolerated,'"" asserting that ""[t]he records, however, reveal that Harvard failed to fulfill this commitment and has permitted students to engage in such conduct with no real consequences.""

Between Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages into the Gaza Strip, and April 24, 2024, when an anti-Israel encampment formed on the university's campus, ""Harvard failed to impose any formal discipline on any students,"" the committee said in the summary of its findings.

Before the encampment was erected, the committee said, ""Harvard only referred 12 students for discipline for conduct related to two antisemitic incidents: the November 16-17, 2023, occupation of University Hall and the disruption of classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants on November 29, 2023."" The committee added that no students received formal discipline for these incidents and ""all remain in good standing.""

""Harvard has also failed to hold student groups accountable for antisemitic conduct. On September 10, the Harvard Crimson reported that Harvard lifted the April 22 suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC),"" the committee wrote, noting that this makes the group eligible for school funding. ""This reversal comes despite the role of PSC and its membership in organizing the unlawful Harvard encampment through the unrecognized group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP).""

The Crimson reported that while PSC itself was not listed as an encampment organizer, many of its members are part of HOOP, and the two groups work together to coordinate their Instagram posts.

HARVARD SLAMMED FOR 'SMOKE AND MIRRORS' ANTISEMITISM RESPONSE: 'THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS WORSE'

The committee noted that Harvard College's Administrative Board downgraded the sanctions of 35 students it initially voted to place on disciplinary probation from a period of six months or longer to periods of less than two months.

""This diminishment meant that none of these students initially slated for longer probation periods remained on probation at the start of the fall 2024 semester,"" their report says.

The board ""initially voted to suspend five students for a year or more for encampment-related conduct violations, but then downgraded their sanctions to probation of no more than a semester,"" the committee said, arguing that those students ""therefore appear to have faced no consequential discipline.""

Documents obtained by the committee show that every Harvard College student who appealed their encampment-related disciplinary sanctions had their sanctions downgraded.

The report cites how one student who participated in the encampment and raised a Palestinian flag over University Hall, which sits on Harvard Yard, ""was initially informed he would receive a three-semester suspension."" But that three-semester suspension was downgraded to probation until Dec. 20, 2024. The committee found four other students who participated in the encampment were each initially told they would be required to withdraw for two terms, but each of these suspensions was downgraded ""to the significantly weaker penalty of probation"" until Oct. 21, 2024.

The committee found that Harvard did not implement any consequences for students who occupied University Hall and who interrupted classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants.

Nine Harvard students who occupied University Hall on Nov. 16-17, 2023, ""received no formal disciplinary consequences at all"" despite having ""disrupted normal business operations by making loud noises and chanting, with the goal of occupying the building,"" the committee said. Instead, they received informal ""admonishments,"" which, according to Harvard, are ""not considered a formal disciplinary action.""

The five Harvard students who interrupted economics and statistics classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants, including ""From the river to the sea"" and ""Globalize the intifada,"" on Nov. 29, 2023, received no formal disciplinary consequences, the committee wrote, ""and were instead only 'admonished.'"" Two of those students had also been involved in the occupation of University Hall just weeks before.

Meet the man in charge of prosecuting war crimes : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/1201730548/meet-the-man-in-charge-of-prosecuting-war-crimes,2024-09-27T02:02:55Z,"International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan.

When thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded throughout Lebanon last week, it was a success for the planners of the attack.

Was it also a war crime, with dozens of people killed and some 3,000 people injured?

That type of question, along with all of the ensuing questions about whether to prosecute, how to prosecute, falls to Karim Khan, the lead prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, which was set up two decades ago to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity.

As for saying whether the attack constitutes a war crime, Khan says he can't answer.

""I need to be very disciplined, in terms of what I say. We don't have jurisdiction in relation to Lebanon. Lebanon is not a state party, unlike Palestine. We're focusing on situations that are clearly, we say, within our jurisdiction.""

Back in May, the ICC applied for arrest warrants against leaders of Hamas, and Israeli leaders Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

Last week, Israel's foreign ministry filed a petition to appeal the warrant, and the foreign ministry says that the ICC failed to, ""provide Israel with the opportunity to exercise its right to investigate by itself the claims raised by the prosecutor before proceeding.""

Does Khan agree with that assessment?

""Well, no is the short answer. I've said it repeatedly, publicly, that we're investigating, only the crimes alleged against Hamas but also that Israel and leaders in Israel have responsibilities to comply with international law,"" Khan told Consider This host Mary Louise Kelly.

""I was investigating, and there was no applications by Israel since 2021 until today. But we'll deal with the filings in the normal way. It would only be right to respond first to the judges.""

Other major leaders have also criticized this move, namely President Biden, who has called the application for warrants against Israeli leaders 'outrageous' and said that they implied an equivalence between Hamas and Israel.

""You know, U.S. values make it clear that every individual has rights. The United States doesn't say Hispanics or Blacks or whites or people from the East Coast or West Coast have different rights. I say the same thing,"" Khan said.

""As an officer of the court, the umbrella of the law should apply equally. And I have just as much compassion for Kfir Bibas, who was a 10-month-old snatched from a kibbutz that I visited and taken by Hamas, as I do for children 10 months old or younger or older that have also died in Gaza.""

Last month, Khan addressed the U.N. Security Council regarding the civil war in Sudan that has also led to a humanitarian crisis involving starvation and mass death and displacement.

He said the ICC is not and never has been a silver bullet, and that to solve crises of the world, it requires the support of states. So what support is needed?

""After the horrors of the second world war, we gave a promise of never again. How do we build that confidence if there's not a proper solution in Darfur? At the moment, people are being hunted down and killed because of the color of their skin and because of a sense of impunity that has built up over 20 years. We don't have a police force. We don't have military. We need states to live up to their responsibilities - that's, first and foremost, Sudan,"" Khan said.

""And then also, African Union, the United Nations and powerful states, including the United States of America, the European Union - everybody should care that the allegations are so horrendous of famine, of starvation, of rape on a big scale. We need that support in terms of enforcement, and we haven't seen it,"" he added."
"Over 90,000 people in Lebanon had to flee Israel's bombardments this week",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5127325/israel-hezbollah-conflict-lebanon-displaced-residents,2024-09-26T21:08:38Z,"BEIRUT -- Around the concrete courtyard of Ahliah School in the center of Lebanon's capital, families perch on plastic chairs, sharing news of what houses they've heard have been destroyed in their villages near the southern border with Israel.

Many arrived Tuesday, fleeing south Lebanon amid what Lebanese authorities have called the largest displacement of its citizens in decades. More than 90,000 people fled their homes in intense Israeli attacks that killed almost 600 people in just two days this week, according to the United Nations' humanitarian coordination office.

The attacks that Israeli said were aimed at Hezbollah fighters and installations were an intensification of nearly a year of Israel and the militant Lebanese group trading rocket, missile and drone strikes across the Israeli-Lebanese border since the start of the Gaza war last October.

Many Lebanese fleeing the south took refuge with relatives in Beirut and other places, or searched for apartments to rent. But according to the U.N., about 40,000 of them sought shelter in more than 200 schools, which the Lebanese government asked to accommodate displaced people.

Outside the metal gates of the century-old Ahliah School cars full of exhausted-looking passengers pulled up on Tuesday. An aid official waved them on to other schools serving as temporary shelters. With more than 600 arriving in 24 hours, there was no room left.

It was supposed to be the first day of classes at the K-12 private school. Instead, Ahliah had to clear out desks, piling them up in the hallways, and make room for families to move in.

Children's laundry hung from some of the classroom windows to dry. But most of the families arrived with nothing at all -- only the clothes they were wearing.

One couple sat scrolling through social media videos to try to see whether their home was still standing. For security reasons, they asked to be identified as Um Ali and Abu Ali, which means their son Ali's mother and father, respectively.

Um Ali says she was told that 18 houses in the neighborhood in a southern Lebanese village had been destroyed.

Their 12-year-old daughter was so traumatized by the airstrikes and their escape that she has barely spoken, Um Ali says.

""The airstrikes were right next to our cars and the children were screaming and crying,"" she says. With her husband's arm bandaged and in a cast after being hit by shrapnel a month ago from an Israeli airstrike, the mother bundled 10 family members into a car and drove south on Monday.

She says as they drove away there was blood ""all over the street. You'd see a child lying in front of you bleeding and you can't do anything to help.""

There were so many people fleeing south Lebanon on Monday, Lebanese soldiers turned the divided highway into a single route north. A 50-mile drive which normally would have taken an hour stretched in seven or eight hours, as panicked families crammed into any vehicle they could find.

Um Ali says in addition to not talking, her daughter has been unable to sleep and her heart races. Standing behind her mother, the girl says she's OK, but then buries her face in her mother's shoulder and starts to cry.

Her father says it is understandable that fighters would suffer in a war. But the effect on children is a different matter.

""Suddenly someone comes and makes your kids live in a state of fear, blood and destruction,"" says her mother. ""Nobody accepts living like that -- to be humiliated and see their lives torn apart.""

""Would Americans accept that for their children?"" the father, Abu Ali, asks.

It was too soon for the sense of loss that follows displacement to kick in. Abu Ali, a construction worker, and his wife refer to life in their border village in the present tense.

""We have a normal life,"" he says. ""My wife is at home, my kids are in school, and we have a nice house in the south with fresh air.""

""I grow everything and raise a few sheep,"" adds Um Ali, her face for a moment radiant with the memory of life in the countryside. ""We live a happy and beautiful life.""

The Israeli military says it is targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah, designated by the U.S. and other countries as a terrorist group, and its weapons and rocket launchers in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa region to the northeast. Israel has hit targets north of Beirut and in Beirut's southern suburbs as well. The strikes have also killed and injured civilians, including hundreds of children.

Hezbollah began attacks last October to support Hamas in its fight against Israel in Gaza. Despite intense efforts by the United States and France to broker a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, Hezbollah has made clear that it will stop only when the fighting in Gaza stops.

The militant group is still reeling from unprecedented attacks recently, including explosions of thousands of its pagers and walkie-talkies last week that killed dozens of people, including children, and injured more than 3,500 others, according to Lebanese health officials. Israel is widely believed to be responsible for having detonated the devices, but the Israeli government has not confirmed any involvement.

Behind the school, a few boys kick around a blue ball on a concrete soccer field. In the courtyard, two sisters from the border town of Nabitieh sit on a low wall. The younger is 18 -- her nails recently manicured in a bright purple. Her sister, 20, has long dark hair that is carefully styled.

The younger one struggles to describe how terrifying it was experiencing the airstrikes and then scrambling to flee.

""It was so scary -- not a little, a lot,"" she says, adding they slept in their clothes when the strikes began during the night to be able to flee early the next morning.

""Every night the planes would pass by to scare us,"" says her older sister. ""There were sonic booms and strikes that were very close.""

Neither wants their name used out of fear for their security.

On the long terrifying drive to Beirut they say they recited the shahada -- the Muslim prayer before death -- over and over in case their car was hit.

By the time they reached the southern suburbs late on Monday, where they had planned to stay, Israeli aircraft were launching strikes there too, forcing them to seek shelter in the city center. Israel has repeatedly hit the mostly Shia suburb of Dahiya, targeting Hezbollah commanders but also killing civilians in the densely populated area.

The streets of the capital are packed with displaced families. And for those who can afford it, so are the hotels. At the reception desk of one, a man asked for five rooms -- but only for a night until the family figure out their options.

Outside another downtown hotel, the cafe tables are full of families with plastic bags of snacks.

""We have been trying to find an apartment but everyone now wants so much money, or six months in advance,"" says a woman, sitting with her sister at one table. Like most displaced people, they did not want to be identified because they said they were afraid they could be targeted by Israel.

The woman, a supermarket cashier, says she left so quickly she did not even have her identification with her.

""The missiles were falling like rain,"" she says. She and her sister have lived through three wars with Israel.

But this one, she insists, has already been the worst."

GOP gains voter advantage in Pennsylvania swing county near Biden's birthplace,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-gains-voter-advantage-pa-swing-county-near-biden-birthplace,2024-09-26T20:05:29Z,"Former President Trump told supporters at a rally in Mint Hill, North Carolina, Wednesday he is returning to speak in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a July 13 campaign speech there was cut short by an assassination attempt against him.

A key Pennsylvania swing county just a few miles southwest of President Biden's birthplace has swung to the Republicans' favor in voter registration figures, a county party district officer confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Luzerne County, home of the Democratic stronghold of Wilkes-Barre, and surrounded by working-class cities like Hazleton and Pittston, is now light red, with at least 83 more Republicans on the rolls than Democrats as of Thursday.

""We'd all like to thank the Democrats and the Democratic platform because they're the ones that really inspired people to leave the party and become Republicans,"" Luzerne County GOP 119th District Chairman T.J. Fitzgerald said Thursday.

""They get most of the credit, then, of course, the [GOP] grassroots and people themselves.""

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN WILKES-BARRE SAY

Fitzgerald, who represents the Nanticoke, Sugar Notch and Plymouth areas in the county party structure, said it was a combined effort of the Luzerne County GOP, Early Vote Action leader Scott Presler and the Trump Force organization that drove new registrants to file with the clerk's office.

Fitzgerald claimed there are also several thousand voter registration forms yet to be processed by county officials in Wilkes-Barre. The trend would suggest somewhere around two-thirds could go to the Republicans, he said, citing information from a recent meeting he attended.

Fitzgerald also leads the separate, grassroots group Luzerne County Republicans, adding the group's work is likely to make a difference in key races this fall. He cited contests between Sen. Bob Casey Jr., D-Pa., and David McCormick and Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., against Rob Bresnahan.

""I think a lot of the state representatives are going to get the coattails of Donald Trump, and they're going to come in as well,"" he added.

While Luzerne is home to former Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., neighboring Lackawanna County is better known for Democrats Joe Biden and Casey and his late father.

Luzerne County Democratic Party Chairman Tom Shubilla reacted to the news by saying his focus is actually getting voters to the polls.

""This is something [the Republicans] have been talking about for a while,"" he said. ""We're ... making sure [voters] have returned their mail-in ballot or whether they could vote early ... so that's not really my primary focus.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS'

""I really don't think that's going to be a game changer one way or the other. ... What if they don't go?""

Shubilla said Luzerne has been a ""purple county"" for a long time and that Pennsylvania likes to vote ""split-ticket.""

""We got to see a lot of people get involved for the first time, or a very long time,"" he said, adding some of those supporters may not have been as active since 2008 when Barack Obama entered the political scene.

In that regard, Luzerne County did vote for the Illinois Democrat before supporting Trump in both of his recent bids despite its Democratic majority in voter registration at the time.

Before then, the last Republican to win the working-class county was George H.W. Bush, against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in 1988."
"Palestinian President Abbas slams Israel, US during UN speech as critics decry his support for terrorism",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/palestinian-president-abbas-slams-israel-us-during-un-speech-critics-decry-his-support-terrorism,2024-09-26T16:47:24Z,"JERUSALEM -- Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority, once again delivered a stridently anti-Israel speech at the U.N. on Thursday, where he also praised the anti-Israel protests across the U.S. and condemned Washington for its support of Israel.

Abbas, who presented a 12-point plan for a post-war Gaza that calls for a permanent cease-fire, accused the Jewish state of committing genocide, while calling for its expulsion from the U.N. and taking aim at the Biden Administration for vetoing Security Council resolutions on the issue, while supplying arms to the Israelis.

He charged the U.S. ""furnished Israel with the deadly weapons that it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians, children and women. And this further encouraged Israel to continue with aggression.""

Abbas started his speech by questioning Israel's legitimacy: ""We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave. Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers, our grandfathers. It will remain ours. And if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""Abbas spoke for 26 minutes and did not say the word 'Hamas' once. Since the massacre of October 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon charged in a statement following the speech.

Yet while leaders from around the world watched his UNGA speech, some critics complain the 88-year-old's rule and domination of Palestinian politics in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria in Israel) has done little for the Palestinian cause.

Abbas was born Safed duing the British mandate period [now in Israel]). His family fled to Syria when Arab armies invaded Israel to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state.

Abbas has been accused of rewarding Palestinian terrorism via the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that supports financial stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their family members.

He has also garnered a reputation over the decades as an anti-American agitator who stokes wild antisemitic conspiracy theories. Just last month, Abbas delivered a speech to the Turkish parliament, where he announced that that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

Asaf Romirowsky, executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME), told Fox News Digital that ""Mahmoud Abbas aka Arafat's appointed successor after 20 years has done what Arafat hoped he would, that is maintain a Palestinian stasis while at the same time refusing to root out the corruption within the PA or combat terrorism. Further, as he has shown during his recent speech in the Turkish Parliament, a clear allegiance to Hamas and an endorsement of 10/7, underscoring the consistent antisemitism of his leadership.""

Romirowsky added ""With no heir apparent, Abbas's legacy, as was Arafat's, is that of self-inflicted victimology while maintaining wealth on the back of his own people in the name of the so-called Palestinian struggle.""

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

Fox News Digital reported shortly after Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people in Israel on October 7, including over 30 Americans, that the Abbas' PA might compensate convicted Hamas terrorists for their role in the attack.

Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Fox News Digital the PA and Abbas ""duplicate all of the corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency of the Palestine Liberation Organization"" that was created by Arafat.

He said ""Abbas does not accept the basic right of the Jewish people to self-determination, and therefore he doesn't recognize the right of the state of Israel to be a nation state of the Jewish people in any borders.""

Michael, who is affiliated with the Misgav Institute continued, ""He has not educated the young generation and has not educated PA officials for peace. On the contrary, Abbas has led and enabled the indoctrination toward hatred and toward delegitimization of the state of Israel.""

In contrast to the U.S.-designated terrorist movement, Hamas, Abbas and the PA are considered to be relatively moderate, according to some Mideast observers.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported Abbas, issued a shocking diatribe against Israel in the German capital of Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming that the Jewish state has carried out ""50 Holocausts.""

Abbas refused to apologize (or aid in a professional inquiry) in Berlin at the time of the Palestinian Black September massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer during the 1972 Munich Olympics."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shut down reports of a cease-fire at the Israel-Lebanon border on Thursday, saying he ""did not even respond"" to the U.S. proposal.

Netanyahu vowed to continue fighting both in Gaza and against Hezbollah ""with full force."" The statement comes as Israel stands on the brink of all-out war with Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy terrorist group that operates in Lebanon.

The Commanding Officer of the IDF Home Front Command, MG Rafi Milo, said Israeli forces are currently engaged in ""a very significant offensive effort.""

""We have set a very, very clear goal. We want to change the security reality in the north fundamentally. So that we can bring the residents back home with security, with a sense of security, and truly change the security situation.

US and allies call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24617/us-and-allies-call-for-an-immediate-21-day-cease-fire-between-israel-and-hezbollah,2024-09-26T03:51:52Z,"NEW YORK -- The U.S., France and other allies jointly called Wednesday for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days.

The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is ""intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.""

""We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,"" the statement said. ""We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.""

There was no immediate reaction from the Israeli or Lebanese governments -- or Hezbollah -- but senior U.S. officials said all parties were aware of the call for a cease-fire. Earlier, representatives for Israel and Lebanon reiterated their support for a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group.

The U.S. hopes the new deal could lead to longer-term stability along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Months of Israeli and Hezbollah exchanges of fire have driven tens of thousands of people from their homes, and escalated attacks over the past week have rekindled fears of a broader war in the Middle East.

The U.S. officials said Hezbollah would not be a signatory to the cease-fire but believed the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance with the group. They said they expected Israel to ""welcome"" the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday.

While the deal applies only to the Israel-Lebanon border, the U.S. officials said they were looking to use a three-week pause in fighting to restart stalled negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, after nearly a year of war in Gaza.

The nations calling for a halt to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict are the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

Work on the proposal came together quickly this week with President Joe Biden's national security team, led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, meeting with world leaders in New York and lobbying other countries to support the plan, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic conversations.

Blinken first raised the proposal with the French foreign minister Monday and then broadened his outreach that evening at a dinner with the foreign ministers of all the Group of Seven industrialized democracies.

During a meeting Wednesday morning with Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers, Blinken approached Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to ask their approval and got it. Blinken and senior White House adviser Amos Hochstein then met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who signed off on the deal.

Sullivan, Hochstein and senior adviser Brett McGurk were also in touch with Israeli officials about the proposal, one of the U.S. officials said. McGurk and Hochstein have been the White House's chief interlocutors with Israel and Lebanon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas launched the war in Gaza.

The officials said the deal crystallized by late Wednesday afternoon during a conversation on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly between Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Blinken expects to meet Netanyahu's top strategic adviser in New York on Thursday ahead of the prime minister's arrival.

An Israeli official said Netanyahu has given the green light to pursue a possible deal, but only if it includes the return of Israeli civilians to their homes. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the U.N. Security Council during a special meeting that ""we are counting on both parties to accept it without delay"" and added that ""war is not unavoidable.""

At the meeting, Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, publicly threw his support behind the French-U.S. plan that ""enjoys international support and which would put an end to this dirty war.""

He called on the Security Council ""to guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Lebanese territories and the violations that are repeated on a daily basis.""

Israel's U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, told journalists that Israel would like to see a cease-fire and the return of people to their homes near the border: ""It will happen, either after a war or before a war. We hope it will be before.""

Addressing the Security Council later, he made no mention of a temporary cease-fire but said Israel ""does not seek a full-scale war.""

Both Danon and Mikati reaffirmed their governments' commitment to a Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war. Never fully implemented, it called for a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon to be replaced by Lebanese forces and U.N. peacekeepers, and the disarmament of all armed groups including Hezbollah.

Earlier Wednesday, Biden warned in an appearance on ABC's ""The View"" that ""an all-out war is possible"" but said he thinks the opportunity also exists ""to have a settlement that can fundamentally change the whole region.""

Biden suggested that getting Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire could help achieve a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

That war is approaching the one-year mark after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking hostages. Israel responded with an offensive that has since killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not provide a breakdown of civilians and fighters in their count.

""It's possible and I'm using every bit of energy I have with my team ... to get this done,"" Biden said. ""There's a desire to see change in the region.""

The U.S. government also raised the pressure with additional sanctions targeting more than a dozen ships and other entities it says were involved in illicit shipments of Iranian petroleum for the financial benefit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah."

The Biden administration is in discussions with Israel and other nations to secure a temporary ceasefire between the Jewish state and Hezbollah, amid fears of a wider war breaking out in the region, Fox News has learned.

The effort comes as Israel and the Iran-backed, Lebanon-based terror group continue to exchange intense missile fire.

""We know tensions are high, but we also see that there is a path forward for diplomacy, and that's why you're seeing this administration push so hard to get this done,"" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, told reporters Wednesday.

The proposal is for a temporary ceasefire that would last a few weeks -- the hope being that it could lead to something permanent. The plan began to come together following a Monday phone call between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer.

HOW A US-BACKED UN RESOLUTION FAILED TO STOP HEZBOLLAH TERROR TAKEOVER: 'BIPARTISAN FAILURE'

France has been involved in the discussions, as have other Arab countries with which the U.S. regularly partners.

The U.S. effort to secure the ceasefire isn't tethered to efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the release of hostages in Gaza.

Lebanese officials said a massive Israeli barrage killed at least 560 people on Monday, prompting thousands to flee southern Lebanon. Israeli forces have continued to carry out dozens of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets within Lebanon following months of attacks by the terror group targeting Israeli soil.

Hezbollah said it launched missiles at eight different targets within Israel early Tuesday. The Israeli military said it tracked 55 rockets fired out of Lebanon and landing in Israel.

Brandeis University President Will Resign Following No-Confidence Vote,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2024/09/25/brandeis-university-president-will-resign-following-no-confidence-vote/,2024-09-25T18:12:22Z,"Brandeis University President Ronald Liebowitz announced today that he will resign on November 1. The surprise decision comes in the wake of a recent vote of no-confidence vote against Liebowitz by the Brandeis faculty.

The no-confidence motion passed by a narrow margin, with 159 faculty voting in favor, 149 voting against, and 26 abstaining. According to Jeffrey Lenowitz, chair of Brandeis Faculty Senate, 76.4% of eligible voters participated.

""There were ten more votes in favor than against,"" Lenowitz said in a statement quoted by Boston.com. ""This reveals what our multiple faculty conversations and debates on it made clear: while faculty are united in their care for Brandeis and their great desire for it to flourish, they are divided on this motion.""

The no-confidence motion was first introduced at a special faculty meeting last May, according to the Justice, the Brandeis student newspaper, but it was not voted on until this month. It reads: ""The Faculty note with grave concern a consistent pattern of damaging errors of judgment and poor leadership by President Liebowitz. The results this year include badly handled budget shortfalls, failures of fundraising, excessive responses to student protests, indifference to faculty motions, and the recent damaging staff layoffs. The faculty have no confidence in the President's leadership and we call upon the Board of Trustees to act.""

Brandeis was one of many campuses that saw anti-Israel protesters over the Hamas terror attack against Israel last year, and Liebowitz drew the ire of many faculty for taking a hard-line stance against the protesters.

In his letter to the Brandeis community, Liebowitz wrote that he was resigning ""with mixed emotions because this is an exceptional institution, which carries great meaning, especially at this time, due to the reason for its founding. At the same time, this is a valuable moment for me and for Jessica to build on our experiences to create new pathways for innovation and reform in higher education, and I resign knowing that the university will be in good hands.""

""The entire Board of Trustees thanks President Liebowitz for his commitment, dedication, and significant accomplishments during this tenure,"" said Brandeis Board of Trustees Chair Lisa Kranc, in a statement. ""Ron has faithfully championed Brandeis' core and founding principles. While many have chosen to stay silent, Ron has had the moral courage to be a leading voice in recognizing that we cannot cower from any form of hatred, especially antisemitism.""

Kranc's message also included the announcement that Arthur E. Levine, Ph.D., a Brandeis graduate and the former president of Branford College and the Teachers College at Columbia University, will begin on November 1 as interim president.

Liebowitz's decision to resign is consistent with a trend revealed in other instances of no-confidence votes against college presidents. While such votes carry no legal authority to remove a president from office, the majority of presidents who are the targets of such votes leave their positions within a year of the action.

One frequently cited study published in the Journal of Research on the College President, analyzed press accounts of no-confidence votes over a two-year period. Institutions identified as having such a vote conducted by an official faculty group regarding their president or chancellor were studied further to identify whether there was a campus leadership change within six months of it. Votes meeting this definition were identified at 57 unique institutions.

Of the 57 cases studied, the campus leader was removed from office in 32 instances, or 56% of the time, within six months of the actual vote. The authors found that two-thirds (21) of the 32 departures were non-voluntary on the part of the president.

In addition, a 2022 analysis by The Chronicle of Higher Education found that of 235 no-confidence votes between 1989 and 2022, 51% of the presidents on the receiving end had left office within a year, even though their departures were seldom publicly linked to the vote."
Justice Department backs UN claim relief workers accused of aiding Hamas are immune,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-department-backs-un-claim-relief-workers-allegedly-involved-hamas-attacks-have-diplomatic-immunity,2024-09-25T16:07:20Z,"Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson reports on the president's response to conflicts around the world and his address to the United Nations on 'Special Report.'

The Justice Department (DOJ) has sided with the United Nations in defending in court its relief agency for Palestinians after some workers were found to have likely been involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) fired at least nine of its employees in August after finding that they likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans.

Victims of the massacre and their families sued UNRWA in a New York federal court, accusing the group and the individuals involved of aiding and abetting Hamas ""in the commission of international torts.""

The United Nations (U.N.) says the lawsuit should be dismissed, claiming the charter between the U.S. and the U.N. gives the group and its subsidiaries diplomatic immunity. ""Since the U.N. has not waived immunity in this instance, its subsidiary, UNRWA, continues to enjoy absolute immunity from prosecution, and the lawsuit should be dismissed,"" the U.N. stated in response.

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT. 7

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams of the Southern District of New York filed a brief in July supporting that argument, saying, ""In light of the United Nations' immunity, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the United Nations.""

The brief notes that ""the United States acknowledges and deplores the profound losses suffered on October 7,"" and that ""the United States takes no position on the factual allegations in the complaint.""

""The United Nations is absolutely immune from suit and legal process absent an express waiver of immunity,"" Williams said, citing the Charter of the United Nations, to which the United States acceded in 1945, that says the U.N. ""shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment [sic] of its purposes.""

Similarly, the individual defendants in the lawsuit also enjoy immunity from suit as U.N. employees, the brief said.

Among other things, the DOJ's brief says that the victims' lawsuit alleges that UNRWA ""knowingly provided monetary and material support to Hamas to build its 'terror infrastructure' leading up to the Oct. 7 attacks, facilitated the construction of Hamas command and control centers, permitted weapons storage in UNRWA facilities, concealed rocket and rocket-launching materials on UNRWA premises, and that that UNRWA chose Hamas-approved textbooks for its schools that were used to indoctrinate children against Israel.""

The suit also alleges UNRWA ""knew several local staff were affiliated with Hamas and paid staff ""in a fashion calculated to further enrich Hamas,"" according to Williams' brief.

UN FORCED TO FIRE 9 EMPLOYEES OVER LIKELY INVOLVEMENT IN HAMAS MASSACRE: 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG'

Mark Goldfeder, director of the National Jewish Advocacy Center, said that DOJ's brief outlining the scope of UNRWA's immunity ""makes a lot of assumptions"" and exhibits a ""lack of appetite on behalf of the executive branch to go after supporters of terror.""

""There are also multiple technical arguments to be made here that UNRWA is not actually immune,"" Goldfeder said in a statement on X, directed at the Justice Department.

""The treaties above are not self-executing; it is only an affiliated organization and was never itself designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act of 1945,"" he continued. ""It saddens me that you chose to simply assume that UNRWA's positions are correct, instead of engaging on any of these points.""

""Perhaps the most egregious assumption you accept is the idea that the claims made by the plaintiffs against all the individual defendants here relate to actions undertaken or omissions made by them in the performance of their official function,"" Goldfeder said.

""To be clear... [the complaint is] chock-full of allegations that these defendants aided and abetted Hamas, and that they did so consciously, voluntarily, and culpably.""

""Is it, pray tell, your contention that all of those actions were what UNRWA was supposed to be doing?"" Goldfeder questioned on the social media platform.

Goldfeder continued in an interview with Fox News Digital, arguing, ""The basic premise of what makes it so absolutely crazy is this - the U.N. is claiming that immunity from civil suits for invading a country and massacring its citizens is necessary for the exercise of its functions. And again, the Biden-Harris administration just filed that they agree. So the point is, if you think that immunity for mass murder is necessary for the U.N. to function, maybe it's time to rethink the U.N. entirely.""

Anne Bayefsky, president of Human Rights Voices and Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, says that the practical effect of DOJ's position is ""unaccountabillity"" for UNRWA.

""Regardless of the empty protestations to the contrary, the practical effect of the DOJ position is to contribute to unaccountability for UNRWA and its employees despite their demonstrable connections to Hamas and heinous behavior on multiple fronts,"" Bayefsky said.

""Legally-speaking immunity applies here when employees act within the boundaries of their official capacities. So is the DOJ now arguing that aiding and abetting an officially-designated terrorist organization is UNRWA just doing its job?"" she added.

UNRWA and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment."

ISRAEL STRIKES WITHIN LEBANON AFTER HEZBOLLAH BALLISTIC MISSILE FORCES MILLIONS IN TEL AVIV INTO BOMB SHELTERS

Anti-Israel protests have been ongoing for months in the U.S. after Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel. Israel responded in the following days, launching a war to eliminate Hamas in Gaza.

In recent weeks, Israel has also carried out attacks against the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon, taking out some of the group's top commanders. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are Iranian proxies.

Israel has now conducted five targeted airstrikes in Lebanon's capital of Beirut since the start of the Israel-Hamas War. Three of those targeted airstrikes have come in the last week.

The Israeli strikes targeted Hezbollah cells and weapons caches. Lebanese officials say the attacks killed at least 560 people.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently delivered a message to the people of Lebanon, saying Hezbollah is using them as ""human shields,"" and urging them to get out of harm's way.

Netanyahu is set to address the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.

This week, heads of state converged on Turtle Bay for the UN's annual high-level week. If there ever were an occasion for the world's diplomatic juggernauts to collectively solve the world's most pressing geopolitical quagmires, this would be it.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS IN GAZA

When it comes to Israel, the UN isn't interested in easing tensions on Israel's northern and southern borders as much as it is in rewarding terrorism and demonizing the Jewish State. For standing up for itself. For defending its people in a war on seven fronts, orchestrated by the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Shiite supremacist empire hellbent on achieving regional dominance, not diplomacy.

Tehran's proxies -- Hezbollah in the north, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, and

terrorist cells in Judea and Samaria are Tehran's attack dogs, unleashed to

sow death and chaos across the Middle East.

The Palestinian resolution approved by the General Assembly last week --

demanding that Israel end its ""unlawful presence in the Palestinian territories"" while calling for sanctions and an arms embargo against Israel -- demonstrates why the United Nations offers little hope for advancing regional peace. The resolution was nothing short of diplomatic terrorism, designed to sabotage real peace efforts by shifting attention away from condemning Hamas for triggering this 11-month war.

Rather than focusing on condemning Hamas for perpetrating the single greatest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust, the UN circus has once again adhered to what has now become a predictable, virulently anti-

Israel script.

Peace is hard to come by while the UN remains loath to come to terms with

the sinister reality that one of its agencies, UNRWA in Gaza, has been overrun by Hamas terrorists. For that reason, and for the sake of peace for Israelis and for Gazans, UNRWA must be disbanded.

UNRWA's stated mission is to advance the human development of Palestine

through the achievement of five strategic outcomes, centered on protecting

refugee rights under international law; safeguarding their health; providing

education to school-aged children; offering sufficient opportunities for earning a living; and providing Gazans with basic food and shelter provisions.

But since its founding in 1949, UNRWA has failed miserably in achieving these goals. UNRWA has failed to ameliorate the lives of Gazans, and it has failed to prevent Hamas terrorists from hijacking the agency's operations in Gaza.

How is UNRWA safeguarding the health of Gazans or providing high-quality

education opportunities when it is overrun by terrorists who use schools not to educate but as Hamas command and control centers?

The preponderance of evidence pointing to terrorism at UNRWA has done

little to convince the UN. On Aug. 5, the UN conceded that nine UNRWA

employees likely took part in the Hamas butchering of 1,200 people, which

included more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7.

Earlier this month, more local UNRWA workers were found to have been disguised as Hamas operatives. On a moral and professional level, UNRWA has failed Palestinians, it has failed Israel, and it has failed the UN.

It is time to deploy a new agency in Gaza that is focused more on humanitarian efforts, and not on activism or, in some cases, terrorism. The latest polio campaign, spearheaded by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and IDF, where more than 600,000 Gazan children were vaccinated, shows that progress is possible when Israel is working with partners interested in humanitarian efforts.

Israel strikes within Lebanon after Hezbollah ballistic missile forces millions in Tel Aviv into bomb shelters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-strikes-within-lebanon-after-hezbollah-ballistic-missile-forces-millions-tel-aviv-bomb-shelters,2024-09-25T11:35:30Z,"Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin has the latest on the Middle East conflict on 'Special Report.'

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon on Wednesday, after Hezbollah launched a long-range projectile toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah said it launched a ballistic missile toward the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency. Millions of people in Tel Aviv received warnings and fled to bomb shelters, though Israel says it ultimately intercepted the missile.

The exchange comes one day after Israel killed Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Muhammad Qubaisi in an airstrike in Beirut. Qubaisi was a top commander in Hezbollah's missile and rocket force.

The Israeli military has vowed to do ""whatever is necessary"" to repel Hezbollah from their northern border, but top officials say they are not seeking to escalate into all-out war.

Opinion | Trump's remarkable endorsement from this Muslim leader ought to alarm Harris,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/muslim-mayor-endorses-donald-trump-rcna172310,2024-09-25T10:40:39Z,"Amer Ghalib, a Muslim immigrant from Yemen and the mayor of Hamtramck, Mich., called Trump ""a man of principles"" and said Harris hasn't addressed his community's concerns.

Amer Ghalib, a Muslim immigrant from Yemen who serves as the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan -- made headlines this week by endorsing Donald Trump for president. In a Facebook post, Ghalib wrote, ""President Trump and I may not agree on everything, but I know he is a man of principles."" He also called him ""the right choice for this critical time.""

If Ghalib -- a self-described conservative Democrat -- had endorsed Trump in 2020, then he likely would have been subjected to a swift backlash. As a candidate and as a president, Trump had weaponized hate against Muslim and Arab Americans and targeted us with his ""Muslim travel ban"" that in many cases separated families. And Ghalib seems to have braced for a backlash in his endorsement. He wrote, ""I'll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I'm ready to face the consequences.""

But even though 81% of voters in Hamtramck, a majority-Muslim city, cast their ballots for Biden in 2020, there appears to have been no notable outrage to Ghalib throwing his support to Trump. That should concern Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign. There are large Muslim and Arab populations in Michigan, obviously, but also in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Virginia.

Ghalib said Trump recently met with him for 20 minutes when he was holding a rally in Michigan. Ghalib, a vocal critic of the Biden administration's seemingly blind support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's devastating war in Gaza, cited that as a main driver of his decision. ""We asked multiple times that they should change course, but nothing happened,"" he told reporters. ""Kamala Harris is still going in the same path and nothing was addressed."" Ghalib claims Trump, without providing details, promised to end the war. But even if Trump did, given his anti-Palestinian record as president, we know that it would be consistent with the goals of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, not the Palestinian people.

According to a recent poll of Muslim voters by Council of American-Islamic Relations, only 11% of Muslim voters nationwide said they planned to support Trump in November. Ghalib's endorsement notwithstanding, the news isn't that Muslims are supporting Trump; it's that they're not supporting Harris. Winning about 30% of Muslim's votes, she was , according to that poll, statistically tied with Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Contrast Harris polling at 30% among Muslim voters with the estimated 69% of Arab or Muslim voters across the country who voted for Biden in 2020.

As a Muslim voter who is clear about the harm Trump will cause, this is worrisome -- but not unexpected. Harris began her campaign inheriting a palpable anger directed at Biden within the Muslim and Arab community for his bear hug of Netanyahu and his continuing refusal to slow down the supply of weapons to Israel's military despite the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people. But when Biden dropped out and Harris became the Democratic nominee, there was a fresh start. Many in these communities wanted to support Harris -- and many are.

But the Uncommitted Movement leaders told NBC News last week that Harris had given them the ""cold shoulder"" and ""fumbled"" by refusing even the ""small gesture"" of allowing a Palestinian American speaker at August's Democratic National Convention.

That said, unlike Ghalib, ""Uncommitted Movement"" leaders in Michigan announced that while they were not endorsing Harris, their top priority was defeating Trump. They said Trump's agenda includes ""plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing."" As a result, they explained point blank, ""We must block Donald Trump, which is why we urge Uncommitted voters to vote against him and avoid third-party candidates that could inadvertently boost his chances.""

Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romaan, a Palestinian American, was one of the people on the short list to speak at the DNC but was effectively blocked by Harris and the Democratic Party. Romaan told me in an email that Ghalib's endorsement of Trump ""does not represent the overwhelming majority of Muslim voters."" But she added that the Harris campaign is missing an opportunity to animate ""a multifaith, multiracial, multigenerational coalition whose ask is simple: stop the bombs and uphold international humanitarian law"" when it comes to Netanyahu and his military.

Romaan, a first-term Democratic lawmaker in the battleground state of Georgia, said there is still time for Harris to address this issue. If she does, Romaan added, it will lead to a ""decisive edge come November.""

While the suffering in Gaza doesn't get the same headlines it got earlier this year, that suffering is still top of mind for many in the Arab and Muslim communities and our allies. Because the suffering is ongoing. Saturday, the Israeli military launched missiles at a school they claim was being utilized by Hamas and, according to CNN, killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children. ""There was no warning. We were sitting in the schools, and suddenly missiles started raining down on us,"" a witness told a CNN reporter. ""Where is the conscience?""

Beyond Gaza, we are now seeing an alarming and deadly escalation of Israeli military action in Lebanon that has killed more than 500 people and displaced thousands. Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been bombarding each other since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas sparked Israel's invasion of Gaza. This could get far worse. UNICEF warned Tuesday that ""any further escalation in this conflict would be catastrophic"" for children and families in Lebanon. If the media is again filled with images of dead women and children caused by Netanyahu's use of U.S. weaponry, Harris will have to denounce this or risk losing even more support from communities that Democrats have depended on for victory.

During her acceptance speech at the DNC, Harris spoke about Palestinians in a way that no Democratic presidential nominee ever has. She described the ""the scale of suffering"" in Gaza as ""heartbreaking."" She not only committed to not only to working toward a ceasefire -- which she first called for in March, well before Biden -- but she also vowed to ensure the ""Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.""

In contrast, Trump has repeatedly used the word ""Palestinian"" as a slur to attack Democrats who express concern for the brutal suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. As President, he cut millions of dollars in vital aid to Palestinians as Netanyahu urged him. And during the Gaza war, Trump vocally criticized Harris's calls for a ceasefire--with his primary concern not being the slaughter of Palestinians but that Israel was ""absolutely losing the PR war.""

Trump is as pro-Netanyahu and anti-Palestinian as they come. He may have locked up the endorsement of the Mayor of Hamtramck, but thankfully the bigoted Trump will not win a majority of Muslim and Arab American voters in 2024. Yet in a close race, even peeling away a few percentages from these two communities could hand Trump a victory. That is why Harris needs to step up to address the policy concerns of these two communities now. Not just for the good of the Arab and Muslim communities, but for the benefit of all Americans who want to see Trump defeated."
How a US-backed UN resolution failed to stop Hezbollah terror takeover: 'Bipartisan failure',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-us-backed-un-resolution-failed-stop-hezbollah-terror-takeover-bipartisan-failure,2024-09-25T08:09:15Z,"JERUSALEM -- As Israel's air force continues to pound the Hezbollah terrorist movement in some of the most intense clashes since the 2006 war, United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSC) 1701 is facing new criticism for failing to disarm the Lebanon-based terrorist organization.

The U.S. and other world powers passed Resolution 1701 at the United Nations Security Council in 2006 in an attempt to prevent a third war between Israel and the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hezbollah. Israel fought Hezbollah in 1982 and in the summer of 2006.

Two key elements of Resolution 1701 have proved to be largely ineffective, according to experts on Lebanon and the U.N.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

The first part involved the 10,000 peacekeeping (with added personnel) U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) that was expanded in 2006 to aid the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in assuming military control over the region, replacing Hezbollah, between the Litani River and the southern border in Lebanon.

UNIFIL was tasked to work with the LAF to ensure the area was ""free of any armed personnel, assets, and weapons."" However, Hezbollah's growing absorption of the Lebanese state has turned it the de facto ruler over the country, according to many experts, or a heavily armed ""state within a state.""

The second crucial element of 1701 was to disarm Hezbollah. Yet, the Lebanese terrorist entity has dramatically re-armed itself to the point where it now has at least 150,000 missiles and rockets aimed at Israel.

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

Walid Phares, who has advised U.S. presidential candidates, said 1701 is a ""limited resolution and cannot work by itself."" He added, ""Everybody is hiding behind 1701 and cannot resolve the issue."" He said even within the presence of UNIFIL, Hezbollah would come back.

Phares, who has extensively written on Hezbollah, proposed enforcement of the 2004 UNSC Resolution 1559 to compliment 1701 because it ""expressly asked for a disarming and dismantling of Hezbollah as a militia. That is basically the comprehensive resolution that can serve the purpose of a cease-fire or of actually getting to peace.""

""The Lebanese opposition should be calling on the execution of 1559. What does that mean? The Lebanese government will help to disarm Hezbollah from the center, but that Lebanese government is controlled by Hezbollah, so that government cannot execute 1559. Who can do it? The Lebanese people themselves,"" he said.

Phares noted that some Lebanese Christians, Druze and Sunnis have been doing it themselves over the last few days by ""refusing access to Hezbollah"" in a number of their areas. ""But they need someone to represent them.""

Rich Goldberg, a former member of then-President Trump's National Security Council, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a bipartisan American failure as much as it is a U.N. failure. The Bush administration signed off on 1701 with an obvious poison pill: that UNIFIL could only take action at the request of the Lebanese Armed Forces. No request ever came, no enforcement ever occurred, all while the U.S. pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into both UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces. We held all the cards and used none for 18 years, and Iran took full advantage.""

""The lesson for today is that whatever comes after Israel's campaign against Hezbollah, it cannot rely on UNIFIL or the Lebanese Armed Forces for verification or enforcement,"" said Goldberg, a senior adviser for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""The only party capable and willing to disarm Hezbollah is the Israel Defense Forces.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., echoed Goldberg's comments on Monday in the Senate chamber, ""The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon allowed Hezbollah to build up massive stockpiles on Israel's border in clear, clear preparation for war.""

IRAN TRIED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION BY SENDING STOLEN MATERIAL FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO BIDEN'S CAMP, FBI SAYS

""Why has the U.N. looked the other way as Hezbollah has expanded its corrosive influence over the institutions of Lebanon's government?"" he continued. ""But setting aside the failures of the so-called international community, this past weekend once again cast a spotlight on America's own naivete toward the glaring facts of Iran-backed war on our friend, Israel.""

Hezbollah launched rocket attacks at Israel on Oct. 8, a day after its ally, Hamas, invaded Israel from the Gaza Strip and slaughtered nearly 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, and took about 250 hostages.

Middle East analyst and expert Tom Gross told Fox News Digital, ""In many senses, Israel would be forgiven for never trusting the U.N. again. Its utter bias during this conflict, its eagerness to believe whatever fabrications Hamas and Hezbollah feed it, including wildly unreliable civilian death stats and false reports of mass starvation in Gaza, as well as its abysmal failure to enforce previous resolutions (including 1701) designed to stop rocket fire into Israel, mean that almost no one in Israel trusts the U.N.""

On Monday, France requested an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to address the Lebanon and Israel conflict.

""I have requested that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be held on Lebanon this week,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot announced. He urged all parties to ""avoid a regional conflagration that would be devastating for everyone.""

France had a colonial ruler presence in Lebanon from 1920 to 1946. Paris has vehemently opposed classifying all of Hezbollah's movement as a terrorist entity, in sharp contrast to Germany, Canada, Austria, the United Kingdom and many additional European and Latin American countries that have condemned Hezbollah's entire organization as a terrorist group.

When approached for comment about the alleged failure of 1701, the U.S. State Department referred Fox News Digital to remarks by U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood in late August at the Security Council to extend the UNIFIL mandate. He said at the time that ""Hezbollah made the escalatory decision to bombard communities in northern Israel. And for the past 11 months, it has done so on nearly a daily basis.  It is wrong that this council has yet to condemn Hezbollah for these repeated destabilizing actions, and we regret that a small minority of the council members blocked the council from doing so in this mandate renewal.""

Wood added, ""There is no dispute that Iran, in clear violation of the arms embargo in Resolution 1701, provides Hezbollah with the majority of the rockets, missiles and drones that are fired at Israel."" He called for the ""need to push for Resolution 1701's full implementation, including by establishing an area south of the Litani River that is free of any armed personnel, assets or weapons other than those of the Lebanese government and UNIFIL.""

A statement released by UNIFIL on Monday noted, ""It is essential to fully recommit to the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which is now more critical than ever to address the underlying causes of the conflict and ensure lasting stability."""
Hezbollah fires missile at Tel Aviv after heavy Israeli strikes on Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv,2024-09-25T07:28:40Z,"BEIRUT -- Hezbollah launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv early Wednesday, in a further escalation after Israel carried out strikes on Lebanon that killed hundreds of people and the militants fired rockets across wider areas of northern Israel.

The Israeli military said it intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, which set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the site in southern Lebanon from which the projectile was launched.

Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which bombs hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members.

The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. The Palestinian Hamas militant group in Gaza repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war.

The launch ratcheted up tensions as the region appears to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced thousands to seek refuge.

Families have fled southern Lebanon, flocking to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria.

Israel said late Tuesday that fighter jets carried out ""extensive strikes"" on Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa region to the north. The military has said it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but has declined to give a timetable for the air campaign.

Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group.

Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France.

Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week's escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something which appears increasingly remote.

Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October.

Cross-border exchanges began ramping up on Sunday in the wake of the pager and walkie-talkie bombings, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility.

On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel.

The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006.

An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, who Israel described as a top Hezbollah commander with the group's rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches towards Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

It was the latest in a string of assassinations and other setbacks for Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest political and military actor and is widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world.

Lebanon's Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country's National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building.

The U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south.

Hezbollah fired 300 rockets on Tuesday, injuring six Israeli soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to the Israeli military.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded, a staggering toll for a country still reeling from the deadly pager and walkie-talkie bombings last week."

A fugitive sex offender dubbed Detroit's ""most wanted"" since 2018 was taken into custody in Burien, Washington state, on Tuesday following a pursuit by law enforcement.

Cory Alan Olson, who was using various aliases while on the run, had been evading law enforcement while living in the area in Washington before he was nabbed by King County Sheriff's detectives, according to Fox 13.

Olson had been using the name ""Randall,"" which matched the name of a person in Kansas, whose identity was compromised while Olson was working temporary jobs in Washington state. Kansas authorities notified Washington state officials after the individual in Kansas was questioned about unpaid taxes on income earned elsewhere, leading to further investigation.

""I love the find me puzzle,"" Detective Riley Myklebust, who played a key role in Olson's capture, told Fox 13.

WASHINGTON STATE 1-YEAR-OLD ORPHANED AFTER PREGNANT MOM, DAD, BOTH FOUND DEAD ON HAWAII VACATION

Myklebust said he ran into significant challenges while investigating identity theft cases.

""After about a week of looking through 10 plus addresses, years of records, I couldn't figure out who this guy was, and that was a hint, because usually I can figure it out,"" he said.

Olson was discovered by detectives as he was stepping into his car at a new job in Burien. Police attempted to stop him when Olson pushed a sergeant and drove away. But he was captured a short time later by Myklebust, who had been pursuing him in a minivan.

Fingerprints confirmed Olson's identity, although he still refused to admit who he was.

""What did he say? He wouldn't give it up,"" Myklebust said.

Olson's criminal history includes the sexual assault of a teenage girl and evading arrest by injuring a deputy in a car crash. He then moved to Washington state, where he was charged for another sexual assault against a person with special needs.

During his arraignment for identity theft, criminal impersonation and multiple counts of forgery, Olson's attorney sought to protect his identity, which was granted by the court, Fox 13 reported.

Police have highlighted the importance of public recognition due to a history of repeated sexual offenses. Olsen often went to karaoke bars and presented himself as a wealthy investor with a military background and often targeted women with teenage daughters, according to Fox 13.

Detectives noted his presence in several communities, including Issaquah, downtown Seattle, Puyallup and Olympia, the outlet reported. They said he used several names in addition to Randall, including Josiah, Payton and Nikko, with the last names Arb or Cadaa."
"Iran spouts 'propaganda' from UN podium, calls on Middle East to unite behind Tehran",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-spouts-propaganda-from-un-podium-calls-middle-east-unite-behind-tehran,2024-09-24T23:47:21Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In an address to the 79th United Nations General Assembly Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian claimed to be the one playing peacemaker in the Middle East and, in a juxtaposition, accused Israel of supporting terrorism.

Pezeshkian called on the U.N. to ""examine"" modern history and said, ""Iran has never initiated a war. It has only defended itself heroically against external aggression, causing the aggressors to regret their actions,"" Pezeshkian said, adding that Iran does not ""occupy"" territory or exploit resources for other countries.

""It has repeatedly offered various proposals to its neighbors and international fora aimed at establishing lasting peace and stability,"" he said. ""We have emphasized the importance of unity in the region and establishing a strong region.""

UN SILENT AS GUTERRES CALLS FOR HOSTAGE RELEASE, RECEIVES 'THUNDEROUS' APPLAUSE ON GAZA

Iran's claims of playing peacemaker in the Middle East are in stark contrast to its repeated involvement in proxy wars across the region, in which it has been heavily involved in Syria and Yemen, drawing deeper the lines of division between it and other powerful Sunni nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

But Iran's deep involvement in the Middle East extends to one other area not generally endeavored by a nation state -- terrorism.

While Pezeshkian claimed from the podium Tuesday that Israel both ""covertly and overtly"" supports the Islamic State, Tehran is widely known to have not only backed terrorist organizations ardently opposed to Israel like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, but it has also helped build bridges between the Taliban and al Qaeda, providing the terrorist networks with arms, funding and even safe haven.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran seeks to safeguard its own security, not to create insecurity for others,"" Pezeshkian also claimed. ""We want peace for all, and seek no war or quarrel with anyone.""

Iran, which has also increasingly aligned itself with top adversarial nations of the West like Russia and North Korea, attempted to claim it has not chosen a side when it comes to Russia's illegal war in Ukraine, despite it having provided Moscow with drones and, most recently, short-range ballistic missiles for its war effort.

""We seek lasting peace and security for the people of Ukraine and Russia. The Islamic Republic of Iran opposes war and emphasizes the urgent need to end military hostilities in Ukraine. We support all peaceful solutions, and believe that dialog is the only way to resolve this crisis,"" the Iranian president said.

KIRBY SLAMS HAMAS CHIEF SINWAR AS 'THE MAJOR OBSTACLE' TO CEASE-FIRE, HOSTAGE RELEASE DEAL WITH ISRAEL

""We need a new paradigm to address global challenges. Such a paradigm must focus on opportunities, rather than being obsessed with perceived threats,"" he added.

Pezeshkian called on ""neighboring and brotherly countries"" to unite with Iran to advance what is best for the Middle East.

But the Iranian president also spoke directly to the U.S. and said Tehran is looking to ""transcend"" the obstacles of the past and move forward with Washington, despite its withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement under President Trump and the subsequent sanctions and trade restrictions that have, in large part, cut it off from the rest of the world.

""My message to all states pursuing a counterproductive strategy towards Iran is to learn from history,"" Pezeshkian said before calling the U.S.'s sanctions a ""crime against humanity.""

""We have the opportunity to transcend these limitations and enter into a new era,"" he added.

But Pezeshkian's comments rang hollow for some and, according to Behnam Ben Taleblu, Iran expert and senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, they were riddled with ""propaganda.""

""Short but certainly not sweet,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Pezeshkian dangled the prospect of a renewed diplomatic agreement, something which his regime will use as a literal shield against pressure on its expanding nuclear program and accountably against supporting a multi-front war against Israel.""

""By blaming former President Trump in his speech and by bringing along technocratic staff involved in the JCPOA back in 201[8], Pezeshkian hopes to win support with certain crowds in Washington and Europe and run the clock against SnapBack, which expires in 2025,"" Ben Taleblu added. But despite Pezeshkian's honeyed comments on renewing diplomatic conversations with the U.S., they are not expected to curry much favor with either side of the political aisle as it continues to ramp up its development of nuclear weapons."
Brandeis University faculty votes 'no confidence' in president after 'excessive' crackdown on student protests,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/brandeis-university-faculty-votes-no-confidence-president-who-banned-students-justice-palestine,2024-09-24T23:06:56Z,"A Jewish student at Brandeis University, Shai Goldberg-Kellman, shares how colleges need a summer do-over to figure out how to combat antisemitism and protect free speech on college campuses.

By a narrow margin, the faculty at Brandeis University voted in favor of the motion of no confidence against its university president Ronald Liebowitz partly over his ""excessive"" handling of on-campus protesters.

In an email, Chair of the Brandeis Faculty Senate Prof. Jeffrey Lenowitz told faculty members Monday the motion passed with 159 votes in favor, 149 votes in opposition, and 26 abstentions. Lenowitz said this vote represented 76.4% of the faculty.

""There were ten more votes in favor than against,"" Lenowitz wrote to Brandeis' student paper ""The Justice."" ""This reveals what our multiple faculty conversations and debates on it made clear: while faculty are united in their care for Brandeis and their great desire for it to flourish, they are divided on this motion.""

This vote will now be taken to the Board of Trustees, who will decide whether to remove Liebowitz from his position and who will replace him.

COLLEGES NEED SUMMER 'DO-OVER' AFTER RAGING PROTESTS LEFT JEWS ON CAMPUS FEELING UNSAFE: BRANDEIS STUDENT

Fox News Digital has reached out to Brandeis University for comment.

The motion was first introduced on May 30 ahead of the 2024-2025 school year to discuss concerns about Liebowitz's leadership over issues like ""badly handled budget shortfalls, failures of fundraising"" and what faculty referred to as ""excessive responses to student protests.""

Brandeis University was one of multiple college campuses to be rocked by anti-Israel protesters over the Hamas terror attack against Israel last year. After protests grew nationwide, Brandeis, under Liebowitz's leadership, chose to no longer recognize the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) for its support for Hamas and the elimination of Israel.

About a month after the Oct. 7 terror attack, Liebowitz wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe saying student organizations ""should lose all privileges"" if they called for violence.

""Most urgently, in this twilight zone moment when students and faculty seem to be enjoying their freedom to express grotesque language about Jews, Jewish life, and the Jewish state, Brandeis will uphold free speech rightly understood. Universities cannot stop hate speech, but they can stop paying for it. Brandeis will ensure that groups that receive privileges through their affiliations with the university, including using its name, will lose their affiliations and privileges when they spew hate,"" Liebowitz wrote.

BRANDEIS' EJECTION OF PRO-PALESTINIAN STUDENT GROUP DRAWS MIXED REACTIONS: 'WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW?'

He added, ""Contrary to the prevalence of the BDS movement on college campuses, Brandeis will pursue closer ties with Israeli academic and cultural institutions and will encourage more universities to follow suit.""

Although a slim majority of the faculty appear to be dissatisfied with Liebowitz's methods, Brandeis University was one of two colleges to receive an A grade over its handling of antisemitism and for promoting a safe environment for Jewish students, according to the Anti-Defamation League's Campus Antisemitism Report Card published in April."

(Credit: Reuters)

United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer made an unfortunate gaffe during a speech at his party's conference Tuesday when he mistakenly called for the return of ""sausages,"" instead of hostages, held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party's annual conference in Liverpool when he called for a de-escalation between Lebanon and Israel, as well as a cease-fire in Gaza.

He also called for the return of hostages being held by the terror group when he slipped up, before quickly recovering.

""I call again for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the return of the sausages -- the hostages -- and a recommitment to the two-state solution: a recognized Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel,"" he said.

The mistake quickly went viral.

During his remarks, Starmer was also heckled by a spectator in the audience who shouted about Gaza.

Multiple hostages are still being held in Gaza nearly a year after the group attacked Israeli communities Oct. 7, sparking the latest conflict between Hamas and the Jewish state.

Israel has proposed ending the war if Hamas releases the remaining hostages, along with the demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of an alternative governing body. Hamas has rejected several offers to end the conflict.

Israel has bombarded Gaza and pledged to hunt down those responsible for the deadly attack. Meanwhile, it has also had to defend itself on a second front against shelling in its north from Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.

""We believe that sports bring people together and unite us. We are aware of Macklemore's increasingly divisive comments, and they do not reflect the values of our respective ownership groups, leagues, or organizations,"" the teams said on Monday, via KOMO News.

He joined the ownership group of the Sounders in August 2019 and was a part of the Kraken's ownership group in in April 2022.

""We are currently evaluating our collective options on this matter,"" the statement added.

Macklemore performed at the ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival.""

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

He said the proceeds of the event held at Seward Park Amphitheater would go to various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA).

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

Maher Joudi, the event's organizer, told The South Seattle Emerald the event was purely to support Palestinians.

""The only thing I want anybody to take away from this is - anything that we do in this space is 1,000% for Palestine,"" he told the outlet. ""It is in service of Palestine and those that are fighting every day. We do what we can on this side. And I think as long as we're centering and framing all the work that we do as being in service of them, then we're doing the work.""

Macklemore dropped an anti-Israel song in May titled ""Hind's Hall,"" referring to the Columbia University building that students occupied and renamed in honor of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the Israel-Gaza war. The song praised the anti-Israel encampments and protests on college campuses across the country and called out President Biden, the police and the music industry.

The rapper this month dropped a second version of the song that now calls out Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee when Biden backed out of the race in July.

It's been nearly a year since Hamas terrorists entered Israel and killed, raped and took hostage hundreds of people. It sparked Israel's ongoing war in the region and no cease-fire appears to be in sight.

The tone was set Tuesday in the hall of the United Nations in New York City after the General Assembly reacted to Secretary-General António Guterres' contempt for Israel's attacks in Gaza, but sat silent during his condemnation of Hamas' near-year-long capture of Israeli hostages.

""Let's be clear, nothing can justify the abhorrent acts of terror committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 or the taking of hostages, both of which I have repeatedly condemned,"" he said as the General Assembly sat and watched. ""And nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""

The secretary-general's comments were followed by applause by the international body before he continued and said, ""The speed and scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza are unlike anything in my years as Secretary-General.""

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, immediately called out the international body for ""hypocrisy"" following its resounding condemnation of Israel's fight in Gaza.

""When the U.N. secretary-general speaks about the release of our hostages, the U.N. assembly is silent, but when he speaks about the suffering in Gaza, he receives thunderous applause,"" he said in a statement. ""This is the opening signal for the annual charade of hypocrisy.""

The tone of the overall assembly was particularly dark after Guterres warned the ""state of our world is unstainable"" and said, ""We can't go on like this.""

But despite the range of issues he addressed, including the more than two-year war in Ukraine, the civil war in Sudan, female oppression worldwide, the wrath of climate change and global hunger, it was the war in Gaza that dominated the addresses that followed.

The President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who opened the assembly's debate following Guterres' opening remarks, called out Israel and argued that it is Jerusalem's fault there are still 101 hostages in the hands of Hamas.

""There have been over 40,000 fatal victims, mostly women and children,"" the Brazilian president said regarding the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza, though the figure does not differentiate between civilians and Hamas terrorists killed. ""The right to defense has become the right to vengeance, which prevents an agreement for the release of the hostages and postpones the ceasefire.""

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has long been critical of Israel, openly drew parallels between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Nazi leader Adolf Hilter and called Israeli prisons ""concentration camps.""

""Just as Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity, Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped by an alliance of humanity,"" Edrogan said.

Erdogan, like the other nations who followed him, accused Israel of flouting international law and questioned when the nations of the U.N. were going to do something about it.

""I call out to the United Nations Security Council, what are you waiting for to prevent the genocide in Gaza?"" He questioned before positioning his next question at nations like the U.S.: ""How long are you going to be able to carry the shame of witnessing this massacre?""

When asked by Fox News Digital about the overall tone of the morning's debate, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. called it ""shameful"" and said it was the ""most hostile"" environment he has seen in his roughly 10 years of attending the general debate.

The King of Jordan, Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, echoed the warnings issued by Guterres and said the U.N. is ""under attack,"" arguing Israel's continued assault with the backing of the U.S. was to blame.

""I cannot recall a time of greater peril than this,"" he said. ""Our United Nations is facing a crisis that strikes at its very legitimacy and threatens a collapse of global trust and moral authority.""

""For years, the global community has taken the path of least resistance, accepting the status quo of the ongoing military occupation of Palestinians all the while paying lip service to the two-state solution,"" Al-Hussein added in direct reference to comments made by President Biden just minutes prior.

The leader of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, echoed the criticisms of his predecessors, accusing Israel of committing ""a crime of genocide"" and hitting at the heart of the U.S.'s continued support for Jerusalem.

""We oppose violence and the targeting of innocent civilians by any party,"" he said. ""But after a year of the war...it is no longer tenable to talk about Israel's right to defend itself in this context without being complicit in justifying the crime.""

Like his predecessors, the Qatari leader argued that Israel's allowance by the international community to continue to carry out strikes in Gaza questions the legitimacy of the United Nations as a whole and has ""inflicted serious damage on the credibility of the post-World War II concepts on which the international community was founded.""

Qatar has played a major role alongside the U.S. and Egypt in an attempt to engage Hamas and Israel in cease-fire negotiations. Though he argued this will not be achieved until Israel stops its occupation in not only Gaza, but elsewhere.

The stock market isn't the only indicator hitting record-high valuations this year. Gold values have also been skyrocketing -- even outpacing the markets. Spot gold prices are hovering near their record of $2,664 per troy ounce. As of Friday, Gold's year-to-date value gain was 27.1%, higher than the S&P 500's record 20.8% return.

Forbes' Derek Saul writes gold is becoming more valuable for two reasons. One is the interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve last week. While lower interest rates tend to be better for consumer spending and borrowing, investors can't earn as much from assets that are tied to federal interest rates, like government bonds and certificates of deposit. Gold, on the other hand, has its own inherent value and isn't impacted by the Fed's decision. In general, gold prices tend to increase whenever interest rates go down.

But the year's constant geopolitical turmoil is also driving gold prices up. Gold is an international currency standard and is seen as a safe hedge against geopolitical risks. Central banks have been purchasing gold quickly as international conflicts unfold. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, central banks have bought gold three times faster than in years prior, Goldman Sachs found. The ongoing conflict involving Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah has added to the frenzy. J.P. Morgan reported that the first quarter of 2024 saw a gold-buying pace 36% higher than anticipated.

While the price of gold doesn't directly impact most businesses (jewelry being a notable exception), the commodity can be seen as an economic indicator, often pointing to economic uncertainties. Everyone in the finance business is well aware of today's unknowns. In addition to the geopolitical situations and interest rate changes, there's also the upcoming presidential election -- in which some major changes to tax policy are being proposed -- and lingering inflation difficulties.

And CFOs are expecting turbulence in the near term. According to StrategicCFO360's quarterly poll of CFOs conducted with BlackLine last month, CFOs rate the economy as a 6.5 out of 10. Overall, 55% said they expect a recession in the near term. Just 35% are anticipating a soft landing.

Last month, the Justice Department launched a pilot program to reward corporate whistleblowers who help uncover corruption at companies. While many companies carry directors and officers liability insurance, often referred to as D&O insurance, will this change impact what companies can afford in premiums -- or in potential damages? I talked to Carolyn Rosenberg, a partner in the insurance recovery group at law firm Reed Smith, about the issue. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

It finally happened: Last week, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The Fed's policy-setting committee opted for a significant rate cut of half a percentage point, meaning the target federal funds rate is now 4.75% to 5%, down from the 5.25% to 5.5% where it's sat since July 2023.

""This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at the press conference following last Wednesday's announcement.

But what does the rate cut mean in the long run? And is this the beginning of more leveling off? The answer to both is we'll see. What happens next depends on how businesses, financial institutions, investors and consumers behave. If inflation continues to decrease or stays steady, if employment figures move upward and if the economy sees increased vigor, it may be the beginning of more economic good news. Forbes writers collected predictions of how the rate cuts will impact different interest groups, ranging from small businesses to student loan borrowers.

Just over a week after roughly 33,000 unionized Boeing machinists in the Pacific Northwest went on strike, the company made its ""best and final offer"" to the union. The aerospace manufacturer's proposed deal includes raises of 30% over the four-year term of the contract -- an increase from 25%, a $6,000 bonus for each worker who approves the deal -- double the previous offer, reinstates performance bonuses -- which were slated to be cut, and increases the company 401(k) match. The union responded on Facebook that the company treated them disrespectfully by sharing the offer directly to members and media while union members were still reviewing it, and Boeing has made the deal contingent on ratification by 11:59 p.m. Friday.

It's not clear what the union's ultimate response will be; the union said it was sending an email survey to members for input. The strike has been costly for Boeing. An analysis by Anderson Economic Group estimated the first week cost the company's workers and shareholders at least $571 million. Since the strike essentially shut down production, Boeing started finding ways to cut its costs last week as the strike continued. Non-unionized employees -- executives, managers and other white-collar workers -- will be furloughed one week out of every four. The company has also instituted a hiring freeze and reduced purchases from vendors and suppliers.

Forbes senior contributor Ted Reed writes labor strikes in the last few years have been bolstered by support from the White House. Focusing on recent airline-related contract negotiations for which strikes were authorized if there was no agreed upon contract by a deadline, Reed writes the administration signaled proof that the threat of strikes were real. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and National Mediation Board Member Linda Puchala worked directly with the union representing American Airlines flight attendants in their successful quest for a contract.

Some labor leaders feel the same support from the White House will continue if Vice President Kamala Harris is elected in November. Former President Donald Trump said in an interview on X last month he supported firing employees who go on strike, leading the United Auto Workers to file federal labor charges against him for trying to threaten and intimidate workers.

One way to deal with the accountant shortage: cash. Private equity has been investing in accounting firms for the last few years, with five of the 25 largest firms in the U.S. receiving those investment dollars, Forbes' Kelly Phillips Erb writes. These investments represent a source of funds for many of the pressures today's accounting firms are grappling with. They can help bolster salaries and benefits to attract a dwindling number of accounting college graduates. The funds can be used to upgrade technology, making AI platforms available that cut down on more mundane work, like data entry and routine review. And they can help meet retirement and pension obligations. Accounting firms are seen as solid investments for private equity firms, places where they can put their money and watch it grow. However, some accounting firms and industry watchers fear that private equity money can cause conflicts of interest or result in some ""sexier"" areas of accounting firms -- like tax and advisory services -- taking most of the funds, with little money left for areas like auditing.

As legal claims against businesses and their boards climb, directors and officers liability insurance, commonly abbreviated as D&O, has become a vital financial hedge for companies. Since the Justice Department launched a corporate whistleblower awards program last month, are there likely to be more claims? I talked to Carolyn Rosenberg, a partner in the insurance recovery group at law firm Reed Smith, about what changes this may bring to D&O coverage. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

In general, how have companies thought about D&O insurance and how do they consider what they need?

Rosenberg: Insurance is typically part of an overall risk management effort on the part of a company. So insurance is designed to shift the risk to an insurer, as opposed to having a company or an individual be personally responsible. Part of what kind of D&O insurance a company may decide upon is really a question of several factors. What is the company's risk appetite? What's the company's financial position? Is it primarily to protect directors and officers? Is it to protect the company's balance sheet? What is the availability of coverage and what's the cost of the coverage? And also what are the terms and conditions of the coverage?

There are a great deal of differences between different insurance policies. Different insurance companies may provide D&O insurance coverage, but beyond that, there can be both nuances and differences in terminology, differences in what enhancements might be negotiated.

When looking at D&O insurance, also look comprehensively at your insurance programs across the board, because you may get hit with a ransomware claim, a data breach claim or a myriad of different claims, and you want to make sure that there are no gaps in your programs. In other words, if a claim is going to be excluded under one type of policy, you might want to look and see: Do you have coverage for that under a different type of policy?

How do you see the new Justice Department whistleblower program impacting the D&O insurance market?

It may be a little too soon to tell. The program is touted as finding more financial incentive and focusing on different areas, but there have always been the opportunity to have whistleblowers attempt to bring claims. The question is, will this lead to a surge of claims? That's not necessarily been proven out.

It's still prudent to look at your current coverage, or if you're in the process of potentially renewing coverage, to see what kind of coverage is in the marketplace. Most D&O policies for public companies include coverage for the company for securities claims. The issue that the whistleblower-type claims and other regulatory initiatives may bring -- and it's not necessarily a new question -- is what coverage do you have for regulatory-type investigations, as opposed to simply a lawsuit? How early in the process will coverage apply, because costs of defending claims, costs of looking into investigations can be quite high. The issue is what coverage do you have currently? And then what other potential alternatives exist in the market?

I've seen certain articles that [ask] does this mean you should be looking into what's called entity investigations coverage to have certainty about coverage for investigations? Historically, those options have been fairly limited and very expensive. It will be interesting to see if those options become more practical, broader or affordable, if in fact there becomes a market for them.

What kind of advice would you give to a CFO working through this process and trying to find the most value and benefit to the company in terms of both their premium and the coverage they may need if something happens?

I would start early, before the insurance renewal, so there's time to compare policy terms and conditions and prices. Most big public companies work with quality insurance brokers who can get those options. A number of companies work with someone like me or others who are insurance coverage counsel for policy holders to really get into the weeds on the policy terms and conditions. Working with the insurance brokers and the risk managers and legal or other teams involved in assisting the CFO, to really do a fulsome look at how the policies compare, and even create potential enhancements to seek from the insurers. And then being able to leave time to do a comparison to say: If this policy is going to be X thousands more in premium, is it worth it if we compare the terms and conditions, apples to apples? Or it may be that we are not comfortable going with this insurer for whatever reason.

The other aspect is that the newest hot issue is artificial intelligence, and to the extent that companies are using it and what they're expecting on the horizon, we would also say you want to look to see if there's anything about the policies or what you're doing that would suggest any specifics with regard to AI.

"Biden defends withdrawing from Afghanistan, dropping re-election bid in last UN address as president",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-defends-withdrawing-afghanistan-dropping-re-election-bid-last-un-address-president,2024-09-24T15:38:17Z,"NEW YORK CITY -- President Biden, in his final address to the United Nation's General Assembly, warned that the world is at an ""inflection point,"" while defending his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and his move to suspend his re-election campaign.

Biden delivered his fourth and final speech to the assembly as President of the United States on Tuesday, addressing leaders and representatives from 134 countries around the globe.

""Today is the fourth time I've had the great honor of speaking to this assembly as President of the United States,"" Biden said Tuesday morning. ""It'll be my last.""

Biden reflected on the global order when he was first elected as a U.S. senator in 1972, saying the world was at ""an inflection point"" and a ""moment of tension and uncertainty.""

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

""The world was divided by the Cold War; the Middle East was headed toward war; America was at war in Vietnam at that point -- the longest war in America's history,"" Biden said. ""Our country was divided and angry, and there were questions about our staying power and our future. But even then, I entered public life not out of despair, but out of optimism.""

Biden said when he was elected president, the world was in ""another moment of crisis and uncertainty,"" referring to the ongoing U.S. presence in Afghanistan.

""We were attacked on 9/11 by Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. We brought him justice. Then I came to the presidency in another moment of crisis and uncertainty,"" Biden said. ""I believed America had to look forward--new challenges, new threats, new opportunities were in front of us.""

Biden said he needed to put the United States ""in a position to see the threats, to deal with the challenges, and to seize the opportunities as well.""

""We needed to end the war that began on 9/11,"" Biden said. ""I came to office as president, with Afghanistan to replace Vietnam as America's longest war.""

""I was determined to end it,"" he siad. ""And I did.""

Biden said it was a ""hard decision but the right decision.""

""Four American presidents had faced that decision, but I was determined not to leave it to a fifth,"" Biden said, while acknowledging the decision was ""accompanied by tragedy,"" as 13 U.S. servicemembers lost their lives, along with hundreds of Afghan civilians in a suicide bombing outside of Kabul Airport during the withdrawal.

But under the Biden-Harris administration, officials have sought diplomacy amid global instability and fears of a growing war in the Middle East, especially following its botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the years-long Russia-Ukraine war, the growing threat from Iran's nuclear development, increased aggression from China, and a crisis at the U.S. southern border.

""I truly believe we're at another inflection point in world history, where the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come,"" Biden said Tuesday. ""We stand behind the principles that unite us; we stand firm against aggression; we end the conflicts that are raging today. We take on global challenges like climate change, hunger and disease.""

Also under his administration, in 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

""The good news is Putin's war has failed,"" Biden said, while adding though, that the world ""cannot grow weary"" and ""cannot look away"" or ""let up on our support for Ukraine.""

As for increasing aggression in China, Biden said there is a need to continue to ""responsibly manage the competition with China so it does not veer into conflict.""

Biden stressed that he is working to ""bring a greater measure of peace and stability to the Middle East.""

""The world must not flinch from the horrors of October 7th - any country would have the right responsibility to ensure that such attack can never happen again,"" Biden said, referring to Hamas' brutal terror attack in Israel. ""Thousands of armed Hamas terrorists invaded a sovereign state, slaughtering and massacring more than 1200 people, including 46 Americans in their homes and at a music festival, the despicable acts of sexual violence, 250 innocents taken hostage.""

Biden said he has met with the families of those hostages.

""I grieve with them,"" he said. ""They're going through hell.""

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT 7

But Biden said, ""Innocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell.""

Biden pointed to the ceasefire and hostage deal his administration has worked on with Qatar and Egypt.

""Now it is time for the parties to finalize terms, bring the hostages home, secure Israel and Gaza free of Hamas' grip, ease the suffering in Gaza and end this war,"" he said.

Biden stressed that his administration has been ""determined to prevent a wider war that engulfs the entire region.""

""A full scale war is not in anyone's interest,"" he said. ""Even as the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible.""

""In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security,"" Biden continued, so that ""the residents from both countries return to their homes.""

""That's what we're working tirelessly to achieve,"" Biden said.

But as for the war in Gaza, Biden, notably, did not mention rising antisemitism in the United States and around the globe since the Oct. 7 attacks, but instead, discussed the ""rise of violence against innocent Palestinians on the West Bank.""

Biden said the world needs to work towards ""a two-state solution where the world -- where Israel enjoys security and peace and full recognition and normalize relations with all its neighbors; and with Palestinians, living securely with dignity and self-determination in a state of their own.""

Meanwhile, Biden declared the need to continue to ensure Iran will ""never obtain a nuclear weapon.""

As he closed his, likely, final address to the world, Biden said he and world leaders ""must never forget who we're here to represent--We the people.""

UN'S 'PACT FOR THE FUTURE' FULL OF EMPTY PROMISES, WILL BE 'CUDGEL' TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES, EXPERT WARNS

""These are the first words of our Constitution. The very idea of America. They inspired the opening words of the UN charter. I made the preservation of democracy the central cause of my presidency,"" Biden said.

Biden explained his decision to suspend his 2024 re-election campaign, calling it a ""difficult decision.""

""Being president has been the honor of my life. There is so much more I want to get done,"" Biden said, but urged world leaders not to forget that ""some things are more important than staying in power.""

""It's your people. It is your people that matter most,"" Biden said. ""We are here to serve the people, not the other way around, because the future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe free, to think freely, to innovate, to educate, to live in love openly without fear.""

He added: ""That's the soul of democracy. It does not belong to any one country. I've seen it all around the world.""

Biden stressed the ""remarkable the power of 'We the people.'""

""It makes me more optimistic about the future than I've ever been since I was first elected to the United States Senate in 1972. Every age faces challenges,"" Biden said. ""I saw it as a young man. I see it today. But we are stronger than we think. We're stronger together than alone.""

He added: ""My fellow leaders, there's nothing that's beyond our capacity. If we work together, let's work together."""

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is set to address the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Tuesday afternoon in New York City amid a wash of stories involving Tehran's involvement in assassination attempts against U.S. politicians and election interference.

Pezeshkian, who turned heads this week for his 40-member strong delegation which reportedly includes his adult children, has already made headlines upon his arrival for comments he made suggesting Israel is looking to start an all-out war in the Middle East by turning Lebanon into the next Gaza.

BIDEN TO ADDRESS UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

""We do not wish to be the cause of instability in the Middle East as its consequences would be irreversible,"" he told reporters Monday, according to Reuters. ""We want to live in peace, we don't want war.

""It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,"" he added.

His comments to the General Assembly are expected to largely focus on the ongoing fight in the Middle East as Israel finds itself pitted against Iran's terror proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.

Pezeshkian's comments are likely to draw focus on the high number of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and recently the Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, where nearly 500 people were killed, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, reported the BBC early Tuesday. It's not known how many of the dead are Hezbollah terrorists.

IRAN TRIED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION BY SENDING STOLEN MATERIAL FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO BIDEN'S CAMP, FBI SAYS

While the U.N. has condemned Israeli attacks on civilians, the Iranian president's comments are likely to ring hollow among some at the international body as Tehran has substantially backed the terrorist organizations that have engaged in the fight against the Jewish state.

There is the other matter of Tehran's exposed plot to assassinate Donald Trump, as well as potentially President Biden, Nikki Haley, along with other ""politicians, military people or bureaucrats,"" according to FBI documents released by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, earlier this month.

The FBI further confirmed last week that Iran hackers attempted to supply the Democratic presidential campaign with stolen communication files from the Trump campaign.

While it appears the Iranian attempts to mimic the Russia-style hack-and-leak operations utilized during the 2016 campaign was a failed push to cause turmoil in the U.S. ahead of the elections, the assassination plot was likely due to the 2020 killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani during Trump's time as president.

Pezeshkian's trip to the U.S. for the top U.N. meeting drew condemnation from U.S. lawmakers last month. They encouraged Biden to block his visa over concerns his presence would ""raise serious security issues"" for the U.S. and its allies.

Hunger strikers were also reported at a notorious female prison in Iran in protest of the Iranian president's address amid Tehran increasing the number of executions and in a call for the release of all political and ideological detainees, according to Iran International."

Israel and Hezbollah resumed missile strikes against one another Tuesday morning following the deadliest day in Lebanon since 2006.

Lebanese officials say a massive Israeli barrage killed at least 560 people on Monday, leading thousands to flee southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy terrorist organization, remain on the brink of all-out war.

Hezbollah says it launched missiles at eight different targets within Israel early Tuesday. The Israeli military said it tracked 55 rockets fired out of Lebanon and landing in Israel.

Israeli forces say they have continued to carry out dozens of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets within Lebanon, and that artillery and tanks continue to hit targets close to the border.

KIRBY SLAMS HAMAS CHIEF SINWAR AS 'THE MAJOR OBSTACLE' TO CEASE-FIRE, HOSTAGE RELEASE DEAL WITH ISRAEL

Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah cells as well as weapon stashes across the country.

Data from American fire-tracking satellites analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes aimed at southern Lebanon, covering an area of over 650 square miles.

These satellites, a part of NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System, are typically used to track wildfires across rural areas of the U.S., but can also be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. That's particularly true when an airstrike ignites flammable material on the ground, such as munitions or fuel.

ISRAEL SAYS IT CONDUCTED RETALIATORY STRIKES AGAINST HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON, STRUCK HAMAS IN GAZA

Top Israeli officials maintain that they do not want the conflict with Hezbollah to escalate into all-out war. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Sunday that the consolidation of weapons and equipment at the Israel-Lebanon border is not preparation for an invasion.

Meanwhile, the aircraft carrier USS Truman, two destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Mediterranean on a regularly scheduled deployment, opening the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Gulf of Oman, nearby in case further violence breaks out.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held back-to-back calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the weekend as he pressed for a cease-fire and a reduction of tensions in the region.

As deadline approached, Hezbollah had just launched long range rockets to strike towards Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria. The Israeli Defense Forces had responded with more than 300 attacks on targets within Lebanon, some within Beirut. The Pentagon announced that our second aircraft carrier, the Harry Truman, was beginning its deployment early to reach the region and join another American carrier task force already deployed there, this one including and around the Abraham Lincoln.

The Biden/Harris Middle East policy is in flames, as is the region. Given that all Vice President Harris can say about Israel and Hamas -- ""We must get a deal done!"" -- what would she say about Israel and Lebanon? What former President Trump has said, consistently, is that Israel needs to win, fast.

For whom do you suppose Israelis would vote if they could vote in U.S. elections? For whom would the Islamist ruling class of Iran vote? (Iran is not a free country like Israel, so the hypothetical question about voting in our presidential election is restricted to those whom the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei would allow to vote.)

We don't know, and there's little to go on. The Jewish People Policy Institute did one survey of Israeli Jews in July, before President Biden withdrew, and found that among Jews in Israel, 51 percent prefer Trump compared to 35 percent who prefer Biden, with 14 percent stating they have no opinion. I have seen no update since then.

We have seen Iran target the campaign of former President Trump. It is a safe bet that the mullahs prefer a Harris-Waltz victory to one of Trump-Vance because Trump ran the ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran which had nearly bankrupted the regime there until President Biden ended it and began not only to ease sanctions but unfreeze billions in Iranian assets in order to secure the release of hostages. Khamenei wants no part of Trump 2.0.

ISRAEL HAMMERS HEZBOLLAH WITH STRIKES, ISSUES WARNING ON WHERE IT MAY HIT NEXT

The Israelis? It's a country deeply divided along political lines but almost wholly united in the need to win the war in Gaza and the one that looms in Lebanon and perhaps beyond (and which may have fully begun overnight). Given that Biden/Harris has played yo-yo with arms shipments to Israel even as it has continually attempted to restrain the Israeli Defense Forces, it's a safe bet that most Israelis are hoping Donald Trump returns to the White House in January.

Many American voters could not care less about Israel or Iran. They are worried about the cost of groceries. Those folks are going to vote for Trump as the certain way to bring down the cost of food is to decrease the cost of producing food and the cost of transporting it to supermarkets. The way to do that is to unleash and fully support American domestic energy production. Trump has the majority of the inflation-driven voter locked up just as Harris has the abortion-on-demand voter locked up.

For those few percent of Americans who vote for national security and ""peace through strength,"" and especially for those who pray for peace in Jerusalem and the region and for freedom for the Iranian people, the choice is clear: Donald Trump.

Former Trump administration national security official Lt. Gen Keith Kellogg (Ret.) said on ""America Reports"" that Israel does not trust the Biden-Harris administration to be a ""peacemaker"" and will not wait any longer for a cease-fire agreement. Kellogg, former national security adviser to VP Mike Pence, said Israel is ""disregarding"" the United States as troops aim to destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.

HEZBOLLAH LAUNCHES ROCKETS AT ISRAEL: 'OPEN-ENDED BATTLE'

KEITH KELLOGG: Israel does not trust the United States right now to be any type of peacemaker or interlocutor at all. They've just disregarded what the United States is going to do. They're going to handle this on their own and I think they're going to be able to do it now. You can really see that they've shifted away from Gaza with the preponderance of the military force. Look at the airstrikes and look at the map that the targets that they've hit. Look what they did to the command and control. Look at them taking out major infrastructure as well. They're really planning to go ahead and really hard, and they're going to solve this. And I think Netanyahu has got it right. He has decided to take a plan, go forward with it, and actually eliminate, at least from the south, south of the Litani River, all Hezbollah positions to allow those people you mentioned between 60 and 100,000 to return to their homes. And I think he's making a real point. I don't think this thing is going to de-escalate at all. I think you're looking at an escalation not only today and tomorrow, but in the coming weeks. This fight is far from finished.

Israel's military says an ""extensive"" wave of airstrikes has hit more than 300 Hezbollah targets Monday as residents of southern Lebanon are being warned to stay away from buildings where the terrorist group is storing weapons.

The strikes are in response to Hezbollah launching around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel on Sunday following Israeli military operations that resulted in the deaths of multiple top Hezbollah commanders. Monday's strikes so far have killed more than 180 in Lebanon and have left over 700 injured, health officials there told The Associated Press.

""I urge the Lebanese residents... who are inside or near houses where rockets and weapons are stored, to move away immediately! For your safety and protection,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement.

Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, the National News Agency said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a meeting with military officials Monday that ""For those who have not yet understood, I want to clarify Israel's policy--- we do not wait for a threat, we anticipate it. Everywhere, in every arena, at any time. We eliminate senior officials, eliminate terrorists, eliminate missiles... Whoever tries to hurt us, we hurt him even harder.:

""I repeat and reiterate: Israel does not seek war. But we have the right and the duty to defend our people,"" Israeli President Isaac Herzog added on X, sharing a video he claims ""shows how Hezbollah stores and launches missiles in civilian areas and homes."""

President Biden is set to deliver remarks at the United Nation's General Assembly on Tuesday morning as leaders and representatives from 134 countries pour into New York City for the convention. Though notably, the heads of some top authoritarian nations embroiled in international conflicts across the globe will not be in attendance.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un will not be in attendance, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is set to give a speech Tuesday despite international pushback amid Tehran's support for terrorism, interference in November's U.S. election and assassination threats against American politicians, including former President Trump.

According to reports on Monday, Pezeshkian told reporters from New York, ""We don't want war ... we want to live in peace.""

But his comments are not expected to be taken at face value, and Biden, who will speak ahead of the Iranian president, will ""rally global action to tackle the world's most pressing challenges,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday.

Biden is expected to outline his administration's priorities and vision for the international body in what will be his last address to the U.N. as president.

According to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Washington has three major areas of focus it will emphasize during the week's events, including continued efforts to ""end the scourge of war"" as roughly a quarter of the world's population lives in ""conflict-affected areas"" amid mounting wars.

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT 7

The U.S. also plans to push other member nations to ramp up their support for humanitarian aid workers while also working to create a more ""inclusive and effective international system"" by adding two new permanent seats to the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) for African nations as well as another rotating seat reserved for Small Island Developing States.

But as the Biden administration moves to shake things up in the international body while some authoritarian leaders are noticeably absent, one U.N. expert pointed to his concern that the U.N. is skirting the threats of today by holding a meeting focused on ambiguous concerns of tomorrow.

""I wish [there was] a 'Summit of the Present' and not a 'Summit of the Future,' because the future gives us a chance to be gauzy,"" Hugh Dugan, who served as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations and as senior adviser to 11 U.S. ambassadors to the U.N. between 1989 and 2015, told Fox News Digital in reference to the ""Summit of the Future"" event that was held over the weekend.

""A lot of hyperbole is going to be heard this week,"" he added. ""If it were the 'Summit of the Present,' that would imply accountability now, whether we're effective now and whether the U.N. is efficient.""

Despite Thomas-Greenfield's calls for ""hope"" during her Friday remarks, there was a notable sense of gloom ahead of the summit as massive international conflicts persist with no obvious end in sight, including Russia's war in Ukraine, Israel's fight against Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah, the gang takeover of Haiti, and civil wars in Sudan and Myanmar.

UN'S 'PACT FOR THE FUTURE' FULL OF EMPTY PROMISES, WILL BE 'CUDGEL' TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES, EXPERT WARNS

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters last week that the Summit of the Future was a challenge issued to nations last year to come prepared and ""was born out of a cold hard fact: International challenges are moving faster than our ability to solve them.""

Guterres highlighted ""out-of-control geopolitical divisions"" and ""runaway"" conflicts, climate change and an unclear path forward in how to cope with artificial intelligence, which is an enormous issue that has prompted a race largely between the U.S. and China over how to develop and utilize it across multiple sectors, including military integration.

""Global institutions and frameworks are today totally inadequate to deal with these complex and even existential challenges,"" he said. ""And it's no great surprise. Those institutions were born in a bygone era for a bygone world.

""We can't create a future fit for our grandchildren with systems built for our grandparents,"" he warned in a tone that is expected to carry throughout the summit.

But Dugan again pointed to the issue of accountability, and he questioned whether it is easier for the top U.N. official to push for major changes in the U.N. rather than evaluate any ongoing mismanagement of spending, bureaucracy and internal politics within the U.N.

Though 134 nations will attend this year's event, the heads of two of the five permanent UNSC seats will be absent as China's Xi and Russia's Putin have sent delegations in their place, a move that has become increasingly common in recent years.

Dugan, who served on the National Security Council during the Trump administration where he dealt with international organizations, said this practice lets the authoritarian leaders avoid the need to answer tough questions largely derived from Western nations and their regional allies, but it also suggests they are ""not concerned about showing disrespect.""

When asked about what this means about the state of the U.N. and its legitimacy, in particular the U.N. Security Council, which has become sharply divided between the U.S., Britain and France versus Russia and China after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Dugan said he believes the U.N. Security Council continues to hold significant standing in the global community.

""I'm always of the view that it does have legitimacy,"" he said. ""It's easy for us to say, well, it can't get a consensus, or it doesn't come to a conclusion that we seek and, therefore, say it's not legitimate. I don't believe that is the case.

""It's true test of its ability is its ability to continue to convene people around the table,"" Dugan continued. ""Even if the head of state isn't at that table, the delegations know it's too dangerous not to be at that table."""
GREG GUTFELD: Trump voters expect deeds while Harris voters are fine with words,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-trump-voters-expect-deeds-while-harris-voters-fine-words,2024-09-24T03:35:34Z,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel react to the differences between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on 'Gutfeld!'

You could not get a clearer contrast. And yet, there will be those who hear Harris and love it every bit as much as you loved what you heard from Trump. So why this great divide? Well, it has to do with deeds and words. Trump voters expect deeds. Harris voters are fine with words. A Trump supporter votes for Trump expecting him to act, but a Harris supporter votes for Harris and that is the act. The act of voting is itself the policy and the point. Specifics don't matter. The vote is the virtue signal, a simple requirement with no follow-up necessary.

And that was by design, that the only basis for voting for a Democrat, whether it was Biden or Harris, was that it was only the vote that mattered and that it be against Trump. They can literally switch candidates from one with dementia to another with wet brain. They just expect you to vote for them no matter what. It's an anti-vote, an un-vote. The Harris voters will pull the lever for Kamala and then recede back into their lives where the issues the rest of us care about are left ignored, whether it's illegal immigration, rising crime, [or] the 20% increase in food and gas prices.

Because they've been convinced that none of that matters except only this one-time heroic vote for Kamala. After all, she could be the first Black and Indian female president to get us into a nuclear war. For proof, listen to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle with a New York Times columnist aboard-- prioritizing a vote for Harris over actual policies.

BRET STEPHENS: It's not too much to ask, Kamala, say are you for a Palestinian state if Hamas is going to run that state?

BRET STEPHENS: Yes or no?

STEPHANIE RUHLE: And let's say you don't like her answer. Are you going to vote for Donald Trump?

BRET STEPHENS: No, I'm not.

STEPHANIE RUHLE: Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump. We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016, for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy.

KAMALA HARRIS HIT FOR BEING VAGUE, DODGING QUESTIONS IN RECENT INTERVIEWS: 'SHE OWES US THESE ANSWERS'

You know, I'd say she's dumber than a box of rocks, but at least you can throw those at Brian Kilmeade. That's a strategy and it might work. So how do you persuade a Democrat voter that it's a mistake to support Kamala when they aren't even interested in issues? The only counter-strategy is not to call them idiots; that's going to fall on deaf ears. Instead, direct their attention to those outlets who are telling them what to believe.

For the best way to unravel a naive liberal is to expose the lies of those who feed them the lies-- meaning debunk the brainwasher. So next time you get a chance, simply ask a Kamala supporter: Why not Trump? And when they call Trump a racist or sexist, which they will, be prepared to debunk the lies, whether it's the fine people hoax, the drinking bleach hoax or any lawfare. All it takes is one debunking to get them to think that their media isn't giving them the whole story. So you're not asking them to vote for Trump, you're just suggesting whether the information they're getting on Trump is really, in fact, trustworthy.

CNN COMMENTATOR SLAMS HARRIS AFTER OPRAH WINFREY SIT-DOWN: 'WHEN HAS SHE SAT DOWN WITH ANY HOSTILE MEDIA?'

It helps to remind them that 85 to 90% of the media is pro-Kamala and anti-Trump, which tells them that when they believe they're listening to legit news, they're actually being propagandized and brainwashed. That's the first step out of this bubble of blather. And next, if they're open to it, ask them to watch those two interviews because you simply cannot watch both and walk away thinking your media has been telling you the truth.

And maybe that will tell them not to let those like The View make their decisions because they'd have you voting for Harris and then celebrating with that triple order of fettuccine Alfredo."

The US is trying to broker an end to the war between Israel and Hamas. Ceasefire talks begin and end and begin again. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has traveled to the region 10 times in the past year.

And that's not the only war the US hopes to end. Russia and Ukraine have been fighting since 2014 when Russia first attacked. It launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, more than two and a half years ago.

The US and NATO have been supporting Ukraine's efforts to hold off Russia in a hope to preserve broader security and stability in Western Europe.

The next occupant of the White House looks certain to inherit two major conflicts.

Why are these wars lasting so long with no end in sight?

"US sending more troops to Middle East, Netanyahu warns Lebanese as Israel-Hezbollah conflict heightens",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-sending-more-troops-middle-east-netanyahu-warns-lebanese-israel-hezbollah-conflict-heightens,2024-09-23T18:40:35Z,"Fox News' Nate Foy reports live from Israel on the escalating conflict with Hezbollah.

The United States is sending more troops to the Middle East, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning to the Lebanese people regarding the heightening conflict with Hezbollah.

""In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region. But for operational security reasons, I'm not going to comment on or provide specifics,"" Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during an off-camera gaggle Monday.

The U.S. already has 40,000 troops in the region. The new deployments come after significant strikes by Israeli forces against targets inside Lebanon that have killed hundreds and as Israel is preparing to conduct further operations. Netanyahu released a video statement Monday addressed to ""the people of Lebanon.""

""Israel's war is not with you. It's with Hezbollah. For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garages,"" Netanyahu said. ""Those rockets and missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens. To defend our people against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out those weapons.""

KIRBY SLAMS HAMAS CHIEF SINWAR AS 'THE MAJOR OBSTACLE' TO CEASE-FIRE, HOSTAGE RELEASE DEAL WITH ISRAEL

""Now starting this morning, the IDF has warned you to get out of harm's way,"" Netanyahu added. ""I urge you - take this warning seriously. Don't let Hezbollah endanger your lives and the lives of your loved ones. Don't let Hezbollah endanger Lebanon. Please, get out of harm's way now. Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.""

He spoke as Israeli warplanes continued to strike Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon.

Fox News confirmed that Netanyahu's cabinet approved a ""special situation"" - similar to a state of emergency - on Israel's home front on Monday. According to the Israeli government, the declaration significantly expands Israel Defense Forces (IDF) powers to give public directives, permitting the military to ban gatherings, limit studies and issue ""additional instructions required to save lives.""

ISRAEL SAYS IT CONDUCTED RETALIATORY STRIKES AGAINST HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON, STRUCK HAMAS IN GAZA

The U.S. State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases.

""Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,"" the State Department cautioned Saturday. Ryder would not say if the additional forces might support the evacuation of those citizens if needed.

Additionally on Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman, two destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Mediterranean on a regularly scheduled deployment, opening the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Gulf of Oman, nearby in case further violence breaks out, according to The Associated Press.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held back-to-back calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the weekend as he pressed for a cease-fire and a reduction of tensions in the region, Ryder said.

""Given the tensions, given the escalation, as I highlighted, there is the potential for a wider regional conflict. I don't think we're there yet, but it's a dangerous situation,"" Ryder said.

The U.S. presence in the Middle East is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks.

"Katie Phang: From Sen. Kennedy to Trump, Republican rage rhetoric is consuming the GOP",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-jd-vance-republican-rage-rhetoric-rcna172263,2024-09-23T18:26:27Z,"When people -- and political parties -- show you who they are, believe them ... each and every time.

Last week, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on antisemitism and Islamophobia, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana accused Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute, of supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.

After Berry, the only Muslim witness in the hearing, repeatedly denied Kennedy's accusations -- and pointed out how insulting they were -- the senator went on a tirade that ended with him telling Berry to ""hide [her] head in a bag.""

It was a disgusting scene and it was the latest example of something that has become part of the DNA of the GOP: what I now call Republican rage rhetoric.

We saw a similar display last week from the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who vowed to restore his anti-Muslim travel ban, during an event in Washington, D.C.:

The old saying is true, ""The fish rots from the head.""

But the incredible thing is that this racist and xenophobic rhetoric is used as a tool and a scare tactic to convince people to vote. Trump told attendees at a rally in New York last week that immigrants from Africa, the Middle East and Asia were ""destroying the fabric of life in our country.""

""We are not going to take it any longer and you've got to get rid of these people. Give me a shot. You will have a safe New York within three months,"" he said.

""Give me a shot."" It's like that line out of The Temptations song ""Ball of Confusion:"" ""Vote for me and I'll set you free."" Free to do what? To be racist? To be anti-immigrant?

We owe so much to immigrants who helped build the foundation of this country. But for Republicans, this outrageous messaging is just dangerous red meat for their base. They don't care if it's even true.

Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, admitted to CNN that he was fine with ""creating stories"" to get the media to pay attention. After Republicans ""created"" insulting stories about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, officials say the city has faced dozens of bomb threats, schools and city buildings have been shuttered, and the Haitian community is living in terror.

Vance, one of Ohio's two U.S. senators, still justifies perpetuating those baseless stories because the media wasn't focusing on their campaign enough.

These are not the men you want running the nation. These are not the men you want representing us on an international stage.

But on Thursday, Trump took things a step even further, using remarks that were supposed to focus on combating antisemitism to question his lack of support from Jewish voters and call his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, ""the enemy.""

""If I don't win this election -- and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens, because, at 40%, that means 60% of the people are voting for the enemy -- Israel, in my opinion, will cease to exist within two years,"" Trump said.

Harris has been a prosecutor, an attorney general, a senator and now the vice president of the United States but, in this climate of political violence, Trump has reduced her to ""the enemy.""

Look, I can't tell you how to vote but I can show you who you're voting for.

Some members of the Republican Party don't embrace the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Instead, Trump says that immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of our country."" Trump says migrants are ""animals."" Trump says that immigrants are wrecking our country.

They're saying the quiet part loud. But the real question here is: Are you listening? They'll take your vote but once they have it they'll cast you aside, if not cast you out of the country. Come November, you must vote like your future depends on it -- because it does."
Patricia Heaton leads fightback campaign against antisemitism on college campuses: 'Have to stand up',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/patricia-heaton-fightback-campaign-antisemitic-vandalism-college-campuses,2024-09-23T16:03:13Z,"Actress Patricia Heaton joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss her decision to launch the nonprofit O7C, an organization that encourages Christians to help fight against antisemitism as war rages in the Middle East.

Actress Patricia Heaton couldn't believe her eyes when she saw Hamas body camera footage, flaunting the terror group's attacks against Israel on social media last October 7.

After students across U.S. college campuses erupted in protest, Heaton decided to take matters into her own hands to fight back.

""I couldn't believe it, and I was outraged,"" the ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" star told Fox News on Monday.

""I looked around for everyone else who was going to be outraged... and it was very silent, so my partner and I created the October 7th Coalition or O7C to help Christians activate, to be as visibly and vocally supportive of Israel, the Jewish people, and fight antisemitism""

ACTRESS PATRICIA HEATON RALLIES CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY TO FIGHT ANTISEMITISM: 'IT'S UP TO US' TO DO SOMETHING

Jewish Americans have been subjected to antisemitism in various ways, with incidents of Jewish-owned businesses being vandalized with Nazi symbols, protesters blocking some Jewish students from entering class and now even some Jewish students seeing their mezuzah - a piece of parchment containing a prayer that is commonly fixed to a door frame - disappear from their dorms.

Harvard student Sarah Silverman described her experience in an op-ed published in The Harvard Crimson earlier this month, writing in part, ""I bounded out of my Thayer dorm, toothbrush and toothpaste in hand, when I noticed something was missing. In the place where my mezuzah -- a Jewish ritual object traditionally placed on doorposts -- had been so tightly secured, only a bit of sticky adhesive I had used to hang it remained.""

The mezuzah was later discovered across the hallway, two doors down from Silverman, and tucked into a wall.

PATRICIA HEATON DEFENDS CHIEFS KICKER FOLLOWING GRADUATION SPEECH BACKLASH: 'HE'S NOT A MONSTER'

""I am left to speculate whether this was a targeted act. Worst of all, I'm left wondering whether someone on my floor -- or even someone I had just met -- hated my identity so much that they felt compelled to frighten me,"" she continued later in the piece.

Stories like Silverman's inspired Heaton and O7C to raise awareness with the #Myzuzah/Yourzuzah campaign, which encourages participants to record and post a video of themselves putting up a mezuzah and using the hashtag #myzuzahyourzuzah.

""We have to stand up for the Jewish people... so that's what we've been working on,"" she said."
"Israel's strikes in Lebanon kill more than 180 people, Lebanese officials say",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123377/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-fighting,2024-09-23T14:14:21Z,"BEIRUT -- Fighting has escalated at the Israeli-Lebanese border, as Israeli strikes killed more than 180 people largely in southern Lebanon on Monday, according to Lebanese health authorities, in one of the deadliest days of nearly a year of conflict in the region.

Lebanon's Health Ministry says children, women and health care workers were among those killed in Israeli cross-border attacks in southern Lebanon.

Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah have been trading large numbers of attacks across the border since the war in Gaza began in October last year. Hezbollah's leadership says it is acting out of solidarity with Palestinians and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.

The Israeli military says it is fighting Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, to prevent an assault in northern Israel similar to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. Israel says it wants degrade Hezbollah's rocket-launching capabilities, push Hezbollah fighters away from the border and allow Israeli families who evacuated the northern region to return home, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reported on Morning Edition.

The Israeli military says its forces struck more than 300 targets, many of which it described as Hezbollah weapons storage depots. Strikes damaged several buildings inside populated areas in Lebanon's south as well as farther east in the country's Bekaa Valley, but at least one landed some 80 miles north of the border near the city of Byblos, according to Lebanon's state-run broadcaster.

Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets at Israel in recent days, following the explosion of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies last week that killed dozens of people and injured thousands more mainly in Lebanon. Israel has not publicly acknowledged a role in the blasts. But a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that Israel notified Washington it carried out last Tuesday's attacks in Lebanon.

Hezbollah's leadership said in a statement Monday it was targeting dozens of rockets at an Israeli military post in northern Israel. Residents in the city of Nazareth told NPR it was a ""scary night"" into early Monday morning, with ""rockets and interceptions over us all night.""

Israeli authorities acknowledge there have been repeated air raid sirens in the country's north, indicating incoming rocket fire from Lebanon.

On Friday, an airstrike over the Lebanese capital city, Beirut, killed at least 50 Hezbollah fighters and civilians, including children. Israel's military said that strike had targeted a senior Hezbollah commander.

Across villages and towns in southern Lebanon, residents have been departing for safer regions away from the border. Several months ago, Israeli military officials ordered residents living in communities on the Israeli side of that border to also evacuate as skirmishes and tit-for-tat missile barrages intensified.

The Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, warned people living in southern and eastern Lebanon to leave their homes as the air campaign against Hezbollah's fighters and positions increases to widen.

Residents in southern regions received messages in Arabic instructing them to move away from known weapons storage sites controlled by Hezbollah, according to local Lebanese media, prompting a large migration of people inside Lebanon.

Cars filled the main road north from the southern city of Sidon, up the coastline toward Beirut, although some Israeli airstrikes have repeatedly landed dozens of miles inside Lebanese territory."
IDF ops in Beirut bring closure for some; Hezbollah terrorists who killed Americans now dead,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-ops-beirut-bring-closure-for-some-hezbollah-terrorists-who-killed-americans-now-dead,2024-09-23T11:39:53Z,"JERUSALEM -- Israel secured long-overdue justice for the family members of American military and diplomatic personnel murdered by Hezbollah, including the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut.

The initial lack of alleged enthusiasm from the Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers for the targeted killings of senior Hezbollah mass murderers sparked criticism among top counter-terrorism experts.

Take the example of Israel's elimination on Friday of Ibrahim Aqil, who was wanted by the United States for both the bombing of the U.S. embassy, which killed 63 people, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983, when 241 U.S. military personnel were killed by the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The U.S. had a $7 million bounty on Aqil's head, who was the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan force. In July, Israel assassinated Hezbollah military Chief of Staff Fuad Shukr, who, like Aqil, was involved in the 1983 Beirut bombings.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on X"" The families of the Marines killed in Beirut have waited decades for justice. I'm thankful Israel helped deliver it by taking out one of the world's most vicious terrorists -- Ibrahim Aqil. Let this be a message to Iran and Iran's proxies everywhere.""

A Washington Post report cited Ryan Crocker, whose office was on the fourth floor of the embassy when the blast went off, as commenting on Aqil's death, ""It is still a source of some satisfaction that he finally got it."" Crocker went on to serve as U.S. ambassador to Syria, Iraq and several other nations.

Max Abrahms, a leading expert on counter-terrorism and a tenured professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital that, ""Targeted killings have been a cornerstone of U.S. counterterrorism since the 9/11 attacks. And yet, Israel killing Hezbollah terrorists with American blood on their hands has been rebuked by Democrat leaders.""

He added ""The fact that even targeted killings of terrorists with American blood stained hands get rebuked unmasks the Democratic leadership, which spent the last year pretending that it objected to the Gaza campaign after 10/7 because of its negative impact on the Palestinian population. As we have seen, the Democratic leadership opposes all Israeli measures to counterterrorism, even ones perfectly executed that eliminate any civilian harm.""

Criticism of the Biden administration's initial lackluster response to the killing of Aqil on Friday appeared to prompt a response from U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who called Aqil's death ""a good outcome"" on Saturday.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""That individual has American blood on his hands and has a Reward for Justice price on his head,"" Sullivan said. He added ""He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.""

White House National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told ""Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream"" that ""Nobody, including Secretary Austin, is shedding a tear over the death of Mr. Aqil, who does have American blood on his hands. I think the world's better for not having him walking around on the planet anymore. But that doesn't mean we want to see a full out war. We don't believe again, that that's in the best interest of the Israeli people.""

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital that, ""The success of Israel's aims is a multi-faceted American interest. First, the demise of so many prominent Hezbollah leaders involves the death of many who are on the American wanted lists, on many of whom the United States has placed hefty bounties. Despite the bounties, however, it was clear the United States had long ago abandoned any effort to bring any of these killers of American servicemen, diplomats and intelligence officers to justice. Their wholesale demise in a matter of two or three days by Israel only further highlights the gap between the lofty rhetoric of a half century of the American foreign policy establishment and the more dishonorable reality.""

He added ""That the U.S. is now taking a de-escalatory position - which creates equivalence between our democratic ally and the terrorists that have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands, is simply disgraceful. At least now, albeit at Israel's hands rather than ours, our sacred servicemen have been avenged.""

Wurmser noted that ""In the Middle East, we are fortunate to have a powerful and loyal ally that shares our values, Israel, that is attracting a collection of other friendly states to begin to forge a local regional alliance to challenge the region's forces of instability, foremost among them being Iran's regime.""

Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital that, ""Over a short period of time, Israel recently eliminated Hezbollah terrorists who were there from the beginning and played hands on rolls and attacks against Americans in the 1980s. U.S. intelligence has been tracking these people for decades.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He added ""But these strikes also have very current implications, given that Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil, together with Ali Karaki, have been jointly running as well as Islamic Jihad organization as a triumvirate since the death of Mustafa Badreddine in Syria several years ago. They were foot soldiers in the 1980s and rose to the highest ranks of the organization.""

Lisa Daftari, an Iranian-American expert on the Islamic Republic and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital that, ""In eliminating Ibrahim Aqil, Israel has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to combating global terrorism -- a fight that serves the interests of all nations dedicated to opposing radical extremism.""

She added, ""The Biden administration should openly commend Israel's efforts and provide robust support, rather than calling for restraint. It's crucial to recognize that if groups like Hezbollah and Hamas cease their hostilities, we may achieve peace. But if Israel halts its operations now, it will continue to endure relentless terrorism, similar to the attacks witnessed on October 7. Our collective security hinges on Israel's resolve to dismantle these threats.""

Retired Marine Corps Sergeant Major Steve Aitken, who was stationed on a boat offshore as the injured were transferred to ships for medical treatment following the terrorist attack, told the Washington Post that Aqil's death was ""God's judgment,"" adding, ""You might get away, but you're not going to get by ... Our memory is long. Israel's is even longer.""

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also stressed the significance of Israel's assassination of Aqil writing on X, ""Ibrahim Aqil was a vicious terrorist mastermind who helped murder hundreds of Americans. On behalf of the families of the Marines killed in the Beirut bombings -- and on behalf of all Americans -- I'm grateful justice has finally been served to this killer.""

Aqil also oversaw Hezbollah's operations in Syria, where he enabled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to wipe out hundreds of thousands of his own Arab citizens."

Israel's military says an ""extensive"" wave of airstrikes has hit more than 300 Hezbollah targets Monday as residents of southern Lebanon reportedly are receiving text messages warning them to stay away from buildings where the terrorist group is storing weapons.

The strikes are in response to Hezbollah launching around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel on Sunday following Israeli military operations that resulted in the deaths of multiple top Hezbollah commanders.

""If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,"" reads a text message in Arabic that residents of Lebanon have been receiving, according to local media reports cited by the Associated Press.

The Lebanese Health Ministry is asking hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley to postpone surgeries that could be done later. The ministry said in a statement that its request aimed to keep hospitals ready to deal with people wounded by ""Israel's expanding aggression on Lebanon.""

HEZBOLLAH LAUNCHES ROCKETS AT ISRAEL: 'OPEN-ENDED BATTLE'

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Monday's strikes from Israel hit a forested area in the central province of Byblos, about 81 miles north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, for the first time since the exchanges between the two sides began in October, according to the AP. No injuries were reported there.

Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, the National News Agency said. It added that a total of 30 people were wounded in the strikes.

The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that ""[s]o far over 300 Hezbollah targets have been struck today,"" and that it is ""currently conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon.""

""I repeat and reiterate: Israel does not seek war. But we have the right and the duty to defend our people,"" Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote on X, sharing a video he claims ""shows how Hezbollah stores and launches missiles in civilian areas and homes.""

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT. 7 ATTACK

""Thousands and thousands of long-range rockets are kept in houses, living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens, and then launched with the sole intention of killing our people. Would you accept this in your or your neighbor's home?"" Herzog asked. ""What nation would accept its citizens living under such a threat from its neighbors?""

The latest escalation between Israeli forces and Hezbollah comes as Lebanon is still reeling from a series of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday last week. The explosions killed at least 37 people and wounded about 3,000, according to local officials. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.

Hezbollah's deputy leader, Naim Kassem, said Sunday's rocket attack against Israel was just the beginning of what is now an ""open-ended battle.""

Shortly after Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, Ukrainian war correspondent Andriy Tsaplienko was live on TV. The anchor asked him how long the fighting might last.

""I said it could take a couple of years to calm down the situation,"" Tsaplienko recalled. ""When the anchor heard it, he was really terrified on a live broadcast.""

In the 10 years since then, Tsaplienko has been detained and beaten by Russian troops. He's also suffered shrapnel wounds that left him with a limp. He's covered every twist and turn in the fighting -- and still doesn't know when the war will end.

""I don't want to say forever, but for a long time, maybe another next decade,"" he said in an interview in Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

The Ukraine-Russia war, and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, are both part of feuds with long histories. Ukraine declared independence from Russia in 1918, then lost a war in the years that followed. Ukraine didn't gain independence from Moscow until the 1991 Soviet Union breakup. Meanwhile, the Israel-Hamas battle is part of the larger Israeli-Palestinian dispute that also stretches back a century.

In both current wars, a common question is, ""When will the fighting end?"" But given the tortured history, it might be better to ask, ""Will it ever end?""

""Both of these conflicts have very, very, high stakes that are relatively indivisible,"" said Gideon Rose, who's with the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of How Wars End.

""Russia is trying to conquer Ukraine. Ukraine is trying to fight for its life. The Israelis are trying to suppress all attacks from Gaza and the Palestinians are trying to avoid being completely subjugated,"" said Rose, adding that this doesn't leave a lot of room for compromise.

These conflicts also reflect a harsh reality of many moderns wars. They can grind on inconclusively -- even when the fighting reaches the point where neither side can score a complete battlefield victory.

""Sometimes there is no solution for a decade or two,"" said Paul Salem, who's based in Beirut with the Middle East Institute. ""You've got to manage the problem. You got to contain it. You got to make sure we don't go into World War III.""

These current battlefield scenarios aren't new. In the past, some wars endured for many years, or even decades. But several factors contribute to making modern wars last a long time, and these two in particular.

First, weapons and technology have never flowed so freely. This means a smaller military can get its hands on more and better weapons than previously. Ukraine uses cheap drones to counter Russia's much larger traditional army.

""Drones are just a toy turned into a weapon,"" Andriy Tsaplienko. ""One drone can cost maybe up to $1,000, and you can attack a bigger target like a tank, and destroy the tank, which costs $3 million.""

In the Middle East, Israel receives the vast majority of its advanced weapons from the U.S. Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon used to fire short-range rockets that only threatened communities just across the border in southern and northern Israel.

But with help from Iran, those two groups have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel, and can now strike throughout much of the country.

A second key factor in both conflicts is how they have repeatedly defied lasting political solutions.

""It's not enough to have a military strategy,"" said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security advisor in Israel. ""You have to have a political one as well. And Israel hasn't had one for years and years, to my thinking, on the Palestinian issue.""

The Israelis and Palestinians were close to a political settlement way back in the year 2000. Today, a full-fledged peace deal appears more distant than ever.

Paul Salem notes that Israel used to fight traditional state-versus-state wars against neighboring Arab countries -- like Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Now Israel is trying to maintain long-term control over Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

""You can win a war, but it's hard to win an occupation,"" said Salem. ""Beating a state and getting the state to say, 'OK, I lose,' or 'I'm going to stop,' is different than maintaining an occupation, which the Israelis have not managed to do sustainably.""

Meanwhile, Russian leader Vladimir Putin meddled in Ukraine's politics for years, seeking to place or keep a Kremlin-friendly leader in power in Kyiv. When that failed, Russia invaded, initially in 2014, and then again, on a much larger scale in 2022.

Leaders often have an incentive to keep fighting

Ultimately, most wars do end with negotiations, though the two sides tend to make a deal only after one or both have reached the point of exhaustion.

""We assume war is so terrible, therefore it must be the incentive of people to stop it,"" said Gideon Rose. ""That's not necessarily the case.""

He notes that leaders waging the wars often make very different calculations than soldiers and civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict.

""Somebody who initiates a war usually has a strong incentive to keep fighting, because unless he can get a real victory when it ends, he's kind of in trouble,"" said Rose.

Leaders who lose wars tend to be tossed out of power, and the potential consequences can be even more serious.

The International Criminal Court in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Russia's Vladimir Putin, and prosecutors are seeking warrants for Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

And in times of war, leaders often pursue goals that may be beyond their reach. Israel's Netanyahu calls for ""total victory"" over Hamas. He wants to end the group's rule over Gaza, and its threat to Israel, once and for all.

Yet Chuck Freilich said Hamas and its allies, Iran and Hezbollah, see mere survival as a victory, and are pursuing their own long-term plans.

""This is a multi-decade war in which there will be round-after-round. And they [Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran] are fully cognizant of that,"" he said.

Freilich also added this sobering note.

""I would say that Iran is an enemy which is too big, too far away, too powerful and maybe too sophisticated in its thinking for Israel to be able to defeat it,"" he said. ""Now, I believe Israel can defend itself against Iran, but I'm not sure that we can defeat it as we did to the Arab countries.""

In the Russia-Ukraine war, Putin describes Ukraine as not being a real country, a place that should be part of Russia.

Andriy Tsaplienko, the Ukrainian war correspondent, says this is exactly why Ukraine keeps fighting.

""We realize this war is crucially important for Ukrainians,"" he said. ""This is the existential war. We will live or we won't live. That's it. I mean, as a nation in general. So that's why we will fight to the end."""
Israel tells Lebanese to leave area where Hezbollah stores arms as it launches strikes,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/g-s1-24128/israel-tells-lebanese-to-leave-area-where-hezbollah-stores-arms-as-it-launches-strikes,2024-09-23T08:01:27Z,"JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military on Monday called on residents of southern Lebanon to immediately evacuate homes and other buildings where Hezbollah stores weapons and said it was carrying out ""extensive strikes"" against the militant group.

It was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire on Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters

The escalating strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of an all-out war, even as Israel is still battling the Palestinian Hamas in Gaza and trying to return scores of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group, while Israel says it is committed to returning calm to the border.

An Israeli military official said Israel is focused on aerial operations and has no immediate plans for a ground operation. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said the strikes are aimed at curbing Hezbollah's ability to launch more strikes into Israel.

Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice.

""If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,"" the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media.

It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire.

Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead it to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in.

The military said it had targeted more than 150 militant sites early Monday. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media of airstrikes and large plumes of smoke. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes on different areas.

An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children.

Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed Israel for the attacks, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility.

Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified over the past year.

The fighting has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon, dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. It has also sparked brush fires that have destroyed agriculture and scarred the landscape.

Israel has vowed to push Hezbollah back from the border so its citizens can return to their homes, saying it prefers to do so diplomatically but is willing to use force. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary.

Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.

Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."
Hezbollah launches rockets at Israel after overnight airstrikes: 'Open-ended battle',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-launches-rockets-israel-overnight-airstrikes,2024-09-23T00:13:16Z,"Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata breaks down the latest conflicts emerging from the Middle East during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into northern Israel on Sunday in response to a series of Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon, pushing both sides closer to the brink of full-scale war.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) airstrikes targeting Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon killed dozens, including one of the group's top commanders, Ibrahim Akil.

Hezbollah's deputy leader, Naim Kassem, said Sunday's rocket attack was just the beginning of what's now an ""open-ended battle"" with Israel.

At Akil's funeral, Kassem vowed Hezbollah would continue military operations against Israel but also warned of unexpected attacks ""from outside the box,"" pointing to rockets fired deeper into Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would take whatever action was necessary to restore security in the north and allow people to return to their homes.

""No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either,"" he said.

Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, told reporters the army is prepared to increase pressure on Hezbollah in the coming days, adding, ""We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated.""

ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE ON TERRORIST TARGETS, ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

The Israeli military said it struck about 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers, across southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours, thwarting an even larger attack.

""Last night, hundreds of thousands of Israelis woke up to rocket sirens as Hezbollah launched over 20 rockets towards northern Israel that left communities in ruins,"" IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said. ""This attack could have caused much more damage, but we were able to minimize their attack with a preemptive strike on rocket launchers across southern Lebanon.""

The latest tit-for-tat between Israeli forces and Hezbollah comes as Lebanon is still reeling from a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday. The explosions killed at least 37 people and wounded about 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.

Israeli forces have been trading fire with Hezbollah fighters almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking another 250 as hostages. Hezbollah leadership has said its attacks on Israel are in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza.

IDF SAYS KEY HAMAS OPERATIVE KILLED IN GAZA, FOLLOWING CRIPPLING STRIKE ON HEZBOLLAH

The low-level fighting has killed dozens in Israel, hundreds in Lebanon and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. But the fighting has intensified in recent weeks, with Israel shifting its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Some have expressed concerns that the fight against Hezbollah will strain resources and complicate prospects for an already elusive cease-fire deal.

Retired Army Brig. Anthony Tata told ""Fox & Friends"" that the conflict would only grow and chided the Biden administration for what he deemed a lack of ""moral clarity.""

""It's critical that Netanyahu keeps his eye on the main fight, which is Hamas, and he eliminates Hamas,"" Tata said. ""The main effort is still Hamas. And I think what they have to do is hold what they've got and hold off Hezbollah until they finish up Hamas, and then they can move to the north and ... destroy Hezbollah. You can't do two things at once equally well.""

Asked Sunday if he was worried about rising tensions in the Middle East, President Biden said, ""Yes, I am.""

""But we're going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we're still pushing hard,"" Biden added.

Hamas is still holding around 100 captives from its attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, a third of whom are believed to be dead. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military said Sunday it intercepted multiple aerial devices fired from the direction of Iraq after Iran-backed militant groups there claimed to have launched a drone attack on Israel."

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres defended the UNRWA's operations in Gaza on Sunday, saying only ""a few elements"" of the organization were affiliated with Hamas.

Israeli ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon claimed last week that the UNRWA is completely taken over by Hamas. Guterres has admitted that Hamas ""infiltrated"" the organization, but said during a Sunday appearance on CNN that there is no evidence behind Israel's claims.

""The fact is there was an infiltration with a few elements that indeed participated in the 7th of October,"" Guterres said, condemning the action.

""A lot of things have been invented that do not correspond at all to the truth,"" he continued. ""Of course there are tunnels below the premises of UNRWA, as there are tunnels everywhere in Gaza. But there has never been any commitment of UNRWA in general to provide any kind of support to Hamas.""

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER: 'DOZENS' OF UNRWA STAFF TOOK PART IN HAMAS' OCT 7 MASSACRE

Meanwhile, Israel has doubled down on its accusations regarding UNRWA. Danon accused Guterres and the U.N. of ""burying its head in the sand"" on the issue. Danon himself was defending an Israeli airstrike that hit the UNRWA al-Jaouni school in a Gaza refugee camp last week.

""Those who were killed in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7. In case there are still any doubts, there are the names of the Hamas terrorists who were at the school compound disguised as 'local UNRWA employees,'"" he Danon said.

The school, which was not operational, was being used as a Hamas command and control center, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

Just last month, Fox News Digital reported that UNRWA was forced to fire nine employees because of their likely involvement in Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

The U.S. suspended funding to UNRWA because of the role some of its employees played in the Oct. 7 massacre. President Biden had initially restarted aid to the controversy-hit agency upon assuming office after former President Trump's decision to defund the organization in 2018.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman dodged questions about his and Vice President Kamala Harris' previous comments against fracking during a Sunday interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

""It's so strange why we keep talking about fracking,"" the Democratic senator said when asked about Harris' reversal on the issue over the last few years. ""Back in 2020 I said it might be an issue but that it's not going to be a defining issue, and now in 2024 we're still trying about fracking.""

The comments come as Harris has continued to face criticism for her reversal on the issue of fracking over the last few years, going from supporting a ban on the practice during her unsuccessful bid for president during the 2020 election to vowing not to support such a ban last month.

FETTERMAN REAMS OUT NY TIMES FOR PLATFORMING TERRORIST PROPAGANDA AFTER INTERVIEW WITH SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL

But Fetterman insisted that fracking is not an important issue during his interview Sunday, instead pivoting to attacking former President Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance for their comments on Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The other side, they're talking about eating cats and geese and dogs and saying absurd things,"" Fetterman said. ""Having a serious policy conversation when the other side is just absolutely on fire.""

Fetterman was then confronted with his own reversal on the issue, including a quote from 2016 in which he called fracking a ""stain"" on the state of Pennsylvania and another in 2018 in which he said he doesn't ""support fracking at all."" But by 2022 Fetterman had changed his tune, NBC News pointed out, displaying a quote in which he said he ""absolutely"" supported fracking.

FETTERMAN SETS POLITICS ASIDE AFTER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS US MUST 'TURN DOWN ... THE TEMPERATURE'

""What exactly do you like about fracking,"" Fetterman was asked.

""It's strange for some weird gotcha taking quotes out of context and here I am now, I am a United States senator I won by five points,"" Fetterman responded. ""I fully support fracking and so does Vice President Harris,"" he continued, before again pivoting to attacking the Republican ticket for their claims on ""eating dogs.""

Fetterman's home state of Pennsylvania, where fracking remains popular, figures to play a critical role in November's election, with Trump having narrowly won the state in 2016 before a similarly narrow defeat at the hands of President Biden in the state in 2020.

Fetterman acknowledged that the race between Trump and Harris will be ""very close,"" though he pushed back against the notion that the state's vote would be ""defined by fracking.""

"Kirby slams Hamas chief Sinwar as 'the major obstacle' to cease-fire, hostage release deal with Israel",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kirby-slams-hamas-chief-sinwar-the-major-obstacle-reaching-cease-fire-hostage-release-deal-israel,2024-09-22T17:05:49Z,"White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby discusses the latest in the Israel war as ceasefire talks persist.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby deemed the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, ""the major obstacle"" to achieving a cease-fire deal in recent weeks.

During an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Kirby responded to The Wall Street Journal's reporting that senior U.S. officials who hoped for months for a cease-fire and hostage release deal now do not expect Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement before the end of President Biden's term. The report cited administration officials as saying Hamas makes demands and ""then refuses to say 'yes' after the U.S. and Israel accept them.""

""It's certainly apparent to us that Mr. Sinwar remains the big obstacle here to getting a deal. And it certainly is the case that he has done nothing in the recent weeks to prove that he's willing to move this forward in a good faith way. He is the major obstacle, no question about it,"" Kirby said Sunday. ""It's tough to get them to say yes to things that he's already said that he wanted. So it's very, very difficult.""

""But as the president said the other day, everything's unrealistic until all of a sudden it's not anymore. And we're gonna keep trying at this,"" Kirby added. ""And this idea that we're just throwing up our hands and 'well, it's not gonna happen before the end of the term,' I can tell ya that's not where the president is. It's not where Jake Sullivan or Tony Blinken are. We still believe that there's a possibility of moving this forward, and we're gonna keep trying. Those hostages need an effort to get them home. We're not going to give up on that.""

ISRAEL SAYS IT CONDUCTED RETALIATORY STRIKES AGAINST HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON, STRUCK HAMAS IN GAZA

Kirby reiterated the administration's position that Israel has a right to defend itself, but acknowledged that some of the criticism of how Israel is handling the conflict has come from the Biden administration as well.

""They absolutely have a right to defend themselves. And we are still providing them the tools and capabilities to do that. But how they do it matters,"" Kirby said. ""President Biden has said that, Vice President Harris has said that to our Israeli counterparts. They need to be doing it in as precise and as discriminant a way to avoid damage to civilian infrastructure and more critically, to civilian life. So it does matter a lot to us.""

""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream also asked Kirby to respond to the death of Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs Friday.

Bream pointed to criticism from Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who suggested Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in expressing fear of escalation to Israeli officials after the strike, was not grateful enough to Israel for taking out a man responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans during the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.

HEZBOLLAH IDENTIFIES SECOND TOP COMMANDER KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN LEBANON

""Nobody, including Secretary Austin, is shedding a tear over the death of Mr. Akil, who does have American blood on his hands. I think the world's better for not having him walking around on the planet anymore. But that doesn't mean we want to see a full out war. We don't believe, again, that that's in the best interest of the Israeli people,"" Kirby said.

Akil was one of the Lebanon-based terrorist group's top military officials, in charge of its elite forces, and had been on Washington's wanted list for years.

The strike Friday came as the group was still reeling from an attack targeting Hezbollah communications earlier last week when thousands of pagers exploded simultaneously. The attack killed 12 people, mostly Hezbollah members, and injured thousands, according to Hezbollah officials. Israel is suspected of being behind that attack but has not claimed responsibility.

As Hezbollah has been launching rockets into Israel since October 2023, Kirby said the U.S. has been working at ""intense diplomacy here now for months to try to prevent an escalation in the conflict up at the blue line with Lebanon.""

""We still believe that there should be a strong effort to work on that diplomacy and to try to get that - that escalation to stop, to get the situation to stabilize, "" Kirby said.

Kirby also defended the Biden administration's handling of Iran, despite criticism from Republicans.

""Iran is one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world,"" Kirby said. ""And that's in part, actually large part, to what President Biden has done. Six hundred sanctions alone just in this administration, 60 sanction regimes. So I don't buy the argument that we somehow turned a blind eye and just given them cash."""

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reflected on how students at Columbia University, where she teaches a class, ""morphed"" from holding ""respectful"" dialogue on the war in Israel into holding ""nasty"" protests against the nation that she said were ""not student-led.""

""We basically sat down and answered questions for 45, 50 minutes, and the questions were really raw. I mean, we had a student from Palestine, a Palestinian student. We had a student from Israel, we had students from across the Middle East. We had students from Asia and obviously the rest of the world, struggling to understand what all of it meant. But it was a respectful, informative, open dialogue, and literally at the end of it, the students applauded,"" Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday morning of a class she held last year when war broke out in Israel.

Clinton co-teaches a political course at Columbia University, titled ""Inside the Situation Room,"" where she joined Columbia University students on the Wednesday following Oct. 7, when Hamas launched attacks on Israel and sparked the ongoing war. Clinton said following the ""open dialogue"" on campus, she witnessed rhetoric on campus ""morph into something that was not student-led.""

""Within a few days, we were doing an event, and we started being protested - the dean and I and our guests - and being screamed at, being called, you know, all kinds of names. What happened in that period? And the best I can sort of unpack it, is that there, there were already existing groups within our country, and particularly on certain campuses like Columbia, who had talking points, they had a plan for protest and disruption, and I watched it sort of morph into something that was not student led, even though students participated, but which had outside funding, outside direction,"" she said.

HILLARY CLINTON CALLED OUT FOR SUGGESTING AMERICANS SHOULD BE ARRESTED OVER DISINFORMATION: 'QUITE CHILLING'

Clinton added that ""to this day,"" she's still not sure how the outside funding and outside influence swayed college students to join the anti-Israel protests.

During the 2023-24 college school year, agitators and student protesters flooded college campuses nationwide to protest the war in Israel, which also included spiking instances of antisemitism and Jewish students publicly speaking out that they did not feel safe on some campuses.

Agitators on Columbia's campus, for example, took over the school's Hamilton Hall building, while schools such as UCLA, Harvard and Yale worked to clear spiraling student encampments where protesters demanded their elite schools completely divest from Israel.

The former secretary of state went on to say that when she pressed college students about their anti-Israel views, they lacked historical context surrounding politics in Israel and the Middle East.

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS IT'S A 'DOUBLE STANDARD' TO ASK HARRIS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""A lot of the videos on social media gave not just a one-sided view of the conflict, but a totally anti-Israel, pro-Hamas, not just pro-Palestinian view. And for me, it was distressing, because, look, I have my own opinions formed over many years. I am willing to sit down and have a conversation with anybody, but it's difficult to have conversations with people who hold strong opinions with no factual and historical basis,"" she said.

""And so in trying to talk to students, not just at Columbia, but elsewhere, I would be met with slogans. I would be met with attacks, and, you know, very inflammatory language. And when I would ask, 'Well, what about, do you know what happened in 2000 at Camp David?' 'No.' 'Do you know what happened in 1947?' 'No.' 'Do you know how difficult the relationships have been?' 'No.' 'Do you know that there are Arab Israelis, and some are serving in the IDF?' None of that. And this whole chanting of, you know, 'from the river to the sea.' What does that mean? What river, what sea? That's what bothered me,"" Clinton said.

HILLARY CLINTON REVEALS INITIAL REACTION TO BIDEN WITHDRAWING FROM RACE: 'THIS IS EXCITING!'

Clinton said that so far this year, it ""has been much quieter"" with ""a much more educational environment.""

She condemned the harassment on college campuses against Jewish students, saying the temperature quickly changed from holding ""legitimate"" dialogue among students disagreeing with a country's foreign policies to open antisemitism.

""This was screaming at students who were Jewish, it was blocking their entry into classes or into club activities. It was nasty. And so there was something else going on here that was very troubling. And we now, you know, have seen evidence of, you know, obviously foreign money, foreign influence, the algorithms on TikTok, which were anti-Israel right off the bat. And so I think that a university particularly has an obligation to, of course, protect free speech, but also to protect students against harassment and against the kind of behavior that interfered with their learning,"" she said."

The rapper Macklemore told a crowd of Seattle concertgoers ""F--- America,"" according to video of his recent ""Palestine Will Live Forever"" performance shared on X.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" the Grammy-winning performer said, sending the crowd into cheers. The video was shared on X by journalist Cam Higby.

Macklemore, a 41-year-old rapper born Benjamin Hammond Haggerty in Kent, Washington, had advertised a ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" on his Facebook page.

RAPPER MACKLEMORE CALLS OUT BIDEN, POLICE AND MUSIC INDUSTRY IN NEW PRO-PALESTINIAN SONG

He said the proceeds of the event held at Seward Park Amphitheater would go to various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

Fox News digital reached out to representatives for Macklemore for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Macklemore dropped an anti-Israel song in May titled ""Hind's Hall,"" referring to the Columbia University building that students occupied and renamed in honor of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the Israel-Gaza war. The song praised the anti-Israel encampments and protests on college campuses across the country and called out President Biden, the police and the music industry.

The rapper this month dropped a second version of the song that now calls out Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee when Biden backed out of the race in July.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

Macklemore seems to threaten that Harris will lose support in the battleground state of Michigan, which has a large Arab and Muslim community in Dearborn, for supporting Israel.

""Hey Kamala, I don't know if you listening but stop sending the money and weapons or you ain't winning Michigan. We uncommitted and hell no we ain't switching positions because the whole world turn Palestinian,"" the song says.

The music video shared on X shows a clip of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Mich., when those lyrics play. The song also includes the antisemitic chant, ""From the river to the sea,"" which calls for the elimination of Israel.

Macklemore, who has an estimated net worth of $25 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, also declares in the second version of the song, ""Capitalism killing us, that's something we can't afford"" and sings, ""There will never be freedom by pleading with Zionists.""

Macklemore has increasingly weighed in on conflicts in the Middle East. Last month, he canceled an upcoming October concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates' role ""in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis"" in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that's been fighting government troops there, according to The Associated Press.

"Mike Huckabee has role in new 'God's Not Dead' film, reveals why people of faith can support Trump",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mike-huckabee-role-new-gods-not-dead-film-reveals-people-faith-can-support-trump,2024-09-22T11:07:21Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee calls the newest installment of the ""God's Not Dead"" film series, ""In God We Trust,"" a story made for this moment in history.

He says the new film is a little like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" -- the Jimmy Stewart classic -- updated to this modern age when faith in God is not as publicly proclaimed and religious freedom totters in the wake of woke political agendas.

The film invokes Ronald Reagan in his speech more than 40 years ago before the Ecumenical Prayer Breakfast in Dallas, Texas.

FAITH LEADER SAYS PARENTS 'SHOULD NOT TRUST THE WORLD TO TEACH THEIR KIDS ABOUT GOD'

At that event, he said, ""Without God, there is no virtue, because there's no prompting of the conscience.""

And ""without God, democracy will not and cannot long endure.""

The film stars David A. R. White, Ray Wise, Dean Cain, Charlene Tilton, Scott Baio and others. Huckabee plays himself in the film. The lead character is a guest on his talk show.

On a recent episode of the ""Lighthouse Faith"" podcast, he joked about getting his Oscar speech ready.

Said Huckabee, ""I'm, you know, the best supporting actor for a role that nobody will remember!""

But in all seriousness, he said it is a powerful film that ""couldn't be more timely.""

Huckabee said Christians are being maligned and chastised for not keeping their faith a private affair.

It's about a congressional campaign between a career politician and a Christian minister who's suddenly thrust into a political battle when he's called upon to be the opposing candidate in a special election just four weeks away.

It takes head-on the issues of faith in the public square, religious freedom and accusations of Christian nationalism. They are today the fuel of vitriolic debates and cultural clashes.

JESUS SHARES IMPORTANT LESSON DURING MEETING WITH MARTHA AND MARY: 'CHILLAX,' SAYS SOUTH CAROLINA PRIEST

Huckabee said Christians are being maligned and chastised for not keeping their faith a private affair, and they're accused of wanting to impose their values on the rest of the country.

But, said Huckabee, ""When a person says these people want to impose their values, I want to say: Doesn't the left want to impose their values? Yes.""

He added, ""Politics is ultimately about winning an election so that your policies, those things that you hold dear, will become a part of the culture and a part of government. But I don't think it's a faith component. It is a moral component that a lot of Christians would like -- so that a child who's eight years old is not [put near] pornography at his school.""

Bestselling Christian author Lisa Bevere knows of what Huckabee speaks. A few years ago, she fought against her 14-year-old son's school after the English teacher assigned required reading that she said was not appropriate.

The film is meant to do more than embolden Christians to get involved in their communities.

Bevere shared on an episode of ""Lighthouse Faith"" podcast that in the book, ""They were talking about pornography and masturbation. And I was like, what in the -- ? What does this have to do with English literature?""

MISSOURI JESUIT SAYS JESUS REVEALS THE 'BIG PICTURE' WHEN IT COMES TO FOLLOWING GOD'S LAW

Bevere posted some passages from the book on her social media page and stirred up hundreds of parents, who demanded the book be dropped from the school's curriculum -- which it did.

The film, though, is meant to do more than embolden Christians to get involved in their communities.

It's also a clarion call to inspire the millions who sat out the last election, to make their voices heard not just at the box office but at the ballot box on Nov. 5.

Said Huckabee, ""It is a reminder that 40 million Christians in America did not vote in the last presidential election. Forty million ... But a lot of those people think it doesn't really matter. 'My vote's unimportant.' Well, that's not true.""

And now, after the second assassination attempt on Trump's life, Huckabee is taking aim at the left's rhetoric.

NEW 'GOD'S NOT DEAD' FILM INSPIRES CHRISTIANS TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD AT BALLOT BOX

He told Fox News, ""One would think that Democrats would stop calling him a 'threat to democracy,' which only incites violent and threatening behavior. But instead, there is no shame in the continued talk from media hosts all the way to the White House in continuing to essentially blame Trump for his own near-assassinations.""

""He doesn't want to have the government telling us what we can think, what we can preach, what we can say, what we can pray.""

He added, ""This is beyond outrageous.""

An ordained minister, Huckabee knows that he and other evangelicals have taken a lot of heat for backing Trump. Eighty percent of White evangelicals voted for Trump in 2016.

It was Huckabee who gathered about 1,200 pastors together before the presidential election for a meet-and-greet with Trump to convince them to support him.

What he said then is still true today, he asserted.

Said Huckabee, ""I don't pretend that Trump is one of us as an evangelical. I don't ... And my introduction [to the pastors] was this: 'Look, Donald Trump isn't one of us. He's probably not going to be sitting in the front row of your church this Sunday ... So let's not kid ourselves.'""

But Huckabee said the Trump positives outweigh the negatives.

CHiP'S STAR ERIK ESTRADA ON HOW FAITH BUOYS HIS LIFE AND CAREER

""He has respect for us [evangelicals], and he doesn't want to have the government telling us what we can think, what we can preach, what we can say, what we can pray. That's all I want out of government.""

Huckabee also said Trump is the most pro-life presidential candidate.

However, in this campaign cycle, Trump is being criticized by some pro-life leaders for shifting on the issue and even accusing him of abandoning the pro-life cause.

At this year's Republican National Convention, the platform committee voted to remove a right-to-life plank, prompting Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, to issue a minority report pushing back against the RNC platform.

Other leaders, such as retired U.S. Navy officer Quinn Skinner, who now works for a pregnancy help organization, lamented in an op-ed that ""there is no national political party that champions the sanctity of life.""

Still, said Huckabee, Trump's presence on the global stage is what America needs now.

Huckabee's support of Israel is part biblical and part political.

""His position on Israel has been the most remarkable of any American president. Period. So for issues that are non-negotiable for me, it's easy to be supportive.""

JEWISH SOLDIER, WOUNDED IN WAR, MEMORIALIZES YOUNG HOLOCAUST HERO BY PLAYING HIS VIOLIN

Huckabee had plans to travel to Israel this month. Since 1973, he's visited the Jewish state about 100 times, sometimes on his own, at other times taking groups with him. He was there not long after Oct. 7 last year, after the Hamas attack, he said.

""I was having lunch in a restaurant in Tel Aviv, and the sirens went off. So, we had to go to the bomb shelter. And as we got there, you could hear the Iron Dome intercept a rocket right above our heads.""

Huckabee's support of Israel is part biblical and part political.

ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS

As a geopolitical example, he imagined a scenario closer to home, saying, ""If somebody came across the border in Buffalo, New York, or El Paso, Texas, and slaughtered 1,200 people, including putting babies in ovens, slicing the womb of a pregnant woman in front of her children, violently raping women in front of their families -- do you think Americans would say, 'I just hope we can get a ceasefire?'""

Instead, said Huckabee, ""We'd be wanting to absolutely annihilate whatever the force was behind that. So Israel has been far more restrained than I think America would have been in a similar circumstance.""

There is the biblical reason for backing Israel, however.

Huckabee said, ""I look at Genesis 12: 'Those who bless Israel will be blessed. Those who curse Israel will be cursed.' Look, I'm a simple guy. When I read it that way, I say I'd rather be blessed than cursed. I'm going to stand with Israel.""

Huckabee, who has mounted two presidential campaigns, is adamant that he's through with running for higher office. ""I did it twice. I loved it, had a great time.""

Now content to be the father of a politician -- Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Rogers -- Huckabee said, ""You know, there comes a moment. You say, I gave it my best shot. Other people now will take up the mantle, and I will help them.""

"Israel says it conducted retaliatory strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon, struck Hamas in Gaza",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-says-conducted-retaliatory-strikes-against-hezbollah-lebanon-struck-hamas-gaza,2024-09-22T09:32:39Z,"Ret. U.S. Navy SEAL officer Mike Sarraille weighs in on attacks on Hezbollah's communications in Lebanon, widely believed to be from Israel, as it raises fears of wider war on 'Fox News Live.'

The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday morning it was conducting retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

This comes after the IDF says Hezbollah launched about 115 aerial attacks towards civilian areas in northern Israel over the span of a few hours.

The IDF said its defensive arrays are deployed in northern Israel and are on high preparedness to thwart threats targeting the area. Air defense systems had intercepted multiple projectiles over Haifa, Israel.

ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE ON TERRORIST TARGETS, ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

The military said strikes will continue and will intensify against Hezbollah.

The IDF also said the Israeli Air Force conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists in a compound in the northern Gaza Strip.

Before the strike, the IDF says numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence information.

HEZBOLLAH IDENTIFIES SECOND TOP COMMANDER KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN LEBANON

Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant spoke with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin several times over the weekend about developments in northern Israel.

Gallant briefed Austin on the precise operation conducted by the IDF to take out the head of Hezbollah's operations unit and commander of the Radwan Forces, Ibrahim Aqil, who is a senior Hezbollah leader and planner of several terror attacks against Israel and who is also wanted by the U.S. for the killing of its citizens.

The minister also talked about Israel's defensive position and operations against the ongoing strikes by Hezbollah against northern cities and civilian areas in Israel. He said the goal is to ensure Israel's northern communities can return to their homes.

Gallant additionally told Austin about the IDF's ongoing activities in Gaza against Hamas and emphasized his commitment to freeing the more than 100 hostages still held by Hamas.

He expressed his appreciation to Austin and U.S. leadership for reaffirming their commitment to Israel."
"Working class will come home to Harris, rallygoers in postindustrial Pennsylvania say",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/working-class-come-home-harris-rallygoers-postindustrial-pennsylvania-say,2024-09-22T08:08:59Z,"Fox News Digital spoke to rallygoers in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., about what they expect from Vice President Harris and how she did in the debate.

Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris rallied in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, a key electorate given its decades of Democratic prominence until the Trump era.

Former President Trump upended the political map in 2016 when he won blue-collar, union-heavy counties like Luzerne and neighboring Schuylkill, Columbia and Northumberland as a Republican nominee.

However, many of those who attended Harris' Wilkes-Barre rally predicted that trend was coming to an end.

Jill Purdy, whose nearby home of Northampton County flipped red in 2016 but went for President Biden in 2020, said Harris' strength is explaining her plans for fixing the economy and meeting with foreign leaders.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS'

""I think that what resonated with me is Trump saying at the very end [of the debate], 'I have a concept of a plan.' So, you know, what is a concept of a plan? None of us can get by with a concept, and you have to have something in your back pocket,"" Purdy, a teacher, said.

""So, I really appreciate how she ... I would hope she would have done a little bit more and, hopefully, we hear more before the election. But I think she set [her plan] in motion.""

In Northampton County, Bethlehem Steel's stacks and coke works once puffed smoke at all hours, signaling solid employment and well-paying union jobs for the Lehigh Valley.

Now, its steel stacks instead serve as a backdrop for a casino and other smaller venues on the rest of its former property, a silent reminder of the area's industrial past.

Similarly, in nearby Macungie, Mack Trucks -- now owned by Volvo -- still produces some of its Bulldog-emblazoned vehicles in Macungie, though its former ""world headquarters"" nearby sat vacant after its buyout.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS SOUND OFF ON HER BORDER BLUEPRINT

Even in 1981, singer Billy Joel's ""Allentown"" described the decline in the area's industrial might, and the issue has persisted today.

Since 2016, groups like Auto Workers for Trump have formed, citing concern with the Biden administration's green policies and the offshoring of jobs. And Teamsters President Sean O'Brien became the first such union boss to speak at the Republican National Convention.

But, for voters like Purdy, Harris remains the best hope for her area, she said.

""I do see a lot of Trump supporters in my neighborhood,"" she said. ""Though. I'm a teacher. So, I'm familiar with unions. And I do think they are for the 'common workers,' so to speak. Those doing the grunt work are still going to favor Harris for the reality of what she can say.""

By contrast, she claimed Trump's reassurances are ""just words.""

""I think most of the people that are [part] of unions are starting to really hear that.""

When asked about Trump's overtures to energy workers or autoworkers like those at Mack, invoking green restrictions and the like, Purdy said she would defer on that particular aspect.

""I don't know enough to know whether I hear anything that this is ... personally, I still think Kamala probably has a more logical route [on the topic],"" she said.

""[Harris] did switch a little on the fracking and that type of thing. I'm OK with people changing their mind for a logical reason. I do worry about the environment, but I can't speak to what others are really thinking about.""

Purdy said that, as a teachers union member, she does fear Trump would abolish the federal Department of Education.

The cabinet office was established by former President Carter, and part of the 1980 Republican platform was to do away with the fledgling agency.

Meanwhile, rallygoers Christian and Annette traveled to Wilkes-Barre from neighboring Hanover Township. They took issue with Trump's tack on the affordability crisis.

Fox News Digital asked about the disparity between gas prices at the end of his term and today and the similar dynamic in the housing market.

""I don't believe anything Trump says,"" Annette replied. ""He lies.""

""The reason [gas] was a dollar in the first place was because nobody was on the road -- because there was COVID,"" Christian added, recalling empty Pennsylvania roads in 2020.

Annette said Harris ""really wants to help us.""

""I believe Harris is really for the middle class,"" she said. ""Trump always likes to brag about how much money he has.""

Behind the venue on Franklin Street, Joe Granteed sat in a chair along the major northbound thoroughfare with a sign he said was meant to warn rallygoers and students at Wilkes University against buying what Harris is selling.

Granteed, of neighboring Plains, said it took him some time to think out what he wanted to write on his large poster facing traffic.

""I think she's desperate,"" he said of Harris. ""She needs to get a piece of Pennsylvania, but Trump owns Pennsylvania.""

""Don't be fooled by all her lies. She preys on your youth and inexperience. They promised unity and prosperity and we got chaos and struggles and division,"" Granteed's sign said.

Granteed also suggested Trump got a raw deal from ABC News moderators at the ""3-on-1"" debate, as he put it.

Meanwhile, on Main Street, Chris M. traveled all the way from Manchester, N.H., to see Harris speak.

Chris said Trump had been a political force until Harris came along.

""He mowed down like 16 competitors in 2016,"" Chris said. ""No one figured out how to handle him until she came along.""

While he ""loathes Trump,"" Chris did admit that, amid persistent inflation, it was the Republican nominee who likely originated the ""no tax on tips"" plan both candidates put out around the same time last month.

""I did hear that latest thing about what he said [Friday] about taxes. I think it's a good idea,"" he added.

""[But] Harris hasn't been afraid to address that, even though it's a weakness under Biden-Harris. So, I don't know,"" he said, adding inflation does not feel as bad as it did under former President George W. Bush in 2008.

In line to get into the McHale Center, Kerry Jones from nearby Dallas said Harris ""really puts forth the agenda of the middle class and bringing up the economy for the working people.""

""As opposed to the rich people and the corporate greed and the takeover of our country by interests that are not ours.""

Jones said Harris' housing plan is ""great,"" and that it would help her daughters finally move out of her house.

""She nails home that she's for the working people, and she wants to take our money and put it back into us,"" she said.

When asked about energy prices and the overall affordability crisis, Jones said the president has ""very little"" to do with gas prices because they are subsidized by the feds and assisted by ""Republican tax cuts."""
"Dozens of rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon, IDF says",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/g-s1-24085/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says,2024-09-22T05:58:32Z,"NAHARIYA, Israel -- Over 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon early Sunday, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa, as Israel and the Hezbollah militant group appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions.

The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired ""toward civilian areas,"" pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. It was not immediately clear if the damage was caused by a rocket or an Israeli interceptor.

The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed at least 37 people, including one of Hezbollah's top leaders as well as women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explod e just days earlier.

The Israeli military said it carried out a wave of strikes across southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours, hitting some 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the frontier.

Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon and vowed to bring back calm to the border so that its citizens can return to their homes. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down.

The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed. It does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up over half of the dead.

Israeli media reported that rockets fired from Lebanon early Sunday were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth, which are further south than most of the rocket fire to date. Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis.

Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles -- a new type of weapon the group had not used before -- at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, ""in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.""

In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones.

Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people -- including two children -- and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.

On Friday, an Israeli airstrike took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group's special forces unit, known as the Radwan Force.

Lebanon's health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters Saturday that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized.

It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the bruising monthlong war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the attack broke up the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths. He had been on the U.S. most wanted list for years, with a $7 million reward, over his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s."
Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/g-s1-24083/israel-shuts-down-al-jazeera-bureau-ramallah-west-bank,2024-09-22T05:19:31Z,"This image made from video provided by Al Jazeera English shows Israeli troops raiding their bureau in Ramallah, West Bank, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2024. Al Jazeera/AP/Al Jazeera hide caption

Israeli troops raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank early Sunday, ordering the bureau to shut down amid a widening campaign by Israel targeting the Qatar-funded broadcaster as it covers the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Al Jazeera aired footage of Israeli troops live on its Arabic-language channel ordering the office to be shut for 45 days. It follows an extraordinary order issued in May that saw Israeli police raid Al Jazeera's broadcast position in East Jerusalem, seizing equipment there, preventing its broadcasts in Israel and blocking its websites.

The move marked the first time Israel has ever shuttered a foreign news outlet operating in the country. However, Al Jazeera has continued operating in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, territories that the Palestinians hope to have for their future state.

There was no immediate acknowledgement of the shutdown by Israeli forces. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Al Jazeera denounced the move as it continued broadcasting live from Amman in neighboring Jordan.

Armed Israeli troops entered the office and told a reporter live on air it would be shut down, saying that staff needed to leave immediately. The network later aired what appeared to be Israel troops tearing down a banner on a balcony used by the Al Jazeera office. Al Jazeera said it bore an image of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist shot dead by Israeli forces in May 2022.

""There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,"" an Israeli soldier told Al Jazeera's local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, in the live footage. ""I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment.""

Al-Omari later said that Israeli troops began confiscating documents and equipment in the bureau, as tear gas and gunshots could be seen and heard in the area.

The Palestinians secured limited self-rule in Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank through the 1993 Oslo agreements. While Israel occupies and controls vast areas of the West Bank, Ramallah is under full Palestinian political and security control, making the Israeli raid on the Al Jazeera office that much more surprising.

The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate denounced the Israeli raid and order.

""This arbitrary military decision is a new aggression against journalistic work and media outlets,"" it said.

The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank. Its forces were driven from Gaza when Hamas seized power in 2007, and it has no power there.

The network has reported on the Israeli-Hamas war nonstop since the militants' initial cross-border attack on Oct. 7 and has maintained 24-hour coverage in the Gaza Strip amid Israel's grinding ground offensive that has killed and wounded members of its staff. It remains unclear whether the Israeli military would target Al Jazeera's operation in Gaza as well.

While including on-the-ground reporting of the war's casualties, Al Jazeera's Arabic arm often publishes verbatim video statements from Hamas and other regional militant groups.

That has led to Israeli claims by officials up to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the network has ""harmed Israel's security and incited against soldiers."" Those claims have been vehemently denied by Al Jazeera, whose main funder, Qatar, has been key in negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire to end the war.

An order closing Al Jazeera in Israel has been repeatedly renewed in the time since, but it hadn't as of yet ordered the Ramallah offices closed.

The Israeli government has taken action against individual reporters over the decades since its founding in 1948, but broadly allows for a rambunctious media scene that includes foreign bureaus from around the world, even from Arab nations. It also blocked the foreign broadcasts of the Hezbollah-affiliated, Beirut-based Al Mayadeen news channel at the start of the war.

Criticism of Al Jazeera is not new. The U.S. government singled out the broadcaster during America's occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.

Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other Mideast governments.

Most notably in 2013, Egyptian authorities raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera as an operating base after the military takeover that followed mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi. Three Al Jazeera staff members received 10-year prison sentences, but were released in 2015 following widespread international criticism.

The Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between fighters and civilians.

The closure of Al Jazeera's Ramallah office also comes as tensions continue to rise over a possible expansion of the war to Lebanon, where electronic devices exploded last week in a likely sabotage campaign by Israel targeting the Shiite militia Hezbollah.

The explosions Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least 37 people -- including two children -- and wounded around 3,000 others."

""Dozens of Israeli Air Force aircraft are currently striking terrorist targets and rocket launchers to remove the threat to Israeli civilians,"" IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Saturday in a translation of a press briefing.

The strikes have killed at least two top Hezbollah commanders and more than a dozen members of the group.

Hagari said to Israelis: ""Rockets and other threats may be launched toward Israeli territory in the near future. We ask you to strictly follow the Home Front Command's defensive guidelines. We are in the midst of a time of warfare, so it is important to remain vigilant and alert.""

Ahmed Wahbi, who oversaw the military operations of Hezbollah's Radwan special forces unit until early 2024, was also killed in the attack.

CNN commentator Scott Jennings said that the Democratic Party was not doing enough to denounce growing antisemitism on college campuses and at protests around the country following the Israel-Hamas war.

""Everybody at this table knows where the source of antisemitism is in this country,"" Jennings said on ""CNN This Morning"" Friday in a debate about former President Trump's attempts to appeal to Jewish voters.

""It is not on the right,"" he said.

BROWN UNIVERSITY BOARD TRUSTEE ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AHEAD OF VOTE ON DIVESTMENT FROM ISRAEL: 'COWARDICE'

He argued that Democrats are not being honest in acknowledging growing antisemitism concerns in their party.

""Let's talk about what's going on [at] all these college campuses,"" he said. ""Let's talk about what's going on the streets of New York City.""

Elite schools like Columbia and Brown University have been rocked by anti-Israel protests on campus, with one of Brown's former trustees announcing his resignation in an op-ed published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal.

Jennings further defended former President Trump for his support of Israel during his administration.

""He did have strong pro-Israel policies,"" Jennings said. ""He did take a hard line against Iran.""

""The antisemitism problem in this country is on the left,"" he added. ""It is not on the right.""

""You cannot deny what we have seen in America since October the 7th,"" Jennings said, referring to Hamas' terrorist attack on Israeli and other citizens that started the war. ""And it only has to do with one thing. Antisemitism is on the rise and there are people who feel like now is the time to let it out and it is ugly.""

""If you want to make apologies for it on the left, go ahead,"" Jennings said, sparking an argument with Executive Director for Republican Voters Against Trump, Sarah Longwell, as to Trump's reputation with Jewish voters. ""I'm not going to do it.""

""No, you are denying it exists on the right,"" Longwell said. ""You are stumping for Trump in a way that tries to ignore that he himself dined with a White supremacist"" and ""cozied up"" to Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Trump had dinner with White nationalist Holocaust denier and political commentator Nick Fuentes in 2023. Greene has been criticized for her comments about the 2018 California wildfires being started by ""space solar generators"" in a statement that has been characterized as antisemitic.

Jennings argued that anti-Israel protesters were still more highly concentrated on the left, telling Longwell, ""That's your party now, those are your people. Those are the people you seek to represent. That's your coalition.""

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital."
MSNBC host defends Harris avoiding policy questions: She's not 'running for perfect',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-host-defends-harris-avoiding-policy-questions-shes-not-running-perfect,2024-09-21T14:26:07Z,"Harris-Walz campaign senior adviser Keisha Lance Bottoms defended the relatively small number of unscripted media appearances done by Vice President Kamala Harris.

MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle went to bat for Vice President Kamala Harris, insisting she doesn't have to address policy questions from the press because ""she's not running for perfect, she's running against Trump.""

On Friday's installment of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Ruhle rushed to defend Harris after host Bill Maher torched the VP's recent comments laying out her plans for a post-war Middle East, suggesting it was hollow.

""She is in a tricky position because Joe Biden is currently the commander in chief and she's the VP,"" Ruhle told Maher. ""So it's very difficult for anybody in her position to kind of thread this needle and say, 'Here's what we should do, here's our plan' when he's the current commander in chief.""

""She's in this weird space of like an improv show, of like a 'yes, and,' 'Yes to what he's doing and I think we should do this,' So it's especially tricky.""

HARRIS ADVISER BRUSHES OFF LACK OF INTERVIEWS: 'SHE'S A VERY BUSY PERSON'

Fellow panelist, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, turned to Ruhle with an ""honest question,"" asking whether Harris was being ""vague"" for political reasons or ""does she simply have no idea?"" Ruhle insisted that wasn't an ""honest question"" since she'd never say Harris has ""no idea.""

""I'm an undecided voter. I'm never gonna vote for Trump, but I'm not sure I want to vote for Kamala,"" Stephens told Ruhle. ""And my fear is that she doesn't really have a very good command of what she wants to do as president. It would be great for her to sit down with you [Bill Maher], or George Stephanopoulos, or you Stephanie.""

""It's not too much to ask Kamala, 'Say, are you for a Palestinian state if Hamas is gonna run that state? Yes or no?'"" he later added.

CNN COMMENTATOR SLAMS HARRIS AFTER OPRAH WINFREY SIT-DOWN: 'WHEN HAS SHE SAT DOWN WITH ANY HOSTILE MEDIA?'

""And let's say you don't like her answer. Are you going to vote for Donald Trump?"" Ruhle shot back. ""Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump. We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016 for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy.""

""Stephanie, the problem that a lot of people have with Kamala is we don't know her answer to anything, okay?"" Stephens doubled down.

""But you know his answer to everything!"" Ruhle interjected.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""And that's why I would never vote for him and people shouldn't vote for him,"" Stephens continued. ""But people also are expected to have some idea of what program is of the person you're supposed to vote for! You're not supposed to say 'Well, you have to vote for y because x is that and the other.' Let's find out a little bit more. And I don't think it's a lot to ask for her to sit down for a real interview as opposed to a puff piece in which she describes her feelings of growing up in Oakland with nice lawns.""

""I would just say to that- when you move to Nirvana, give me your real estate broker's number and I'll be your next door neighbor. We don't live there!"" Ruhle exclaimed.

After she and Maher further mocked Stephens for remaining undecided, the columnist told them he is among the ""millions of Americans who Kamala has to persuade if she wants to win.""

""Did you ever play the game Would You Rather? Because that is what voting for the president is, okay?"" Ruhle later told Stephens.

Earlier in the conversation, Ruhle agreed with Maher that Trump was a ""threat to democracy"" and defended the ABC News moderators' uneven fact-checking of Trump versus Harris at the presidential debate.

""When Donald Trump tells lie after lie, you don't say 'Well, nobody seems to care. It's our job in the media- when people complain 'Donald Trump got fact-checked way more than Kamala Harris did,' you're damn right he did! You know why? He told more lies!"" Ruhle said."
Fetterman says Trump has 'special kind of place' in PA after assassination attempt,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fetterman-says-trump-has-special-kind-place-pa-after-assassination-attempt,2024-09-21T13:33:20Z,"Trump 2024 campaign senior adviser Alina Habba argues politics' influence on safety has become a 'real problem' on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

Former President Donald Trump has a ""special"" connection with the people of Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. John Fetterman warns.

Fetterman made the observation during a conversation with The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg during the 2024 Atlantic Festival on Thursday.

""Trump has created a special kind of hold within the coronet he's remade - the party - and he has a special kind of place in Pennsylvania, and I think that only deepened after the first assassination attempt,"" Fetterman said.

FETTERMAN REAMS OUT NY TIMES FOR PLATFORMING TERRORIST PROPAGANDA AFTER INTERVIEW WITH SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL

A deranged gunman attempted to assassinate Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. The shooting, which Trump miraculously survived with only a wound on the side of his head, sharpened support among his die-hard base.

""I also want people to understand, you know, and it's not science, but there is, there's energy and there are kinds of anger on the ground in Pennsylvania -- and people are very committed and strong,"" Fetterman said Thursday. ""And I joked that his signs became like the state flower - and you see that everywhere.""

However -- after President Biden's withdrawal from the race and Vice President Kamala Harris' rapid ascension as the Democratic presidential nominee, polls indicate she holds a slight lead over Trump in the Keystone State.

FETTERMAN SETS POLITICS ASIDE AFTER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS US MUST 'TURN DOWN ... THE TEMPERATURE'

A Thursday poll from the Washington Post had Harris at 48% support among likely and registered voters, while Trump sits at 47%. A New York Times poll gave Harris a slightly larger lead, with the vice president sitting at 50% compared to Trump's 46%.

Fetterman expressed skepticism of Harris' reported lead in Pennsylvania on Thursday, comparing the situation to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's seven-point lead in Pennsylvania that ultimately collapsed on Election Day during her failed 2016 presidential bid.

""Everybody thought that it was in the bag, but that's not the energy and the other kinds of things that were really consistent with what I'm witnessing all across,"" Fetterman recalled. ""And then, sadly, we saw what happened.""

Hezbollah identifies second top commander killed in Israeli airstrike in Lebanon,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-identifies-second-top-commander-killed-israeli-airstrike-lebanon,2024-09-21T12:34:43Z,"The IDF said the targets were ready to be used ""in the immediate future"" to fire into Israeli territory. (Credit: IDF)

The Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah announced Saturday that another one of its top commanders was killed in Friday's targeted Israeli airstrike on the country's capital of Beirut.

Ahmed Wahbi, who oversaw the military operations of Hezbollah's Radwan special forces unit until early 2024, is among the 16 members of the group who were eliminated in the strike, Reuters cited Hezbollah as saying.

The development comes as the Israel Defense Forces said it was carrying out more airstrikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon on Saturday.

Friday's strike also killed Ibrahim Aqil, another commander of the Radwan special forces who served on Hezbollah's highest military body, the Jihad Council, according to the U.S. State Department.

""During the 1980s, Aqil was a principal member of Hezbollah's terrorist cell the Islamic Jihad Organization, which claimed responsibility for the bombings of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in October 1983, which killed 241 U.S. personnel,"" the State Department says.

Hezbollah released a statement describing Aqil as ""one of its top leaders"" who was killed in a ""treacherous Israeli assassination,"" Reuters reports.

Israel said Friday following the airstrike in southern Beirut that ""We can now confirm that Ibrahim Aqil was eliminated together with other senior terrorists in Hezbollah's Radwan Forces.""

The overall death toll from the airstrike is 31, including seven women and three children, Lebanon's health minister said on Saturday.

The airstrike reportedly knocked out an eight-story building that had 16 apartments and damaged another one adjacent to it. The missiles destroyed the first building and cut through the basement of the second where a meeting of Hezbollah officials was being held, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene.

Health Minister Firass Abiad told reporters 68 people were also wounded of whom 15 remain in the hospital, adding that search and rescue operations were still ongoing, with the number of casualties likely to rise.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) announced Saturday morning that it has killed a Hamas operative and other Hamas terrorists amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.

The IDF said it used an intelligence-based strike to take out Muhammad Mansour, a Hamas operative who acted as a source of technological knowledge in Hamas' military intelligence system.

Several Hamas terrorists who led terror attacks against IDF soldiers were also killed, the IDF said.

This comes as the IDF says it continues to eliminate terrorists and strike dozens of terror infrastructure sites in the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip.

Children once held hostage still working through trauma: 'Are they coming for us again?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/children-held-hostage-working-trauma-coming-us-again,2024-09-21T08:41:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Dr. Efrat Bron-Harlev, CEO of Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, recently addressed the United Nations about the plight of the children who were kidnapped from Israel by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023.

She said that 38 of the 253 people who were abducted that day were children. The youngest was Kfir Bibas, just eight months old at the time.

The child is still in captivity, along with his parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas, and his brother, Ariel, who turned five last month.

THRIVING WITH ANXIETY: EXPERT TIPS ON EMBRACING THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION

Bron-Harlev, a pediatrician, said children released after 50 days in captivity are still, to this day, waking up terrified in the middle of the night.

""They were not allowed to cry, not allowed to laugh, not even allowed to stand up.""

She said the children appeared ""like shadows of children. No impressions on their faces. They were not happy. They were not crying. They were mostly very, very silent.""

Dr. Hagai Levine, chair of the Israeli Association of Public Health and head physician of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, also reported seeing children being afraid to speak.

""In captivity, they were told, 'If you speak, you will be killed' -- that's very, very traumatizing,"" he told Fox News Digital.

In addition to psychological trauma, the hostages were also in extreme physical danger.

Levine, who is also an epidemiologist, said the risks to the hostages' lives ranged from the threat of ""being murdered to lack of food to lack of oxygen, lack of water (and) infectious diseases.""

Referencing the recent polio outbreak in Gaza, Levine noted that he sent a letter to UNICEF and the World Health Organization reminding the organizations ""that every child has a right to health -- and this includes Kfir and Ariel Bibas.""

Levine said he was on a bus this summer with children who were formerly hostages as well as children who are relatives of hostages.

""They have the unique ability to cope.""

The young ones attended a U.S. summer camp in July, he said.

""A couple of people called me a White supremacist. A couple of people called me the N-word.""

""I saw songs and jokes,"" he said, recalling his observations. ""I'm not saying they were happy, but they have the unique ability to cope.""

The doctor said he knows these children have had to grow up quickly -- but the ""plasticity of the brain"" helps children rehabilitate, he said.

He said he has encouraged them to play and dance.

However, ""there is always a shadow"" holding them back, he said -- given that at this moment, there are still other hostages held captive.

Levine said these children grew up in a tight-knit community of a kibbutz -- and seeing hostage posters everywhere of their neighbors is very real to them.

""It's really difficult for them to really recover,"" he said.

SEVERE BURNS REPORTED IN CHILDREN MAKING TIKTOK-FRIENDLY GLASS FRUIT IN MICROWAVE

It is a long process to get these children to be able to trust again, Levine said, and they need someone who is a constant in their lives, especially if their parents were murdered.

He said physical, psychological and educational rehabilitation, such as speech therapy and equine therapy, can help them to regain trust and feel in control.

They ""have been in this horrible nightmare"" for nearly a year.

He also noted that relatives of the hostages are experiencing survivor guilt, severe depression, anxiety, insomnia and physical symptoms such as tremors.

They are traumatized because they don't know what happened to their loved ones, and they ""have been in this horrible nightmare"" for nearly a year at this point, he said.

Roxanne Saar, the aunt of released hostage Gali Tarshansky, age 13, told Fox News Digital, ""I feel like it could have been me.""

Saar had been staying at her father-in-law's home at Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 6, 2023, when she decided to return home that night.

LACK OF SLEEP POSES CONCERNING RISK FOR KIDS, STUDY FINDS

The next day, 101 civilians at Be'eri were killed by Hamas terrorists and 32 people were kidnapped, according to JNS (Jewish News Syndicate).

Gali Tarshansky's brother, Lior, 15, and her uncle, Noy Shosh, 36, were among the murdered victims.

Saar said that the first question the young teenager asked when she was released from captivity after 54 days was, ""Where is Lior?""

It was not until after she returned to Israel that she discovered her brother and uncle had been killed, along with her dog, Mocha, as well as friends she grew up with from her kibbutz.

She was held hostage in homes in Gaza with Nova festival survivors and a couple from Kibbutz Be'eri. The husband, Ohad Ben Ami, is still a hostage, Saar said.

""There was no showering, there was no water.""

Saar said that in Gaza, ""there was not enough food, there was not enough medicine, there was no showering, there was no water ... There was psychological terror.""

ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS

She said the young woman's captors, some of whom were armed, told her, ""Israel does not exist. Your family doesn't want you anymore.'""

Saar added, ""I'm not sure if we know everything ... I don't have any expectations from terrorists who are capable of kidnapping a 13-year-old girl.""

It is crucial, she said, for the remaining hostages to be freed in order for the released hostages to heal.

Saar said Gali Tarshansky is living in a different area of Israel today, attending a new school. She is in therapy.

Said Saar, ""I don't think there is anyone in the world who can understand the potential future impact of what happened ... Everybody wants to help, but how can someone help with something that we never knew before?""

Professor Merev Roth, PhD, an analyst who works with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, told Fox News Digital that therapists who are treating released hostages are in uncharted territory.

""Will he come back when I'm really old?""

""All of this is new,"" she said. ""There is not one case in history that so many kids and families were kidnapped from their houses for such a long time and in such a brutal massacre.""

Roth is one of the founders of First Line Med (FLM), an organization that offers pro bono treatment to victims of Oct. 7.

SURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING 'ANGEL' BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7

She supervises child therapists and treats adult family members of child hostages who were released after 50 or 54 days in captivity.

Roth said she had to treat some of the families in their homes or hotels initially, because they were afraid to go outside.

She recalled seeing how frightened a three-and-a-half-year old toddler was when the child heard a gardener working outside.

""I remember the girl running into her mother's body, and her mother immediately took her in her arms. The girl didn't say a word. She was white, she was shaking, she didn't even cry,"" Roth said.

Another time, when the little girl heard noises outside, Roth said the girl asked, ""Are they coming for us again?""

Roth said another child released from captivity is unable to get through a full day of school in kindergarten.

Her father is still a hostage, and Roth said she knows he is in danger and asks her mother, ""Is Father dead? Will he come back when I'm really old?""

Roth said the children who were separated from their parents in captivity, or witnessed family members being murdered or wounded, ""shattered in the most extreme, brutal way"" a child's sense of safety and trust in the world.

""They become easily frustrated, angry and disassociated.""

Some children had captors who were abusive and threatening; other hostages experienced Stockholm Syndrome, where they identified with their captor, Roth said.

JEWISH COOKING 'GODMOTHER' RECREATES VIVID FAMILY MEMORIES AND 'SENSE OF BELONGING' THROUGH FOOD

Antisemitism spreading across the globe is ""a big blow,"" said Roth. ""It added to the feelings that the world went crazy, that everything is distorted.""

She said these children are suffering from ""trauma syndrome symptoms,"" such as anxiety, depression, sleeping disorders and social withdrawal.

They become easily frustrated, angry and disassociated, which means ""you are disconnected from your emotional response ... You become confused. You cannot concentrate and you don't react emotionally in your full scope. You are a bit numb,"" she said.

Dissociation can also be self-protective, Roth noted.

""It takes a long time until they come back into their senses, which is a good thing, because their psyche protects them from feeling all that they would feel if they were connected, and it would be overwhelming for them.""

""They do find any channel they can to be smiling and friendly and cooperative. They're really trying ... They are amazing in their coping, but they are injured.""

Play therapy, she said, enables children to reenact real experiences through imaginary scenarios, and gives therapists insight into their inner thoughts.

""You can see the split of the world into total good and total bad creatures fighting each other ... I see complete evil, revenge, abuse and angels,"" she said.

""You can also see the other side ... life saviors that came from nowhere to save them.""

He also wrote a touching story with his therapist about a family of kittens who had been kidnapped and were found. Roth said that the child told his therapist, ""Now we can finish therapy, because the kitties are back home.""

Said Roth, ""I'm always overwhelmed by the beauty and the strength and the resilience."""

Last Sunday saw yet another apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump's life at one of his golf courses in Florida. The Secret Service has come under renewed scrutiny, as this incident follows the July shooting at one of his rallies in Butler, Pennsylvania. The acting director says he wants a ""paradigm shift"" for the agency.

Major coalitions made their feelings on the election known this week. More than 100 past Republican national security leaders signed a statement supporting Vice President Harris. But one of the country's most powerful unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said it won't endorse a candidate this year. The group backed Democratic candidates in the last six presidential elections.

The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday after its September meeting that it has cut its main interest rate by half of a percent. It's the first cut to interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic in March 20-20.

Meanwhile, two waves of deadly explosions involving pagers, walkie talkies, and other electronic devices rocked Lebanon and Syria this week. Israeli officials notified the U.S. that the country was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon on Tuesday but did not give any details about what was planned.

On Monday, a European Union naval mission said salvagers successfully towed a Greek-flagged oil tanker that was on fire for weeks in the Red Sea to safety. It was carrying one million barrels of crude oil. The tanker was attacked by Houthi rebels in early September. Houthi rebels continue to threaten ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza.

China's legislature this week passed a new policy that would raise the retirement age for the country's workers. Starting next year, the retirement ages will be raised over the course of 15 years. It will go from 60 to 63 for men. For women, it will depend on their trade. The retirement age for women in blue-collar jobs will go from 50 to 55. For women in white-collar jobs, the retirement age will go from 55 to 58."

- House passes bill increasing Secret Service protections for presidential, VP candidates

- Anti-Israel agitators rock UNC, vandalize building, pull down U.S. flag

A new requirement in New York that will take effect this weekend is set to grant Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James widespread power over the state's election process, a New York election attorney said.

""Nobody is really talking about it or what a big effect it's going to have,"" election attorney Joseph T. Burns, partner at the law firm Holtzman Vogel, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week. ""But it's interesting because, look, there's a lot of bad stuff that happens in New York when it comes to the elections and everything else, but this strikes me as being particularly bad. And it's certainly quite a power grab by the attorney general as well.""

Under the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York, which Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law in 2022, a preclearance requirement is set to take effect on Sept. 22. The new rule requires certain jurisdictions in the Empire State to request preclearance from the attorney general or a designated court to make election-related decisions, which range from changing the hours of early voting to culling deceased residents from a voter list, Burns said.

Burns published an op-ed in the New York Post this week, warning that the new law hands James ""unprecedented power over election processes in some of the most hotly contested congressional districts in the nation, including those on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley."" The upcoming requirement has flown under the radar, Burns said, telling Fox Digital, ""Nobody's talking about. It's pretty remarkable.""

""The new rule upends the system of constitutionally mandated, bipartisan election administration that has served New York's voters ably for generations,"" Burns wrote in his op-ed, which was published on Sunday. ""The law requires certain counties, cities, towns, villages and school districts to get the blessing of the AG or a designated court before making election-related or voting-related changes."" ...Read more

White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. had ""no involvement"" in the attacks, emphasizing he believes ""that there is time and space for a diplomatic solution"" to prevent the conflict from escalating. The White House previously said it was ""afraid and concerned about potential escalation"" in the region.

The U.S. has accused Aqil for two terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of Americans in 1983. In the 1980s, Aqil was a member of the Islamic Jihad, and he was implicated in the militant group's two attacks in 1983: A bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, that killed 63 people, and the bombing of a Marine Corps barracks, which killed 241 American personnel. Another Hezbollah leader responsible for the attacks, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike in July. Aqil also directed the kidnapping of American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s, according to the State Department, which previously offered $7 million for information leading to his arrest.

Hezbollah -- a militant group in Lebanon backed by Iran that the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization -- struck the Israeli military along the Lebanon border after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel in October, and the conflict has escalated in recent months. The IDF last targeted Beirut in July while targeting Shukr, whom Israel blamed for killing 12 people in a suburb near southern Lebanon. Israeli officials reportedly told the U.S. they would carry out an unspecified operation in Lebanon earlier this week before pagers exploded across the country. Other reports suggest the U.S. believes Israel planted the explosive before the pagers reached Hezbollah, which blamed Israel for ""this criminal aggression that also harmed civilians and caused death and injuries."" The U.S. and officials from other countries have warned Israel against escalating a conflict with Lebanon, it will become a proxy war that eventually could draw in its sponsor, Iran, and eventually the U.S."
"After repeated promises from Biden administration that a cease-fire is close, war in Middle East is escalating",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/repeated-promises-biden-administration-cease-fire-close-war-middle-east-escalating,2024-09-20T19:42:42Z,"The IDF said the targets were ready to be used 'in the immediate future' to fire into Israeli territory. (IDF)

After months of public optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire, Biden administration officials have soured on the prospects of an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""We aren't any closer to that now than we were even a week ago,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby admitted to reporters on Wednesday. He called the prospects of a completed deal ""daunting.""

""No deal is imminent,"" one U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not sure it ever gets done.""

Israelis point the finger at Hamas for killing six hostages earlier this month, including a U.S. citizen. Arab officials lay blame on Israel for explosive pagers and walkie-talkies and airstrikes aimed at killing Hezbollah fighters for making the prospect of a multi-front war more likely.

""There's no chance now of it happening,"" an Arab official said after the recent campaign against Hezbollah. ""Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until after the election. The outcome will determine what can happen in the next administration.""

For Biden, a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who ran on his diplomacy chops, failure to secure a deal would be a blow to his legacy. It would mean a presidency bookended by a chaotic pullout from Afghanistan at the start and the false hope that peace -- and the return of some 250 hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 -- was just around the corner after the outbreak of war in the Middle East.

Along with the recent attacks on Hezbollah, officials cited another main reason for pessimism to the Journal: the number of Palestinian prisoners that Israel would be asked to release to bring home its hostages.

Joel Rubin, former deputy assistant secretary of state, told Fox News Digital he's less pessimistic about the potential for a deal.

""Nobody's walked away from the table. They haven't stated they're done. Qatar and Egypt are still partnering with us on these talks. The three-stage agreed-upon framework is still in place,"" he said.

""The hangups are on the implementation side, not the framework side,"" he said, noting that negotiations as far as which prisoners will be released, how their safety will be guaranteed and what to do with Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar remain open-ended.

ISRAEL STRIKES HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON

""These implementation issues keep coming up,"" he said. ""That's where you keep hearing Hamas growing its demands, adding new names, expecting more. And that's where you hear Israel, you know, calling for the Philadelphia corridor, which suddenly has dropped out of the discussion, right? They both want more and more advantage and gains on their side, which is why negotiators are exasperated.""

While the Biden administration continues to try to find ways forward on a deal, public comments that have strung along hope for months are now conflicted by some of the privately held sentiment that cease-fire efforts are futile.

On July 19, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a cease-fire deal was within sight.

""I believe we're inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a cease-fire, get the hostages home and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability,"" Blinken said.

On Aug. 17, President Biden said he was ""optimistic"" a deal could be reached. ""We are closer than we've ever been,"" he said, adding that he was sending Blinken to Israel to continue ""intensive efforts to conclude this agreement.""

On Aug. 19, Blinken said that Israel had ""accepted a proposal"" and the next step was for Hamas to agree.

""The next important statement is for Hamas to say 'yes,' and then, in the coming days, for all of the expert negotiators to get together to work on clear understandings on implementing the agreement,"" Blinken said at a press conference in Tel Aviv.

HOW DID THE HEZBOLLAH PAGER EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN? 5 THINGS TO KNOW

""This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a cease-fire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security.""

But those comments came one day after Hamas had said it would not agree to that proposal. They objected to Israel having control of the Rafah and Philadelphia corridors, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had demanded.

Then again on Sept. 2, Biden claimed the U.S. was ""very close"" to finalizing a cease-fire deal that would see the release of hostages. Asked why he was optimistic despite other deals having failed, he said, ""Hope springs eternal.""

Even this week, Blinken expressed optimism about a deal, though he warned after the pager blasts that ""escalation"" threatens to thwart progress.

""It's imperative that all parties refrain from any actions that could escalate the conflict,"" Blinken said at a news conference in Egypt.

He said he was focused on a deal that would bring calm on all fronts, including Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Blinken said that 15 out of 18 paragraphs of a deal had been agreed by all sides.

He blamed long wait times for messages to be passed between the parties for leaving space to disrupt the talks.

""We've seen that in the intervening time, you might have an event, an incident -- something that makes the process more difficult, that threatens to slow it, stop it, derail it -- and anything of that nature, by definition, is probably not good in terms of achieving the result that we want, which is the cease-fire,"" Blinken said.

After Egypt, he went to Paris to discuss the prospects of a deal with his European counterparts.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Wednesday with the relatives of the seven remaining U.S. hostages held in Gaza, where the families said they ""expressed frustration with the lack of tangible progress"" to Sullivan.

On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a televised address called the pager attacks ""a declaration of war"" and that attacks against Israel would continue until the war with Gaza is over. Likewise, Israel's defense minister vowed to continue striking Hezbollah in Lebanon, aiming to stop the group's rocket and missile attacks so some 70,000 Israelis who live in the northern border region could return home."

The Israel Defense Forces tells Fox News Digital that it is reviewing an incident in which soldiers were filmed apparently heaving lifeless bodies off a rooftop during a military operation in the West Bank.

The scenes allegedly unfolded on Thursday in the town of Qabatiya, where the IDF says its troops ""eliminated four terrorists during an exchange of fire.""

""This is a serious incident that does not coincide with the IDF values and the expectations from IDF soldiers,"" the military agency told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""The incident is under review.""

In a video captured of the incident, three soldiers can be seen picking up what appears to be a stiff body and then dragging it toward the edge of a roof as troops stand on the ground below, according to The Associated Press. The soldiers on the roof peer over the edge before heaving the body off.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption

Former President Donald Trump is casting himself as Israel's ""protector"" and warning Jewish voters against supporting his rival, Vice President Harris.

Trump addressed the Israeli-American Council summit in Washington, D.C, on Thursday, during an evening focused on commemorating the October 7 attacks that sparked Israel's war with Hamas.

Speaking to a mostly friendly crowd, Trump touted his past support for Israel and, without providing evidence, claimed that the Jewish state will soon cease to exist unless he's elected.

""It's total annihilation -- that's what you're talking about,"" Trump said. ""You have a big protector in me. You don't have a protector on the other side.""

Trump also accused Harris of ""pandering"" to Hamas supporters and said ""Jewish people have no excuse"" for supporting his Democratic rival. Trump has a long history of accusing Jewish Democrats of being disloyal to Israel.

Harris has said that she will support Israel's right to defend itself while also calling the suffering in Gaza ""devastating.""

The Hamas attack on October 7 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 200 hostages, including some American citizens. Since then, health officials in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have died.

Trump's address to the Israeli-American Council comes just weeks after a 23-year-old Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was found shot dead in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, along with the bodies of five other hostages.

Other featured speakers Thursday night included Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson."

At least 200 University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill students and staff participated in an anti-Israel walkout led by UNC Students for Justice in Palestine on Thursday, according to the school's student newspaper.

The Daily Tar Heel reported that the ""Walk out for the West Bank"" featured protesters walking in and out of various buildings around campus while spray-painting messages such as ""Free Gaza,"" ""F -- K UNC"" and ""Israel is a terror state.""

""There were several speeches demanding that the University reject Israel and the brutalization of students. Protesters chanted phrases like ""disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,"" as they walked through Halls,"" the Daily Tar Heel reported.

University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill has been plagued with campus unrest since last school year. Last spring, fraternity brothers at the school famously prevented the American flag on Chapel Hill's quad from touching the ground when anti-Israel agitators tried to replace it with the Palestinian flag.

(Courtesy New York Post)

A Cornell University professor who was accused of ""justifying terror"" after describing Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 operation in Southern Israel as ""exhilarating"" is coming under fire again for taking part in an anti-Israel march on the college campus this week, when protesters could be heard chanting ""long live the intifada"" before crashing a career fair.

Russell Rickford, an associate professor of history at Cornell University, was seen on video with a keffiyeh around his shoulders marching with dozens of anti-Israel supporters on campus Wednesday.

Some of the protesters, many of whom wore face masks and were also clad in keffiyehs, carried Palestinian flags and signs reading, ""Cornell divest from genocide"" and ""defund genocide.""

CORNELL PROFESSOR WHO WAS 'EXHILARATED' AFTER HAMAS ATTACK ISSUES APOLOGY FOR 'REPREHENSIBLE' REMARKS

The boisterous, pan-banging protesters eventually disrupted a career fair at the Statler Hotel on campus, as Rickford could be seen on video looking on and clapping his hands outside.

School officials said the demonstrators pushed past school police officers, although it does not appear that Rickford was part of the group that burst into the career fair.

""Guests of the university felt threatened. And students were denied their ability to experience the career fair,"" Joel Malina, the vice president of university relations at Cornell said in a statement. ""This behavior is unacceptable, a violation of university policy, and illegal.""

One Jewish student told the New York Post that the instructor's presence at the protest was ""insane"" and another accused him of ""emboldening hate."" Video shows the group chanting, ""long live the intifada."" Intifada is an Arabic word for a rebellion or uprising, or a resistance movement.

Rickford, who specializes in African American political culture, was roundly condemned last year when he made inflammatory comments about Hamas' sneak terror attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the current war in Gaza.

""It was exhilarating, it was energizing.... I was exhilarated,"" Rickford said at the time. He later walked back the comments and apologized, describing the speech as ""reprehensible.""

The self-identified ""secular Marxist"" eventually went on leave amid the media firestorm over his comments about the Hamas killing spree against hundreds of civilians, including American citizens, but he has now returned to the college.

Amanda Silberstain, vice president of Chabad and Cornellians for Israel, an Israel advocacy group on campus, said Rickford marched with students to the Statler Hotel but is unsure if he went inside.

""He was wearing a keffiyeh and smiling. Rickford knows he's immune from consequences,"" Sillberstein told the Post. ""We have a professor who is promoting antisemitic narratives and emboldening hate.""

DIVERSITY PROFESSOR ACCUSED OF VERBALLY ATTACKING STUDENTS AFTER TERRORISM REMARK CLEARED OF ANY WRONGDOING

Malina said that students who violated university policies during the protest would be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for ""immediate action including suspension"" while faculty and staff would be referred to human resources.

""These individuals will also be subject to potential criminal charges,"" Malina said.

Cornell provided Fox News Digital with a prior statement from Molina when asked for comment about Rickford's latest actions.

""Last October, Professor Russel Rickford made a horrific comment at an off-campus rally in downtown Ithaca. As then-President Pollack and Board Chair Kayser noted at the time, his comment was reprehensible and demonstrated a complete disregard for humanity. Professor Rickford apologized for his comments and took a voluntary leave of absence for the remainder of the academic year.""

""Consistent with well-established principles of academic freedom, Cornell has a process for considering whether public statements such as those expressed off campus by Professor Rickford at a political rally fall under the category of protected speech, or rather demonstrate prohibited bias, discrimination, or harassment. Given that Professor Rickford's comments were made as a private citizen in his free time, the university's academic leadership has concluded that Professor Rickford's conduct in relation to this incident did not meet that high bar.""

Fox News Digital was unable to reach Rickford for comment.

Rickford's comments on political violence go as far back as a decade.

In two videos reviewed by Fox News Digital, one from 2021 and another from 2014, Rickford discussed his desire for an anti-racist ""insurgent"" group to take power in the United States. In one of the videos, he said some White people are ready to commit ""race suicide"" and went on to discuss the ""politics of violence"" while simultaneously attacking the ideals of civility.

During a webinar hosted on a Cornell platform in February 2021, Rickford endorsed ""radical frameworks for anti-racism."" The radical frameworks call for a fundamental revolutionary change in society to change the distribution of wealth in neo-Marxist fashion.

""Radical anti-racists ... knew justice required not ... dialogue ... but genuine reallocations of resources and power. Attacking the roots of White supremacy meant challenging the normal operations of capitalism.""

Rickford has also said that the Black Lives Matter movement ""reflects this more ... redistributive mode of anti-racism,"" adding that ""What we need is not more civil dialogue [but] more insurgent popular anti-racist movements that fight the whole apparatus of oppression."""
Samaritan's Purse pledges to donate 20 ambulances to Israel: 'Need is so great',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/samaritans-purse-pledges-donate-20-ambulances-israel-need-so-great,2024-09-20T08:18:30Z,"Reverend Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse surprised Israel's emergency services system with a pledge to donate 20 more ambulances on Thursday during a dedication ceremony of two armored ambulances.

The unveiling of the ambulances for Magen David Adom, the emergency services system, was done in the memory of three American-Israelis killed by Hamas; Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Roi Idan and Smadar Mor-Idan.

IN ISRAEL, FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND SAMARITAN'S PURSE DONATE AMBULANCES, HONOR LIVES LOST TO TERROR

""Today we are in Israel to dedicate the two armored ambulances that have just arrived, as well as a new ambulance center near the Gaza border where there has not been one before,"" said Rev. Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse.

""The need is so great, we have just committed to providing 20 more armored ambulances. The MDA team are heroes, saving lives every day, and it is an honor to stand with them,"" Graham added.

Counting Thursday's pledge, Samaritan's Purse has donated 42 ambulances to Israel since the war with Hamas began on October 7, 2023.

""Franklin Graham, welcome to Israel. A true friend of the state of Israel,"" said Gadi Yarkoni, mayor of the Eshkol Regional Council.

FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S SAMARITAN'S PURSE TO DEDICATE NEW AIRLIFT RESPONSE CENTER 'TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING'

Rev. Graham also laid the cornerstone in a ceremony for a new Magen David Adom (MDA) station in Avshalom, which borders Gaza. The Avshalom emergency station would decrease wait times for Israeli paramedics to reach the scenes of emergencies along the Gaza border. MDA also partners with the Red Cross to respond to disasters worldwide.

Samaritan's Purse is also working on another Magen David Adom station in Shlomi, on the northern border of Israel.

""We don't know if we are happy or sad. We walk around between hope and despair. We are waiting for our people to return,"" said Eli Bin, MDA's director general during the ceremony. ""Mr. Graham, you are really one of the most important people to MDA, and one of the most important people to the state of Israel.""

""The building of the station is building a bridge between the awful events that happened and much more hopeful future here,"" added Bin.

Samaritan's Purse donated 14 ambulances to MDA in January after Hamas forces destroyed rescue vehicles in Israel during the October 2023 attack.

""The generosity of Reverend Franklin Graham and his organization Samaritan's Purse knows no bounds. As he dedicated eight additional Magen David Adom armored ambulances and two new MDA stations, he leaned in and told me he would donate another twenty, taking the total amount to forty-two life-saving vehicles. The entire people of Israel are indebted to this great man and organization,"" said MDA director general Eli Bin.

Israel strikes Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon; IDF warns residents to stay near bomb shelters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-strikes-hezbollah-targets-inside-lebanon-idf-warns-residents-stay-near-bomb-shelters,2024-09-20T00:32:21Z,"The IDF said the military targets were ready to be used 'in the immediate future' to fire into Israeli territory. (Credit: IDF)

Israeli officials on Thursday were warning residents in the north to stay inside or remain near bomb shelters after the Israeli Air Force (IAF) struck hundreds of Hezbollah military targets inside Lebanon.

The IAF, using intelligence from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), struck some 100 launchers and additional ""terrorist infrastructure sites"" comprising about 1,000 barrels.

Israeli officials said these barrels ""were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory.""

It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.

HOW DID THE HEZBOLLAH PAGER EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN? 5 THINGS TO KNOW

The strikes come after two days of attacks targeting thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies that have been widely blamed on Israel.

Speaking for the first time since back-to-back attacks Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah described the mass bombing of devices as a ""severe blow"" and threatened retaliation.

During his speech, Hezbollah struck at least four times in northern Israel, and two Israeli soldiers were killed in a strike earlier in the day. Israeli warplanes flew low over Beirut while Nasrallah spoke and broke the sound barrier, scattering birds and prompting people in houses and offices to quickly open windows to prevent them from shattering.

Earlier Thursday, Hezbollah said it had targeted three Israeli military positions near the border, two of them with drones. Israeli hospitals reported eight people lightly or moderately injured.

The attacks have heightened fears that 11 months of near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel will escalate into an all-out war. Hezbollah says its strikes on Israel are a show of support for Hamas. Israel's nearly year-old war with Hamas in Gaza began after its militants led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

Israel has responded to Hezbollah's attacks with strikes in southern Lebanon and has struck senior figures from the group in the capital, Beirut. The exchanges have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents on each side of the border.

Israeli leaders have stepped up warnings in recent weeks of a potential larger military operation against Hezbollah, saying they are determined to stop the group's fire to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border.

Dem lawmakers push bill to restore funding to UN agency with alleged ties to Hamas: 'So necessary',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-lawmakers-push-bill-restore-funding-un-agency-alleged-ties-hamas-so-necessary,2024-09-19T22:54:52Z,"The Israeli Defense Force on Tuesday released video they claim shows Hamas terrorists operating inside a UNRWA base near Rafah.

A group of Democratic lawmakers is calling for the U.S. to restore funding to a controversial United Nations agency that supports much-needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees but faced accusations that some of its employees participated in the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.

Speaking at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday afternoon, Democratic Reps. André Carson of Indiana, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, among others, said passing H.R. 9649, or the UNRWA Funding Emergency Restoration Act, was crucial for helping Gazans.

Carson, who sponsored the bill, portrayed a dire situation in Gaza, calling current conditions ""absolutely deplorable"" and ""inhumane.""

""One million. That's the number of estimated Gazans who will not have enough food this month. 700,000. That's the number of women and girls in Gaza who do not have access to menstrual products or even running water and toilet paper. 100,000. That is the number of Palestinians who have been seriously injured without access to functioning hospitals. 41,000. That's the number of Palestinians killed by Israel since Oct. 7th,"" Carson said.

ISRAEL STRIKES HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON AFTER TWO ROUNDS OF DEVICE EXPLOSIONS

Jayapal said the UNRWA has, for decades, ""played an integral role in supporting the welfare of Palestinian refugees to ensure that they can live with dignity.""

""Unfortunately, UNWRA has been under constant attack by those who want to put a stop to this lifesaving work. The stoppage of funding was an unnecessary and dangerous interruption to continue to provide the humanitarian assistant that is so necessary,"" she said.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, has been one of the central agencies distributing aid to Palestinians in Gaza over the course of Israel's ongoing war with Hamas. It has around 30,000 employees.

In January, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres tasked the U.N.'s investigative arm, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, to investigate allegations by Israel that UNRWA staff took part in the Oct. 7 massacre.

Nearly 20 UNRWA staff members were investigated, but the U.N. only found enough evidence to dismiss nine people.

Still, Israel's allegations initially led top donor countries -- most notably, the U.S. -- to suspend funding for UNRWA, causing a cash crunch of $450 million. Since then, all donor countries -- except for the U.S. -- have resumed funding.

IRANIAN NETANYAHU ASSASSINATION PLOT FOILED, ISRAELI MAN CHARGED

Schakowsky said it was ""shameful"" that the U.S. decided to cut funding to UNRWA because only a ""tiny number"" of the agency's roughly 30,000 employees were alleged to have been involved in terrorist activities.

""Every other country, among those of our allies that had decided to stop funding UNRWA, have changed their mind. So now it is the United States alone,"" Schakowsky said. ""And the fact that the United States has decided that it's not going to be there means a danger to the people who are dying, in danger of dying every single day, including children and women and families and everyone for basic needs that they have. And that is shameful. We cannot allow that.""

H.R. 9649 has 65 co-sponsors and support from more than 100 human rights organizations. But not everyone is supportive of restoring funding.

Anne Bayefsky, Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and President of Human Rights Voices, said lawmakers' support of H.R. 9649 whitewashes the UNRWA's alleged ""connections to terrorism"" and sends ""the wrong message to Israel and America's enemies at the wrong time.""

""Let's get the facts straight: UNRWA employees directly participated in October 7 atrocities; 10% of UNRWA employees are reported to have ties to multiple Palestinian terror organizations; a significant percentage of UNRWA's senior education leadership are members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad,"" Bayefsky said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Bayefsky also noted that ""UNRWA facilities -- including schools -- have been used as Hamas command and control centers and weapons depots [and] UNRWA's Gaza headquarters powered a Hamas data center directly beneath it.""

Bayefsky slammed the UNRWA for not having taken, in her view, ""serious steps towards accountability or prevention... while at the same time demanding more funding.""

""This is not a small drop in a fictional ocean of humanitarianism,"" Bayefsky said. ""UNRWA's ties to Palestinian terrorism emanate from raising a generation of Palestinian Arabs on the hatred of Jews in its schools, upending the meaning of a 'refugee' to serve as a vehicle to eviscerate the Jewish state. And spreading slanderous lies guaranteed to undermine peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis to the detriment of all.""

The BBC flunks Journalism 101 when it comes to Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bbc-flunks-journalism-101-when-comes-israel,2024-09-19T18:01:27Z,"FOX News contributor Joe Concha joined 'FOX & Friends First' to discuss why he believes the editor should be fired.

Bad journalism has bad consequences.

Traduce Israel, and you bring Jew-hating angry mobs onto the street. That is a step away from acts of racial hatred. Journalists know this, yet they willingly act as cheerleaders for such hatred, whipping it up with distorted, manipulative and sometimes dishonest journalism.

They should know better.

THE BBC BREACHED EDITORIAL GUIDELINES OVER 1,500 TIMES IN ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT, REPORT CLAIMS

The BBC is the largest and most 'trusted' brand in journalism. We know this, because the BBC tells us. It earns this sobriquet by dint of its past glories, and the fact that it is legally obliged to produce 'impartial' news. In return for this promise, it is paid more than $5 billion per year by the British public.

The Asserson Report, which I published earlier this month, takes a deep dive into four months of BBC news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. We look at some 9 million words of output using a traditional litigation style analysis. In parallel, a team of data scientists (operating as the Research for Impartial media - RIMe) conducted a series of experiments using cutting-edge AI techniques. Working independently, yet collaboratively, these two disciplines found strikingly similar results, exposing the myth of BBC impartiality.

'CORROSIVELY WOKE' BBC CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY RETRACTIONS, APOLOGIES RELATED TO ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

We analyzed BBC English language TV output. While some programs were neutral, the remainder were between 90% and 100% pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli.

The BBC broke almost every rule in its own rule-book - the 'Editorial Guidelines.' They use BBC as a platform for Hamas sympathizers, and Hamas members; they report death figures they know to be wrong without adequately conveying their unreliability to audiences; they air reports from Gaza without mentioning that Hamas controls journalistic output; their own

journalists express personal opinions. Each of these is a separate breach of the BBC's own guidelines on impartiality.

While we found that BBC English was disappointingly bad, we found that BBC Arabic was significantly worse. In a 'sympathy analysis' conducted by the RIMe data scientists across global media, BBC Arabic was snuggled up with such outlets as Al Jazeera; Palestine Chronicle and Iraqi News. It must surely degrade trust in the BBC to discover that it is being used to peddle extremist views.

The BBC News machine displays a strong anti-Israel view from almost every angle we analyzed. Any pretense at impartiality seems to have been abandoned. Indeed, its lead Middle East journalist, Jeremy Bowen, recently boasted that he considers impartiality means him telling the audience what he considers to be 'the truth.' This is the precise opposite of what the Editorial Guidelines dictate.

So, how has the BBC drifted so far from its roots? There are two answers. Firstly - the BBC has been captured by an institutional bias on many issues. Journalists who insist on expressing their own opinions should be shifted to somewhere less harmful - Gardener's Question Time, comes to mind - or they should be removed altogether. This seems rarely, if ever, to happen.

Secondly, and more fundamentally, BBC management needs to get a grip on their most sacred product - news. They need to set targets; monitor output, adjust when targets are not hit; and take steps against recalcitrant journalists and editors. At present, the BBC senior management sets no KPI's; sets no goals; conducts no systematic monitoring of output and is essentially running blind. They hope their journalists will achieve impartiality, but take no effective steps to ensure they do. They have let go of the rudder, and are allowing the BBC to be blown where the winds take it. That means that a bunch of very self-opinionated journalists, many of whom display deeply malevolent views about Israel, control the output.

The Asserson Report blows the myth of impartiality out of the water. The BBC doesn't achieve impartiality and is not remotely close to achieving it. BBC management must either take back control of the ship, or the British people should demand a refund."
"Iranian Netanyahu assassination plot foiled, Israeli man charged",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-netanyahu-assassination-plot-foiled-israeli-man-charged,2024-09-19T14:12:42Z,"WARNING: Graphic footage -- 'Fox News @ Night' panelists Lisa Daftari and Hillel Neuer discuss Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies exploding in Lebanon and who was behind the attacks.

Israeli authorities indicted a Jewish Israeli man for being recruited by Iran to pursue an assassination plot against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials.

Moti Maman, 73, told authorities he had a ""lapse of judgment"" and is now cooperating with law enforcement. Israeli police arrested Maman in August, saying he had twice visited Iran to meet with intelligence officials who gave him various tasks to conduct in Israel.

During his latest trip to Iran in August, Israeli authorities say Iranian intelligence proposed assassination plots against Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar.

Authorities say Maman demanded a $1 million advance payment in exchange for his participation, but Iran paid him only 5,000 Euros.

""This is a very serious affair that is an example of the great efforts of the Iranian intelligence agencies to recruit Israeli citizens to promote terrorist activities in Israel. The security officials assess that the Iranians will continue their efforts to recruit operatives in Israel to gather intelligence and carry out terrorist missions in Israel while also turning, among other things, to elements with a criminal background to carry out the missions,"" a senior Shin Bet official said in a statement.

""At a time when the State of Israel is at war on several fronts, an Israeli citizen goes to an enemy country on two different occasions, meets with Iranian intelligence agents, and expresses a willingness to carry out serious terrorist acts on Israeli soil. His actions helped Iran and its intelligence agents in their campaign against Israel,"" the statement continued.

News of Maman's indictment comes days after a massive Israeli operation targeting pagers used by Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy terrorist group in Lebanon.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

The explosions of hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members in Lebanon and Syria on Tuesday and the detonation of a second wave of electronic devices a day later remain a mystery, though experts are calling the deadly blasts a sophisticated attack that likely took months of planning.

The two waves of bombings killed at least 37 people, including at least two children, and wounded more than 3,000 others, Lebanon's Health Ministry said.

Hezbollah has used pagers to communicate for years, and the group's leader recently called on members to stop using cell phones altogether over concerns that Israeli intelligence could track the devices.

While Israel has not claimed responsibility for the waves of explosions, its intelligence agency, Mossad, is widely credited for the operation.

Hezbollah and Lebanon immediately pointed fingers at Israel following the explosions on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a senior U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that Israel was behind the pager explosions.

Morning Glory: Why I Am Voting For Trump,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-why-am-voting-trump,2024-09-19T09:14:11Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

This column began as a post on X/Twitter, one which resonated with the audience. Here is the revised and extended version of why former President Donald Trump should win your vote.

Voting has begun in Pennsylvania, perhaps the single most crucial state in this election.

Voting for president will accelerate on Saturday when Virginia opens its doors to early, in-person voting. Trump took to X on Tuesday, September 17, to urge Pennsylvania voters to get out and vote early. Republicans across the country seem to have fully absorbed the necessity of voting early -- it is crucial in a race this close -- but only the final tally will tell if they got the message.

TRUMP ADVISER UNPACKS WHY FORMER PRESIDENT IS HOLDING RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE STATE WEEKS FROM ELECTION

Analyst Nate Silver's ""prediction of victory odds"" gave Trump a 59.7% chance of winning the election and Vice President Kamala Harris a 40% chance of winning on Tuesday morning, a week after the debate. (Note: Silver's analysis is not a poll, but rather the widely respected Silver's assessment of the odds of winning based on all the state polls and other crucial data.)

Polls taken after the debate but before the second assassination attempt on Trump have Harris slightly ahead nationally but very much within the margin of error. Most analysts say she got a small bump from the debate but it is margin-of-error stuff at best and may be changing as she stumbles through the aftermath. (Her appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists was a fiasco for her if anyone sees it. She remains a jukebox with very few choices among her answers, all of them bad. A 7% cap on the cost of childcare?) The race is a frozen, jump ball of a race, with each candidate possessing a good chance of winning.

The takeaway from all this, and what I emphasized in my opening monologue on Tuesday, is that ""the choice,"" voters must make is underway is upon them even as it is very much being debated across the country.

That ""choice"" is between Trump/Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's national security team, and his 3,000 other political appointees and Harris/ Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her national security team and her 3,000 other appointees.

At the end of his first term, Trump had Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor Ambassador Robert C. O'Brien, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and many more who are expected to return in a second Trump term in some role. Harris's national security choices are almost a complete unknown save for Philip Gordon, her current National Security Advisor (a very unsettling prospect according to people who I know who know his record.)

A key consideration for voters should be the national security team Trump or Harris will bring with them, along with the 3,000 appointees they will also place in every agency of the vast federal government beginning in late January.

Trump's appointees will be center-right to conservative men and women and Harris's appointees are almost wholly unknown but, in many if not most cases, will be out-and-out radicals, far to the left of the mainstream. That's the San Francisco way. That's why San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley are in such ruins. They are all run by extreme ""progressives,"" which really means radicals.

Each candidate would also get to nominate judges and perhaps a Supreme Court justice or two, though there are no vacancies on the highest court now as there was when America voted in 2016.

Trump's and Harris's views on judges as well as every other big issue are so completely different --on the need for a defense buildup, for the continuation of the 2017 tax cuts (they expire in 2025 if not extended and Trump wants to extend them and Harris does not), of whom our most deadly enemies are and how to deter them, on how to close the border (Harris simply won't), on energy production including fracking, on Israel and its right to strike at its enemies, on the nature and specific threats posed by our enemies in China, Iran and Russia -- that the choice should be very easy. Mine was. It is Donald Trump. I hope yours is too and that you forward this column to everyone you know.

My choice to vote for Trump is driven by my faith in the Constitution and deep unwillingness to amend it, explicitly or via expansion and packing the Supreme Court by congressional legislation about the number of justices. Amendments to the Constitution's provisions about the Supreme Court or underhanded laws expanding the number of justices, which has been fixed at nine since shortly after the Civil War, would mark the beginning of the rapid end of the rule of law in the country.

Harris is pledged to radically changing the court. Trump is opposed to court-packing. That imperils the most important general feature of the Constitution -- separation of powers -- as well as the First Amendment specifically, the right to free speech and especially the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. This should matter to every person of faith, no matter their religious views or no views at all.

My choice is also driven by knowledge -- first-hand, personal knowledge gained while serving in the executive branch from 1984 to 1989, and by experience gained since 1989 when I left the Beltway for California to become a journalist, lawyer for clients needing land use permits from the federal government and a law professor at Chapman University's Fowler School of Law.

My years as a young lawyer fresh off a clerkship with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, began as a member of the Reagan administration in 1984. The jobs 40 years ago showed me how the federal government actually runs. I worked as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office, for two attorneys general at the Department of Justice, and at the Office of Personnel Management.

I went through the ""advice and consent"" process in the Senate and helped run OPM first as its general counsel, then as it's confirmed deputy director and finally as it's acting director at the close of the Reagan administration. From 1984 to early 1989, I had the highest security clearance level available -- TS-SCI (though I was not read into every compartment of ""Specialized Compartmented Information"" because my work was on counterintelligence matters and domestic security issues, not overseas surveillance and operations.)

Five of my seven jobs from those years long ago were from among those 3,000 jobs that appointees of incoming presidents do not require Senate confirmation. A vast majority of the appointees of a president do not require Senate confirmation, and the policies all appointees ought to be pursuing are directed at least in theory by the president. Those are the actual results of the election. To repeat: Very few of the 3,000 are confirmed by the Senate to an ""Executive Level"" position. (I held two of those.)

If a voter grasps how many people leave and arrive with a change of presidents, they should approach the choice in November with that legion of appointees in mind. Harris's appointees will be far, far to the left of the American mainstream. Trump's are a jumble of what used to be called ""Rockefeller Republicans"" and ""Goldwater Republicans.""

Trump is the least ideological president since Richard Nixon, period. He innovated on the domestic level -- setting up the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, and staffing his White House within all comers from all camps, from Daniel Patrick Moynihan to Henry Kissinger to George Schultz and Donald Rumsfeld. Trump's few critics in the GOP -- a list of 200 people out of tens of thousands who served GOP presidents have endorsed Harris are mostly opposed to Trump and not to his policies.

Such lists of endorsements are neither significant nor influential because most voters do not care about endorsements, whether it is 20, 200 or 2,000. They want to know whether the candidates and their policies and appointees will impact them and their children and grandchildren and the quality of their lives, particularly the economy and their personal security.

On security, our enemies fear Trump and cannot possibly fear Harris, who simply lacks the minimum skills to be president, much less restore American defenses and deterrence.

Harris won't. She is afraid of interviews! How could our most serious enemies fear her if she fears the New York Times and the Washington Post and all the major networks?

Understand what that means: She has given two interviews in the two months since she became the selected nominee of the Democrats, and both were disasters even though neither CNN's Dana Bash nor Philly TV journalist Brian Taff pushed her hard or posed any follow-ups, much less pointed ones on her non-responsive answers to their questions.

She's become a parody of herself, a jukebox with a half dozen bad choices of answers, none of them responsive to the direct questions asked her. Again and again, she refuses to answer questions. It is probably because she lacks the knowledge to do so.

In the one debate Trump and Harris held, neither ABC/Disney's duo of David Muir and Linsey Davis, primed to ""fact check"" Trump, said a word about Harris's startling, indeed disqualifying, answer that no American troops were in combat zones. (Either she doesn't know or she just wanted to lie to get a talking point out there -- either way it should be disqualifying for anyone who aspires to be commander-in-chief.)

There was not one question in that debate about the People's Republic of China's genocide of the Uyghurs, repression of Hong Kong, threatening Taiwan and the Philippines, its spying in the U.S. or its influence campaign on TikTok. (This void may have been imposed on Muir and Davis because of Disney's vast business interests in Communist China including two theme parks). That debate should be forever embarrassing to ABC/Disney and the moderators.

It is as though a debate in 1940 between FDR and Wendell Wilkie did not feature a question about Imperial Japan. The good news is that this ambush of Trump did not significantly halt his momentum but may have done so to Harris because of the troops-in-combat zone and the attention it brought to Springfield, Ohio, and other communities staggering under sudden, massive influx of migrants who have been granted protected status by President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris.

The election is very close, and it should not be. There are many people, people whom I respect greatly, who have been so unsettled by the aesthetic that the former president brings with him that they won't vote for him. I can't change their minds, and some of those minds have been closed to Trump since 2015 and some since January 6, 2021. They simply cannot get past their last issues with Trump, even though some of them surely know Harris lacks the very minimum skills needed to be president.

Their sunk costs cannot be unburdened from themselves, but the vast, vast majority of voters are not frozen in time or particular enmity toward either candidate. Thus, for the next 45 days, I am going to devote every hour on air and every appearance on other programs and every column I write to making the case for Trump. It is a very easy case to make.

I believe the future of my grandchildren depends greatly on this election. The CCP led by Xi Jinping is a mortal threat to every American. Our ally Israel needs every assistance we can provide to it to defeat Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. Iran is very close to obtaining but must not get a nuclear weapon.

I fear Harris on all counts far more than I fear Trump cutting off aid to Ukraine which I do not believe will happen. The Constitution will be stressed by an influx of Harris radical judges and directly assaulted by her ""court reform"" plan, which is really court packing. Her prosecutors will continue the weaponization of the law against political opponents and will ignore crime in the way that prosecutors in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and other cities have done so.

My choice to vote for Trump is driven by my faith in the Constitution and deep unwillingness to amend it, explicitly or via expansion and packing the Supreme Court by congressional legislation about the number of justices.

Next, ""energy is freedom"" is one of my favorite sayings, not only because it is true -- from putting gas in your car to drive to revenues to the U.S. Treasury, revenues which depend heavily on American productivity which is built on the cost of energy. The only way to really bring down prices is to bring down the cost of their production and the cost of their transportation to market.

The U.S. must absolutely ""drill, baby drill,"" but also throw everything at the new generation of nuclear power plants and the export of liquified natural gas. Our ""AI"" (and super-computing) future depends on our soaring base load of energy production. China will dominate artificial intelligence and super-computing and thus the world if we do not at least keep pace with them and that means vastly more domestic energy production.

Trump is committed to all of the above. Harris in 2019 was ""absolutely"" against fracking and has lied about her being the tie-breaking vote to allow fracking. (The bill she refers to had provisions on offshore oil leases, not fracking.) We know Harris's values have not changed and that she is a disciple of ""climate change crisis"" and all the de-industrialization that comes with it whether intended or not. We have to produce domestic energy at two-to-four times our current total output. Just recently, the Biden/Harris administration hit back to the production levels Trump achieved.

My choice to support Trump may not be your choice, but my job is to make sure you understand the stakes. They are oh so high. Please send this column along to friends and family."
John Kirby denies US involvement in Lebanon device attacks: 'We want to see the war end',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/john-kirby-denies-us-involvement-lebanon-device-attacks-we-want-see-war-end,2024-09-19T01:05:57Z,"Hundreds electronic devices, including pagers and handheld radios, reportedly exploded around Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday in an attack widely believed to have been the work of Israel.

National Security communications adviser John Kirby shot down multiple questions Wednesday about possible U.S. involvement in the explosion of hundreds of electronic devices used by Hezbollah members in Lebanon.

""We were not involved in [Tuesday's] incidents or [Wednesday's] in any way. And I don't have anything more to share,"" Kirby said when asked to respond to the attacks.

Kirby's comments came hours after several blasts were heard around Lebanon's capital of Beirut and other parts of the country. Hezbollah's Al Manar TV reported the explosions were the result of walkie-talkies detonating.

At least nine people were killed and another 300 were wounded in Wednesday's attack, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry.

The explosions came just a day after pagers used by hundreds of Hezbollah members exploded throughout Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing at least 12 people - including two children - and wounding thousands more.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

Both attacks are widely believed to have been the work of Israel, which has been fighting with Hezbollah almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led assault in southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza.

Since then, hundreds have been killed in strikes in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, while tens of thousands on each side of the border have been displaced. Hezbollah said its strikes are in support of its ally, Hamas.

Reporters repeatedly pressed Kirby on Wednesday to say whether the U.S. was involved in the back-to-back attacks targeting members of Hezbollah or had been informed beforehand.

Kirby reiterated that he did not ""have anything more to share today.""

""We want to see the war end. And everything we've been doing since the beginning has been designed to prevent the conflict from escalating,"" Kirby said. ""We still believe that there is a diplomatic path forward, particularly up near Lebanon.""

The attacks have heightened fears that what has been intermittent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into an all-out war.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israeli troops Wednesday: ""We are at the start of a new phase in the war -- it requires courage, determination and perseverance.""

Gallant made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel's army and security agencies, saying ""the results are very impressive.""

Hezbollah announced three strikes on parts of northern Israel Wednesday, at least one of which took place after the latest round of explosions in Lebanon."

On Tuesday, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah became small bombs, exploding almost simultaneously across Lebanon. The blasts killed at least a dozen people - including two children - and wounded thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Then, on Wednesday - barely 24 hours after the first synchronized attack - more communication devices used by the militant group detonated across southern Lebanon. The Lebanese health ministry reports that the second round of explosions killed at least 14 people and injured several hundred.

Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack. And while Israel's military declined to comment, a U.S. official told NPR that Israel privately claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant hinted at the ""excellent achievements"" by Israel's military and intelligence branches. He said Israel was at ""the beginning of a new era in this war.""

The two unprecedented attacks come at a time when ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have stalled, and tensions between Israel and Hezbollah continue to grow.

NPR's Jane Arraf says the attack has rattled Lebanon.

""It's hard to explain just how used to bad things happening Lebanese are,"" she told All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro, ""but this has been largely a conflict involving warplanes, artillery, drones.""

As a result, Tuesday's attack was especially shocking, Arraf says.

Hezbollah fighters, officials and office staff often use the messaging devices targeted in the attacks for communications. Many of the casualties were Hezbollah fighters, medics and office workers, but many nearby civilians were also caught in the blasts.

According to Lebanese health minister Firas Abiad, most of the injuries people sustained were to the abdomen, legs, hands, face and eyes. Reuters said it viewed footage that showed many of the pagers buzzing, then exploding as people reached for them.

After Hamas attacked Israel last October 7, Hezbollah fired rockets across the Lebanese border into Israel in support of Hamas. Israel and Hezbollah have been at low-grade war since then.

This week's attacks mark a surprising development that could deter Hezbollah from further escalating its attacks on Israel in the short term at least.

Security experts in the region say Hezbollah's communications have been hijacked, thousands of their operatives are wounded and there is likely deep suspicion within the group over who collaborated with Israel to orchestrate the attack.

Amer Al Sabaileh, a Jordanian security expert, says Hezbollah might not be in any condition to fight an all-out war with Israel: ""You don't know the level of infiltration, and what next surprise Israel is preparing for you."""

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY., explains why Vice President Kamala Harris is a 'leader' at the Democratic National Convention.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is demanding an investigation into whether any U.S. resources went toward Israel's coordinated explosion of Hezbollah pagers.

""Israel's pager attack in Lebanon detonated thousands of handheld devices across of a [sic] slew of public spaces, seriously injuring and killing innocent civilians,"" the progressive New Yorker wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""This attack clearly and unequivocally violates international humanitarian law and undermines US efforts to prevent a wider conflict. Congress needs a full accounting of the attack, including an answer from the State Department as to whether any US assistance went into the development or deployment of this technology.""

Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, planted explosives inside of 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's and Wednesday's detonations, a senior defense official confirmed to Fox News.

ISRAEL BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS

""The United States, did not know about, nor was it involved in, these incidents,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters of the pager attacks on Wednesday.

He then warned Israel against escalating conflict.

""We've been very clear and we remain very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're trying to resolve in Gaza,"" Blinken went on. ""To see it spread to other fronts, it's clearly not in the interest of anyone involved to see that happen.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., meanwhile, dropped a pair of joint resolutions that would block U.S. arms sales to Israel.

The Biden administration in August approved a series of arms sales totaling $20 billion to Israel, including ""several systems that are directly tied to tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza,"" according to Sanders.

HEZBOLLAH PAGERS THAT EXPLODED WERE MADE IN HUNGARY, TAIWANESE COMPANY SAYS

""Congress must act to save lives, uphold U.S. and international law, and stand up for U.S. interests. We must end our complicity in Israel's illegal and indiscriminate military campaign, which has caused mass civilian death and suffering.""

Under Senate rules, Sanders can force a vote on the resolutions as soon as next week. They would need 51 votes to be approved.

The Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah organization switched from mobile phones to pagers to prevent Israeli interception of their communications. Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel a day after the Gaza-based terrorist movement invaded the Jewish state on Oct. 7.

Some 2,500 people were wounded and 12 killed in the coordinated pager explosions on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, 14 people were killed and hundreds more injured when walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on Wednesday afternoon.

Of the 26 who have died in the two attacks, Hezbollah confirmed eight were its members.

Hezbollah is estimated to have more than 150,000 missiles aimed at Israel. The de facto ruler of Lebanon, Hezbollah, has amassed new sophisticated missiles, rockets and drones since its 2006 war against Israel. Hezbollah has launched more than 7,500 missiles, rockets, and drones into Israel since Oct. 8.

One Hezbollah official said the detonation of the pagers was the group's ""biggest security breach"" since the Gaza conflict began.

Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that ""the resistance will continue today, like any other day, its operations to support Gaza, its people and its resistance, which is a separate path from the harsh punishment that the criminal enemy (Israel) should await in response to Tuesday's massacre.""

This is the first resolution proposed by the Palestinians after gaining additional powers as a member following a vote in May, including granting them the ability to propose resolutions.

The Palestinian territories pushed for the resolution on the back of a July advisory opinion by the United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) that determined Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and settlements is illegal and should be withdrawn.

Andrew Tucker, the director general of The Hague Initiative for International Cooperation, told Fox News Digital ahead of the resolution vote that the proposal would essentially seek to implement the ICJ advisory opinion with a hard timeline, whereas the ICJ merely said it should be done ""immediately.""

""The court came out with an opinion in July,"" Tucker explained. ""It's an opinion: It's not a ruling, it's not a criminal case. They're not deciding a dispute. It's a legal opinion that the court is being asked to give by the General Assembly.""

""But it goes to the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict,"" Tucker said. ""In essence, the court is being asked to give its opinion on really the key issues that have been disputes between Israel and the Palestinians for decades, and the General Assembly is now implementing that opinion.""

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

""The court [is] saying: [It] doesn't matter what Israel's security concerns are, doesn't matter [that] there's a war going on in Gaza,"" Tucker continued. ""It doesn't matter that Hezbollah is threatening to attack from the north. All of these things are irrelevant.""

""The Palestinians have a kind of absolute right to self-determination, and that means that Israel's presence in the territories has become illegal,"" he added. ""Now, legally... there's a lot to be said about this. For example... never before has the right to self-determination been given this level of priority.""

Tucker argued that the implications of such a decision could lead to ""greater conflict"" because Israel's expedited exit could leave open the chance for Iran to dig into the West Bank the same way it did with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

""If Israel withdraws from these territories... It's only 10 kilometers from there at the smallest [point] between the West Bank and Tel Aviv,"" Tucker said.

""So whoever gets control of these territories, if it's hostile toward Israel, which is unfortunately the case, we're facing a highly, highly volatile security situation,"" he added."
Opinion | Sen. John Kennedy used a Senate hearing on hate crimes to spew hate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/john-kennedy-arab-american-maya-berry-hamas-bag-rcna171564,2024-09-18T19:49:08Z,"A senator's racist attack on a witness in a hearing was appalling even by Trump era standards.

On Tuesday, the executive director of the Arab American Institute, Maya Berry, appeared as a witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on an issue that should garner concern across the political spectrum: hate crimes. In both her prepared statement and her testimony, Berry apprised lawmakers of the need for stronger enforcement of the law to tackle the country's growing ""hate crime crisis.""

She acknowledged both Jewish and Arab American victims of hate crimes, and shared statistics on those crimes' effects on all kinds of demographic groups, including Black Americans, Asian Americans and members of the LBGTQ community.

It's difficult to imagine how a reasonable person could take issue with Berry's comments, other than to interrogate how effective the hate crime enforcement model is. But in a shocking display, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., demonstrated that he is not a reasonable person.

Instead, Kennedy used the hearing as an opportunity to launch a series of racist attacks on Berry, centered around accusations that she supports terrorism. His repugnant broadsides were a stunning illustration both of why the panel was being held in the first place and how politicians use ad hominem attacks to try to silence criticism of Israel.

Shortly after beginning to question Berry, Kennedy abruptly asked her: ""You support Hamas, do you not?""

""Senator, oddly enough, I'm going to say thank you for that question, because it demonstrates the purpose of our hearing today in a very effective way,"" Berry replied.

Kennedy interjected: ""Let's start first with a yes or no.""

""Hamas is a foreign terrorist organization that I do not support,"" Berry responded, ""but you asking the executive director of the Arab American Institute that question very much puts the focus on the issue of hate in our country.""

""You support Hezbollah, too, don't you?"" Kennedy then asked -- implying that he didn't believe her answer on Hamas.

Berry replied, ""I find this line of questioning extraordinarily disappointing.""

""Is that a no?"" Kennedy demanded.

""I don't support violence, whether it's Hezbollah or Hamas or any other entity that invokes it, so no, sir,"" she said.

""You just can't bring yourself to say no, can you? Kennedy said, even though Berry's answer could not have been clearer. He continued his absurd line of questioning, asking her if she supports or opposes Iran ""and their hatred of Jews?""

After Berry said she didn't support Iran, Kennedy questioned why she criticized the U.S. decision to cut funding to the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian civilians as a moral failure (a correct position, but one that should be irrelevant to a hearing on hate crimes) and then used that to circle back to deeming her a terrorist sympathizer. ""You can't bring yourself to say you don't support UNRWA, you don't support Hamas, you don't support Hezbollah and you don't support Iran,"" Kennedy shouted. ""You should hide your head in a bag.""

His declaration elicited gasps and cries of disapproval from the crowd in the room.

What a shameful display. Berry was called in as an expert from a civil rights organization to talk about the domestic issue of hate crimes. But the Kennedy was only interested in smearing an Arab American witness as a supporter of foreign American adversaries. He did so not by referring to her past conduct or positions, but simply putting words in her mouth, and then refusing to accept any of her statements as true.

In an interview with NBC News after the hearing, Kennedy said that he was correct to question Berry's positions because he claims that ""her website says"" she's a Democratic activist, that she believes Israel is committing genocide, and that Congress should fund UNRWA. True or not, none of those things have any bearing on whether she supports Hamas, Hezbollah or Iran. He also claimed -- again, falsely -- that she ""never would answer"" whether the supported those entities.

The only reasonable explanation for Kennedy's behavior is that he believes that her identity as Arab American is sufficient to define her as a supporter of terrorism.

Kennedy's grotesque bigotry undermines the very concept of democratic discourse, in which citizens' interests are defined by their actions and their words, not their ethnic background or their gender or sexual orientation. Whether sincere or not, Kennedy's refusal to take Berry at her word is a refusal to accept her as a legitimate citizen. And as Berry pointed out, Kennedy's behavior underscored exactly why hate crimes are a problem in America -- too many Americans fall prey to the fallacy of generalizing about marginalized identities and vilifying them.

Lastly, Kennedy's rhetoric was a reminder of how many supporters of Israel in Washington will conflate any kind of support for Palestinians' dignity -- in this case, funding for UNRWA -- with antisemitism. These smear campaigns are intended to discourage criticism of Israel through ad hominem attacks.

Berry went before the Senate to discuss the important issue of hate crimes, only to receive a torrent of abuse. She should be commended for her sensitivity to how those crimes take a toll on people from all kinds of marginalized communities. And it is Kennedy, not Berry, who should hide his head for such a vile expression of hate."
"Another wave of blasts hits Lebanon, as Hezbollah reels from pager explosions",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/g-s1-23577/pagers-devices-explode-hezbollah-lebanon-israel,2024-09-18T18:20:57Z,"BEIRUT, Lebanon, and TEL AVIV, Israel -- A fresh wave of explosions in communications devices struck in Lebanon on Wednesday, leaving 14 people dead and 450 wounded, according to Lebanese health officials.

The new explosions took place barely 24 hours after the near-synchronized pager blasts on Tuesday that left 12 people dead and nearly 3,000 injured in Lebanon and parts of Syria.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke on Wednesday about ""excellent achievements"" by Israel's military and intelligence branches leading to ""impressive results,"" but without mentioning device attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday.

""We are at the beginning of a new era in this war,"" Gallant said, adding that the ""center of gravity is moving north.""

The latest incident came as the Lebanese militia Hezbollah vowed that Israel will face punishment for Tuesday's attacks, further raising fears among analysts that the region may be pushed to an all-out war that the United States has been trying to prevent.

Israel has not explicitly taken responsibility for this week's attacks on Hezbollah's communications devices. But a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters, told NPR that Israel notified Washington that it had carried out Tuesday's attacks.

Even before this week's blasts that injured and claimed the lives of the Hezbollah militia's operatives, the group had already feared spying on its digital devices.

From his hideout somewhere in Lebanon, its leader Hassan Nasrallah in February warned his followers: Get rid of your cellphones.

""Please break it, bury it, lock it up in a metal box,"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech then. ""Do it for a week, two weeks, a month ... these are deadly spies.""

Fearing that Israeli intelligence had infiltrated Hezbollah's communications, Hezbollah officials adopted old-fashioned handheld beepers, security experts say.

A second wave of explosions of wireless devices ripped through Beirut on Wednesday afternoon, including at a funeral for Hezbollah members and a child killed in Tuesday's bombings, Hezbollah said.

A day after the Hamas-led attack on Israel last Oct. 7, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia began firing rockets across the Lebanese border into northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas. Israel has since regularly targeted Hezbollah militants and weapons stockpiles, as the two sides trade attacks daily.

Between January and February, Hezbollah stopped using smartphones and adopted pagers to avoid Israeli surveillance, said Amer Al Sabaileh, a Jordanian geopolitical analyst and security expert with contacts inside Hezbollah.

""It's not limited just for specific cells inside Hezbollah. It started to be the common method of communication,"" Al Sabaileh said.

Hezbollah handed these pagers out among its militant operatives as well as its civilian functionaries, the group told NPR. Four health care workers including one working at a Hezbollah-affiliated hospital, an 8-year-old girl and 11-year-old boy were among those killed, Lebanon's acting health minister said. Hezbollah is a political party in Lebanon as well as an armed militia.

In the days leading up to Tuesday's pagers operation, Israel's leadership had publicly warned that only military action could stop Hezbollah's attacks and allow Israeli civilians to return to their homes near the Lebanese border.

Some Israeli columnists praised the explosions as an operational success, but reported that Israel had not originally planned to detonate the devices now but did so out of concern that information might leak and compromise the mission.

""Officials in Jerusalem, within the defense establishment, and several experts, argue that the current timing should be leveraged to launch a comprehensive campaign in Lebanon,"" wrote veteran war correspondent Ron Ben-Yishay on the Israeli news site Ynet. ""This campaign could destroy a significant portion of Hezbollah's missile and other capabilities, acquired with Iranian assistance, which pose a serious threat to Israel's home front.""

The strike also drew domestic criticism.

""Israel might be dreaming of reestablishing a 'security zone' in Lebanon, or replicating the 'perimeter' tactic -- creating a buffer zone around the Gaza Strip -- to push back the threat,"" wrote columnist Zvi Bar'el in the left-leaning Haaretz. ""This would imply a long-term occupation inside Lebanon, repeating the same mistake and expecting different results.""

Hezbollah has vowed Israel will face punishment for the attacks. It has not specified what form that punishment could take. But the group's capacity to initiate an all-out war has been severely limited, security experts say.

Hezbollah's communications have been hijacked. Thousands of operatives and functionaries are wounded. And there is likely deep suspicion within the group's ranks that could spark internal probes into who may have collaborated with Israel to booby-trap the pagers and other devices.

""You cannot go to war while your house is not protected,"" Al Sabaileh said. ""You don't know the level of infiltration, and what next surprise Israel is preparing for you, and this means that going to war in such conditions might be a suicide recipe for Hezbollah.""

Iran, whose ambassador to Lebanon was wounded in Tuesday's pager attack, may be motivated to retaliate against Israel following the explosions targeting its Lebanese proxy, especially because it has yet to avenge a July 31 bombing that killed Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh in his guest room in the Iranian capital.

""The Iranians are still talking about retaliating after the elimination of Haniyeh,"" said Orna Mizrahi, a Hezbollah watcher and senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. ""The Iranians may have a bigger appetite to do something after this action."""
Israel degrades Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists in spectacular pager explosion operation: Experts,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-degrades-iran-backed-hezbollah-terrorists-spectacular-pager-explosion-operation-experts,2024-09-18T16:51:08Z,"JERUSALEM - The Jewish state's James Bond-style alleged hack attack on Tuesday that caused explosions of handheld pagers carried by thousands of members of the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah was a devastating setback for the Lebanon-based organization.

Fox News Digital spoke to leading U.S. and Israeli experts about the setback for the Iranian regime proxy.

According to a Reuters report, Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, planted explosives inside of 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations that killed nine people, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters.

ISRAEL WAS BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS, AS NEW BLASTS REPORTED

The Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah organization switched from mobile phones to pagers to prevent Israeli interception of their communications. Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel a day after the Gaza-based terrorist movement invaded the Jewish state on Oct. 7.

Walid Phares, a leading U.S. expert on Lebanon and Hezbollah, told Fox News Digital that the reported Israeli operation, ""is certainly a strike against Hezbollah's national security apparatus. We are talking about thousands and thousands of individuals who are at the heart of the security force of Hezbollah, who are, according to sources we know, in charge of manning many things. One is the missile force.""

Hezbollah is estimated to have over 150,000 missiles aimed at Israel. The de facto ruler of Lebanon, Hezbollah, has amassed new sophisticated missiles, rockets and drones since its 2006 war against Israel. Hezbollah has launched more than 7,500 missiles, rockets, and drones into Israel since Oct. 8.

One Hezbollah official said the detonation of the pagers was the group's ""biggest security breach"" since the Gaza conflict began.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

Phares added that the ""Israeli electronic bomb"" operation also degraded many Hezbollah special forces, commandos, electronic forces, and internal security and intelligence apparatus members. He warned, however, that Hezbollah would eventually recover.

Phares noted that Israel's strike ""weakened the image of Hezbollah within the Lebanese population."" He said the psychological benefits of the strike have showed that the Lebanese are now convinced that Hezbollah ""can eventually be defeated"" and its ""grip on Lebanon"" can be weakened.

He said the Israeli cyber strike could also encourage opposition among Sunnis, Druze and Christians to mobilize against the Shi'ite Hezbollah organization.

ISRAEL STRUCK BY LONG-RANGE MISSILE FROM YEMEN, 40 PROJECTILES FROM LEBANON IN EARLY MORNING ATTACKS

An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman was tight-lipped when Fox News Digital approached him for a comment. Israel frequently retains a policy of deliberate ambiguity about high-profile attacks on its enemies. The Israeli government's policy is to neither confirm nor deny spectacular assassinations or other covert operations. A senior U.S. official later confirmed that Israel was behind the attack, but Israel has yet to do so.

The alleged Mossad operation, with a trail running from Taiwan to Budapest, was an unprecedented Hezbollah security breach that saw thousands of pagers explode across Lebanon, wounding some 2,500 people, including many of the group's fighters and Iran's envoy to Beirut.

Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that ""the resistance will continue today, like any other day, its operations to support Gaza, its people and its resistance, which is a separate path from the harsh punishment that the criminal enemy (Israel) should await in response to Tuesday's massacre.""

Jonathan Conricus, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that ""Beyond shock and humiliation, the immediate impact on Hezbollah is not yet clear, neither are the Iranian terror proxy's intentions to retaliate. While the pager attack was a brilliant tactical success unlike anything previously accomplished against a terror organization during combat, the strategic benefits of this tremendous move are limited, if not supplemented with swift Israeli action against Hezbollah as it reels from the shock of impact.""

Conricus, a former IDF spokesman, continued. ""It seems that this action was more aimed at softening Hezbollah to agree to a war-avoiding diplomatic solution, and less as a preamble of an Israeli offensive. Israel's main focus remains to facilitate the safe return home of almost one hundred thousand Israelis displaced by Hezbollah attacks for over 11 months. If the pager operation brings this about, then it will have been worth the risk. If not, it will be added to a long list of Israeli tactical successes that were not complemented by strategic thought and action.""

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

Israel's Mossad has garnered a worldwide reputation as one of the most formidable intelligence agencies. Within the last two months, Israel reportedly killed Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah terrorist in Beirut, eliminated the Hamas terrorist leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and its special forces raided an Iranian weapons facility in the Masyaf area in Syria.

Nadav Eyal, a prominent Israeli columnist for the large Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth, told Fox News Digital that while Israel has not claimed responsibility for the operation, ""This will be remembered as one of the most brilliant Israeli intelligence operations ever. It is a substantially meticulous operation.""

Eyal continued, ""This is a very effective operation if you want to restore deterrence in the region. Israel's major strategic problem in the region that it has lost its deterrent force, deterring its enemies from attacking it. Hamas attacked on October 7. Hezbollah attacked Israel on October 8. Iran attacked Israel in April. All of these parties, together with the Houthis, are not deterred.""

The Israeli military expert added, ""By these kinds of operations Israel is really showing those different forces what it can do. And it has done also in its response to the Iranian aerial assault back in April. It's showing them it can operate in ways and means that they did not anticipate. Whether or not it is effective in the long run, we need to see.""

He noted, ""Israel has been preparing for the war in the north with Hezbollah since 2007. These have been 17 years of Israeli preparations... Israel has not been preparing for an invasion of Hamas.""

""We need to push Hezbollah out of south Lebanon and hit their capabilities,"" IDF Reserve Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi told Fox News Digital.

Avivi, the founder and chairman of Israel's Defense and Security Forum, added that while Israel did not take responsibility for the attack in Lebanon on Tuesday, ""This is the first step in really moving the center of gravity from Gaza to Lebanon. In my opinion, war is imminent. We will have to hit Hezbollah and we will have to do a ground incursion. We cannot have Hezbollah on our borders. Israel is sending a very, very strong message. We have knowledge and capabilities. We know everything about Hezbollah and Iran. If they do not retreat, the end game is clear: Hezbollah is going to be destroyed in south Lebanon."""
Book Review: George Gilder's Excellent and Crucial 'The Israel Test',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/09/18/book-review-george-gilders-excellent-and-crucial-the-israel-test/,2024-09-18T16:03:56Z,"Without defending some (or a lot) of its anti-growth economic policies, the easily-forgotten truth is that California is by far the most enterprising, entrepreneurial state in the most enterprising, entrepreneurial country in the world. Evidence supporting the previous claim can be found in the fact that 60% of the world's venture capital investment annually flows to startups based in California, not to mention that if the Golden State were a country, it could lay claim to being the world's 4 largest economy. When conservatives oddly politicize what booms as a ""basket case"" (and other pejoratives like it), they shrink themselves.

The great George Gilder has long recognized the herculean genius of California's entrepreneurs, along with that of the remarkable investors who match west coast genius with capital. As he observed in his spectacular 2023 book Life After Capitalism, it's not just the economic activity taking place within California that people should marvel at, it's the surges in productivity that California-based innovation has long made possible outside the state. California is decidedly not an economic basket case, but the world economy would most certainly be a basket case without California.

Gilder's past insights came to mind quite a bit while reading his highly informative, excellent and crucial new book, The Israel Test: How Israel's Genius Enriches and Challenges the World. This essential read gives life to Gilder's assertions about California's economic impact on the world, an impact that is very much informed by technology and financial sectors well populated by Jews.

For those who don't know why California thrives despite certain policies normally inimical to success, they'll understand better from The Israel Test. As Gilder makes plain on the book's very first page, ""we Americans still face our Israel Test, our humbling need to not only recognize our dependence on the genius of the Jews in the United States, but also to acknowledge our reliance not only for innovation but even for our national security on this diminutive and embattled Middle Eastern ally."" While the focus of The Israel Test is not California, what's apparent is that Israel, like California with its sizable Jewish population, is similarly instrumental to global economic health and security. Yes, it's increasingly true that the world economy would be a basket case without Israel.

In Gilder's words, ""Planetary prosperity depends on the outsized genius of a tiny minority of human beings."" More and more of this ""vital few"" (HT: Reuven Brenner) talent resides in Israel. Which is the purpose of Gilder's book, one that should (and hopefully will) attain a large global audience. Particularly as Israel's enemies spew hideous rhetoric of the ""river to the sea"" variety, those who know better need to understand that the words aren't just ugly, not just sickeningly inhumane if acted upon, they would also be globally disastrous economically.

Looked at through a U.S. economic prism alone, Gilder writes that ""most of America's preeminent technology companies"" along with its healthcare giants ""still depend on crucial inventors, engineers, intellectual prosperity, and laboratories in Israel."" Considering our military planes like the F-16, numerous inputs for the latter are crafted in Israel. Assuming an all-out missile attack on the United States, Gilder asserts that ""Israeli technology will be the reason we likely survive it."" Despite this, the country suffers an ""insidious spate of abusive nonsense detailing the alleged flaws - indeed the sins - of Israel.""

What's odd is that the abusive nonsense directed at Israel frequently originates in the United States. Odder still, as Gilder conveys through brilliant Israeli entrepreneurs like Shaul Olmert (son of Ehud, former prime minister), is how much of the criticism of the country comes from Israelis themselves. Gilder laments that Jewish outperformance isn't just financial, technological and cultural, that the Jews ""outperform all rivals even in the arena of anti-Semitism.""

Looking at the U.S. alone, Gilder is of the view that ""the United States has all too often failed the Israel Test"" through its perception of ""Israeli power, prosperity, culture, genius, and self-defense as a problem rather than a supreme global asset."" And a global asset it is. At the same time, it requires stress just how much of a local asset Israel is.

Gilder writes that before the Jews returned to Israel (1/6 of 1 percent of the total Middle East land mass), the land ""scarcely counted as a desirable asset or a prize to be awarded to anyone before the Jews reclaimed it and made its economy valuable and its land capable of supporting life."" And it was surely not desired by Arabs who now make pushing the Jews into the sea from this tiny bit of land their modern raison d'etre. Major evidence required to make this claim can be found in what the land surrounding Israel looks like now, not to mention what Israel would look like if the Jews departed or were pushed out.

Which explains Gilder's assertion that contra all the rhetoric about ""occupation"" and forced ""settlements,"" the ""Jews were not occupying a nation,"" rather ""they were building one."" What they built has proven rather appealing to non-Jews, including Arabs. Gilder notes that ""Arabs flourish in Israel as they do nowhere else.""At present, ""Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank accommodate some 5.5 million Arabs, with a population density ten times that of Jordan."" Human migration is the purest market signal of them all, and the migration of Arabs into and around Israel signals the soaring economic opportunity that reveals itself wherever the commercially skillful take their talents. Genius, per Gilder, is ""a source of wealth and opportunity for all.""

Which raises obvious responses to the frequent critiques of Jews and their ""settlements."" To say these movements are negatives is like saying it would harm a limping U.S. neighborhood if well-to-do, upright neighbors moved in, or that a business district would be harmed if a McDonald's, Whole Foods, or Apple Store showed up. Obviously not. Where prosperous people and businesses go, other thriving businesses and people frequently follow. Where the Jews go, vast improvement follows. Gilder writes this in more of a protective sense for Israel from guns and bombs, but when he writes that ""Israel is not too large but too small,"" it's easy to apply the previous assertion to the wellbeing of the non-Jews in the region not fortunate enough to live in Israel.

Sadly, this view is not shared by Hamas, Hezbollah, the PA, and a myriad of other entities that have directed so much ugly rhetoric, violence and murder at Israel and its people. Even though the Jews have made enormously desirable what formerly wasn't, Hamas et al obviously want the land back. Or do they? Considering the look of the lands abutting Israel, what a disaster for the various terrorists groups if the Israelis were to pull an Atlas Shrugged of sorts and leave.

For now, Hamas and other terrorist organizations like it somehow frame Israel's prosperous, world-enhancing existence as the problem for the region. Worse, they get help not just from Israel's critics, but also its defenders. Gilder writes that ""the central error of Israel's defenders is to accept the framing of the debate by its enemies, whose idea is that peace depends on some marginal but perpetually elusive improvement in Israel's behavior."" Which is something to think about given the Arab population within Israel itself.

While the Israelis live next to Arabs and Christians within Israel, while Arabs and Christians serve in the Knesset, Gilder notes that ""the dispute over the settlements is an argument over whether Jews may reasonably expect to be permitted to live among Arabs anywhere."" Not now, it seems. It's accepted as a ""natural right"" of Palestinians ""to be squeamish about living anywhere near Jews.""

It brings us to the why (or the presumed why) behind the hatred. Religion doesn't seem to suffice, which means it's difficult to countenance the belief of some that ""The Jew carries the burden of God in history [and] for this has never been forgiven."" Gilder references the latter as a good summation of what Joseph Telushkin and Dennis Prager (Prager writes the foreword to The Israel Test) believe, but it didn't ring true and Gilder says as much. Such a view ascribes thought that's hard to find behind all the hatred.

More compelling is the explanation offered by Russian writer Maxim Gorky (and cited by Gilder) that anti-semites ""dislike the Jew only because he is obviously better, more adroit, and more capable of work than they are."" Gilder seems to agree with Gorky. He writes that ""The source of anti-Semitism is Jewish superiority and excellence."" Gilder and Gorky are difficult to argue with, but as Gilder himself notes, Israeli prosperity within Israel has been a magnet for Arabs. Which is important to stop and think about.

Bringing California back into the discussion, it's an undeniable fact that the Jews largely created a film industry that has lured millions west over the decades. More modernly, the technology industry that is heavily populated by Jews similarly exists as a major lure for non-Jews. Perhaps oddest of all, consider how Iranians and Jews live peacefully around each other in Beverly Hills at the same time that Iran the country is very public about its desire to destroy Israel.

It's all a long way of saying it reads as perhaps a little too simplistic to say as Israeli journalist (cited by Gilder) Caroline Glick does, that ""The enviers hate Israel."" There's got to be something more? The view here is that it's rooted in a lack of freedom. Where people are free to live and work as they wish, all the while broadly free of the excessive tax, regulatory, trade, and monetary barriers to production, they prosper alongside the Jews all the while recognizing how much they gain from getting to work alongside such remarkable talent. Again, Jewish prosperity is a magnet for much bigger populations that aren't Jewish.

It brings to mind a question once asked of an old boss: why was Hollywood giant Lew Wasserman so greatly revered? What was it about him? The reply was that Wasserman was ""Michael Jordan"" in the film industry. He made everyone better around him. The desire to be better resides within us all, but when government gets in the way with policy errors that limit the human ability to prosper, those most capable of outrunning government error are scapegoated.

Considering the above argument through the prism of the United States, no doubt there's anti-Semitism in the U.S. But arguably a major reason it's not nearly as evident in the U.S. has to do with all the immense economic opportunity that exists stateside. Contrast this with Germany and the Holocaust. It's seriously hard to imagine that Hitler ever attains power absent the gruesome devaluation of the mark in the aftermath of WWI that robbed so many of all that they'd worked for.

Where people are prospering, they don't have time nor the inclination for racist or murderous thoughts, nor do they seek scapegoats. As in, if the world were freer and by extension more unequal (in a free society genius is rewarded the most) and prosperous, the bet here is that anti-Semitism and its frequently murderous offshoots would be much less evident. This viewpoint shouldn't be construed as an attempt to excuse hideous, frequently gruesome behavior, but it is to say that prospering people are happier and less violent. Freedom is the fix for so much in the world, including anti-Semitism.

Conversely, opportunity suffocated unleashes anger and the desire for scapegoats. History is clear that Jews are routinely the scapegoated, and particularly because they've proven more capable of overcoming barriers to prosperity erected by governments. Gilder references Jewish fortitude with his discussion of what happened to the former Soviet Union under Gorbachev when ""the bulk of Soviet Jews"" were released. He describes what subsequently unfolded as the economic equivalent of ""a frontal lobotomy"" for the U.S.S.R. Yes, even where there was little to no freedom to prosper, Soviet Jews managed to prosper in a relative sense as Anya Gillinson anecdotally notes in her excellent new memoir, Dreaming In Russian.

It further speaks to the economic boom taking place in Israel now. The Soviet Union's loss was the world's gain; that, or parts of the world gained immeasurably from the unshackling of so much talent. Gilder writes that ""the most precious resource in the world economy is human genius,"" and a substantial portion of the Soviet Jews found their way to Israel once freed from the Soviet Union. Getting more specific, Gilder writes that ""immigrants from the Soviet Union constitute fully half of Israel's high-tech workers,"" and that VC outlays in Israel soared ""nearly sixty-fold from $58 million to $3.3 billion"" between 1991 and 2000 subsequent to their arrival. This looms large in consideration of the fact that ""Israel has become a center of innovation second in absolute achievement only to the United States."" Stop and think about it.

In thinking about what the Soviet Union (or Russia) lost in concert with Israel's gain, think back to the needless Cold War. Leaving aside the U.S.'s arms buildup, Ronald Reagan's much greater insight, one that Gilder doubtless helped Reagan arrive at, was that economically, culturally and personally unfree people would be no match for free people and the fruits of their freedom. No argument there, but stop and contemplate if Gorbachev (and those who came before him) had recognized the towering genius that was within the U.S.S.R./Russia all along. Russia quite simply had the people to be a global economic (and military) powerhouse if they'd just set the genius residing with Russia's borders free. It staggers the mind.

Lest we forget, Gilder believes deeply in a tee-shirt slogan spotted by his editor (Richard Vigilante) during an Israel visit, and which said ""Don't Worry America, Israel Is Behind You."" As he sees it, both the U.S. economy and its military would be substantially reduced without the existence of the same Israel that's been so profoundly lifted economically and militarily by Jews from the former Soviet Union. It's a long way of saying that when Vladimir Putin claims the collapse of the Soviet empire ""was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,"" he's engaging in non sequitur. More realistically, the Soviet Union's or Russia's failure of its own Israel Test was right up there among the biggest Russian tragedies.

As for greatest catastrophe of the century, geopolitical or economic, it would have to be World War II whereby so much of the world's genius was tragically exterminated. About this mass slaughter of Jews, Gilder is so very correct with his assertion that ""the rest of the world has suffered even more in absolute terms by the loss of the vast potential of the six million Jewish victims whose only sin was being Jewish on the European continent in the twentieth century."" About Gilder's oh-so-correct statement, one that he in no way wrote to minimize the suffering of Jews, let's please allow it to exist as yet another indictment of a profession (economics) that makes astrology appear serious by comparison, and whose PhDs assert near-monolithically that the upside of World War II was that it ended the Great Depression.

It would be difficult to find a sicker and more ferociously obtuse viewpoint than the one held by the vast majority of ""trained economists"" about WWII's (and war in general) allegedly positive growth implications. Nothing could be further from the truth, or more dangerous. As Gilder makes plain, ""no one can be rich alone."" Oh well, according to economists Gilder is incorrect. So deluded are they by the GDP ""gains ""achieved via killing, maiming, wealth destruction, and the rebuilding of wealth destroyed, that they've somehow come to the conclusion that the latter ended the Great Depression, after which American producers were allegedly rendered better off by a supine Europe suddenly bereft of its vital few. Worse is that economists have spread their tragic misunderstanding of prosperity to high-level thinkers like Yuval Levin and Edward Conard at American Enterprise Institute who claim that what makes the 1950s so attractive to nostalgic Americans is that so much of the rest of the was destroyed. Adam Smith is no doubt looking down mystified.

What happened in Europe alone doesn't just indict an economics profession that embarrasses itself in all sorts of ways all day and every day (those same economists also believe economic growth causes inflation), it also to some degree exposes American conservatism as less serious than its practitioners would like to believe. Think ""Eurosclerosis"" and the various pejoratives lobbed at Europe by conservatives in similar fashion to how they denigrate California. According to conservatives, the biggest driver of ""Eurosclerosis"" is excessive rates of taxation that deaden the incentive to work.

About the good of lowering taxes all and every way possible, no argument against will be made here. Taxes are a price, or a penalty placed on work and investment. At the same time, conservatives shrink themselves yet again when they ascribe Europe's relative lack of prosperity to ""tax rates."" What has Europe less prosperous was anti-Semitism that revealed itself in the most murderous of ways. Absent it, stop and think how rich Europe would be today, and by extension how much better off the world would be.

Quoting Gilder the same way but a second time, ""the most precious resources in the world economy is human genius."" It lifts us all, only for sickening envy (Gilder, Gorky, Glick) or a lack of freedom (Tamny, surely many others) to reveal itself occasionally in the form of anti-Semitism that shrinks the portion of the population most crucial to cultural, health, and economic progress.

What Gilder believes about the importance of the individually brilliant brought to mind quibbles on occasion. In particular, his chapter about Benjamin Netanyahu as the man that propelled Israel ""into the modern world of finance"" wasn't as compelling as the book's many other arguments. For one, capital always and everywhere finds genius as Gilder's own VC stats for Israel (a sixty-fold increase between 1991 and 2000) indicate. For two, the previous surge was per Gilder himself a function of the arrival of brilliant Soviet Jewry.

This isn't to say that Nethanyahu didn't bring better, more pro-growth policies to Israel. If Gilder says he did, than he did. At the same time, and as overtaxed and over-governed locales like California and New York remind us, talent trumps policy by many miles.

More on Netanyahu, the book plainly went to print before the tragedy of October 7, 2023. No expert on Israel (I've never even visited), isn't the primary job of the prime minister in Israel to protect the people from the many terrorists who mean it the worst of harm? If Netanyahu is so heroic, doesn't he deserve the slings and arrows of the present, and much, much more?

Which leads to another quibble with Gilder's analysis. He writes that anti-Zionists view Israel as a mistake because of ""discrimination against Arabs, sorely maldistributed wealth and income, a runaway engine of west bank settlements that represent an imperial 'occupation,'"" etc. Maybe that's the consensus view, but my problem with Israel is that as presently constituted, it places the most brilliant people on earth directly in harm's way.

The above had me wanting to ask Gilder while reading his spectacular book if Israel itself passes the Israel Test? By Gilder's own estimation, many of the best and brightest within Israel share the negative views of the country held by some of its most ardent critics. That being the case, how can it survive? This is important precisely given Gilder's own assertion that ""no nation is more important to the survival of the United States and the world than Israel."" If true, or even if not true, is Israel itself passing the Israel Test?

About this question, in the aftermath of 10/7 I found myself arguing with Jewish friends that Israel must cease wasting Israeli lives on these wars. What is gained? Gilder argues that ""conspicuous weakness is a prime cause of war,"" and that's long been the right's consensus, but what good did the latter do the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan, and seriously, what good has it done Israel? Its military superiority well established time after time (think 1948, 1967, 1973, and many times since), the killers keep coming.

Back to the argument made, I wanted Netanyahu to not respond, to let the hideous videos of heinous Hamas acts travel around the world in concert with intense quiet from Israel. I then wanted Netanyahu to announce that there would be no invasion of Gaza given an aversion to wasting even one more precious Israeli life on a war that never ends. That instead, Israel had hired the Wagner Group to man the country's borders. If the Arabs can't be asked to live among Jews, they would henceforth no longer be allowed to work with Jews inside Israel. In concert with the arrival of Wagner, a wall would be built with the money saved by not going to war yet again with people who value life much less than the Jews do.

None of what's been written is meant as yet another apology for Israel's alleged mis-behavior. Not at all. At the same time, it's a stab at what your reviewer imagines to be realism: the Arabs will never give up. Since they won't, it's time to put to bed the right's mantra about ""conspicuous weakness"" as the ""prime cause of war."" Let's replace it with government is always and everywhere incompetent, and governments are populated with too many people too eager to go to war. It's not working.

Beyond that, by Gilder's own admission Israel is heavily populated with Shaul Olmert-types who are remarkably brilliant, but who are uncomfortable with Israel vis-à-vis those who surround it and who mean it harm. The mention of Olmert once again isn't an expression of agreement with him, but it's a comment that he arguably represents a growing portion of the Israeli population eager to innovate over engage in endless war. Though militarily quite skillful, the Jews aren't a warring people, period. Worse, they're up against people with less to live for, and who are seemingly willing to wait them out.

Three quarters of the way through The Israel Test, Gilder cites a speech given by Nobel Prize winning Israeli game theorist, Robert Aumann. At a presentation of his that Gilder attended in Toronto, Aumann observed that, ""over history many peoples have been expelled from their homes. Only the Jews have been expelling themselves, their own people. From their own homes and synagogues, towns and farms. From Sinai, from Gaza, from the West Bank, from Jerusalem, only the Jews."" Aumann's observation is the counter to the assertion that the Israelis should just take their genius elsewhere, and far away from the Arabs. Aumann makes a hard-to-argue-with case that the Jews have been compromising for way too long, and it's beyond wrong to ask them to move again.

At the same time, and per Gilder, ""if the Arabas or Iranians desired peace, they would have long ago achieved it."" Absolutely. Which is telling. Peace isn't the goal, and it's something to keep well in mind in concert with Gilder's correct assertion that ""the survival of the Jews is vital to the triumph of free economies."" In that very real sense, it's difficult to conclude from this remarkable book anything other than that the United States and Israel are failing The Israel Test, and that their ongoing failure threatens the rest of the free world."
"Cruz interrupted by anti-Israel agitator who yelled, 'F---ing Jews' during hearing on 'hate'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cruz-interrupted-anti-israel-agitator-who-yelled-f-jews-during-hearing-hate,2024-09-18T15:59:04Z,"An anti-Israel agitator was escorted out of a congressional hearing on ""hate"" after yelling ""f---ing Jews"" at Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, while he spoke about antisemitism on college campuses.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was interrupted during a congressional hearing dedicated to discussing ""hate"" on Tuesday by an anti-Israel agitator who stood up shouting ""F---ing Jews.""

During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled, ""A Threat to Justice Everywhere: Stemming the Tide of Hate Crimes in America,"" Cruz discussed soaring antisemitism on college campuses in the wake of Oct. 7.

""Antisemitism is a unique, historic form of evil, and over millennia, it is manifested in violence, mass murder and genocide,"" Cruz said. ""October 7th was one of the darkest days in human history when terrorists murdered over 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostages. Women and girls were raped. It was the single largest mass murder of Jews in a day since the Holocaust. In the wake of October 7th, we have seen antisemitism explode across the United States and across the world, but especially on college campuses.""

After listing examples of antisemitic and pro-Hamas messages hurled toward Jewish students, Cruz called out the Biden-Harris administration.

COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS TO REACH 'CRESCENDO OF INTIMIDATION' AS SCHOOL SUFFERS LATEST BLACK EYE

""Throughout all of this, the Biden-Harris administration has been utterly absent. Does anyone doubt if the Klan were on college campuses terrorizing African American students, threatening African American students, that we would see the FBI there, that we would see prosecutors there, that we would see federal funding cut off to universities? Of course we would. And we should,"" Cruz said. ""But when it comes to antisemitism, the Democrats have a problem. I would note this is occurring in blue states with blue governors, because the Democrat Party is terrified of the pro-Hamas wing of their party.""

""In states like Texas and Florida, we don't allow this. At the University of Texas, when violent protests threatened Jewish students, police officers arrived and arrested them. That's what happened when you enforce the law,"" Cruz continued. ""Every Republican member of this committee asked the chairman to hold a hearing on antisemitism in February. And yet we don't get a hearing on antisemitism. We get a hearing generically on hate.""

Cruz was about to explain why he believes the Biden administration is to blame for this, when a man in the audience stood up and interjected, shouting profanities including ""F---ing Jews,"" according to video on social media. The anti-Israel agitator was then escorted out.

""And this is the kind of anger and hate that is encouraged. You're now seeing the hate manifesting right here,"" Cruz said, referencing the protester.

""So we now have a demonstration of antisemitism. We have a demonstration of the hate,"" he added.

Cruz proceeded to ask one of the witnesses, Mark Goldfeder, director of the National Jewish Advocacy Center, ""Has the Biden administration cut off the funding of any of the colleges that have allowed this hate? Have they indicted anyone for funding these violent protests? Have they indicted the people paying for the matching tents, or have they sat there silently and have the universities, sat there silently while their students are terrified to go to class?""

Goldfeder responded, ""They have not indicted anyone.""

""Has any university had their funding cut off for allowing this sort of violent intimidation?"" Cruz asked.

""Not a single university,"" Goldfeder said.

The senator earlier referenced how the Anti-Defamation League has illustrated how the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States more than doubled from 2022 to 2023.

ACTRESS SELMA BLAIR CONDEMNS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS 'PRAISING' HAMAS TERRORISTS: 'SOMETHING VERY WRONG'

Cruz said that ""college campuses in particular have become vile incubators of hatred of Jews,"" citing examples of how one Cornell University student made threats after Oct. 7, including statements such as ""if I see a pig, male Jew, I will stab you and slit your throat. If I see another pig female Jew, I will drag you away and rape you and throw you off a cliff.""

The Republican senator displayed a flier circulated by a student organization at California State University, Long Beach, calling for a ""Day of Resistance"" celebrating Oct. 7, noting how the flier included an image of a person parachuting with a fan attached, ""a direct reference to and a glorification of Hamas terrorists that used gliders to descend upon a music festival and murder 260 innocent people and take many more hostages.""

Cruz recalled that in the days after now-former Columbia University President Minouche Shafik was confronted about soaring antisemitism on campus before the House Education and the Workforce Committee in April, Rabbi Elie Buechler issued a warning to Jewish students that Columbia ""cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,"" and that he ""would strongly recommend"" that Jewish students leave campus and go back to their homes.

Cruz said the rabbi ""had every reason to be concerned,"" as at Columbia's campus, individuals yelled, ""We're all Hamas! Long live Hamas!""

The senator continued to list examples of antisemitism on campuses across the U.S., including the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor who was told to ""go back to the gas chambers,"" and displayed a photo of a student at Columbia University holding a sign reading ""al-Qassam's next targets,"" in front of a group of students holding American and Israeli flags in counter-protest.

""Al-Qassam is the military arm of Hamas. According to social media, this particular student is a wealthy student from Georgia. She's not Palestinian, but she has been taught lies and hatred, and she feels perfectly comfortable advocating the murder of her fellow students at Columbia,"" Cruz said."
"Newt Gingrich sounds off on Kamala Harris' 'word salad' interviews, 'insane' position on Israel-Hamas",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/newt-gingrich-sounds-off-kamala-harris-word-salad-interviews-insane-position-israel-hamas,2024-09-18T15:37:21Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her campaign blitz, but a series of 'word salad' interviews have some pundits skeptical if she can sway enough undecided voters. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned on ""Hannity"" Tuesday that the new interviews have become a ""joke,"" stressing the ""insanity"" of Harris' position on the Israel-Hamas war.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

NEWT GINGRICH: The American people aren't stupid. In the recent interviews, for example, with undecided voters, overwhelmingly they believe she's much more radical than Donald Trump. ... They identify her with Biden and the Biden administration so overwhelmingly, they think that she is the candidate of the past and Trump is a candidate of change, by about three-and-a-half to one. Americans want change in current policies, not continuity. Part of this may be psychological and she may not be capable of uttering a clear, coherent policy position. But whatever the reason, the more we get these word salads, the more obvious it is that she either doesn't know what she's saying or she can't articulate it, or she's trying to hide. These things all hurt her. This interview today did not help her at all. The interview in Philadelphia on the local TV station became a joke. I mean, people thought it was absurd.

If you just watch her, it's the same stuff over and over. The things she's memorized have nothing to do with the real world. And I particularly want to point out, at one point in this interview, she talks about we have to get to a truce in Gaza and release the hostages. Now, there are two problems. The first is she is the vice president. They've had 11 months to get to this truce. 11 months. They've gotten nowhere. There's no reason to believe she'd get anywhere if she was president. Why? Because the founding constitution of Hamas says not a single Jew will remain. And when people chant 'from the river to the sea,' they're chanting genocide fully as much as the Nazi Germans were about Jews in Europe. These college students need to understand that. That's a genocidal quote that Hamas means to either massacre or evict every single Jew in Israel. So her fantasy that somehow she's going to sit down with Hamas, talk reasonably with them, get them to agree to something plausible, this is insanity. This is totally out of touch with the real world.

Vice President Kamala Harris has had numerous 'word salad' interviews during her time in office. Although her campaign has been marked by few media appearances, she had her first solo interview with the national media Tuesday.

Harris spoke to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Philadelphia, about a month after former President Trump spoke to the same group and made waves when he questioned Harris' race.

CBS REPORTER FINDS ONLY 3 HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN 3 NEVADA RESTAURANTS: 'PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TRUMP'

Beyond race-focused topics, the interview included remarks from Harris about her economic plan, abortion, support for Israel and gun control.

Later, the moderators turned to the second assassination attempt made on Trump's life over the weekend. Harris indicated that she spoke to Trump after the close call to check on him.

Harris was asked a follow-up question about her confidence in the Secret Service to protect her, with Harris responding in the affirmative.

""Not everybody has Secret Service. And there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,"" she said. ""I mean, I look at Project 2025, and I look at, you know, the Don't Say Gay laws coming out of Florida. Members of the LGBTQ community don't feel safe right now, immigrants or people with an immigrant background don't feel safe right now. Women don't feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection, but that doesn't change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country.""

"Hezbollah pagers that exploded were made in Hungary, Taiwanese company says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-pagers-exploded-were-made-hungary-taiwanese-company-says,2024-09-18T11:49:46Z,"WARNING: Graphic footage -- Fox News correspondent Nate Foy has the latest on the explosions on 'Special Report.'

Hundreds of pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria in an apparent operation targeting members of Hezbollah bore the brand of a Taiwanese company, though the firm's chair told reporters Wednesday that another company in Budapest manufactured the devices.

Near-simultaneous detonations of pagers used by members of the Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group killed at least 12 people, including two children, and wounded nearly 3,000 on Tuesday.

Taiwanese pager firm Gold Apollo said in a statement that the firm had licensed its AR-924 brand of pager to BAC Consulting KFT, based in Hungary's capital, and was not involved in the production.

""According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,"" the statement read.

LEBANON EXPLOSIONS: HEZBOLLAH APPARENTLY TARGETED AS PAGERS DETONATE, SEVERAL DEAD, THOUSANDS HURT

Gold Apollo chair Hsu Ching-kuang told reporters Wednesday that his company has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years, though he provided no evidence of the contract.

The pagers started heating up and exploding around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. The blasts were concentrated in areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon and in Damascus, Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official told the Associated Press.

Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told reporters Wednesday morning that many of the wounded had severe injuries to the eyes, and others had limbs amputated.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. The Israeli government has not commented.

Experts believe a sophisticated supply chain infiltration occurred, during which explosive material was secreted into the pagers prior to their delivery and use.

While it appeared that members of Hezbollah possessed many of the pagers that exploded, it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the pagers.

Hezbollah, which has pointed the blame at Israel, said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would continue its normal strikes against Israel ""as in all the past days"" as part of what it describes as a support front for its ally Hamas, and Palestinians in Gaza.

""This proposal introduced by the Palestinian delegation, ahead of the United Nations' General Assembly, is an absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism. It is a clear insult to the Jewish people and anyone who understands history,"" Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Vice Chairman Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a statement that was signed onto by 28 other Republicans.

A UN General Assembly vote is expected on the resolution on Wednesday, according to reports.

Attempts by the U.S. and neighboring Middle Eastern countries to facilitate a ceasefire agreement have yet to result in an end to the war.

""Instead of proposing biased and counter-productive initiatives, which will do nothing to advance a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the international community must focus its energy and resources on ensuring Hamas and other terrorist groups are completely destroyed,"" the GOP statement continued.

Hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah members exploded simultaneously. The group blamed Israel. Hussein Malla/AP/AP hide caption

Electronic pagers belonging to members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah exploded simultaneously on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least nine people and wounding around 2,800 across the Middle East nation. The method of attack was highly unusual, if not unprecedented, and raised the specter of an escalation in the Israel-Hezbollah fighting.

Lebanese government officials and Hezbollah blamed Israel and predicted the militant group would mount a strong response. Israel's military declined to comment, though its security forces have a history of carrying out tech-related attacks, such as exploding cell phones.

""After examining all the facts, available data and information about the heinous attack that took place this afternoon, we hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,"" Hezbollah said in a statement.

Many of the explosions rocked the southern suburbs of Beirut, the main Hezbollah stronghold. Videos on social media show a number of men going about daily business, when they are suddenly knocked to the ground by the force of the exploding pagers. Bystanders were also injured.

Ambulances rushed the wounded to hospitals, where they soon overwhelmed emergency rooms. While the largest number of casualties was in Beirut, there were also wounded in the north and the south of the country.

There was no immediate word on how such an attack was planned and executed.

In one widely circulated but unverified video, a man appears to check his pager just before it goes off, suggesting the explosion may have been triggered by an incoming message.

Online, some speculated that the batteries could have been made to somehow overheat. But Trevor Ball, a former explosive ordnance disposal technician for the U.S. Army said he believes that explosives must have been planted in the pagers.

""Based off the videos and pictures of the pagers, it appears that the pagers had a small amount of high explosives that were remotely initiated,"" Ball told NPR in a message. ""The widespread nature of the pagers exploding indicates that the supply chain of the pagers was compromised at some point.""

Hezbollah members began carrying pagers after the heavy fighting erupted with Israel almost a year ago. Hezbollah knows that Israel's security services are often able to hack into phone networks, and the Lebanese group thought the pagers would provide a more secure way to communicate.

Reports from Lebanon said Hezbollah recently received a new batch of imported pagers, which were being used to share information about possible Israeli drone strikes and other attacks.

After the explosions, which took place around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, the Ministry of Public Health told ""all citizens who own wireless communication devices stay away from them."" Hezbollah told all its member who recently received new pagers to throw them away.

Lebanon's health minister, Firas Abiad, said Tuesday evening that at least 2,800 people were injured. Most had wounds to the face, hands and mid-section, he said. Various media reports in Lebanon put the death toll at nine.

At the State Department, spokesman Matt Miller said the U.S. was not aware of the attack in advance and was still gathering information.

One U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that Israel informed the U.S. that it carried out the attack after it was over.

Hezbollah and Israel began trading cross-border rocket and missile fire almost immediately after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack last year on southern Israel. The level of fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has picked up recently, raising the possibility of a full-scale war."
Fetterman reams NY Times for platforming terrorist propaganda after interview with senior Hamas official,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-reams-ny-times-platforming-terrorist-propaganda-after-interview-senior-hamas-official,2024-09-17T20:12:28Z,"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., discusses the recent strike in Rafah on MSNBC.

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., accused the New York Times of spreading Hamas propaganda after the paper quoted Khaled Meshal, one of the terror group's most senior officials, in a new report Tuesday.

The Times story, headlined ""Hamas is surviving war in Israel. Now it hopes to thrive in Gaza again,"" centers around an interview with Meshal, who insisted Hamas ""is winning the war and will play a decisive role in Gaza's future"" despite Israel's commitment to eradicate the terror group responsible for killing 1,200 people on October 7.

The Times interviewed Meshal for two-hours in his living room in Doha, Qatar, where he ""offered rare insights into the thinking of Hamas officials,"" the report reads.

REP. RITCHIE TORRES CALLS OUT NY TIMES 'BIAS' FOR NOT INTERVIEWING HIM FOR STORY ABOUT HIS ANTI-ISRAEL CRITICS

""In the interview, Mr. Meshal made clear that Hamas officials are not in a rush to conclude a cease-fire with Israel at any price, and will not give up on their main demands for an end to the war and an Israeli withdrawal,"" the Times wrote.

Fetterman posted a screenshot of the story's headline on X, rebuking the outlet for giving one of Hamas' most senior leaders a platform to promote the group's message.

""No idea why NYT would platform this propaganda from a terrorist. Undoubtedly, Israel will hold him accountable,"" the lawmaker wrote. ""Hamas is no different than WWII Nazis and I fully support Israel's commitment to neutralize them.""

The Times report notes that the U.S. accused Meshal and other Hamas leaders of playing ""a central role in planning and carrying out the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel."" Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel.

Still, the paper features quotes from Meshal insisting that the terror group ""has the upper hand,"" and ""has remained steadfast"" while bringing the Israeli military into 'a state of attrition.""

""Hamas's reasoning is simple -- winning simply means surviving and, at least for now, the group has managed to do that, even if it is severely weakened,"" the Times writes.

NETANYAHU TRASHES NY TIMES REPORTING CITING ANONYMOUS OFFICIALS WHO SAY ISRAELI MILITARY WANTS CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA

Meshal told the paper that President Biden's seemingly changed position - from initially supporting Hamas eradication to demanding a cease fire in the region, sends a message that the U.S. is ""practically recognizing"" the terror group.

""Despite Hamas's immense losses, including many senior commanders killed by Israel, Mr. Meshal said he was confident that the group would play a dominant role in Gaza following the war.

Fighting between Hezbollah and Israel has been escalating for months as Israel continues its war against Hezbollah's ally, Hamas. On Oct. 8, 2023 -- the day after Hamas attacked Israel -- Hezbollah attacked Israel to show it was ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people. On Monday, the United States warned Israel against escalating its war with Hezbollah as concern continues that a war in the Middle East could expand beyond Gaza. The warning came as Israel's security cabinet voted to update its goals of its war with Hamas to include the safe return of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes on the northern border with Lebanon. Despite warnings from the U.S., Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that ""while Israel appreciates and respects the support of the US, it will - ultimately - do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes.""

The Biden administration's efforts to secure a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas via shuttle diplomacy continued Tuesday as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to fly to Egypt in another attempt to ""establish broader regional security.""

The U.S., in coordination with Egypt and Qatar, has been leading indirect negotiations in the pursuit of ending the deadly war in Gaza, which has persisted for nearly a year following the horrific Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas which saw the death of 1,139 people along with the abduction of 251 people from Israel.

However, hopes of finding an end to the war remain unlikely during Blinken's latest visit, which is the 10th trip he has taken to the Middle East since the October 2023 terrorist attacks.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

State Department spokesperson Matt Miller told reporters Monday amid U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein's trip to Israel, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, that there is ""no timeline"" for a deal.

""We are working expeditiously to try to develop that proposal, [to] try to find something that would bring both the parties to say yes,"" he added.

A cease-fire deal, which the Biden administration appeared hopeful they were close to achieving last month, appears to have reached an impasse as both Hamas and Israel have made stipulations over access to the Philadelphi Corridor, a non-negotiable issue for both sides.

Blinken's latest trip is not expected to result in any major breakthroughs and comes just one day after Israel's security cabinet updated its war aims against not only Hamas, but Hezbollah.

The goals, which already included the elimination of Hamas' military and government bodies in Gaza, the return of all hostages and ensuring a safe environment for Israelis living along the southern border, now also includes the safe return of some 60,000 Israeli citizens to their homes in the north.

Following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, more than 65,000 Israelis were evacuated from their homes along the northern border with Lebanon over concerns that Hezbollah could carry out a similar Hamas-style attack.

Despite the devastating effects Hamas achieved in its gruesome attack last year, security experts have long warned that Hezbollah - which is financially and militarily stronger than Hamas - poses a greater threat to Israeli security.

In a late-night statement Monday, Netanyahu's office said, ""Israel will continue to take active measures"" to achieve its new ""goal"" in returning citizens to their northern homes.

The statement followed comments made by both the prime minister and the defense minister on Monday that said Israel is looking to change its force posture along its northern border.

Neither Netanyahu nor Gallant have detailed what these security changes will entail, but both have looked to make clear to the U.S. that Israel will do what it believes is best for its security.

Some Israelis are leaving the country due to the war in Gaza,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-22080/israel-emigration-gaza-war,2024-09-17T14:27:18Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel -- The Green household was taken over by piles of clothing, books, and kid's toys this summer, as 40-year old Inbal Green and her husband Shlomy Green, 37, packed up their lives. Along with their dog, cat and four-year-old daughter Riley, the Israeli couple were leaving suburban life outside Tel Aviv and moving to Thailand. Since the war in Gaza began last October, they'd felt too unsafe to stay.

Shlomy opened a kitchen cabinet filled to the brim with stacks of canned goods, cereal and teabags.

""Now we have to sort through the entire house and decide only what we want to take with us,"" he said. ""That's why the house is in complete shambles.""

The Greens, born and raised in Israel, are among a growing number of Jewish Israelis looking for jobs abroad and leaving since last Oct. 7. Israeli media reported figures from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics showing a spike in the number of Israelis -- more than 12,000 -- who left the country last October and had not returned by June.

The war in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials there, was triggered when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.

The vast majority of Jewish Israelis support the defeat of Hamas as essential to the country's future security. But the toll of this war -- for both Israelis and Palestinians -- is also driving some Jewish Israelis to choose to leave the country. Some, like the Greens, say they're leaving for good.

The Greens said that with their country's shaky political and security situation, they've previously toyed with the idea of leaving. But after last October's Hamas-led attack, they just didn't feel safe in Israel, Shlomy said. They believed the Israeli government wasn't doing -- or going to do -- enough to protect them from future attacks.

""The thing is we want to feel safe and secure in our home,"" he said. ""And we're not willing to compromise on that.""

The Greens said that in the early morning of Oct. 7, they were awoken by air raid sirens warning residents of incoming rockets from Hamas or Hezbollah. Most homes in Israel have a safe room that people will shelter in when these sirens go off.

All three ran into their safe room, and that's when they started getting text messages from family and friends telling them the news of the Hamas-led attacks in the south.

Inbal said they grew concerned that the attacks might spread further into Israel. Tel Aviv is only about 40 miles from the Gaza Strip. So they packed up some essentials and made their way to the airport, getting on one of the last flights to Cyprus by noon that day

""We felt like we were fleeing,"" Shlomy said. ""We were basically just thankful that we left in time.""

The Greens spent two months abroad but had to make their way back to Israel for practical reasons -- their Israeli health insurance stopped paying their medical bills because they were abroad, Shlomy broke his leg and his employer wanted him back in Israel.

But by then, Inbal said, leaving Israel for good had become their shared goal. Shlomy, a software developer, applied for jobs all over the world and landed one in Thailand. He said they did their research and felt they would be able to lead a comfortable life there.

""There are very low or nonexistent antisemitism rates there right now,"" he explained. ""Almost no pro-Palestinian protests, life is calm there, which is what we were looking for.""

Shlomy said he used to believe that peace was possible with Palestinians, but after the Hamas attack, he's unsure.

Labor and corporate immigration lawyer Liam Schwartz works at one of Israel's largest law firms. From a meeting room at his firm, there's a magnificent view of Tel Aviv, the sea on one side, skyscrapers on the other.

Schwartz helps Israeli businesses relocate their employees to parent companies in the U.S., and works with families who want to move there. He normally sees hundreds of cases a year, but says his workload has increased by at least 40% in the past few months. What makes this year unique is Oct. 7, he said.

""I've never been this busy ever in my career,"" Shwartz said. ""This is way beyond expectations.""

Schwartz said that Israeli companies are worried about a possible all-out war in northern Israel with Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the conflict in Gaza started. Because of this, companies, especially those in high tech, are relocating entire teams to the United States.

He's also seeing Israeli employees pressure their companies to sponsor them for work visas to the U.S. Many of these employees just don't feel safe or comfortable in Israel anymore, he said.

""Companies are interested in not losing talent, so many of them are just saying yes,"" Schwartz said.

Schwartz acknowledged that these are privileged Israelis. Many others don't have the luxury of applying for work visas or even a regular visa, because they are unskilled or don't have the means. ""For the woman who sweeps the floor where I work, there's basically nothing there,"" he said, because she is unskilled and her employer would most probably not sponsor her.

Some Israelis say they want to leave because they are disillusioned with how their government is handling the war in Gaza. The families of the hostages kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7 have been protesting, along with thousands of other Israelis, to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the peace deal presented by President Biden in May.

At a weekly anti-government protest in May in Tel Aviv, Hadar Behrendt held up a sign saying ""Nine Months Already,"" referring to the length of the war in Gaza at the time and how hostages are still there.

She said she doesn't want to be ashamed of what Israel has become. She'd rather go elsewhere.

""It's like being foreign in my own country,"" said Behrendt. ""We are kidnapped by this government.""

Behrendt, who said her family escaped Germany in 1936, said she will be using her German passport to move to Greece with her husband.

""It's very hard for us,"" she said. ""All our family is here, but I can't be part of this.""

Inbal Green, packing for her own family's departure, said she grew up in a Zionist family, believing that she had a duty to protect and serve Israel. She was a reservist for 14 years, volunteered with the Israeli police and the Israeli national medical emergency organization.

""And then here comes October 7th, and after all that, I still have to pack my things,"" she said.

Her grandmother survived the Holocaust and settled in Israel, she said. But she doesn't want what she calls the instability and chaos of today's Israel to be her daughter's responsibility.

""The country suffers from PTSD. I don't want her to carry that on her tiny shoulders,"" Inbal said.

She admitted that she is also tired of carrying what she says is the burden of feeling insecure and uncertain about the future in her own country.

""I don't want to carry that anymore,"" she said. ""I think it's OK to say ... I want to breathe.""

Inbal insisted she was sure she didn't want to come back to live in Israel ever again. Only one thing would bring her back -- if her daughter chooses to serve in the Israeli military.

""I still think it is important,"" Inbal said about the compulsory Israeli military service. ""It is a character builder."""

They also react to campus protests.

The United States' Ambassador to the United Nations is expressing frustration with the Israeli military following strikes that killed multiple UN-aligned personnel in the region.

Amb. Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke out at the U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday, where she lamented the ""preventable"" loss of life caused by the conflict.

""We will continue to raise the need for Israel to facilitate humanitarian operations, and protect humanitarian workers and facilities, such as the UNRWA school targeted by the IDF last week in Nusseirat,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

UNRWA refers to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

She continued, ""We have also been unequivocal in communicating to Israel that there is no basis - absolutely none - for its forces to be opening fire on clearly marked UN vehicles, as recently occurred on numerous occasions.""

A former school converted into a UNRWA civilian shelter was struck last week by the Israeli Defense Forces, killing 18 people. Six of those killed were UNRWA personnel.

The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, previously rebuked criticism of the strike on the UNRWA shelter, asserting that the entire agency has become overrun with terrorists and terrorist sympathizers -- including personnel at the destroyed shelter.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

""How long will the U.N. continue to bury its head in the sand and ignore the fact that Hamas terrorists have taken over UNRWA?"" Danon asked this week. ""Those who were killed yesterday (Wednesday) in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7.""

Danon provided a list of names ostensibly connecting known Hamas terrorists to the civilian shelter.

When approached by Fox News Digital, Juliette Touma, a UNRWA spokesperson, claimed that ""Israeli authorities have not requested UNRWA officially to provide them with the list of staff killed in yesterday's attack on the UNRWA school."" She added, ""The names that appear on today's statement from the Israeli Army have not been flagged to us before by the Israeli authorities in previous occasions prior to today.""

The U.S. ambassador did note on Monday the ongoing threat of Hamas embedding its members within civilian agencies.

""At the same time, we continue to see Hamas hiding in, and taking over, and otherwise using civilian sites to conduct operations and pose an ongoing threat,"" said Thomas-Greenfield. ""There's no clearer evidence of Hamas' total indifference to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. For their sake, and the sake of innocent people on all sides of this conflict - this must stop.""

Nine individuals were fired by UNRWA last month after it was found they likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

""For nine people, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that they may have been involved in the 7th of October attacks,"" Farhan Haq, spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general said during a press briefing.

"Watchdog group sues for NASA emails with 'Space Czar' Harris, Boeing as astronauts linger in orbit",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watchdog-sues-nasa-missives-space-czar-harris-boeing-astronauts-linger,2024-09-17T08:05:51Z,"Steamboat Institute Fellow Kaylee McGhee White and former New York state Sen. David Carlucci discuss Kamala Harris' ABC interview and the flip-flops the vice-president has made on various issues.

A conservative watchdog group sued the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) seeking documents relating to the situation that has left two U.S. astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) for several more months.

The Oversight Project's executive director told Fox News Digital on Monday he and his group have legally sought emails between NASA political appointees and the White House, including the office of Vice President Harris, who also holds the title of chair of the National Space Council.

The filing by Mike Howell, head of the Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, also demands outgoing emails to Harris' presidential campaign. Just as Harris was tasked with assuaging the root causes of illegal immigration as the so-called border czar, her role as vice president makes her essentially the lead adviser on space policy in that regard.

""This looks like to me and other experts that Kamala Harris, the space czar, chose politics over our astronauts,"" Howell said, inferring that there may have been a political calculation against bringing astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams home as planned.

PENNSYLVANIANS OFFER MIXED ANSWERS ON WHERE HARRIS STANDS ON KEY ISSUES

""It's very bizarre that the mainstream media seems not to care about this massive scandal. We're going to continue to investigate this and get Americans the answers they deserve.""

The National Space Council (NSpC) had originally been organized in a slightly different manner under former President George H.W. Bush before it was disbanded and reorganized under former President Trump.

Trump himself unveiled the first new branch of the military in decades, the U.S. Space Force, at a 2018 NSpC meeting.

In its filing, the Oversight Project seeks to compel NASA to share correspondence from agency chief of staff Bale Dalton III, Associate Administrator James Free and five other senior officials. It also seeks communications between NASA and officials in the commercial crew program at Boeing, the company that manufactured the Starliner capsule that took Wilmore and Williams to the ISS this summer.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS'

A source close to the matter pointed to the stipulated responsibilities of the NSpC chair, as outlined by Trump in his 2021 executive order establishing the council.

""The Chair shall serve as the President's principal advisor on national space policy and strategy ..."" the first stipulation reads.

The chair of the NSpC, therefore, has substantive advisory authority over NASA's decision-making, the source said.

In an August press briefing, a NASA official said there was a ""little disagreement in terms of the level of risk"" between the agency and Boeing after the capsule suffered propulsion issues and elemental leaks. Ultimately, the Starliner craft safely returned to Earth unmanned on Sept. 7.

A few weeks prior, Boeing officials said in a statement they remained confident in Starliner's ability to return safely with crew aboard: ""We continue to support NASA's requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft's safe undocking and landing capabilities. Our confidence is based on this abundance of valuable testing from Boeing and NASA.""

""The data also supports root cause assessments for the helium and thruster issues and flight rationale for Starliner and its crew's return to Earth,"" the statement reads.

On X, formerly Twitter, Howell listed the curriculum vitae of a handful of NASA hires made while Harris has led the NSpC, including a veteran of New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, another from the Jacksonville Symphony and an individual whose ""scientific"" major was ""political science.""

""Space is serious business. Kamala Harris obviously has no business running the National Space Council... They're lost in space right now. Part of the reason they're lost in space is that our NASA has been turned into another woke-DEI, dismal excuse for a government agency,"" he said.

Howell also shared a copy of a document showing ""strategic objectives"" of the ""NASA DEIA Strategic Plan.""

""The fact is that Vice President Kamala Harris' record as Border Czar is as awful as her record as Space Czar,"" Howell said Monday.

Howell said it is important that the public see any such correspondence of a political nature between NASA, the vice president's camp and/or Boeing because other nations like China are watching for such ""sign[s] of weakness.""

""It seems that Harris signaled a willingness to cede America's space superiority in the name of an effort to 'save democracy,'"" he said, suggesting the DEIA priority may jeopardize national security. ""When is enough, enough?""

""I love being in space. This is my happy place,"" Williams said.

Wilmore will miss his daughter's final year of high school but notably requested his absentee ballot Friday so that he would be able to vote from orbit.

Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' governmental office and the Harris campaign but did not receive a response.

In a response to Fox News Digital regarding the FOIA, a NASA spokesperson stated that Harris and NSpC staff ""received frequent updates on the Starliner Crewed Flight Test.""

""While the National Space Council works closely with civil, national security, commercial, and international partners to advance the nation's space priorities, it does not make operational spaceflight safety recommendations or decisions,"" the spokesperson wrote."
Israeli defense minister tells US only 'military action' can return people to homes amid Hezbollah threat,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-defense-minister-tells-us-only-military-action-can-return-people-homes-amid-hezbollah-threat,2024-09-16T19:56:20Z,"Overnight Israeli airstrikes have killed 18 people and wounded 37 others in western Syria, said Syrian Health Minister Hassan al-Ghabbash on Monday, during a visit to one of the sites. (Courtesy: Reuters)

In a meeting with a top adviser to President Biden on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that ""military action"" against Hezbollah was the ""only way"" to safely return its citizens to their northern homes.

U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein met with both Gallant and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt to avoid a broader conflict between the Jewish state and the Iran-backed terrorist groups.

But Israeli officials appeared steadfast in their position on handling Hamas to the south and Hezbollah to the north, and noted the time to secure a cease-fire agreement to end the war in Gaza was running out, particularly as Hezbollah continues to ""tie itself"" to Hamas.

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

Instead, Gallant told Hochstein that Jerusalem needed to ""change the security situation on the northern border,"" though he did not detail what this would entail.

Israeli security experts have been warning for months that Jerusalem faces a far greater threat along its northern border as Hezbollah - already better financially backed and militarily equipped than other Iranian proxy forces like Hamas - has been gaining power for decades.

Israeli citizens fled their homes in the north following the catastrophic attacks by Hamas in the south on Oct. 7, 2023, fearing a similar attack could be carried out by Hezbollah.

Additional evacuations have since been enforced by government officials along the northern border as Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah routinely engage in cross-border skirmishes.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

It is unclear how many Israeli residents have been displaced since the onslaught of the war against Hamas nearly one year ago, though some estimates suggest that figure could be as high as 80,000.

""We are in a multi-front campaign against Iran's axis of evil, which is striving for our destruction,"" Netanyahu said following Houthi and Hezbollah missile strikes on Sunday. ""I am attentive to the residents of the north.

""I see their distress. I hear their anguish. The current situation will not continue,"" he added. ""This requires a change in the balance of forces on our northern border. We will do whatever is necessary to return our residents securely to their homes.

""I am committed to this. The government is committed to this, and we will not suffice with less than this,"" Netanyahu warned.

Israeli officials have shown increasing resistance to a cease-fire deal with Hamas and have said no deal can be reached without the return of all hostages, despite pressure from the Biden administration.

Netanyahu has also said there are major security concerns that cannot be compromised for the sake of a cease-fire, like the continued presence of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi Corridor in Gaza, which runs along the border with Egypt.

Following the Monday meeting between Netanyahu and Hochstein, the prime minister, according to a readout of the exchange, said Israel ""appreciates and respects the support of the United States,"" but added that Jerusalem ""will do whatever is necessary to maintain its security and return the residents of the north to their homes safely.""

Danon's remarks came after last week's Israeli air strike that hit the UNRWA al-Jaouni school in a Gaza refugee camp. Danon questioned, ""How long will the U.N. continue to bury its head in the sand and ignore the fact that Hamas terrorists have taken over UNRWA? Those who were killed yesterday (Wednesday) in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7. In case there are still any doubts, there are the names of the Hamas terrorists who were at the school compound disguised as 'local UNRWA employees.""

The school, which was not operational, was being used as a Hamas command and control center, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

Danon listed the names of the Hamas terrorists who were affiliated with UNRWA on his X post, while noting ""UNRWA-Gaza is a terrorist organization whose members participated in the October 7 massacre, and whose members abducted and murdered innocent Israeli civilians. It is time to shut down UNRWA.""

Just last month, Fox News Digital reported that UNRWA was forced to fire nine employees because of their likely involvement in Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

When approached by Fox News Digital, Juliette Touma, a UNRWA spokesperson, claimed ""The Israeli authorities have not requested UNRWA officially to provide them with the list of staff killed in yesterday's attack on the UNRWA school."" She added, ""The names that appear on today's statement from the Israeli Army have not been flagged to us before by the Israeli authorities in previous occasions prior to today.""

She complained, ""We always find out about these very serious allegations in the media. After the event."" Schools in Gaza have not been in session since shortly after Israel waged war on Hamas in reaction to the Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel.

DOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA

Fox News Digital asked the Israel Defense Forces about Touma's statement. An IDF spokesman said ""From what I understood, it's pretty clear in Gaza who belongs to who. I don't think this is a surprise at all to anyone in UNRWA, just an attempt to shift the discussion and blame."" The IDF spokesman stressed that the UNRWA spokeswoman's comment ""Sounds like a diversion from talking about the important issue - terrorists working for the organization and using UNRWA as a cover.""

Hillel Neuer, executive director of U.N. Watch, told Fox News Digital. ""This was a precision strike targeting terrorists who embedded a command and control center within a compound that had previously served as a school. The U.N. should be condemning Hamas for using civilian buildings for military purposes, which is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Instead, they rushed to condemn Israel.""

Neuer, who has testified to Congress about the controversial agency, claimed, ""UNRWA is deeply complicit with the Hamas terrorist organization. Their staff routinely celebrate terrorist attacks against Israelis and Jews, as we have identified in numerous of our reports, listing some 200 names. Next, we identified heads of UNRWA teachers unions, who are senior officials within Hamas. Suhail al-Hindi, who for many years headed the UNRWA teachers union in Gaza, is sitting on the Hamas political bureau with Yahya Sinwar. Likewise, the head of the UNRWA teachers' union in Lebanon, Fathi al-Sharif, is a senior Hamas terrorist, documented on our website, unwatch.org.""

He called on foreign governments to stop funding UNRWA. ""It is high time for all western states who are giving more than a billion dollars to UNRWA to stop funding a terror-infested agency. The Swiss parliament rightly called to stop funding it, and to end UNRWA altogether. We urge all other democracies, the U.S., UK, France, Germany, and Japan, to do the same.""

UNRWA's Touma decried the Swiss decision. ""Switzerland's lower parliament votes to suspend funding to UNRWA. It is beyond comprehension that this happens in circumstances where the Agency is at the forefront of lifesaving humanitarian work in Gaza. Switzerland has been known for championing humanitarian aid and playing a leading role in promoting international humanitarian law.""

Touma added, ""Parliamentarians voting to phase out a U.N. General Assembly mandated Agency without offering a political alternative to Palestinians under occupation are again on the wrong side of history.""

The U.S. suspended funding to UNRWA because of the role some of its employees played in the Oct. 7 massacre.

Anti-Israel groups such as ""Queers for Palestine"" have surfaced across America since the Hamas terror group attacked Israel on October 6, but homosexuality remains deeply taboo in the Palestinian territories. Gay and transgender people in Gaza and the West Bank face a significant level of persecution and are often subjected to horrific acts.

New Tolerance Campaign (NTC) President Gregory T. Angelo, who is gay and the former president of Log Cabin Republicans, said the campaign is a ""wake-up call"" to anyone who identifies as part of the ""Queers for Palestine"" or ""Gays for Gaza"" movements.

""I don't want people to just shrug off this campaign as some kind of publicity stunt or something that is supposed to be comical. It actually is a legitimate offer,"" Angelo told Fox News Digital.

A PRIDE MONTH NOTE TO QUEERS FOR PALESTINE

""This campaign emerged to call out these purported advocates of LGBT equality and put our money where their mouths are,"" he continued. ""I think that this is a real opportunity for these groups to legitimately step up and host an event that would either highlight the fact that the Palestinian territories are not indeed a good place for LGBTQ individuals to be living, or it could be a breakthrough moment for pluralism and peace in the Middle East.""

The New Tolerance Campaign said it secured commitments for the $1 million prize and will begin publicizing the offer with mobile billboards circulating around Columbia University in New York City, the headquarters of the Human Rights Campaign in Washington, D.C. and UCLA in Los Angeles.

""Obviously, the $1 million prize is something that is flashy. It was designed to get attention; it was designed to turn heads. But the greater drive behind this project is one of equality and broad human rights,"" Angelo said.

The campaign will also allow everyday Americans to send messages directly to the senior leadership of the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, the LGBTQ Task Force, and Advocates for Trans Equality encouraging them to fight for LGBTQ rights in Palestinian territories and Arab countries.

""On the left in the United States, all oppression is the same oppression. And I think the left, quite to their disservice, lumps everything from racial discrimination to sexual orientation discrimination to gender discrimination to Islamophobia, all under the same umbrella. That's certainly not the case,"" Angelo said.

Angelo said that many anti-Israel protesters across the United States insist LGBTQ people aren't treated particularly well in the United States when confronted with facts about how they would be treated in Gaza or the West Bank.

""Well, that could not be further from the truth. Here in the United States, we have protection from job discrimination for gay and trans individuals that came through a Supreme Court ruling. We have same-sex marriage is the law of the land in all 50 states, and just more generally, aside from legislation, we have a country that welcomes people of all faiths and family types,"" Angelo said.

""Contrast that with what you see over in the Palestinian territories where same-sex marriage isn't something that's even a possibility or discussed,"" he said. ""There are no protections in terms of employment for sexual orientation or gender.""

Palestinian Authority police in 2019 barred gay and transgender rights group from holding events in the West Bank and threatened to arrest participants. Meanwhile, Israel frequently promotes its tolerance on issues of sexual orientation and Tel Aviv is proud of its reputation as a top destination for gay and lesbian travelers.

Angelo said he was stunned in 2013 when he visited the West Bank during an immersion trip to Israel.

""I got to see with my own eyes the disparity in, not just gay rights, but really human rights that are evident when you cross over between Israel and into the Palestinian territories,"" Angelo said.

Disabled veteran arrested at Rutgers after posting anti-Hamas flyers: 'Not going to let anyone censor me',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/disabled-veteran-arrested-rutgers-posting-anti-hamas-flyers-not-going-let-anyone-censor-me,2024-09-16T09:08:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Rutgers Law School student who mounted a counter-protest against anti-Israel demonstrators on campus was arrested by police after he refused to stop posting flyers that labeled Hamas as ""savages.""

Yiorgos ""George"" Maravelias, a disabled veteran who previously served as a United States Army First Lieutenant and deployed to Afghanistan, first engaged in campus activism in November 2023. He told Fox News Digital that after October 7, a vocal minority of law school students erected tables and hung flyers that criticized Israel's actions in Gaza.

""I set up a table right next to them with my beliefs, which is that Hamas are rapists, that they are monsters, savages. That October 7 was a terrorist attack. You know, basically, I believe that a lot of the statements that they apply towards Israel, I think they fully hold against America,"" he said.

Maravelias said he then began hanging his flyers on walls and spaces that were riddled with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian content. Soon after, a woman began ripping down his posters.

RUTGERS STUDENTS WHO STOOD UP TO ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS WITH USA CHANT SPEAK OUT: 'FED UP WITH ANTI-AMERICANISM'

""I addressed this person. I said, what are you doing? Like, why are you ripping down my flyers? And she told me that it was against the policy to put flyers where I had my flyers, which were right next to where these -- there were these bulletin boards that the whole entire bulletin board was one speech and one viewpoint,"" he told Fox News Digital.

The woman, who was later identified as distinguished professor of law and Chancellor's Social Justice Scholar Sahar Aziz, escorted Maravelias up to Dean Cate Lysionek's office with his crumpled papers in hand. Maravelias claimed that Aziz was informed that no such policy prevented him from engaging in political speech.

Speaking in her individual capacity and not as a representative of Rutgers, Aziz refuted Maravelias' claim that she was informed no policy against his actions existed. She told Fox News Digital that at the time the flyers were posted, the law school had a signage policy prohibiting students from posting flyers on the bare walls of the law school atrium. Flyers could only be posted on the bulletin boards.

Aziz stated that Maravelias violated this policy when he posted numerous signs on the walls and claimed that no other flyers were taped on the atrium walls at the time.

Maravelias said Lysionek told him to report the incident to Dean Johanna Bond as there were consistent reports of Aziz interfering with the free speech of students opposed to the pro-Palestinian activists.

Aziz said she has not interfered with the free speech of students on campus, regardless of their viewpoints, and suggested there is no evidence of Maravelias' ""false claim.""

RUTGERS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SAYS WITHOUT DEI OFFICES, THERE IS 'NO ABILITY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS'

She noted that other faculty have hosted at least two pro-Israeli events featuring the Zionist Organization of America and Stand With Us. To her knowledge, the events occurred without interference.

""In stark contrast, there are external self-described Zionist organizations who have sought to censor Palestine-related programming hosted by the Center for Security, Race and Rights - which is an academic center focused on the civil rights of Muslims, Arabs, and South Asians. Fortunately, Rutgers University has an academic freedom policy that applies to all faculty regardless of viewpoint or identity,"" she added.

Maravelias said he brought the incident to the attention of Dean Johanna Bond and Dean Sarah K. Regina.

Bond allegedly declined to repudiate Aziz's actions and refused to meet with Maravelias to discuss the matter.

He also emailed Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway, alleging the school had violated his First Amendment rights.

""In the Army it's an open-door policy. You send it up the chain of command. I heard nothing,"" Maravelias said.

Dean Bond, Dean Regina, Lysionek, and President Holloway did not reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

He would again engage in a counter-protest in May when protesters set up an encampment on Rutgers' Newark grounds. Protesters hung signs with phrases like ""From the river to the sea"" and ""Globalize the Intifada."" They also created a list of demands -- one of which stipulated that no military recruiters could be allowed on Rutgers campuses.

JEWISH STUDENTS AT RUTGERS SPEAK OUT IN WAKE OF LATEST ANTI-ISRAEL INCIDENT ON CAMPUS: 'HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE'

""I found that to be grotesque, disgusting, offensive. So, I decided to go down to Rutgers and participate with, once again, the speech that I had in the fall. Same, same exact point of view. Nothing that I would deem to be offensive. Nothing against Palestinian people, nothing racist, Islamophobic or bigoted otherwise,"" he said.

That night, several individuals ripped down his flyers. Campus security instructed him to file a complaint with the police.

""I go to the police. They say, 'Oh, we can't do anything about this.' So, I'm like, where's the accountability? Like, why is my speech being ripped down?"" he told Fox News Digital.

The following day, Maravelias visited Dean Regina's office and asked what the rules were for posting around the school and how he could get accountability if anyone obstructed his speech. Leadership, according to Maravelias, had no answer.

""I said, 'I'm going to go participate in my speech. I'm letting you know right now that if anybody touches my flyers, it's tit for tat. They rip down mine; I'm gonna rip down theirs. I'm not gonna let anybody censor me while I'm participating in free speech,'"" Maravelias recalled.

He then went outside and taped up flyers that criticized Hamas and tied small Israeli and American flags together. Maravelias said he was verbally excoriated by the pro-Palestinian crowd calling him a ""baby killer, genocidal maniac, Zionist"" and more. While he left the encampment's messages in place, activists tore them down as soon as he posted his flyers.

A large group of Rutgers University police officers then surrounded Maravelias. They allegedly asked to speak with him privately.

""I'm like, I'm going to post my flyers where their flyers are posted. If you want to talk to me, I'll talk right here. They kept on trying to, you know, reason with me or try to stop me from posting my flyers,"" he said.

One police officer instructed another to rip down his flyers that said, ""Stand with Israel"" and ""Stand with America."" Maravelias said he was told his speech was ""inflammatory.""

""I go, what happens if I continue to post my speech? Am I going to be arrested? Because if you're ripping down my flyers and I keep posting flyers like, where does this go? What's going to happen? He's like, yes, you'll be arrested,"" Maravelias said.

When he refused to stop posting flyers in the same area where the protest encampment had placed hundreds of signs, the police asked Maravelias to put his hands behind his back.

The Rutgers Police Department then arrested Maravelias, detained him at their station, fingerprinted and photographed him. He was in custody for several hours before being released.

Rutgers University Police Department did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maravelias had charges filed against him for a petty disorderly persons offense.

The summons issued to Maravelias said, ""Within the jurisdiction of this court, purposely cause or recklessly create the risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm by, specifically by creating a hazardous or physically dangerous condition by an act which serves no legitimate purpose of himself.""

He graduated from Rutgers Law School soon after.

Maravelias said he does not believe there is anything wrong with Rutgers as an institution. Still, he said there needs to be an evaluation to see if people in leadership positions at the school are living up to university standards.

""I think we need to have a real leadership reckoning with the Rutgers institution, especially the law school,"" he said.

Charges against Maravelias were dismissed in July 2024 at the first substantive court date. Rutgers also filed student conduct administrative charges against him and refused to expunge them, according to his lawyer, Christopher J. D'Alessandro.

D'Alessandro was in the Army in the early 1990s. He went to college on a GI Bill and started working for the New Jersey State Parole Board in 1997. He re-enlisted in the New Jersey Army National Guard in 2005 and deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, citing the impact of the 9/11 attacks. D'Alessandro continues to serve as a logistics officer and retired from parole in 2015.

He later attended Rutgers Law School and did a fellowship at Rutgers Law Associates. D'Alessandro is also the former VP of Veteran Alumni at Rutgers University.

COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS TO REACH 'CRESCENDO OF INTIMIDATION' AS SCHOOL SUFFERS LATEST BLACK EYE

""This is an issue not just for [Maravelias], but for any veteran that would go to Rutgers, and I've encouraged many veterans to go to Rutgers Law School. In fact, I try to talk every veteran into going to Rutgers Law School,"" D'Alessandro told Fox News Digital.

""So, this is a problem that needs to be fixed because I want to be proud of the school I went to and I want to be able to tell a veteran in good conscience, this is a law school that you want to go to because they'll teach you how to obtain justice,"" he continued.

D'Alessandro said that the manner in which Rutgers addressed the Newark anti-Israel encampment was wildly divergent from the way they treated his client.

Citing a Rutgers statement, D'Alessandro, in his personal opinion, said that the school negotiated with the ""pro-Hamas encampment,"" many of whom were non-students, and instead of applying laws, rules, and regulations, allowed the encampment residents to act with impunity.

Maravelias revealed that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka issued 10 housing stipends to encampment protesters because they were homeless.

He also noted that Rutgers had expressed no interest in settling the matter.

Baraka's office did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maravelias said he received a letter directly from the school stating that while the conduct charges would not be pursued (as he had since graduated), should he ever re-enroll at Rutgers, the charges would be reinstated.

RUTGERS STUDENTS COUNTER ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS ON CAMPUS BY WAVING AMERICAN FLAG, CHANTING 'USA! USA!'

D'Alessandro said that to obtain the Body Worn Camera footage of Maravelias' arrest, Rutgers is requiring them to pay an $804 fee. In addition, they claim Rutgers has refused to produce CCTV surveillance footage of the event, claiming it would jeopardize campus security.

""I did not take the bar exam because I have been too distracted by fighting the criminal charges to study effectively. The actions of Rutgers taken against me also affect my being barred, as I have to pass Character and Fitness, disclosing all that has transpired to the Bar,"" Maravelias said.

D'Alessandro said Maravelias' situation reminds him of an old police adage he recalled from his time in law enforcement: ""You might beat the rap, you won't beat the ride.""

While Maravelias had his charges dismissed, D'Alessandro said he was still arrested, publicly humiliated, made to feel like a criminal, taken down to the station, stuck in a cell, fingerprinted, and photographed. That booking will go into the system that anybody who looks up his client will be able to see.

Maravelias had no legal fees for the Defense. He was represented pro bono by a defense attorney.

D'Alessandro said the case is disappointing because, as a veteran who often represents other veterans in employment cases, they are a group who routinely have their rights violated.

""I learned how to be a lawyer at Rutgers. They taught me to do what I'm doing now. That's a school where I learned to seek justice for my clients. So, it's extremely disappointing that I have to go up against the place I graduated from because they denied a law student First Amendment rights. You can't even make that up,"" he said.

Trump's historic Abraham Accords would be bolstered with military 'exchange program' under bipartisan bill,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-historic-abraham-accords-would-bolstered-military-exchange-program-under-bipartisan-bill,2024-09-15T15:47:38Z,"EXCLUSIVE: A bipartisan pair of senators is introducing a new bill on the fourth anniversary of the Abraham Accords to deepen cooperation between U.S. and Middle East partners.

The LINK Act, brought forth by Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., co-chairs of the Abraham Accords Caucus, would establish a ""military subject matter exchange program"" to deepen cultural ties and strategic cooperation between American troops and allies in the Middle East.

""In the face of emboldened Iranian aggression, I'm deepening the historic partnerships created through the Abraham Accords four years ago today,"" said Ernst.

""More cooperation among our Middle East partners is what Tehran fears. The LINK Act accomplishes this by coordinating military planning and creating a permanent and effective defense alliance. By working hand-in-hand with our partners, the strength and security of our nations grows.""

The pair of senators had three of their previous Middle East-related bills signed into law.

The Gulf States of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain signed a normalization deal with Israel in 2020, brokered by the U.S., known as the Abraham Accords.

As part of the agreements, UAE and Bahrain recognized Israel's sovereignty and established full diplomatic relations. It was the first time Israel had established peace with an Arab country since 1994 with the Israel-Jordan peace treaty.

Six months after Yulia Bar-Dan and her family fled their home on a kibbutz in northern Israel fearing a possible Hezbollah assault following the horrendous Hamas attack of Oct. 7, she returned to gather what she could from a lifetime of memories she'd left behind.

One hour was all she had. ""We were given a chance, under the cover of darkness, to return home for the first time,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""I cried the whole time.""

When she arrived, Kibbutz Manara, once home to close to 300 people, looked like a war zone. ""We heard explosions above us and hurried to our house - the one closest to the Lebanese border. There was no electricity, and we couldn't open the windows,"" she said.

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

With a flashlight in hand, she went room to room, gathering as much as she could in a large trash bag. The family of five is now living in a single room and there's not much space for extras. ""My daughter wanted her dollhouse, but I couldn't bring it. The happiest moment was finding our cat alive. Seeing him brought real joy to the kids,"" she says.

Not long after she collected her belongings and left the kibbutz, a Hezbollah missile hit her house. The strike added her home to the staggering 75% of kibbutz structures in the north that have been damaged by Hezbollah's relentless bombardments.

Since Hezbollah joined the war as a ""support front"" for Hamas on Oct. 8, over 7,500 rockets have been fired from Lebanon into Israel, and more than 200 drones have crossed the border. The toll: 44 people have been killed, 271 wounded and 62,000 evacuated from dozens of communities in northern Israel. Those who have left have no idea when - or even if - they will ever return. The damage to agriculture and tourism has reached billions of dollars, and there is widespread fear that this conflict will escalate further.

The decision to evacuate most northern communities immediately after Oct. 7 didn't come from the government, which was slow to respond. It came from the residents themselves. ""It's sheer luck that Hezbollah's Radwan forces didn't join Hamas in the massacre; if they had, nothing would have stopped them,"" says Yochai Wolfin, the community director of Kibbutz Manara. ""We are right on the border and at high risk. We've known for at least 10 years that Hezbollah's Radwan forces have a plan they've been training to invade the Galilee, seize multiple communities and do here exactly what we saw happen in the south.""

ISRAEL WARNS US DEFENSE CHIEF IRAN AGGRESSION HAS 'REACHED ALL-TIME HIGH'

Naor Shamia, who has lived with his wife and three children on Kibbutz Manara since 2011, doesn't sugarcoat the response of people living near the northern border following Oct. 7. ""We ran away. We were terrified they would slaughter us, just like they did in the Gaza envelope,"" he recalled.

Since Oct. 7, Shamia, who typically would spend his days teaching math and physics, has been focused on leading the kibbutz's rapid response unit - a band of community members with combat experience - which has been tasked with defending against terrorist infiltrations, rocket fire and even wildfires ignited by hot shrapnel or missile impacts. ""Much of Kibbutz Manara is visible from Lebanon, which makes our situation even more challenging,"" Shamia says. ""You can walk through parts of the kibbutz and be fully exposed to Hezbollah.""

In December, when members of the rapid response unit rushed to a blaze that had been sparked by an anti-tank missile, Hezbollah fired three more missiles, injuring two members of the unit. ""Manara sits on a high ridge, making us an easy target for anti-tank missiles,"" Shamia says. ""We're exposed.""

Established in 1943, the kibbutz economy has been primarily based on agriculture, including a famous vineyard, cherry and apple orchards, and poultry farming. Today, much of that has been destroyed by Hezbollah's rockets. The vineyard was burned and the orchards, located in frequently targeted areas, were abandoned.

An aluminum business, which Yulia's husband, Nadav, ran, was also destroyed by a missile strike. Since then, he has been serving with the rapid response unit, while Bar-Dan and their three children live in a single room on a kibbutz in the north but away from the border.

""There's no official declaration of war here, but we're living as if there is a war, constantly bombarded by drones and missiles,"" she says. ""The children go to school, but they spent two hours in a shelter today because of missile fire. People might ask, 'Why don't you move somewhere else?' But this is our home. I can't imagine living anywhere else.""

She continued, ""What would happen if she and others pulled up roots and abandoned the northernmost regions of Israel? Manara is on the border. If we're not there, who will be? We have to come back.""

She says she hopes for the day when the government comes to understand what's at stake ""and does what's necessary to change the situation in the north.

Due to weakness in the White House, we are experiencing chaos in the Middle East, strikes on our servicemembers, the bloodiest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, and Americans still held hostage by Iran-backed Hamas.

It doesn't have to be this way.

Four years ago, we were celebrating the signing of the Abraham Accords, a historic advancement to peace in the Middle East ushered in under the Trump administration. On September 15, 2020, President Trump forged these agreements, facilitating the greatest deal between Israel and Arab countries in modern history. Americans, Israelis, and Arabs were brought together under a common vision. Cultural, economic, and defense ties were deepened, and the world watched as Iran's biggest fear came true: a more unified and prosperous Middle East. This was peace through strength in action.

BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN NEEDS 'MORE AGGRESSIVE' PLAN TO TAKE ON IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS, EXPERTS WARN

As a combat veteran who served in the Middle East, I co-founded the Abraham Accords Caucus, so Congress could build upon the Accords' strong foundation. Through this work, I've created laws to strengthen and expand these agreements by establishing integrated defense systems with our allies and partners to protect from Iran-backed attacks on land and at sea.

Unfortunately, after three-and-a-half years of Biden and Harris in the White House, Iran-backed terrorists have put these efforts to the ultimate test. In April, the U.S., Israel, and our Arab partners worked together to shoot down a barrage of 300 Iranian projectiles, a feat made possible by my DEFEND Act. Additionally, my MARITIME Act paved the way for us to work with our partners to counter Iran-backed Houthis' near daily threats in the Red Sea that disrupt innocent civilians and commerce.

The world is on fire and it has cost American lives.

It's clear that Iran wants chaos; and, under President Biden and Vice President Harris' lack of leadership, their wishes have come true.

IRAN USING HELLS ANGELS, CRIMINAL GANGS TO TARGET CRITICS IN US AND ABROAD: REPORT

The Biden-Harris White House has refused to enforce sanctions on Tehran, allowing the regime to fuel and fund its proxy terrorism and hostage diplomacy. Emboldened by this administration's decisions, Iran-backed Hamas worked to undo the progress made by the Abraham Accords when these terrorists invaded Israel on October 7, 2023.

And yet, 11 months since this invasion, Israel and Arab states have demonstrated that they remain committed to the Trump-led agreement despite ongoing tensions in the region. While this is proof that the unifying strength behind the Abraham Accords is alive, we must be vigilant to ensure progress does not unravel because of the Biden-Harris administration's appeasement.

During my fourth trip to the Middle East since the October 7th attack, regional leaders told me they are ready to give up on American leadership. Make no mistake, this is a result of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' decision to abandon our allies and embolden our adversaries - it started with the Afghanistan withdrawal and has continued to this day.

Now more than ever, we must build upon the Trump-era Abraham Accords, which is why I'm furthering my work to ensure Israel, and our allies, have a comprehensive strategy of cooperation to counter Iran's efforts.

My STARS Act would extend defense coordination to protect from hostile space activities. This will improve satellite security coordination to enhance the United States' situational awareness, defend against threats from adversaries, and deepen space cooperation with Israel and other allies in the Middle East.

To further integrate regional defense operations, my LINK Act would strengthen people-to-people ties between military leaders of Abraham Accords countries, and my AI Accords Act would direct the Pentagon to increase partner-sharing network capabilities to improve cyber cooperation.

The power of the Accords is not dead. In fact, their continued existence is exactly what Iran fears. A united Middle East helps put an end to the regime's wave of terror across the region that seeks to destabilize our partners, kill American servicemembers, and destroy the United States, Israel, and our allies. Four years into the Abraham Accords, too much is at stake: we cannot afford to fail.

A long-range missile fired from Yemen early Sunday landed in central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

The attack prompted air raid sirens in the region and local media aired photos of what appeared to be a fragment from a missile or interceptor that landed on a train station in the central town of Modiin.

There were no reports of casualties or damage from the missile but authorities observed a fire in the rural area.

In addition to the attack from Yemen, the Israeli military said around 40 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Sunday. Some were intercepted while the rest fell in open areas, the military said.

Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for Sunday's missile strike from Yemen.

Local media reported sounds of explosions resulting from the missile but Israel's military said later the sound came from the interceptors.

Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel since the start of Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, which started after the terror group launched an attack on the Jewish State on Oct. 7.

Nearly all the attacks have been intercepted over the Red Sea.

No injuries were reported from the projectiles. Israel Fire and Rescue Services are working to extinguish fires that were caused by fallen projectiles in open areas.

PARENTS OF 22-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN HELD BY HAMAS SPEAK OUT: 'THEY'RE HOLDING OUR CHILDREN'

Since the Israel-Hamas war began nearly a year ago, Iran and rits financed terror groups have attacked Israeli and U.S. targets, which has led to retaliatory strikes from Israel and its Western allies.

Iran supports terror groups across the region -- Hamas, the Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah -- which have exchanged fire with Israel nearly every day since the war in Gaza began more than 11 months ago. Iran and its allies have said their actions come as a show of solidarity for the Palestinians.

In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10 others. In response to that attack, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen.

The Houthis have also repeatedly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea in what they claim to be a blockade on Israel in support of the Palestinians. However, most of the ships that have been targeted have no connection to Israel."

The IDF in late-August retrieved six bodies of deceased Israeli hostages in a rescue operation. The bodies included that of American-Israeli citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose parents had made numerous public appeals for his safe return, including speeches at the Democratic National Convention.

PARENTS OF 22-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN HELD BY HAMAS SPEAK OUT: 'THEY'RE HOLDING OUR CHILDREN'

Goldberg-Polin, along with Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat and Almog Sarusi, were executed by Hamas terrorists on Aug. 29 before Israeli forces reached them, the IDF reported.

The new footage shows Hagari as he moves through the tunnels, showing how cramped, dark and terrifying the entire scene truly was. The passageway runs under Rafah's Tel Sultan neighborhood.

The footage reveals garbage littered throughout the tunnel, as well as scattered clothing and some bloodstains. The troops also found several weeks' worth of food and equipment they believe the Hamas terrorists had used to survive along with the hostages.

The tunnel, located about 60 feet underground, runs approximately 400 feet and is not tall enough to stand upright without bending over, according to The Times of Israel.

Israeli forces would go on to destroy a reported eight miles of underground routes and have neutralized roughly 80% of all Hamas tunnels along the Philadelphi Corridor, the IDF said this week.

""We are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the murder as thoroughly as possible,"" Hagari said. ""Once the investigation is complete, we will firstly, firstly present the findings to the families and then to the public.""

""The troops operating in the field acted responsibly and cautiously, above and below ground,"" Hagari continued. ""In recent weeks, they have eliminated many terrorists above ground, including the commander of the Tel al-Sultan Battalion and the chain of command of the battalion.

""We did not have intelligence information that would allow us to carry out a hostage rescue operation, and we did not know the precise location of the hostages in the tunnel that was located,"" Hagari added. ""They were murdered before we reached the location.""

Hagari also mentioned that the IDF has initiated an investigation into how the names of the six hostages leaked before they were recovered from the tunnel, calling the breach ""a very serious incident that firstly hurt the families . . . and also compromised the security of the troops operating in the field.""

UK government accused of cracking down on free speech: 'think before you post',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-government-accused-cracking-down-free-speech-think-before-you-post,2024-09-14T15:34:46Z,"LONDON - Britain is facing a free speech crisis as the new left-wing government, overzealous police and courts crackdown on freedom of expression.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the leader of the ruling Labour Party, and his government of barely two months have been accused of rolling back free speech protections on safety grounds and failing to root out selective enforcement of laws.

""Every Brit fundamentally has the right to free speech, but for several years now, we've seen a growing trend,"" Lois McLatchie Miller, Senior Legal Communications Officer for Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) U.K., told Fox News Digital. ""It's only now becoming widely recognized that certain groups, depending on their beliefs, seem to have their free speech curtailed much more easily than others with different viewpoints.""

NEW ONLINE 'MISINFORMATION' BILL SLAMMED AS 'BIGGEST ATTACK' ON FREEDOMS IN AUSTRALIA

Widespread riots in the streets of England last month and a heavy-handed approach in response to the social unrest reignited the debate about free speech.

The U.K. has been grappling with harsh policing of online speech for years. In 2019, ex-police officer Harry Miller was investigated over social media posts deemed transphobic for questioning whether transgender women were real women. Miller's posts were recorded by the police as a ""non-crime hate incident,"" prompting him to challenge the designation in court. In 2020, the U.K. court ruled in Miller's favor but stopped short of changing the guidelines that allow police to pursue people over comments made online.

During a speech to parliament, Reform Party leader Nigel Farage complained of the double standards in applying the law evenly. Farage wrote on X ""Establishment MPs can heckle me all they like, but the British people are angry that we are living through a two-tier policing and justice system.""

Last month, the government issued a direct reminder of such laws and warned its citizens to be mindful of posting content deemed offensive and threatening with imprisonment. The Crown Prosecution Service posted a warning to social media platform X, which was amplified by the government's official social media accounts, warning citizens, ""Think before you post!""

""Content that incites violence or hatred isn't just harmful - it can be illegal,"" the agency wrote. ""The CPS takes online violence seriously and will prosecute when the legal test is met. Remind those close to you to share responsibly or face the consequences."" The post added: ""The British government is cracking down on people who share social media posts about the U.K. riots that it judges are 'likely to start racial hatred.'""

The government simultaneously began working on measures to force social media companies to suppress perceived ""fake news"" and legal content deemed harmful, to avoid fueling social unrest. The new measures would expand the scope of Britain's Online Safety Act by targeting and making social media companies liable for ""legal but harmful"" content.

UK LOOKS TO TREAT MISOGYNY AS EXTREMIST VIOLENCE, RAISING FREE SPEECH CRACKDOWN CONCERNS

London Mayor Sadiq Khan encouraged the Stammer government to swiftly implement changes to the online safety law, saying that currently, ""it's not fit for purpose.""

""I think very swiftly the government has realized there needs to be amendments to the Online Safety Act,"" Khan said in an interview with the Guardian. ""I think what the government should do very quickly is check if it is fit for purpose. I think it's not fit for purpose.""

But concerns over free speech in the U.K. extend beyond online, with double standards applied to different viewpoints and political protests.

""This isn't 1984, but 2024.""

Last weekend, two pro-Israel counter-protesters, Mark Birbeck and Niyak Ghorbani, carrying a ""Hamas is terrorist"" sign, were arrested during the pro-Hamas march in London on suspicion of breach of peace. The counter-protesters' presence allegedly led to the march being paused, and they were arrested following a struggle with police officers.

Ghorbani is a well-known anti-Hamas Iranian dissident whom London's Metropolitan Police tried to ban from attending future anti-Israel protests as part of his bail conditions after he was arrested for opposing the protests. A court rebuked the force and ruled in April that such bail conditions were neither proportionate nor necessary. The moniker 'Two-tier Kier' is how some on social media have responded to the new prime minister's policies.

UK POLICE COMMISSIONER THREATENS TO EXTRADITE, JAIL US CITIZENS OVER ONLINE POSTS: 'WE'LL COME AFTER YOU'

""On one hand, we see groups like environmental protesters, such as Stop Oil activists, or pro-Palestinian, and even in some cases, pro-Hamas protesters being given a wide berth to express their beliefs, sometimes using very violent language,"" Lois said. ""Yet, when we consider different types of protests, for example, Christians going out to pray near places of worship, they often face much stricter restrictions.""

For example, Dia Moodley, a Christian pastor who occasionally engages in street evangelism, was forced to sue the local police after the force forbade him from ""passing comments on any other religion or comparing them to Christianity"" and ""passing comments on beliefs held by Atheists or those who believe in evolution."" Moodley won in court earlier this year, and the police admitted that the restrictions on free speech imposed on Moodley were ""disproportionate.""

'Two-tier Kier' is how some on social media have responded to the new prime minister's policies.

Adam Smith-Connor, a Christian military veteran, meanwhile, is set to appear in court next week after being fined and criminally prosecuted over praying silently near an abortion facility. Local authorities alleged that Smith-Connor's silent prayer violated the so-called ""buffer zone,"" a designated area where individuals are allowed to express approval or disapproval of abortion.

""Silent prayer is not, and can never be, a crime. Yet, the prosecution of Adam Smith-Connor - who served in Afghanistan to uphold fundamental freedoms for everyone - shows an authoritarian move towards 'thought-policing' in the U.K. This isn't 1984, but 2024. And yet, the determination of the state to clamp down hard on even silent Christian beliefs - while protecting the free expression of others with different views - is clearly exposed,"" said McLatchie Miller.

Yet, there is a growing backlash against the government's anti-free speech stance, particularly the decision to pause the implementation and potentially scrap entirely the free speech law in higher education over safety concerns.

Over 600 academics and intellectuals, including seven Nobel laureates, signed a letter urging the government to reconsider the decision to shelve the law, the Times of London reported. The law was a flagship policy passed by the previous Conservative government to protect students' and academics' free speech rights on campus.

""The decision to halt [the act] appears to reflect the view, widespread among opponents, that there is no 'free speech problem' in U.K. universities. Nothing could be more false. Hundreds of academics and students have been hounded, censured, silenced or even sacked over the last 20 years for the expression of legal opinions,"" the letter read."

Omer Neutra, a 22-year-old American, has been held hostage by Hamas for more than 330 days.

His parents, Orna and Ronen Neutra, residents of Long Island, told Fox News Digital their son is a friend to everyone.

""He sees people. He pays attention. He has this great sense of humor. So, he touches so many,"" said Orna Neutra.

Ronen Neutra said his son loves the New York Knicks.

""He knows all their stats, whether they win or lose. We hope that those numbers and the stats in his head are keeping him busy,"" he added. ""Because we are 11 months in, and that's far too long.""

The parents wear a piece of duct tape on their shirts, changing it each day, to mark how long their son has been in captivity.

Omer Neutra turns 23 next month.

SURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING 'ANGEL' BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7

He and others have remained in captivity since Oct. 7, 2023, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

Goldberg-Polin's family confirmed Hersh's death Sunday after he was murdered by Hamas. The Neutra family expressed devastation about the loss.

""They are practically our family now. And knowing that Hersh managed to survive 11 months in the most terrible conditions, including his injury and everything else. And to be executed the way he was with [the] other five hostages is just appalling and shows us who we're dealing with. Hamas is a bunch of monsters,"" Ronen said.

Goldberg-Polin's body was among the remains of six hostages recovered by the Israel Defense Forces.

""This intensifies the sense of urgency to get them out, actually. It's been way too long. Their lives are at risk every single day. ... It's a terror organization. We realize that, and that only makes it even more urgent to get them out because we see that, as time goes by, the risk only increases,"" Orna said.

At least seven American citizen hostages are believed to be in Gaza.

""Unfortunately, making a deal with a terrorist organization like Hamas, it's that impossible. It's not like we're negotiating with them. It's what they want. They're holding our children. You can't negotiate with them. You know, it's almost like losing in advance because they're holding our precious ones so that, you know, they are putting the rules of the game,"" Ronen said.

Orna and Ronen are dual American Israeli citizens with Holocaust survivors on both sides of the family.

Ronen's grandfather was in Yugoslavia and joined the Jewish Partisans after he was let go from a factory to save his family and fight the Nazis.

After the war, he moved to Israel and was one of the few who survived.

Orna's grandfather saved his family multiple times from the Nazis and hid on the Polish border with Slovakia, she said.

""Due to resiliency and taking action and not waiting for things to just resolve themselves -- these are the qualities that saved both of our families. And we're really praying and hoping that Omer embodies these qualities and is surviving,"" she added.

Orna and Ronen addressed the Republican National Convention last month to bring awareness to the situation.

Before the two spoke, people at the convention erupted in a ""bring them home"" chant.

""We were very touched, and we're really touched, by the support of the public. And we feel it,"" said Orna.

There have been 1,896 total reported antisemitic incidents on college campuses since Oct. 7, a 700% increase from the previous year, according to Hillel International, the largest Jewish campus organization in the world that works with thousands of college students globally.

""We are appalled by the lack of understanding of the conflict by the TikTok generation that picks up a small, short video and thinks they understand the conflict,"" Ronen said.

Ronen urges college students to read and learn about the Gaza conflict.

""Trying to say that 'from the river to the sea' or whatever means the destruction of Israel and elimination of the Jewish people from Israel. If you are calling for that, you are as bad as Hamas,"" he said.

Orna said people who care about the Palestinian people should be focused on the release of hostages.

""If you are really concerned about loss of life and the devastation in the region, which we are too, then you should be calling for the release of the hostages and for complete escalation in the region and for Hamas to surrender,"" she said.

The Neutras said they have been speaking with the White House on a regular basis, but until their son is back, not enough has been done.

""We wake up every morning, and we ask ourselves, 'What are we doing today to advance our cause and getting closer to bringing home and the rest of the hostages?'"" Ronen said."

Billionaire conservative philanthropist Leonard Leo, who operates a vast network of conservative nonprofits, called on his groups to start ""weaponizing"" their ideas, something he said the left has been championing over the years.

A letter sent to groups supported by Leo's 85 Fund on Wednesday said it would be undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" of entities it supports, and ""will be adjusting the extent to which it funds ideas and policy development."" The goal, according to Leo's letter, is to ensure their philanthropic efforts are not overly focused on ""ideation,"" or as Leo describes it, ""the development of and education about conservative ideas and policies."" Rather, Leo wants his groups to adopt more aggressive tactics that ""weaponize"" their ideas and produce more tangible results, something he suggested liberals have championed effectively for their causes.

""The Left built powerful networks of activists, academics, journalists, and philanthropists, along with professionals from other disciplines, who could collaborate to influence public attitudes and generate political pressure on public officials,"" Leo said. ""They invested in talent pipelines to populate the power centers inside government, where policy would be implemented. They incubated litigation as a means of leveraging the law to produce change. And, beyond politics and law, left-wing philanthropy built or took over enormous infrastructure to control various cultural chokepoints.""

""In contrast,"" Leo continued, ""vastly insufficient funds are going toward operationalizing and weaponizing [conservative] ideas and policies to crush liberal dominance.""

'STOP PRETENDING': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WANTS DEMS BEHIND SCOTUS ETHICS RULES TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEDICINE

Leo's letter cited the George Soros-funded Tides Foundation and the Hansjörg Wyss-backed Arabella Advisors as examples of groups that ""incubate action-oriented campaigns."" He pointed to their support of nationwide NGOs like Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). SJP has been at the forefront of drumming up anti-Israel sentiment at college campuses across the country since Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack that killed over a thousand innocent Israelis and took hundreds hostage. Meanwhile, WPATH has been at the forefront of the transgender movement, publishing standards of care that doctors and public officials alike have used to justify ""gender-affirming care"" for minors.

""With donors like Hansjörg Wyss and the Arabella Advisors network having billions at their disposal, the left is able to significantly outspend the conservative movement to shift American society,"" Leo told Fox News Digital. ""Consequently, we need to do more with less, focusing on leveraging the conservative movement's talent to have impact, if we want to be successful.""

Leo is the co-chairman and former executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a group focusing on advancing the principles of a limited, constitutional government, particularly in the legal world. He has been credited with transforming the Federalist Society into the powerhouse lawfare organization it is today with more than 70,000 members. Meanwhile, Leo has also been considered one of the foremost influences on former President Trump's Supreme Court nominations. Prior to Trump's selection of Federalist Society-backed Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, Leo drew up a list of potential judges that Trump released during his 2016 campaign.

LEONARD LEO WARNS BIDEN-HARRIS EFFORTS TO RADICALLY OVERHAUL SUPREME COURT COULD 'BACKFIRE'

After Trump was elected, Leo stepped away from his daily duties with the Federalist Society, but remained its co-chair. Meanwhile, in 2022, Leo's Marble Freedom Trust received a $1.6 billion gift from American businessman and GOP donor Barre Seid. Leo still has roughly $1 billion left to spend, the Financial Times reported this week after analyzing public financial disclosures. A representative for Leo declined to share how many total NGOs receive financial support from the 85 Fund.

""[W]e need to do more with less, focusing on leveraging the conservative movement's talent to have impact, if we want to be successful.""

""Expect us to increase support for organizations that call out companies and financial institutions that bend to the woke mind virus spread by regulators and NGOs, so that they have to pay a price for putting extreme left-wing ideology ahead of consumers,"" Leo said during a rare interview he granted to the Financial Times.

Leo told the outlet that his Marble Freedom Trust has been increasingly focused on going after ""woke"" banks and China-friendly entities across a range of sectors, such as food production and artificial intelligence. Leo also indicated he plans to invest in local media in the U.S. over the next year.

The call from Leo for his groups to ""operationalize"" and ""weaponize"" their ideas has been met with anger from liberal critics.

""Leonard Leo's brazen call to 'weaponize' the conservative movement further exposes his strategy of using his dark money network to force his right-wing agenda on everyday Americans and stack the deck in favor of the powerful few,"" said Carolina Ciccone, president of NGO watchdog Accountable.US. ""Let's be very clear: This isn't just about shaping conservative thought -- it's about weaponizing the very institutions that are set up to protect the rights of everyday Americans to serve the interests of right-wing special interests.""

Universities of Wisconsin introduce policy requiring college leaders to stay neutral on controversial issues,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/universities-wisconsin-introduce-policy-requiring-college-leaders-stay-neutral-controversial-issues,2024-09-14T06:14:27Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Universities of Wisconsin leaders must remain neutral in public statements on political and social issues, and they should only make public statements on matters affecting school operations, under a new policy the university system released Friday.

Under the new policy, university leaders' public statements must be limited to matters that directly affect university operations and the university's mission, and they must maintain viewpoint neutrality when referencing any political or social controversy.

The purpose of the policy is ""to uphold and protect academic freedom, freedom of expression, and an environment in which competing ideas can be freely discussed and debated by all members of the university community,"" the policy states.

The policy applies to the system president and vice presidents, the university chancellors, provosts, vice chancellors, deans, directors, department chairs and anyone else who may be perceived as speaking on behalf of a system institution.

PRO-ISRAEL DEMONSTRATOR IN MASS. CHARGED AFTER FIRING AT ATTACKER IN APPARENT SELF-DEFENSE SHOOTING

Any expression of support or opposition must be approved by UW system President Jay Rothman or the university's chancellor.

Statements expressing solidarity or empathy should be avoided if they suggest support for one group's viewpoint over another, the new police states.

The policy does not apply to faculty or staff who may express their expertise or judgment as it relates to their academic discipline or research expertise, including analysis or commentary on a political or social issue.

But, the policy notes, faculty and staff should be careful when posting such statements on university-owned channels to ensure they would not be misconstrued as being made on behalf of the institution. The policy also does not apply to faculty and staff's personal statements on non-university-owned channels.

Rothman and university chancellors may also adopt additional guidance and procedures requiring faculty and staff to include disclaimers when not representing the institution, according to the policy.

The president and chancellors may not expand the scope of the policy to restrict the free expression rights of people or groups of individuals who do not present themselves as speaking on behalf of the institution.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the UW System for comment.

UW system spokesperson Mark Pitsch told The Associated Press that the policy will take effect immediately and does not require the approval of the board of regents.

The policy comes after UW-Milwaukee Chancellor Mark Mone made a deal with anti-Israel demonstrators in May to end campus protests. The agreement, which was slammed by Jewish groups, included the university calling for a cease-fire in the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas as well as for the university to discuss severing ties with Israeli companies.

Rothman criticized Mone's decision to make the deal, writing on the social media platform X that campuses need to remain viewpoint-neutral and ensure actions on campus have consequences.

Mone announced this summer that he plans to resign next year, although he has not specifically said why he is stepping down. He said he is leaving his position next year to give time to find his replacement.

Republican lawmakers have criticized higher education for years, saying conservative voices are censored on campuses across the country while liberal voices are welcomed.

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for around a half hour to a packed crowd at the McHale Athletic Center of Wilkes University in Pennsylvania on Friday, where she was interrupted at least twice by pro-Palestinian protesters.

""You're supporting a war criminal,"" one protester shouted about two-thirds of the way into her speech.

A second appeared shortly after the first was ushered out, and shouted for several minutes until he also was removed, crying out ""Free Palestine"" as he was led past the press cordon.

In response, Harris said, ""I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking,"" before moving on with the rest of her address over the interjector's din.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS?'

Harris had been introduced by Mary Grace, a local nurse who said she was a longtime Republican who could not support former President Trump.

After thanking Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Wilkes-Barre Democratic mayor George Brown, all of whom preceded her remarks, she began the crux of her remarks by referencing the ABC News debate from earlier in the week.

""I take it many people here watched it,"" she said, as the reference drew applause.

""You'll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom. And keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page.""

Harris claimed Trump will give billionaires and large corporations ""massive"" tax cuts while also taking a scalpel to entitlements.

She also said the Republican wants to impose a ""Trump sales tax,"" which some observers claim to be a reference to the former president's foreign tariff plans.

Harris also spoke about national division, saying ""we are not going back"" to past years, and instead called for a ""new way forward.""

""We need a President of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us,"" she said.

""People are exhausted with that stuff.""

She also called herself the ""underdog"" in the race, predicting it will be tight in the crucial Commonwealth in which she spoke.

""So Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom?"" Harris asked

Making the trek north on I-81 from Harrisburg, Shapiro - who many believed was the proverbial runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Harris' running mate consideration - offered a booming endorsement shortly before the candidate came onstage.

""We have proved ... that we can 'get sh -- done'!"" Shapiro shouted, referencing his gubernatorial administration's edgy slogan of sorts.

""[We've invested] a historic amount in our public schools... when those kids go to and from schools, they deserve to live in safe communities,"" he added.

""We want everyone to know that you are valued here, whether you choose to be a lawyer or a laborer, we want you to know you belong here [in Pennsylvania].""

""Where you come from, who you love, and who you pray to - you belong and I got your back,"" Shapiro went on, adding Harris' campaign offers a similar vision.

""She and I have both been prosecutors,"" said Shapiro, who served as the separately-elected attorney general during the governorship of predecessor Tom Wolf.

""Kamala Harris has always been for the people... She stood up for our union sisters and brothers.

This time borrowing a line instead from Harris, Shapiro added of Trump's tenure in the White House, ""we are not going back to that.""

""When you go back and look at his record, it was ... less jobs and a whole lot less freedom when Donald Trump was in charge,"" he said, invoking the abortion issue and claiming women lost ""basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.""

Shapiro went on to point to Philadelphia, just 100 miles on the other end of the Northeast Extension from where he spoke, saying that Americans ""declared our independence from a king [there, once] and we are not going back.""

In response to Harris visiting the Commonwealth, PA Trump Team spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital that Pennsylvanians are fed up with the rising costs of groceries, gas, and utilities thanks to the Harris-Biden administration's disastrous inflationary, anti-energy agenda.""

""The choice between another four years of retirees scraping by off ramen under Kamala or a return to the peace, prosperity, and stability of the Trump administration couldn't be easier for Pennsylvanians.""

At the debate in Philadelphia, Harris made reference to the approximate 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania. Outside Port Richmond and the Philadelphia area, the counties in and around where Harris rallied Friday have a sizeable such population.

In Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County, about one-sixth of the population is Polish American, and cities like Nanticoke, Hazleton and Shamokin - in nearby Northumberland County - also host sizable communities.

In that regard, when asked, Desai said Trump is an ""especially easy choice"" for Pennsylvania's Polish-Americans, noting his ""blossoming friendship"" with Polish President Andrzej Duda and his work with Warsaw to build a stronger alliance, including within their shared NATO status.

At the debate, Harris appeared to draw a connection between the Polish-American electorate and her criticisms of how Trump would end the war in Ukraine - which borders Poland:

""Why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,"" Harris said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin."

A supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris shouted back at several pro-Palestinian protesters who appeared outside the throng lined up to see the Democratic presidential nominee at Wilkes University on Friday.

""Did I hear something about Hamas?"" a Harris supporter who later identified himself as Frank from Stroudsburg, Pa., hollered back at a man waving a Palestinian flag and criticizing the protesters. The man was joined by a female protester, whose own remarks preceded his, and about five other people.

""You are a bull---- spreader,"" the male pro-Palestinian protester shot back. ""You are the cowardly one here. Come show your muscle... Let the people live; that's what we want.""

The woman had been shouting at the crowd, trying to make the case that there is little daylight between Harris and former President Trump on the issue of the Israel-Gaza conflict and the Jerusalem government's response to the October 7 terror attack.

KAMALA HARRIS: WE NEED A 'CEASE-FIRE' AND CHART A COURSE FOR A 'TWO-STATE SOLUTION'

Frank told Fox News Digital after the kerfuffle that he effectively had had enough of the protesters' invective and had to say something.

""Everybody agrees that the war [in Gaza] is horrible... but they're complaining about Kamala, who has called for a cease fire.

""[The protesters] are representing the Palestinians, which is fine, but they say nothing about Hamas and the horror that started this whole thing,"" Frank added.

""And they don't say anything about how Hamas uses the Palestinians as human shields. So, you know, United States has been trying to negotiate a cease fire here for months and months. And the problem is Netanyahu and the right wing of the Israeli government -- they don't even want a two-state solution.""

""Kamala Harris is on record as advocating for a cease fire. So, you know, aim your anger where it might do some good.""

After speaking with Frank, Fox News Digital also caught up with Loai, the male protester who had been jawing with the Harris supporter.

Loai said he was born in Palestinian territory but now lives locally in the Wyoming Valley.

When asked why he and his group are protesting the Harris rally, Loai said the vice president supports ""Zionists [and is] supporting Israel.""

Loai added that both Harris and Trump are ""essentially"" the same on the matter. When asked who he prefers if he had to choose, Loai quipped, ""let's see who is less smelly.""

""We want to see the genocide stop,"" he added.

Loai said he also ""doesn't care"" about Israel - and personally is not calling for its demise, as other protesters have shouted ""from the river to the sea"" - a phrase connected to calls for the destruction of Israel.

""We don't care about Israel; that they exist or not. That's not our business. We are American here. We want this genocide to be stopped. - Wherever they go, they just [need] to get the Hell out of [the Palestinian territory]."""

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Thursday said its troops had ""dismantled"" Hamas' Rafah brigade on the Philadelphi Corridor as they look to eliminate cross-border tunnels into Egypt.

In a press release the IDF said its troops in the 162nd Division had conducted ""precise, intelligence-based, targeted operations in the Rafah area over the last few months"" and ""eliminated over 2,000 terrorists.""

Israeli forces destroyed a reported 8 miles of underground routes and have neutralized roughly 80% of all Hamas' tunnels on the strategic security corridor, which runs alongside the border with Egypt.

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

The Rafah brigade was considered one of Hamas' last remaining strongholds, according to the Times of Israel.

Israeli forces continue to conduct operations in the Tel al-Sultan area, located in the south-western portion of Gaza and just north of the Philadelphi Corridor, where tunnels continue to be located and destroyed.

The IDF said that during an operation in the Tel A-Sultan area, first launched a couple of weeks ago, Commander of the Tel al-Sultan Battalion Mahmoud Hamdan had been killed along with 250 other Hamas terrorists.

The Philadelphi Corridor has become a major point of contention as the U.S. looks to establish a cease-fire agreement with the aid of Qatar and Egypt, between Israel and Hamas.

IRAN THREATENS 'NIGHTMARE' FOR ISRAEL AS UN WATCHDOG WARNS TEHRAN NUCLEAR PROGRAMS RUNS UNCHECKED

But any negotiations appear to have reached an impasse as Hamas has suggested that it will not agree to any cease-fire terms so long as Israeli forces remain in the security corridor in Gaza. Similarly, Jerusalem has rejected any calls for it to vacate the corridor, citing security concerns stemming from not only existing Hamas terrorists in Gaza, but also threats posed from the Sinai Peninsula.

Securing the release of all hostages taken by the Hamas terrorist group also remains a top issue for Israel, as officials like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned that there are mounting concerns that hostages could be smuggled out of Gaza through the Sinai Peninsula and into the hands of the Iranians.

Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen, commander of the 162nd Division, told the Times of Israel that his troops had located 203 separate but interconnected tunnels in the Philadelphi Corridor, nine of which crossed over the border with Egypt.

The commander also noted that all nine tunnels had been made inoperable prior to the discovery by IDF soldiers, either by Egyptian or Hamas forces.

The remaining tunnels that have not yet been destroyed are currently being investigated and will be neutralized once all searches of the tunnels are complete."

Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty hide caption

The first wave of a massive vaccination campaign against polio is wrapping up in Gaza.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says that in less than two weeks, they've helped administer more than 550,000 polio vaccines to children across the enclave. But the work is only half done.

""We start the race against time for the second stage of the campaign,"" says Juliette Touma with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the group that's administering the vaccines. ""We have to do all of this all over again to give the children the second doses of vaccines against polio.""

Polio is a highly infectious virus that can lead to paralysis and even death. It often spreads through fecal matter. This is a problem in Gaza, which has suffered destruction of much of its water treatment infrastructure.

""Solid waste everywhere,"" says Dr. Majdi Duhair, a retired epidemiologist in Gaza. ""No clean drinking water, no hygiene.""

This has all led to plenty of sewage in the streets -- the perfect recipe for the spread of polio. So when the virus turned up in wastewater samples in the enclave, alarm bells went off, especially because vaccination programs in Gaza have collapsed since the war began.

Sure enough, last month, a little boy not quite one year old became paralyzed in both of his legs. He is Gaza's first confirmed case of polio in a quarter century.

""Scientifically, one confirmed case of polio -- it is considered as an outbreak,"" says Duhair. That's because a single case points to roughly 200 more people who are infected but not showing symptoms. No other cases have surfaced in Gaza so far, but ""we are expecting the circulation of this virus is very high in the community,"" he says.

Health officials sequenced the polio virus that appeared in Gaza and traced it to a strain last seen in Egypt in 2023. ""There are obviously interactions between people in Egypt and in Gaza,"" says Raul Andino, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""And this virus is very infectious, very easy to transmit.""

Andino explains that the oral vaccine -- which is comprised of a weakened form of the polio virus -- is ""extremely safe"" to get and that it protects the recipient from polio. It's also easy to administer, requiring just two drops in the mouth and no needles. Rarely, however, when that weakened virus is shed in a person's stool, it can mutate and regain its ability to cause disease.

This is what happened with the strain now in Gaza. People were vaccinated orally in Egypt and at some point, the virus that they shed in their fecal matter became virulent again.

But here's where the real problem lies: ""When you reduce the regular vaccinations in a given population,"" says Andino, ""you end up having a number of individuals that are susceptible to be infected.""

This is the reason that public health officials moved quickly to launch a mass campaign of polio vaccination.

Duhair worked as the director of public health in Gaza's Ministry of Health for three decades. Since he retired two years ago, he's been asked for advice on various matters. Then, in mid-July, he got a call from the Ministry to head up the committee overseeing the planning and rollout of the vaccination effort.

""Without hesitation, I cannot refuse serving my population,"" says Duhair. ""I am a Palestinian, and they are our children. Immediately, I accept[ed] the job.""

Andino helped develop the novel oral polio vaccine that was used in the campaign. Unlike the previous version (used in Egypt among many other places worldwide) that only needed one mutation to recapture the capacity to cause disease, this new vaccine requires three. ""That makes the virus safer,"" Andino says. ""It's not perfect, but it's safer.""

The goal of the vaccination effort was to reach at least 90% of the kids in Gaza under ten. (The risk for adults is much lower.) There was a lot to do in very little time.

Duhair and his colleagues coordinated with groups like UNICEF to deliver the vaccine to Gaza and WHO to bring in the refrigeration to keep the vaccine cool.

Right off the bat, the team faced challenges. Chief among them was running the campaign in the middle of a war zone. ""It's impossible to undertake a vaccination campaign of such volume and scale under a sky full of airstrikes,"" says Touma. ""Impossible.""

That's why it was crucial that the Israeli army and Hamas agree to briefly pause the fighting in different areas specially for the immunization effort. These respites allowed the vaccination teams to disperse throughout the enclave.

They also had to figure out how to drive the vaccine and the vaccinators around Gaza, a little territory crammed full of people displaced from months of Israeli air strikes.

""It is a matter of overcrowding of a small area,"" explains Duhair. ""And of course, the streets are damaged.""

So Duhair and his team planned accordingly. They started early at 6 a.m every day. And they put extra vehicles on the roads in case any were delayed.

Usually, a campaign like this would move house to house to vaccinate as many children as possible. But in Gaza, they couldn't since there are so few houses left and people are often moving hour by hour.

""That presented an immense level of challenge in terms of mapping the population and also correctly estimating the population sizes in each location,"" WHO's Deepak Kumar said at a press briefing.

He says more than 200 teams have been involved with the vaccination effort, tracking the numbers of children in Gaza and how many have been vaccinated. ""The data was watched over very closely until we were confident that we have reached more than 95% of coverage,"" says Kumar.

""We go from shelter to shelter and tent to tent,"" says Touma. ""People are literally everywhere. I mean, in the middle of the street, you have people living by the beach. So the idea is to reach every child wherever they are.""

WHO reports that families were enthusiastic about having their children vaccinated.

""We are happy with this polio campaign,"" says Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the West Bank and Gaza. ""And I think we are also quite confident that we reached an enormous amount of children in this short time.""

It was a considerable undertaking. ""I don't think a polio campaign has ever been done like this globally, constrained by time and security as we're currently undergoing in Gaza,"" says Scott Anderson, deputy humanitarian coordinator with the U.N.

Anderson is stationed in Gaza, and he likens the vaccination effort to putting a band aid on a much deeper wound -- a territory whose people and infrastructure have been bombarded for over 11 months by Israeli air strikes after the war that started after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7.

""We're really just hoping and praying that there's not a larger outbreak of disease,"" he says.

Vaccination is just a piece of the polio response. For the next six months, officials will need to be vigilant to ensure there's no virus circulating in either the people or the wastewater of Gaza. That's when they'll know if the outbreak is over.

Still, this territory is but one place in the world where the virus is present. These spots have things in common, like insecurity, poor hygiene and reduced access to health care and routine vaccination programs.

Zubair Wawood is an epidemiologist and polio expert with WHO, one of several groups that comprise the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

""There's a 99.9% reduction in the number of polio cases since the start of this initiative more than three decades back,"" says Wawood, ""and we are at the very, very last mile of this.""

And yet, Wawood says that upheavals like the one in Gaza and elsewhere in the world -- involving war, displacement, chronic disruption -- make that last mile a lot longer."

Fighting the disturbing spiral of Jew-hatred in Canada,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fighting-disturbing-spiral-jew-hatred-canada,2024-09-12T20:15:46Z,"'Gutfeld!' panelists weigh in on what's fueling the 'mass hysteria on the left and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's efforts to criminalize 'hate speech.'

In recent years, the troubling rise of Jew-hatred in Canada, with antisemitic incidents growing in number and severity, has become a national emergency. As with any other national emergency, national unity is essential in tackling the challenges that communities face across Canada, as is the call for collective action from all sectors of society.

JEWS 'UNDER SIEGE' IN TRUDEAU'S CANADA AMID SOARING ANTISEMITISM

This past year, Hamas released a video where one of its leaders, Ghazi Hamad, thanked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his support - a shocking moment that should serve as a wake-up call to all Canadians of good conscience. Then, to the surprise of many Canadians, Canada voted in favor of a non-binding United Nations resolution calling for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in the Israel-Hamas war. This signaled a marked departure from Canada's historical pattern of supporting the Jewish state at the UN in its battle against terror.

TORONTO POLICE RESPOND TO VIRAL VIDEO OF OFFICERS DELIVERING COFFEE TO ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS

Trudeau and his Foreign Minister, Mélanie Joly, appeared to align themselves with those extending an invitation to terror at a time when the West is fighting an insurgency by those executing a foreign terrorist agenda on Canadian soil. Trudeau's moral equivocations in his words and actions appear to be lending support to a violent terrorist organization, notorious for its relentless mission to eradicate Jews.

Unfortunately, the lack of moral clarity among Canadian leaders extends to other levels of government too, with some mayors siding with the terrorists which contributes to making the Jewish community feel unsafe. The absence of strong moral leadership in Canada has contributed significantly to the rise of extreme actions by a small but highly radicalized segment of the population.

Numerous terrorists arrested in North America in recent months were either residing in Canada or held Canadian citizenship, exposing a lax immigration system that neglects to screen out extremists - another failure on the part of the current government to protect our national interests.

A recent exposé by Canary Mission revealed that no fewer than 154 professors were involved in radical activities at the University of Toronto.

A consequence of the lack of strong moral leadership is that it has opened the door for college campuses across Canada to promote anti-democratic narratives, such as the oppressor/oppressed dynamic, colonialism, and the ideology of the ""woke"" left, which are supported by a higher education system primarily funded by both the federal and provincial governments -- unlike in the U.S. where funding is more diversified.

Academic freedom and higher learning have, unfortunately, become a breeding ground for extremists. A recent exposé by Canary Mission revealed that no fewer than 154 professors were involved in radical activities at the University of Toronto. It's no surprise that students are becoming increasingly radicalized.

Foreign funding has also been flagged as a significant concern, as highlighted in discussions with Canadian elected officials regarding the Justice Committee. The use of dark money to fund student organizations and extremist ideologies must be stopped. Likewise, Canada's contributions to organizations that indirectly support terrorism must cease.

This is why The Lawfare Project, a nonprofit civil rights advocacy group I founded, initiated an investigation into the Canadian government's funding of UNRWA.

Legal accountability goes hand in hand with imposing societal consequences to denormalize Jew-hatred. As we have learned from other social justice movements, grassroots mobilization is key. This is why I also founded the #EndJewHatred movement. There must be accountability, or the behavior will persist unchecked.

The #EndJewHatred movement unites individuals from coast to coast to participate in campaigns advocating for Jewish civil rights. National collaboration amplifies our voices, allows for meaningful dialogue, and facilitates coordinated actions to confront hate and promote tolerance.

Our efforts to foster unity extend beyond grassroots mobilization and into educational institutions. After anti-Jewish protesters violently disrupted an event at York University hosted by Herut, a Jewish group, and both groups were suspended, The Lawfare Project's pro bono legal services resulted in York reinstating Herut and harshly criticizing the protest organizers.

We have partnered with Canadian lawyers to file cases against the Ontario College of Art & Design University (OCAD), and McMaster University to address rampant and systemic antisemitic discrimination. These legal actions not only protect Jewish Canadians, but also reinforce democratic values, ensuring that discrimination has no place in Canada.

As Jew-hatred has spiraled in Canada over the past year, with masked mobs taking to the streets in support of foreign terrorist organizations committed to destruction and genocide, our community is increasingly empowered to rise up, join with our allies, and fight for our democracy. Our immediate challenge is to unmask the hate, expose the haters, and impose legal and social consequences on them to chip away at systemic Jew-hatred.

"In Jordan's elections, anger at Israel over the Gaza war fuels Islamist gains",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/g-s1-22336/jordan-elections-islamists-israel-gaza-war,2024-09-12T19:33:29Z,"AMMAN, Jordan -- Jordan's Islamist opposition made the biggest gains of any opposition party in parliamentary elections held this week, winning one-fifth of the seats amid increasing anger against Israel over the war in Gaza.

The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, is now the single biggest opposition bloc in the 138-member parliament. The legislative body has limited power, and will continue to be dominated by pro-government and tribal political groups.

The IAF's showing in the election has been widely watched as a gauge of whether the increased support for Hamas, which is at war with Israel, would translate into more seats for the Brotherhood-linked party in Jordan and more influence for Islamist parties in other countries.

Voting turnout was relatively low -- an average of 32% across the country. The percentage of voters going to the polls was much higher in tribal areas and much lower in the capital Amman.

Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood leader Murad Adailah told Reuters the IAF victory was a ""popular referendum"" endorsing support for Hamas and its allies and rejection of the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel.

Jordan's highest court dissolved the Muslim Brotherhood organization four years ago, citing failure to comply with registration laws. The Brotherhood stills operates in Jordan but is not allowed to directly field parliamentary candidates. Many Arab rulers have banned the Brotherhood, fearing threats to their hereditary power and to more secular political agendas.

Jordan's monarchy has tried to balance legislative and judicial moves to limit the power of the Brotherhood while allowing its supporters some free expression. At protests after Friday prayers, Brotherhood speakers regularly lead chants of ""we are all Hamas"" and call for Jordan to break its peace treaty with Israel.

The United States, Jordan's main foreign donor, has designated Hamas a terrorist organization.

Jordan signed its 1994 peace treaty with neighboring Israel under the late King Hussein, becoming the second country to do so after Egypt. A majority of Jordan's population is originally Palestinian, descendants of families who fled or were forced from their homes in the war in 1948, the year Israel was created -- and in subsequent wars, and were never allowed back.

Anger has grown along with the death toll in Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in Israeli attacks. Israel says it needs to destroy Hamas after Hamas militants led a cross-border attack last October that Israeli authorities say killed roughly 1,200 people.

Along with appealing to Jordanians enraged over Israeli attacks in Gaza and the West Bank, the IAF managed to form alliances to appeal to a wider group of voters than its traditional urban conservative Muslim base and successfully fielded candidates including tribal leaders and Christians.

Jordan is a constitutional monarchy and King Abdullah II implemented electoral reforms two years ago aimed at encouraging the role of political parties as a step toward greater democratization. The new laws also increased the number of seats for women and lowered the age at which candidates can run from 30 to 25.

The king still appoints government leaders and can dissolve parliament, which introduces and passes laws and has the ability to force a government resignation through a no-confidence vote.

Jordan, a resource-poor country, has been hit particularly hard by the economic fallout of the Gaza war. Tourism, one of the country's main sectors, has plummeted and unemployment, while officially about 22% of the working population, is believed to be much higher.

The head of European Union election mission, Željana Zovko, praised Jordan for succeeding in holding elections as scheduled, despite the ongoing turmoil in the region."
The U.N. says 6 staff were killed in an Israeli strike on a Gaza school,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/nx-s1-5109856/unrwa-israel-strike-school-gaza-hamas-war,2024-09-12T15:24:46Z,"NUSEIRAT REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip -- The United Nations relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip says Israeli airstrikes hit a school that was sheltering families in central Gaza, killing six of its employees.

The U.N. agency, UNRWA, says this is the fifth time the al-Jaouni school has been hit since the start of the war. It says that some 12,000 people -- mostly women and children -- are taking shelter there and the manager of the UNWRA team helping people was killed in Wednesday's strike.

First responders say 18 people died in the attack that caused the roof of a shelter to cave in. Families were left scrambling to find their loved ones amid the wreckage.

""No one is safe in Gaza,"" the agency said in a statement. ""No one is spared.""

António Guterres, the U.N. Secretary General, called the strikes ""dramatic violations of international humanitarian law.""

""What's happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

The Israeli military said Hamas was using the school as a ""command and control center.""

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, responded to Guterres' criticism by writing on X: ""It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields.""

UNWRA called on all parties in the conflict to ""never use schools or the areas around them for military or fighting purposes"" and said that ""schools and other civilian infrastructure must be protected at all times.""

Sixteen people were reported killed in a previous Israeli attack on several structures in the Al-Jaouni school compound in July, which Israel said was being used by Hamas fighters.

UNRWA says Wednesday's attack caused the highest number of staff killed in a single incident. At least 220 agency staff have lost their lives since the war began. Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA Commissioner-General, said humanitarian staff are being ""disregarded"" in the Gaza war.

""The longer impunity prevails, the more international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions will become irrelevant,"" he wrote on social media.

Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed and 95,125 injured in Israel's military offensive on Gaza since Oct. 7, the day that Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages.

Millions of Gaza residents have been displaced in the war, many of them multiple times. The population is blighted by hunger and the spread of disease.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it carried out its largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the start of the war, taking 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions to the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients were 45 children and 52 adults with a wide range of conditions, including cancer and other diseases and injuries from the conflict.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, said the evacuation was a ""highly complex operation"" that was ""completed under immense time pressure to bring all patients together.""

A WHO report published Thursday found that some 22,500 people -- about a quarter of those wounded in the war in Gaza -- have injuries that will require rehabilitation now and for years to come. According to the report, some 3,105 and 4,050 limbs have been amputated as a result of the conflict. Many, including thousands of women and children, suffer from injured spinal cords, traumatic brain injuries or major burns.

""The huge surge in rehabilitation needs occurs in parallel with the ongoing decimation of the health system,"" said Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, a WHO representative for the West Bank and Gaza. ""Patients can't get the care they need. Acute rehabilitation services are severely disrupted and specialized care for complex injuries is not available, placing patients' lives at risk. Immediate and long-term support is urgently needed to address the enormous rehabilitation needs.""

Gaza's only limb reconstruction and rehabilitation center, supported by WHO, stopped functioning in December 2023 because of lack of supplies, and because specialized health workers were themselves being forced to leave the area in search of safety. The report says 39 physiotherapists have been killed.

The WHO says its latest report highlights how vast the unmet medical needs are in Gaza today."
More Universities Are Reconsidering Political Position-Taking. Now They Need To Go All The Way.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieldiermeier/2024/09/12/more-universities-are-reconsidering-political-position-taking-now-they-need-to-go-all-the-way/,2024-09-12T11:04:09Z,"The past month brought reports that several more American universities -- including the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, Cornell, USC and the University of Texas system -- have joined the movement of universities adopting the practice of institutional neutrality, in which universities and their leaders refrain from taking public positions on social and political issues that aren't directly related to the core mission and functioning of the university. Harvard and others made the shift earlier this year.

This is good news for higher education and for anyone who cares about free speech on campus, and hopefully signals the end of an era in which many universities have felt compelled to sound off on a wide range of issues, whether or not these issues had anything to do with their institutions. Much of this change of heart was surely prompted by backlash to statements universities made (or didn't make) following the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, and by the protests that raged out of control on some campuses last spring.

Yet as welcome as this news is, most universities still aren't going far enough.

Institutional neutrality is one of the three pillars that support the free expression that is essential to a university's purpose. (The other two pillars are open forums and the practice of civil discourse.) The primary need for institutional neutrality was best articulated 57 years ago in the University of Chicago's Kalven Report, which points out that universities and their leaders risk stifling debate among students and faculty -- the lifeblood of education and research -- when they take official positions and declare one point of view to be the correct one.

What's more, when a university takes a political stance, it invites lobbying by various campus constituencies, which turns the university into one more political battlefield and erodes its unique purpose. Taking official positions also erodes the university's commitment to expertise. Recognizing and producing deep knowledge and expertise is one of the main reasons universities exist. When university administrators make declarations in haste on issues they know little about, they undermine that reverence for expertise.

For all these reasons, then, any university's embrace of institutional neutrality is a welcome development. But the policies some universities have announced don't quite get the job done, because they don't explicitly address two important factors: The scope of institutional neutrality within a university, and the issue of divesting endowment funds for political purposes.

In terms of scope, the practice of neutrality must go deeper than a university's highest offices, but not as deep as students or individual faculty. After all, the very purpose of institutional neutrality is to provide students and faculty with the greatest possible freedom for speech, debate and intellectual exploration. But those in positions of leadership throughout the university, including those leading official academic units like individual schools, departments and research centers, should avoid statements that state an official political position. Such statements imply that everyone within a school, department, center or program is of one mind, leaving little room for dissenting views. They define a party line which is contrary to the notion of a university and hampers academic freedom.

As for divestment, student groups nationwide have called on their institutions to divest from Israel and companies deemed to have ties to what students view as Israel's unjust treatment of Palestinians; this was a central demand of protesting students last spring.

Divestment isn't a new advocacy tactic. In recent years, students have called on universities to divest from fossil fuels as part of a campaign to decarbonize the economy and reduce climate change. Whatever cause is driving it, politically or socially motivated divestment clearly violates institutional neutrality because it requires a university to choose a side in a debate unrelated to its core functioning, thus signaling that there is only one acceptable way to think about the issue.

The list of institutions adopting institutional neutrality is still relatively short but is likely to keep growing as universities heed the lessons of last spring. To be consistent in their principles and ensure the most possible space for dialogue and debate on campus, no university should settle for half-measures. Those announcing their commitment should finish the job and make it clear that they will expect the practice from leaders university-wide, and that they will also shield their endowments from political influence by refusing to use them as tools for advocacy. Only through such clear and consistent expression and application of their principles can universities hope to combat the politicization that threatens to undermine our mission and purpose. After all, a university's job is to encourage debates, not settle them."

There were at least four moderator interventions/rebukes disguised as ""fact checks"" of former President Donald Trump and none of Vice President Kamala Harris. The bias pulsed. It could be felt by everyone. Democrats and leftists cheered, Republicans were first shocked and then outraged.

When, post-debate, Trump declared it was his best debate ever because it was three against one, very few agreed with the first part of his statement and very few disagreed with the second part.

In interviews Wednesday morning with conservative thought leaders Matt Continetti, Mary Katharine Ham, Bethany Mandel, National Review's Rich Lowry and Jim Geraghty, not one of them thought Trump won the debate and many thought he lost, some calling it an awful performance etc. But none of them defended ABC and its moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. I have not seen one center-right to conservative pundit do so (the opposite reaction to the CNN debate between Trump and Biden moderated by Dana Bash and Jake Tapper which was widely praised as fair on the right.)

TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE: BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT WEIGHS IN ON HIGH-STAKES FACEOFF

It is also widely agreed across the center to the right to have been the worst moderated, most biased presidential debate since they began in 1960. This will eventually be admitted by the left after the election is over. Harris performed well and Trump did not. Trump got angry early and by the time he had his best moment -- his closing statement -- the audience had no doubt shrunk.

But while Trump lost the battle he may have won the war. The naked suppression of news, the oozing bias, the ignorance of or refusal to reference key facts -- Snopes has debunked the Charlottesville chestnut for goodness sake and thousands of Jewish kids on campuses across the country are in fear of anti-Semitic mobs within the last few months and were not even mentioned! -- made ABC and Disney the real loser Wednesday night. It is possible the polls might even edge towards Trump as the ""great silent majority"" digest the tidal wave of omnipresent criticism of the debate moderators outside of the Manhattan-Beltway media elites. We will see.

But whatever the polls show and however the elections turns out, it is a debate that will live in infamy. While the journalistic reputations of Muir and Davis are the most scarred by the fiasco, the damage will extend to both the ABC and Disney brands, especially because of the Israel and China related-omissions.

I have co-moderated five presidential primary debates hosted by big legacy networks as Salem Media's representative: four with CNN in 2015-2016 and one with NBC in November of last year. None of them were prefect. But in none of them were any of the moderators a story the day after the debate because that was the goal. It should be the goal of every moderator for every debate everywhere. Basic fairness was my constant refrain in the hundreds of hours and dozens of question preparation sessions and rehearsals. The moderators work from very tight scripts. They know their question sets. We rehearse responses to anticipated responses from candidates. Wednesday's night descent into hackery was intentional. There is no excuse.

I did not expect a Bud-Lite level disaster for ABC and Disney, but they have created one for themselves. The GOP does not have a long memory, for if it did, it would have recalled ABC's George Stephanopoulos infamously asking Mitt Romney in a 2012 debate ""Governor Romney, do you believe that states have the right to ban contraception?"" Perhaps Republicans haven't forgotten that but didn't believe in collective media guilt. It should now. This ambush of Trump was carefully planned and well executed. If Trump wins there should never be an ABC interview. No Republican should associate with the network period. No Republican should even watch Muir or Lindsey. They are partisans but dishonest ones. They pretend otherwise.

The worst presidential debate in American history is not something I've ever heard any media talent aspire to participate in. David Muir, Linsey Davis and the entire ABC/Disney team own the title now. It is highly doubtful they will ever surrender it.

"Harris' support for Palestinian state rewards terrorism, experts warn",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/harris-support-palestinian-state-rewards-terrorism-experts-warn,2024-09-12T08:16:17Z,"JERUSALEM -- Vice President Harris' endorsement of a Palestinian state during and prior to her debate with former President Trump would further destabilize the Middle East and bring about additional terrorism, according to Israeli and American experts.

During Tuesday's presidential debate on ABC, the Democrat presidential candidate reiterated her support for a two-state solution: ""I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates ... to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.""

The two-state solution means an independent Palestinian state on Israel's borders that encompasses the West Bank territory (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria) and the Gaza Strip. Biden faced intense criticism in February for ignoring the outbreak of Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria while singling out Israeli residents of the region for sanctions.

WITNESS TO TERRORISM: HOW HAMAS RADICALIZED PALESTINIANS FOR THEIR GENOCIDAL ATTACK ON ISRAEL

Trump's former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, told Fox News Digital, ""After Oct. 7th, the two-state became a dead letter. A Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan will destabilize both countries and bring only additional terror and misery.""

Friedman, who authored the new book, ""One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,"" added, ""Vice President Harris should stop parroting failed theories and trying to force a square peg into a round hole. She should empower Israel to reach a just and workable solution on its own and not interfere in matters where she is neither competent nor well-informed.""

In early September, Friedman blasted Biden on Fox News' ""Your World"" for creating rifts within Israeli society.

Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for 24 years as a combat commander and spokesperson, told Fox News Digital, ""The so-called two-state solution may have been possible to implement 31 years ago, but four straight Palestinian rejections of Israeli peace offers have made it clear that the current Palestinian leadership does not aspire to end the conflict and achieve peace. Palestinian rejectionism has also eroded the political support for the peace process in Israel, since it has become abundantly clear that the Palestinian leadership does not seek peace.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

According to Conricus, ""Polling of the Palestinian population in Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled areas shows clear popular Palestinian support for Hamas, signaling that the Palestinian population supports the genocidal vision of annihilating Israel through jihad, as demonstrated by Hamas on Oct. 7. Global leaders would do well to listen to the two parties to the conflict to understand how the situation has changed and adapt diplomatic solutions to current possibilities. And whatever the outcome of the Oct. 7 war that Hamas waged against Israel, giving Hamas the ultimate prize of statehood would be devastating for regional stability and peace and for American global standing. Terror must not be awarded with statehood.""

Joel Rubin, former deputy assistant secretary of state and Democrat strategist, told Fox News Digital, ""The two-state solution is on life support right now, but just because this is a difficult moment to envision a peaceful endgame between Israel and the Palestinians that's rooted in diplomatic compromise, that does not mean it should not be the goal. After all, Israel fought multiple existential wars with Egypt and then, only years after the Yom Kippur War, concluded a peace deal that has held and provided Israel with deep security along its southern border for more than four decades. That is what a two-state solution is all about: Ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in a manner that provides stability and security for the long haul.""

NETANYAHU HITS BACK OVER GLOBAL PRESSURE TO MAKE CEASE-FIRE CONCESSSIONS, SAYS DEMANDS ARE 'IMMORAL', 'INSANE'

Rubin, who is a longtime Jewish community activist, added, ""We have seen it achieved with Arab states. There is no reason that it can't be done with the Palestinians as long as the political will is there, extremism is rooted out and security arrangements are solid. So, for Vice President Harris to make this a priority is an inherently pro-Israel position, one that seeks to provide Israel with the long-term security and stability that it still clearly does not have.""

In late August, Harris noted her endorsement of a Palestinian state in an interview with CNN. She said, ""I remain committed since I've been on Oct. 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity.""

ZIONISM EXPLAINED FROM ITS BIBLICAL ORIGINS TO THE REBIRTH OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL

The Harris campaign did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital press queries.

Harris and Biden have provided significant funding for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is led by Mahmoud Abbas. The PA president is considered by some to be a moderate when compared to the Iranian regime-backed Hamas leadership. Abbas, however, supports stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their families regarding the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that might mean the PA compensates Hamas terrorists.

Fox News Digital reported in November that many of the newly released convicted Palestinian terrorists who were part of a swap that secured the freedom of some Israeli and foreign hostages held by the terrorist movement Hamas could receive U.S. funds via the PA.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli-based organization researching Palestinian society, told Fox News Digital at the time, ""The American and European funding boosts the Palestinian Authority budget by $600 million. The Palestinian Authority pays the salaries of imprisoned terrorists and the family members of the martyrs, and the amount comes to $300 million a year.""

Last month, Abbas, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute, told the Turkish Parliament that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

The 88-year-old Abbas, who has clung to power since he took over the presidency of the PA in 2008, has been embroiled in antisemitism and Holocaust-distortion scandals over the years.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported that Abbas delivered a tirade against Israel in Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming the Jewish state carried out ""50 holocausts."""

(Courtesy: ABC News)

So, as crime remains a major issue in the presidential election, American voters got to witness yet another felony firsthand. It was last night when you saw an entire network sneak up on a candidate and mug him. Instead of asking Trump to shake her hand at the start, Harris should have asked him to hand over his wallet, watch and phone. But ABC's blatant assault wasn't just on Trump, it was also an attack on you, the voter. Because last night, an entire network decided that their own politics were more important than answering the one question every unsure voter wanted answered: who the hell is Kamala Harris?

The repulsive pair of moderators obliterated your right to know, denying the nation once again an honest election for our highest office. It truly was the first DEI debate where different standards were enforced on Trump, while Harris had none. Worse, the moderators' contempt for us is so total that they didn't care who saw it. But hey, what's your reputation as a news network when you got an election to sabotage? They now have less credibility than Hamas at a bar mitzvah.

Now, I could go over all the times Trump was fact-checked by the moderators and Harris wasn't or how the host pressed Trump for multiple follow-ups, but didn't for Harris. But it's 10 p.m. and by now you've heard all that news. I swear if I hear three against one, one more time, I'm going to cancel my group massage with Hansen. It was clear that Linsey Davis and David Muir gave Kamala the easiest night she's had since Willie Brown ran out of Viagra.

TRUMP SAYS ABC DEBATE MODERATORS FAVORED KAMALA HARRIS: 'IT WAS THREE TO ONE'

Rather than a policy debate, we got ABC baiting Trump and Kamala piling on. It was designed to make Trump look bad and avoid forcing Harris to explain why she's flipped every position like she did burgers at her make-believe job at McDonald's. She lied at will without a single fact check, even trotting out the fine people, Project 2025 and bloodbath hoaxes. All three are provable lies, but nothing, nothing from Muir and Linsey, who might as well have been wearing Kamala 2024 hats. Muir's would've had to be a triple XL; the guy's head is like a microwave with a hairpiece. But perhaps the greatest unmatched question was how Kamala got to be on that stage in the first place.

How could the moderators not have asked her about why she hid Biden's dementia from the American people? It took Trump to ask her about who is actually running the country right now. What's scary is she didn't have an answer for that either. They didn't even bother with Kamala's newly posted policy agenda, a cut-and-paste job from Joe Biden's old campaign website. Wouldn't that seem relevant to a woman who kept repeating, I have a plan? It's clear. ABC f----- the American public. I would say hold your applause, but I know it's hard. They torpedoed the one opportunity for voters to see who Harris really was. And now there's no way that you can actually judge who won or lost the debate.

TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT AFTER DEBATE: 'I'VE MADE MY CHOICE'

It's like trying to guess the price of a painting once you know it's a forgery. And that's what this debate was - about as real as Rachel Levine's periods. The Dems could say they won, but the public lost. This was the one chance for America to see Harris unvarnished and ABC chose to varnish her. But you also gotta ask, why would Kamala risk trotting out all those debunked hoaxes? Because she knew the fix was in. They were going to run cover for her. It's kind of like me picking a fight at a bar with Tyrus by my side. Why worry? I'll sit back and drink the beer and then take credit for everything.

But you also gotta wonder why ABC would tank its reputation and spit on the American public to prop her up. They must know her campaign is in trouble, and that meant emergency surgery. But not on Kamala, on Trump. Make him look as ugly as possible, so she looks better. And his angry reaction is what they wanted. They created an ambush to elicit his rage. Then they could say, oh, look at his anger. It's like asking why are Brian Kilmeade's arms flailing as you try to drown him in a bathtub?

He puts up a struggle. Meanwhile, you learn nothing of Harris as intended. This is as inflation is still double digits. Our border still doesn't exist, and our inner cities are descending into unlivable hellholes. You think two so-called journalists on a major network might have noticed, but expecting honesty from ABC is like expecting integrity from pond scum. Oh, same thing."
Bill Maher and Henry Winkler clash over war in Gaza: 'Are you watching the same footage I'm watching?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-henry-winkler-clash-over-war-gaza-are-you-watching-same-footage-im-watching,2024-09-12T01:39:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Talk show host Bill Maher had a respectful debate with actor Henry Winkler about how Israel should conduct the war in Gaza.

The ""Club Random with Bill Maher"" podcast released an episode on Sunday where the host interviewed Winkler, who is known for playing Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli on the sitcom ""Happy Days."" During the interview, Winkler, who is Jewish himself, expressed his frustrations over the war in Gaza and the plight of Israeli hostages. He argued of the Israeli military, ""They're not gonna eliminate Hamas, Hamas is an idea, not a group of people.""

Maher responded by arguing that World War II was a great example of destroying ideas by conquering regimes and turning the countries themselves into American allies, but Winkler suggested that the war's impact on civilians in Gaza is merely radicalizing more of them to join Hamas, ""You don't think that all those people that are now homeless, and their families are destroyed, you don't think that they are now Hamas again?""

They then went back and forth over whether Maher had been implying that by wiping enough Gazans, Hamas could be destroyed, an accusation the host denied, arguing he was simply objecting to the idea that an idea cannot be destroyed.

US TOP GENERAL SAYS TENSIONS IN MIDDLE EAST HAVE 'SOMEWHAT' EASED AMID NEW IRANIAN THREATS

Maher went on to argue that his response to people questioning Israel's conduct in the war is to ask, ""Do you know what's going on, really, underneath Gaza and all the tunnels and how close they are? I don't either, but you know who does know? The Israeli Defense Forces. Now are they perfect? Absolutely not, but again, they're not the ones purposely killing civilians. They try not to kill civilians. If you can't understand that difference, morally, then you're very morally confused.""

""Are you watching the same footage I'm watching?"" Winkler asked.

""You think they are trying to kill civilians?"" Maher replied.

""I think that it is indiscriminate,"" Winkler said.

""That's what war is,"" Maher replied. ""War becomes that. There is no war you can name that didn't. Sherman burned Atlanta to the ground and it wasn't just the military people he was killing. It's a shame, but again, there's a very simple solution to this: Stop attacking Israel. Jews used to know this.""

DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS ISRAEL MUST 'WIDEN THE GOALS' OF WAR TO RETURN RESIDENTS TO THE NORTH

Winkler and Maher expressed their mutual respect for each other, and the actor said that ""I disagree a little bit with what you're saying, I don't think that the head of Israel at this moment is a soulful human being.""

""That may be true too,"" Maher said. ""I didn't say he wasn't, and I didn't say even that he might not be doing what you suggested he might be doing. What I was saying is that even if those things are true, it could also be true that this is the correct policy, which I believe it is. I think you've gone 11 months to do this let's finish it while we're there."""
"A Voice Calls Out In The Silence: Bernard Henri Levy's ""Israel Alone""",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomteicholz/2024/09/11/a-voice-calls-out-in-the-silence-bernard-henri-levys-israel-alone/,2024-09-11T22:27:53Z,"On Sunday September 15, 2024 Bernard Henri Levy will appear in person at the Los Angeles Nova Festival exhibition in Culver City to talk about his new book, Israel Alone (to be published September 19, from Simon and Schuster).

The events of October 7 are not an affront to Israel alone but to all civilization, Bernard Henri Levy reminds us in his passionate reporting on the events of October 7 and what has followed.

In his new book, published in English this September, Levy makes the intellectual, historical, political, even philosophical case for the uniqueness of the tragedy of October 7, its heinousness, and mounts a passionate defense of Israel's existential right to defend itself in the face of such an attack and to pursue the murderers, planners, and collaborators who are still holding more than 100 hostages, not just Jews and Israelis, but citizens from many nations and followers of many religions.

Point by point, argument by argument Levy asserts the truths about October 7 and the Gaza opreation that followed, that so many are quick to dismiss or ignore. In doing so, Levy also calls out all the politicians, foreign governments, not-for-profits, NGOs and humanitarian organizations who remained silent for some 60 days after the attacks, chief among them the United Nations.

Levy makes the distinctions others don't about what genocide is (and isn't), and what Israel has or has not done during the Gaza operation. How all that Israel claimed - and the rest of the news organizations denied or failed to report - that Hamas used mosques, hospitals, and private homes as human shields with no regard for the casualties that ensued (perhaps even planning for them). That UNWRA workers collaborated with and gave material support to Hamas, that the Gaza Ministry of Health is a propaganda arm of Hamas and that its statistics of the dead are inflated -- - All have been proven true and yet ignored.

Levy decries the loss of any human life in Gaza, but he places those deaths in context and in apposition to the murders of October 7. He makes the case for the difficult task Israel faces to free the hostages and find Hamas' leaders.

Isarel Alone, is call to the world to understand the perniciousness of antisemitism and how it is used to incite anti-Israel sentiment all over the world, and particularly at American universities and college campuses.

While Levy is a defender of Israel, he is also no apologist for Netanyahu and Netanyahu's current government. As Levy reminds us, the issues of October 7 and the defense of Israel remain greater than one politician, particularly in a democratic country.

Reading the book is like being swept along in a flood of history, famous names, references and, at times, Levy's own personal history and sentiments.

This is a style Levy has developed in his 48 books, countless articles, speeches, and media appearances in France, the US, and all over the world.

In the twenty years I've known him, Levy has always written as the most French of writers, and also as the most Jewish of French writers. At my father's eulogy, some 30 years ago, I remarked that my father never took a breath that wasn't Jewish. Well, in Israel Alone, there is not a word Levy has written that is not deeply Jewish and deeply French.

This is clearly a book Levy was compelled to write. He went to Israel on October 8 and headed to the South to see the carnage himself. But the more important question is: Who will read this book?

It is Levy's hope that young Jews will read this book and become proud Jews and vocal defenders of Israel. I hope that is so.

I sincerely hope that those who would want to cast Israel as a pariah nation, and have it be Israel Alone, pick up this work mistakenly, and learn from it. I know that these days it is near impossible to change anyone's mind. Emotional loyalties, individuals' belief in their own interpretation of events, a knowledge base informed by podcasts, tiktok and social media, a genuine desire for social justice and human rights, all these do not always lead to greater knowledge about Israel and the events of October 7 -- I hope all these people whose hearts are hardened against Israel for their own reasons, read this book.

I hope that all the University and college presidents in the US, and all the sitting members of the United Nations, and their committees such as their organization that investigates violence against women as war crimes, and all the student protesters on all the college campuses read this book.

Of course, the chance that any of them will, I know, is exceedingly small. But if even one person who holds Israel and its actions in disdain, does read it, then perhaps, Israel will not be so alone."
"House GOP majority would block Iran peace deal efforts under a President Harris, top Republican vows",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-majority-would-block-iran-peace-deal-efforts-under-harris-top-republican-vows,2024-09-11T20:57:06Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Republicans would pull out every stop to block a Harris administration from negotiating another Iran deal, according to the House's No. 3 Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York.

""We would block that at every turn,"" the GOP Conference chairwoman vowed in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.

""Biden and Kamala Harris have given hundreds of billions of dollars straight to Iran, the greatest sponsor of terror, and the dollars are going to support proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah, which are attacking Israel every single day.""

Two separate agreements last fall that included a prisoner swap allowed Iran to access up to $16 billion of its previously frozen assets.

STEFANIK FILES ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST TRUMP TRIAL JUDGE

Middle East watchers have predicted that Vice President Kamala Harris would be much more likely to take to the negotiating table to try to prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon than using military deterrence and financial sanctions.

In 2019, Harris said she favored rejoining the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear programs.

""President Trump's unilateral withdrawal from an agreement that was verifiably preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon -- against the warnings of our closest allies and without any plan for what comes next -- was beyond reckless,"" she said.

She said she would seek to rejoin the deal ""so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance.""

Iran has a growing stockpile of uranium enriched to just below weapons-grade, and some fear it could create a nuclear weapon before the end of the year.

Trump recently warned that sanctions should be used ""as little as possible"" to ""continue to have [the U.S. dollar] be the world currency.""

""I use sanctions very powerfully against countries that deserve it, and then I take them off because, look, you're losing Iran, you're losing Russia. China is out there trying to get their currency to be the dominant currency.""

In a wide-ranging interview on the House GOP's national security priorities, Stefanik, a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said if the GOP keeps control of the House next Congress, it would continue to work to defund the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) and ""address these foreign dollars going into universities, put a stop to that.""

President Biden signed an appropriations package in March that banned funding to UNRWA for one year after some of its employees were found to have ties to Hamas.

STEFANIK: HARRIS UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF

The chairwoman declined to say whether the House would authorize more funding for Ukraine or Taiwan once this year's foreign aid packages dry up but noted concerns about oversight of U.S. aid in Ukraine.

""I have major concerns about the lack of accountability for the billions of dollars that have gone to Ukraine,"" she said. ""We are continuing to get more reports from the Pentagon that they can't account for -- to the tune of billions of dollars.

""The only person who can solve that conflict is Trump,"" Stefanik added. ""If you look at modern-day presidents, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin invaded other countries during every modern president except for President Trump.""

And on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Stefanik revealed she is not confident the U.S. is equipped to prevent another similar tragedy.

""If you look at the attack against Israel, the Iranians [are] on the march. The same terrorists that are chanting 'Death to Israel' are also chanting 'Death to America,'"" she said. ""We have individuals on the terrorist watch list who have crossed our open borders. ... That is a national security threat."""
Kirby: 'No use in responding' to a 'handful of vets' on Biden's botched Afghan withdrawal,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kirby-no-use-responding-handful-vets-bidens-botched-afghan-withdrawal,2024-09-11T20:53:30Z,"The White House pushed back on a report released by the GOP on Sunday that criticized President Biden's chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.

On the anniversary of 9/11, White House National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby dismissed the concerns of military veterans critical of the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, writing in response to a Fox News Digital press inquiry that there's ""no use"" weighing in on the veterans' views.

""Obviously no use in responding. A 'handful' of vets indeed and all of one stripe,"" Kirby said in a ""reply all"" email chain Wednesday afternoon that appeared to be intended for White House staffers, but which also included Fox News Digital.

Fox News Digital had reached out to the White House earlier Wednesday afternoon regarding critical comments from four veterans, including Florida Rep. Cory Mills, who blasted Kirby for his Monday press conference that they said provided ""cover"" for the Biden administration's 2021 withdrawal.

Included in that initial reachout were quotes from the four veterans, and Fox News Digital asked the White House if it had any comment to include on the vets' blistering criticisms of Kirby and the White House's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. The email chain was forwarded to White House staffers on the National Security Council, before Kirby replied to all on the chain that there's ""no use in responding.""

Kirby's message was sent in error, with him following up with a Fox News Digital reporter that ""Clearly, I didn't realize you were on the chain."" Kirby sent the email while traveling with President Biden on the anniversary of 9/11.

HARRIS LEAVES OUT DEADLY BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL IN SOARING PRO-MILITARY DNC SPEECH

The veterans quoted in the email lambasted Kirby for ""deflecting"" from the Biden administration's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, following House Republicans releasing a scathing report this week following the anniversary of the botched withdrawal.

""The bottom line is that the Biden-Harris administration chose politics over strategy, and Kirby, who I wouldn't trust to guard my grocery list, is now trying to cover for them,"" Florida Republican Rep. Mills, an Army veteran, said in comment to Fox News Digital.

The Republican chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, released a report this week disputing President Biden's claims that his hands were tied to an agreement made under former President Trump's administration that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan under an established deadline in 2021. The report added that State Department officials had no plan for helping Americans and allies out while there were still troops in the region to protect them.

McCaul's report argued the failure to adequately respond to terror threats ahead of the terrorist bombing at Abbey Gate at the Kabul airport that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghan civilians, and that the Taliban likely had access after the withdrawal to $7 billion in abandoned U.S. weapons, and up to $57 million in U.S. funds that were initially given to the Afghan government.

Kirby joined the White House's press conference on Monday where he defended the Biden-Harris administration's withdrawal, while arguing the new report ""says little or nothing new.""

Kirby went on to list the ""actual facts"" surrounding the withdrawal, including arguing that the Trump administration cut a deal with the Taliban that ""mandated a complete U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

""President Biden, for his part, faced a stark choice when he came to office: Abide by the flawed agreement and end America's longest war, or blow up the deal, extend the war, and see a much smaller contingent of American troops back in combat with the Taliban,"" Kirby said. ""He chose the former and was able to buy additional time to prepare for that withdrawal all the way into summer, and we, as a nation, are safer for it.""

GOLD STAR DAD SAYS BIDEN-HARRIS 'DENIED' SON'S SERVICE AS FALLEN AFGHANISTAN SOLDIERS HONORED IN CALIFORNIA

Mills said that Kirby was ""deflecting"" from the White House's ""failed foreign policies,"" while pointing to the House Foreign Affairs Committee threatening to subpoena Secretary of State Antony Blinken last year regarding a July 2021 dissent cable by 23 diplomats that offered avenues to mitigate disaster as the Taliban's power grew ahead of the U.S. pulling out of Afghanistan.

""Once again, John Kirby is deflecting from the Biden-Harris administration's failed foreign policies. If they were truly transparent, why did HFAC have fun threatening contempt of Congress for Secretary Blinken for intentionally withholding DoS dissent cables from 23 U.S. Embassy diplomats warning that the administration's strategy would allow the Taliban to advance and lead to the collapse of the Afghan government and American lives to be lost? They knew this and tried to cover it up. This wasn't ignorance, it was intentional and putting political optics above strategy/ safety with a complete lack of transparency. This administration knew exactly what they were doing, tried to cover it up, and got caught. Worse, their actions cost the lives of 13 American servicemembers and severely damaged our credibility with allies. It welcomed aggression from adversaries and showed weakness geopolitically,"" Mills said.

3 YEARS LATER, AFGHANISTAN WAR VETERANS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN - HAVE YOU?

Mark Geist, a Marine veteran and Benghazi annex security team member who helped rescue more than 100 Americans from the Taliban in 2021, told Fox News Digital that Kirby delivered a ""one-sided presentation of facts"" and argued the U.S. wanted to end the war in Afghanistan to ""start and fund the war in Ukraine.""

HOUSE GOP RELEASES SCATHING REPORT ON BIDEN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM AFGHANISTAN

""In the press conference, John Kirby delivered a one-sided presentation of facts and falsehoods regarding the recent House Report on Afghanistan. I'll start with where Mr. Kirby finished, which was likely the only thing he said that was completely true: they pulled out of Afghanistan because they wanted to start and fund the war in Ukraine, fully aware that the American people would not tolerate being involved in two wars again,"" Geist said.

Following the deaths of the 13 U.S. service members, Biden-Harris administration critics such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the withdrawal paved the way for adversaries such as Russia to invade Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is ongoing, as is a war in Israel against Hamas.

Another veteran, author of ""Crisis of Command"" Stuart Scheller, told Fox Digital that the botched withdrawal ""will be studied for generations as the epitome of failure at the National Security Council level.""

Scheller argued that Biden launched a ""PR stunt"" when he announced the U.S. would be totally withdrawn from Afghanistan by Sept. 11 of that year, the 20th anniversary of 9/11.

GOLD STAR DAD RECALLS KNOCK AT HIS DOOR THAT 'CHANGED EVERYTHING'

""He picked the arbitrary date of September 11th as a PR stunt, which required the American military to pull out during the Taliban's peak fighting season. He decided to abandon Bagram Air Base, despite the Trump plan outlining the need to hold this key piece of terrain. He left 7,000 prisoners in the prison at Bagram, which the Taliban later freed. Biden allowed the use of the Taliban as external security. He authorized a strike on the 'enemy' after the suicide attack that only killed women and children. He left billions of dollars of equipment in the hands of the Taliban and needlessly allowed the murder of thousands of Afghan partners,"" he said.

Scheller was arrested and ultimately discharged from the Marines after blasting top military brass in a series of viral videos for the botched withdrawal.

""I am proud that I identified the mistakes and poor planning in real time. It still pains me that it cost me my career. John Kirby, a former Navy admiral, represents the morally weak military officer class willing to parrot narratives for individual advancement. These politicians in uniform demonstrate, time and time again, that they are terrified of honest assessments of failure,"" he said.

Chad Robichaux, a former Force Recon Marine and an Afghanistan veteran, added in comment to Fox Digital that Kirby has traded an ""oath to the Constitution and the American people"" for ""loyalty to D.C. elites and partisan politics.""

HARRIS CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT FROM PUBLIC MEMORIALS HONORING SERVICE MEMBERS KILLED IN AFGHAN EXIT SHE BACKED

""The fact is that Biden and Harris chose to go against the advice of their Joint Chiefs, military, and intelligence advisors, abandoning Afghanistan and giving up the most strategic military stronghold on the global landscape -- Bagram Air Base, which sits between Iraq, Iran, Russia, and China. Worse, they did so before evacuating Americans or our allies. We left behind 20 million women and girls to be sexually enslaved. We left billions of dollars in sensitive equipment and technology. We left our biometric systems that identify our allies. And since then, we've been paying the Taliban up to $87 million a week, mostly in cash, to jihadists sanctioned by the U.S. government, four of whom are on the FBI's top ten most wanted list,"" he said.

BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION IN 'DENIAL' ABOUT BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL, HR MCMASTER SAYS

""For him to lie to the American people he wore the uniform to serve, in order to cover up the atrocities of politicians, is disgraceful,"" he added.

Following Kirby's accidental reply all email, his office offered on the record comment regarding his Monday press conference, saying he stands by his ""comments in the briefing room.""

""While I acknowledge not every veteran agrees with them, I stand by my comments in the briefing room. What was cherry-picked and selective was the report itself. And what's most important is that America's longest war is over and those still serving in uniform are better positioned to meet the threats we face today,"" Kirby said.

House Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee released their own memo shortly after the Republican report this week, accusing Republicans of criticizing the Biden administration for the withdrawal for political purposes.

""When former President Trump took office, there were approximately 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan,"" Meeks wrote. ""Days before leaving office, the former President ordered a further reduction to 2,500. President Trump initiated a withdrawal that was irreversible without sending significantly more American troops to Afghanistan to face renewed combat with the Taliban.""

For veterans critical of the withdrawal, they lamented Afghanistan falling back into the hands of terrorists.

""Afghanistan has gone from 4 Al Qaeda training camps to 52, and the Biden-Harris White House is funding it with U.S. taxpayer dollars,"" Robichaux said in his comments to Fox Digital.

Trump And Harris Duel Over Energy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2024/09/11/trump-and-harris-duel-over-energy/,2024-09-11T18:59:25Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump met for the first time on the debate stage on September 10, 2024, in Philadelphia. Though light on specific policies and plans, the event presented stark contrasts in their approaches to energy, climate, and geopolitics. Among the many topics discussed, both candidates used the occasion to position American energy independence as key to the country's future, unusually highlighting the topic.

Harris was pressed on her shifting position regarding hydraulic fracking, a practice she supported banning while a presidential candidate in 2019, but then reversed her position to match Joe Biden's when she became his Vice President. This shift was part of a pattern during the debate, as the Vice President highlighted increased oil production under the Biden administration as well as new leases for fracking enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act. This shift in policy emphasizing fracking and oil production is likely a bid to increase her support in Pennsylvania, known prominently as the country's second-largest natural gas-producing state. Despite this shift in tone, the Biden/Harris administration did take action to limit offshore drilling.

Pressured again by her change of positions, Harris aimed to reconcile with her position of support for renewables, stating, ""My values have not changed. My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy, so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil."" Though reducing dependence on foreign oil is an admirable goal, geopolitical measures like taking sanctions off Iran allowed Tehran to flood the market with oil. While this may have helped keep oil prices lower, Trump noted it also set the stage for increased Iranian funding of proxies such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, setting the stage for the Hamas October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and subsequent war in the Middle East.

Trump also pushed back on the fracking issue, echoing his previous claims regarding Harris' energy agenda, claiming, ""She will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania would end on day 1 ... oil would be dead, fossil fuels would be dead, we'll go back to windmills and solar."" He went on to exaggerate the area required for solar panels to operate. He went on to criticize the Biden-Harris administration for killing the Keystone XL pipeline. That pipeline would have been expected to carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day to the United States from Canada, making President Biden's cancellation of the project a contradiction to Harris' stated goal of energy independence. Trump also mentioned that while Biden blocked the Keystone pipeline, he waived sanctions on the ill-fated Nord Stream 2 pipeline intended to transport gas from Russia to Germany early in his administration, although this was reversed several months later.

Vice President Harris later focused on green messaging when responding to a question concerning how the candidates would approach climate change. After reminding the audience former President Trump called climate change a hoax, Harris went on to tout the Biden administration's investment into the clean energy economy while pointing out the increase in domestic gas production under Biden. She continued this thread of linking clean energy investment to manufacturing by touting the creation of 800,000 manufacturing jobs, a claim which is somewhat inflated according to revised estimates. While domestic gas production rose under Biden, this is not an improvement that can be primarily attributed to the current administration, rather it's part of a long-standing trend while Biden's pause on LNG exports stymied industry-driven growth and was only recently overturned by the courts rather than the Biden White House recognizing LNG's importance.

Trump fired back at Harris' claims related to manufacturing jobs, focusing specifically on the automotive sector. He focused on China's production capacity, noting, ""What they've given to China is unbelievable, but we won't let that happen. We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country. The Biden administration is destroying manufacturing in this country..."" This highlights the edge China has gained over the United States as a leading manufacturer of green technologies, especially electric vehicles. In framing the green energy transition as an arena for competition with China over manufacturing, Trump used the issue to justify his repeated calls for tariffs.

The debate laid bare the many profound differences between Harris and former Trump, especially regarding energy policy and the geopolitical implications surrounding it. Harris positioned herself as the proponent of a balanced energy transition, emphasizing her administration's record of bolstering clean energy while maintaining domestic oil production. She presented herself as pragmatic, citing investments in the Inflation Reduction Act and showcasing her ability to work across energy sectors, from fossil fuels to renewables. Even though she framed investments made by the IRA as pragmatic, she failed to address that the measure ultimately has little effect on inflation and increases it if anything. This approach contrasts with her statements during the 2020 primary election cycle in which she said during a 2019 CNN Townhall she would ban fracking, a position she walked back during the general election as Biden's running mate. This dodge aims to reassure voters in key swing states like Pennsylvania that her policies won't undermine traditional energy jobs while continuing to push for climate solutions, a key issue for younger generations.

Trump portrayed Harris' energy policies as destructive to American industry, arguing her campaign statements aside, if elected her administration would kill jobs in energy and manufacturing, especially in the auto sector. He paired this with arguments for traditional hydrocarbon production, sharp criticisms of China, and accusations against the Biden-Harris administration of being overly lenient on foreign powers and thus setting conditions for the wars in Europe and the Middle East, with their potential to escalate. By vowing to reintroduce tariffs and protect American jobs through a strong stance on trade, Trump hoped to align himself with working-class American voters.

While both candidates stuck to their recent policy positions and criticisms, the debate is noteworthy as a signal and a historical capstone. Both Trump and Harris approach rhetorical agreement, arguing for increasing American energy production, something which Democrats in the past shied have away from. Both candidates also touted domestic energy production as a prerequisite to their subsequent policy visions - a ""great economy"" from Trump, and a slate of green investments from Harris.

Energy encapsulates so many facets of politics in one - environmentalism and climate change, trade, geopolitical competition, national security, job creation, regulation and permitting, guaranteeing energy policy a spot at the top of the candidates' agenda."
"Jewish Democrat suing Harvard over antisemitism chastises his party for inaction, endorses Trump",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jewish-democrat-suing-harvard-over-antisemitism-chastises-his-party-inaction-endorses-trump,2024-09-11T18:35:46Z,"Jewish activist and recent Harvard graduate Shabbos Kestenbaum, a registered Democrat, tells Fox News Digital he's decided to endorse former President Trump in 2024 because Kamala Harris ""does not deserve our support.""

A Jewish Democrat who is suing Harvard over antisemitism on campus following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel explained to Fox News Digital his decision to endorse former President Donald Trump.

Shabbos Kestenbaum, who's testified before Congress and addressed the Republican National Convention in recent months about antisemitic threats on American college campuses, waited until Sept. 5 to announce that he was endorsing Trump during a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Summit. In an interview with Fox News Digital this week, Kestenbaum, who registered as a Democrat when he turned 18 and has voted for Democratic candidates, including President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., and former Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said he could not support Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

""To sort of paraphrase Ronald Reagan, I don't feel that I've abandoned the Democratic Party. I do feel that the Democratic Party abandoned me,"" Kestenbaum said, explaining that he still supports progressive polices, including a $15 minimum wage, ""reproductive choices for women,"" and ""progressive taxation."" ""But at the end of the day, when American Jewry is facing an existential crisis, we are faced with a binary choice. And I think in the electoral zero-sum game, the binary choice would be President Trump. I think he would just be better for the core issues that are affecting me, that are affecting the American Jewish community.""

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES HARVARD UNIVERSITY MUST FACE ANTISEMITISM LAWSUIT FROM JEWISH STUDENTS

After many months of trying to work with the Harris campaign, the White House and Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate, Kestenbaum said he came to the conclusion that even though he did not vote for Trump in the 2016 or 2020 elections - or even five months ago - he would support him in 2024 because Trump is the ""only realistic and viable option for American Jewry.""

Kestenbaum argued Trump has outlined specific, ""practical policy solutions,"" including withholding federal funds to universities that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and ""giving Israel whatever tools they need to dismantle Hamas and release the hostages,"" while the Biden-Harris administration and Harris' presidential campaign ""have done nothing.""

""They haven't earned our vote. They've ignored our questions or they've given us plainly contradictory answers. And they're taking our votes for granted,"" he said of the Harris campaign. ""So American Jewry, listen up. We will be the deciding factor in this election. There are enough of us in Michigan, in Arizona, in Georgia, in Nevada to really sway this election.""

Because Biden won states like Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by small margins of between 13,000 to 30,000 votes in the 2020 election, and Jewish Americans make up anywhere from 1 to 3% of the population in those states, Kestenbaum said Jewish voters ""will be the crucial deciding factor"" in 2024. According to Kestenbaum, Trump is on track to receive the most Jewish votes for any Republican presidential nominee since President Dwight Eisenhower, which he credits to the Trump campaign as having ""really been courting the Jewish vote in a way that the Harris campaign just never has.""

JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENT: TOO OFTEN STUDENTS AT HARVARD ARE TAUGHT NOT HOW TO THINK, BUT WHAT TO THINK

""Jewish Americans will be pivotal in this election,"" Kestenbaum said. ""What I would urge the Jewish communities across the country, what I would urge my community, is we know what our issues are.""

""And I urge you, if you care about those policy prescriptions, if you care about the releasing of the hostages, you care about the strengthening of the U.S.-Israel relationship, you care about combating antisemitism on our college campuses, just look at the facts. Look at the data,"" he said. ""Harris has not outlined anything she would do specifically to alleviate those concerns. President Trump has. I get we don't like his persona. I get we don't like many of his policies. But at the end of the day, we are facing an existential issue. And I think there's only one viable choice, and that's President Trump.""

Kestenbaum said when he spoke to the RNC in July, he ad-libbed significant portions of his speech from the teleprompter to omit the parts explicitly endorsing Trump because he wanted to show he was ""bipartisan"" and keep an open mind before attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago the next month. It took him two hours to get back to his seat after addressing the RNC because so many people came up to him with messages of support and prayers for the hostages who remained held in Gaza, he said.

Kestenbaum said he told DNC leadership that if they didn't want to amplify him at the convention, then at least consider amplifying other Jewish students ""who are fighting for their civil rights on college campuses, who are experiencing unprecedented antisemitism, and we never got a response.""

When he first testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee about his experiences of antisemitism on Harvard's campus after Oct. 7, Kestenbaum said ""it was pretty remarkable that the majority of the Democratic leadership didn't even show up, and then the ranking Democratic member, Bobby Scott, he used his opening remarks to criticize Republicans for focusing on antisemitism. 'We need to be combating Islamophobia. We need to be combatting sexism,' which is true in theory, but had nothing to do with the reality on the ground and what we were there to testify on.""

""And I didn't want to say anything. I want it to be bipartisan or even nonpartisan. But these incidents just kept on happening. And whether it was the House Judiciary Committee ranking member, Democrat Jerry Nadler, falling asleep when I was giving testimony, it was deeply hurtful and offensive,"" Kestenbaum said. ""And again, I didn't want to say these things because I'm a Democrat and I went to the Democratic convention with an open mind and also with a mission to sort of change my party, to steer them into it, into a direction that would be more palpable for me and American Jewry. And it was very clear that at least for this election in 2024, they're either unable or unwilling to make serious inroads with the American Jewish community. And that's a direct result of them taking us for granted for decades.""

He said he is still a registered Democrat and ""is not ready to throw in the towel yet,"" but he can't decide why the Democratic Party is increasingly shifting toward more anti-Israel rhetoric.

""The state of Israel is a progressive issue. I mean, this is a place where not only can LGBTQ individuals be full members of society, but they serve in Israeli parliament,"" he said. ""This is a hotbed of democracy in an otherwise volatile, regressive region of the world. Israel is a vital ally that provides intelligence gathering to the United States. So why are we de-legitimizing? Why are we demoting a staunchly progressive ally? And I can't understand why my Democratic Party insist that this is proper politics.""

He also took issue with Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress earlier this year, and for what he categorized as inadequate policy proposals on the Israel-Hamas war that the Democratic nominee finally added to her campaign website this week 50 days after entering the race.

""If Kamala Harris is working around the clock to secure a cease-fire deal and the return of the hostages, then I would shudder to think what four more years would do because she is not working around the clock. And if she is, she's doing a pretty crappy job at that,"" Kestenbaum told Fox News Digital. ""She does not deserve our support. She does not deserve our votes. It's also telling that after 50 days of having zero policies, she doesn't outline policy. She outlines aspirations and goals. Nothing. Nothing that she said on her website, in the one interview she has given, talks about the dismantling of Hamas as a terrorist organization.""

""If a cease fire was agreed to, Hamas would still be in power,"" he continued. ""It is laughable to say that she is working around the clock when we know that President Biden has been eating ice cream on the beaches of Delaware for almost the entirety of the summer. And if she is working around the clock, then as I said, she's doing a bad job. And why would we want her to continue to work around the clock for four years when she can't even get the job done now? So we don't need what I like to call the Beatle-Juicing of a cease fire, simply stating it three times and hoping that it'll appear. We need bold action. Under her leadership, under her watch, 45 Americans were killed in the Middle East, eight American hostages are still being held, and she talks nothing about dismantling this terrorist organization to prevent this from ever happening again.""

Harris' website mentions Israel under a subsection titled, ""Stand With Our Allies, Stand Up to Dictators, and Lead on the World Stage,"" where the campaign promises Harris ""will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to protect U.S. forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups."" It goes on to say Harris ""will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and she will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself"" and she and Biden ""are working to end the war in Gaza, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination."" The campaign vows the vice president and Biden ""are working around the clock to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done."""
International press reacts to Trump-Harris debate as world watches 'fiery debate',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/international-press-reacts-trump-harris-debate-world-watches-fiery-debate,2024-09-11T16:53:08Z,"A Fox News Digital focus group of voters across the board shared who they believe won the face-off between the 2024 candidates at Tuesday night's debate.

It was not only Americans tuning into the U.S. presidential debate Tuesday night as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris faced off for the first time.

The results of the November election are expected to have resounding consequences for U.S. policy abroad, and the international community has been paying close attention following President Biden's drop from the race this July.

The reactions by the international press to the Tuesday night debate drew stark comparisons from Trump's first debate, which largely focused on heightened concerns surrounding Biden's cognitive abilities.

This time, though, Trump's performance was in their crosshairs.

KAMALA HARRIS, DONALD TRUMP DEBATE PROMPTS MAJOR ENDORSEMENT, FOX NEWS INVITATION FOR A 2ND FACE-OFF

The U.K. press, notoriously divided along party lines, reflected critical evaluations of how Trump performed under pressure from former prosecutor Harris, who was determined to have successfully achieved what so many of Trump's opponents have been unable to - she flustered him.

Three of the right-leaning Telegraph's leading stories on the debate suggested Harris came out on top, with one headline reading ""Harris puts Trump on defensive in fiery showdown,"" while another report described Trump's performance as ""furious"" and ""rambled.""

In analyzing the champion of the debate, the report concluded that Harris ""made [Trump] look ridiculous.""

""It is difficult to crown Harris the victor of a political debate in which she said so little about her own platform. But her attack strategy won her the night. Trump fell for it: hook line and sinker,"" the report added.

The Times of London, generally considered a conservative-leaning newspaper, reported that Trump ""struggled"" through the debate, while another report criticized that he ""leaned"" into his base rather than going after moderate voters after they claimed he brought up a debunked claim that migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were ""eating the pets"" of residents.

A third report on the Times' homepage read, ""Strong night for Harris gets better with Taylor Swift endorsement.""

The Sun had more divided takeaways of the night with one report claiming Trump ""ripped into Harris"" while another highlighted a politics expert who called Trump's debate talking points ""Nonsense"" and also highlighted his ""meltdown over 'migrants eating pets'.""

TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE: BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT WEIGHS IN ON HIGH-STAKES FACE-OFF: 'FELL INTO THE TRAP'

The French press gave the win to Harris, with Le Monde, the nation's top publication, leading with a headline that read ""Harris, on offense, wins debate against Trump.""

L'Express, a Paris-based magazine described as center-right, also argued Trump was on the defensive Tuesday night in its report titled, ""'Kamala Harris has started to bang on Trump' - the debate seen by the foreign press.""

The leading story on the publicly funded news outlet Deutsche Welle was headed by, ""Harris puts Trump on defensive in fiery debate"" and claimed pollsters showed Harris ""narrowly won"" over Trump.

Though the report also noted the debate is unlikely to have an impact on U.S. voters - a sentiment broadly expressed in reporting across the U.S. as well.

Russian state-owned media TASS did not have any mention of the U.S. debate on its homepage.

While state-run news agency RIA Novosti lightly covered the debate, with one report headlined ""Trump is doomed.""

A second report pointed to a response issued by the German Foreign Office following comments made by Trump during his closing remarks that criticized Berlin's push toward clean energy.

The report included a response by the ministry posted to X, which said, ""Like it or not: Germany's energy system is fully operational, with more than 50% renewables. And we are shutting down - not building - coal & nuclear plants. Coal will be off the grid by 2038 at the latest.

""PS: We also don't eat cats and dogs,"" the ministry added in an apparent jab at Trump's previous debate comments.

HUGE MAJORITY OF DEBATE WATCHERS SAY HARRIS TOOK HOME THE VICTORY, CNN POLL FINDS

In Ukraine - where the results of the 2024 election are expected to have a significant impact given Trump's previous comments suggesting he will not continue to militarily support Kyiv - reports focused on the combative exchange between Trump and Harris.

The Kyiv Independent honed in on Trump's claims that he will have the war ""settled"" before even taking up the top job if elected this November - though he has refused to detail how he will accomplish this.

The report did not name a winner or a loser, though it pointed out the two engaged in a bitter clash over the issue of Russia's invasion and highlighted Trump's refusal to say whether he wants Ukraine to come out on top.

Israeli publications appeared to have more heavily covered the debate, though both candidates spent little time discussing the war between Israel and Hamas, and Harris was largely deemed the frontrunner.

One report by Israel Hayom, a right-leaning outlet, said Harris was ""exuding confidence and control"" and accused Trump of appearing ""self-absorbed rather than voter-focused.""

The report said there was no clear ""knockout"" winner, but added the debate ""was a genuine rhetorical slugfest in which Harris successfully exploited Trump's weak spots and knocked him off balance.""

The Jerusalem Post, also deemed to have conservative tendencies in its reporting, described the debate as ""predictable"" but noted Trump's ""apocalyptic prediction"" that Israel would cease to exist under a Harris presidency was a ""reach"" and ""oddly depriv[ed] the Jewish state of any agency or capacity to survive."""
11 Takeaways From Kamala Harris And Donald Trump's Presidential Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2024/09/11/11-takeaways-from-the-kamala-harris---donald-trump-presidential-debate/,2024-09-11T15:35:35Z,"In a face-off, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took to the stage in Pennsylvania in a fiery debate for the Oval Office, laying out their sharply contrasting visions for America's future.

Moderated by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, the debate kicked off with immediate tension, as former President Trump focused on his familiar themes: border security and economic recovery, repeatedly pointing to his claim of record-breaking tariffs and tough immigration policies.

Vice President Harris called out what she framed as Trump's failures, including public health mismanagement, saying Trump's administration had triggered a public health epidemic. Harris also ripped into Trump's recession-prone economic plan and his response to the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Sensitive issues like race, abortion, and voting rights also took center stage, with Harris accusing Trump of worsening the country's divides. Trump was also challenged for his misleading comments about winning the 2020 election.

The debate, which was different from the 2020 presidential debate, with no audience, saw the two presidential hopefuls rip into each other's policies, with words like ""weak"" and ""stupid"" thrown about. Here are 11 key takeaways from the U.S. presidential debate.

In the first few minutes of her speech, Harris focused on the middle class, young families, and small businesses, pushing her bold ""opportunity economy"" plan by offering tax breaks for small businesses and a $6,000 tax cut for growing families. Her pledge: to lead as president for all Americans and act as a unifying buffer for both sides.

Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on immigration and dismissed Harris' vision as a socialist threat. Trump fired at Joe Biden's policies and criticized Harris for aligning with what he called Marxism, claiming that the Biden administration's policies had deteriorated the U.S. economy and led it into economic disaster. Trump also painted Harris as an advocate for Marxism, warning viewers that her economic plans would stifle economic growth.

Harris, in response, dismissed these attacks, emphasizing that her ""opportunity economy"" was aimed at uplifting middle-class families, not just the wealthy elite, drawing a sharp contrast between her inclusive economic vision and Trump's policies, which she argued favored only the rich. Trump, in turn, fired back, stating that Harris' leadership was eroding the economy and depriving the American people of being able to afford basic groceries.

During the debate, Trump repeatedly zeroed in on immigration, noting it as a core issue of American national security and patriotism.

Trump argued that his border policies had kept America safe and emphasized that a softening of these policies under Harris would open the country to job losses, crime, and economic regression. He pointed to his administration's success in implementing tariffs and border security measures as a defense against what he labeled as ""radical socialist"" policies from Harris. His rhetoric on immigration was designed to appeal to his base, framing the border as a frontline issue that threatened the livelihood and safety of everyday Americans.

Harris, on the other hand, aimed to reach voters from a collaborative standpoint, welcoming voters to approach the election with unity and humanity. By leaning into her history as a public servant, Harris aimed to appeal to the people and chart a new path.

In a particularly impassioned moment, Trump began to passionately speak about the harm that undocumented immigrants were causing, citing baseless stories that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio -- a claim that moderator David Muir quickly challenged.

The abortion debate was one of the most heated exchanges of the night, with Harris passionately defending Roe v. Wade and women's rights.

Trump accused Harris of advocating for executing babies post-birth; Harris argued that her policies were centered around humanizing the conversation by focusing on the personal toll these decisions would have on families, either because of incest or rape.

Trump, in contrast, reiterated his pro-life stance but admitted that he would consider exceptions for abortion in cases of incest and rape. He positioned himself as the candidate who would protect religious freedom.

At the same time, Harris emphasized the need to separate government from personal medical decisions, particularly for women, and held Trump accountable for putting women through something ""unconscionable."" Harris argued for the reinstatement of Roe v. Wade to set protections in place for women to make collaborative decisions about their healthcare with their providers.

The candidates clashed over their approaches to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Harris said that it was important to uphold international humanitarian law while supporting Israel's right to defend itself. She criticized Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting that his presidency had weakened America's global standing and that her administration would pursue a ceasefire and a two-state solution.

Trump, meanwhile, argued that such conflicts would have never happened under his leadership, accusing Harris of abandoning Israel. He also claimed that Iran's growing influence was a direct result of Biden's weak policies, which he said had allowed terror groups like Hamas to thrive.

Trump claimed he could have ended the war between Russia and Ukraine before it began, positioning himself as a proficient leader who commands respect from adversaries like Vladimir Putin. He blamed Biden's ""weak"" foreign policy for allowing the conflict to escalate with no foresight.

Harris, in contrast, defended the Biden administration's support of Ukraine and echoed the need for Americans to stand up for democratic values. She argued that Trump's admiration for dictators like Putin only emboldened autocrats, and that his foreign policy record was filled with mistakes that destabilized global security.

Like with other issues, Trump and Harris offered different views on the state of the American economy. Trump framed his presidency as one of unprecedented economic growth, boasting job creation and record stock market highs.

At the same time, Harris blamed the former Trump administration for the ""worst economy since the Great Depression.""

Trump pointed to inflation and rising gas and grocery prices as evidence of Democratic failure, but Harris fired back by pointing to her economic plans, which she argues would focus on tax relief for middle-class families, investment in clean energy jobs, and $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers. Harris also positioned herself as a unifying bridge between both parties, arguing that addressing economic inequality and creating a fair economy would benefit all Americans.

The candidates' debate over national security was a flashpoint, with Trump painting Harris as weak and unprepared to handle global threats. He claimed that during his presidency, countries like China, Russia, and North Korea were ""afraid"" of him, and that his strength had kept the world more stable.

Harris pushed back, challenging Trump's problematic relationships with authoritarian leaders and his tendency to admire dictators. She emphasized the importance of diplomacy, alliances, and upholding America's role as a leader in promoting global security and democracy. Harris also advocated for strength in national security, which means respecting and supporting the U.S. military and its veterans, which she accused Trump of neglecting.

Racial division was another major topic, with Harris accusing Trump of using race to divide the country. She recalled Trump's history of racial discrimination and raised his refusal to rent to Black tenants in the 1970s to his comments on the Central Park Five. The issue of race was brought up when Muir asked Trump about his comments on Harris' race.

Harris, on the other hand, positioned herself as a unifying political figure who would be committed to addressing systemic racism and healing the divisions that have widened under Trump's leadership.

During the debate, the moderator Muir grilled Trump about the January 6th riots at the Capitol and whether he regretted the incident, but the former president did not provide a direct response. Rather, he addressed other topics, challenging the Biden administration for their lackluster response to riots in Minneapolis.

This lack of direct acknowledgment has since drawn attention from critics who have raised concerns about Trump's evasion and his response to the rioters. In contrast, Harris took the opportunity to condemn the violence of January 6, 2021, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic institutions and holding individuals accountable.

Harris strongly positioned herself as an advocate for climate action and promised to continue expanding renewable energy and reducing America's dependence on fossil fuels. She also criticized Trump's lackadaisical approach to climate change, which Trump dismissed and, in contrast, doubled down on his support for deregulating the fossil fuel industry. He argued that his policies had led to American energy independence, while Harris' plans would cripple the economy with excessive regulations and economy-crippling green initiatives.

Apart from seemingly sidestepping questions about the January 6th riots, Trump also denied any association with Project 2025, a policy agenda outlined by the Heritage Foundation. The initiative, which includes plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce and increase executive power, has been met with both support and criticism from different political factions.

Trump distanced himself from the project during the debate, insisting that it was not part of his campaign strategy, despite speculation about his alignment with its goals. His denial came as part of a broader effort to reframe his policy vision, focusing instead on familiar themes like immigration and the economy, while avoiding detailed discussions on controversial policy proposals tied to his potential second term.

Harris did not hold back when addressing Trump's criminal history during the debate. She pointed to the former president's legal battles, including ongoing investigations and indictments.

Since the debate, political analysts have continued to dissect the two contenders' strategy, responses and optics on the debate stage, with some arguing that both candidates did not answer certain questions around economy, immigration and policy as closely as they should have. With less than eight weeks left to election day, this debate will be critical in moving the needle in terms of who wins America's ultimate vote."
"The risk of another 9/11 is greater than ever, thanks to these Biden-Harris policies",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-risk-of-another-9-11-greater-than-ever-thanks-biden-harris-policies,2024-09-11T11:12:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Last December, FBI Director Wray told Congress he'd never in his career seen so many threats against the United States as he did then. There were ""blinking lights everywhere,"" he said, a reference to a chapter in the 9/11 Commission Report's titled ""The System Was Blinking Red.""

Nine months later, as we mark the 23rd anniversary of the horrific terrorist strike that left 2,977 American dead, the chances of a repeat attack are just as high - if not higher.

This is a direct result of the Biden-Harris administration's actions and inactions, which have left America less secure at home and at grave risk abroad.

For example, as the president and vice president took office in 2021, Iran-backed actors found they could launch attacks with near impunity. According to U.S. Central Command, from 2021 until March 2023, Iran-backed proxies launched ""about 78"" attacks on U.S. force in Iraq and Syria, and faced a response only three times.

BIDEN-HARRIS CAN'T LEAD AND IT EMBOLDENS OUR ENEMIES

Since then, attacks by Iranian proxies on U.S. forces have only escalated further, with more than 230 attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq, Syria and Jordan in 2023 alone, more than any year during the Trump administration.

Similar policy results are evident in the Red Sea, where the oil tanker Sounion is currently leaking oil as a result of undeterred Houthi attacks, constituting a grave environmental disaster and raising global energy prices. And it could get worse - the Houthi attack on the Sounion may cause the largest-ever ship-sourced oil spill.

The policies of the Biden-Harris administration have provided unprecedented resources to terrorist organizations and to Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism. Despite the collective counsel of military leaders and his Cabinet, President Biden and Vice President Harris directed the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

KAMALA HARRIS PRESIDENCY WOULD UNDERMINE US IN THIS KEY REGION

The result: 13 American service members died and control of the country reverted to the Taliban, along with tens of billions of dollars of abandoned equipment and infrastructure. It was the first of 11 diplomatic facilities - a record - abandoned by the Biden-Harris administration.

On the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we handed the world's largest terrorist sanctuary back to those we wrested it from. Worse, the Biden-Harris administration continues to fund the terrorist Taliban regime to whom al Qaeda has pledged its fealty. As one of the many who participated in the initial response to 9/11, it is especially grievous, knowing the price paid and appreciating that others may be called to respond against an adversary we equipped.

Today, ISIS is resurgent in Afghanistan and Africa and has claimed external attacks in Russia and France. Taylor Swift's European concert tour was abruptly curtailed as a result of credible threats. Al Qaeda's leader, Saif al-Adl, who fled Kabul after our invasion in October 2001, now resides in Iran as a guest of the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism.

KAMALA HARRIS LACKS THE MINIMUM SKILLS SET TO BE PRESIDENT

Iran itself has been the greatest beneficiary of Biden-Harris largesse. The administration has provided the regime unprecedented access to resources, nearly $100 billion since 2021. This has fueled its nuclear program, regional terrorism, and assassination attempts against former President Trump and former administration officials responsible for bankrupting them and confronting the threats of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. And it has accelerated Iran's ballistic missile and drone programs.

In April 2021, the Biden-Harris administration reversed Trump's decision to cease funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, ignoring the evidence that UNWRA provided support to Hamas.

The Biden-Harris policies of appeasement have led Iran and its Axis of Resistance to engage in non-stop attacks against U.S., Israeli and partners interests, which spiked beginning in 2021 and accelerated after the horrific attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, when 32 Americans were killed - the deadliest terrorist attacks against the U.S. since 9/11.

BIDEN'S MORAL EQUIVALENCY BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS WILL RESULT IN FAILURE -- AGAIN

Three U.S. soldiers were killed in Jordan by Iranian-sponsored proxies in January 2024. After the death of Hamas leader Ismail Hanieyah in Tehran, U.S. forces were attacked in Iraq and Syria, resulting in seven casualties without a response. American Hersh Goldberg-Polin's body was recovered on Aug. 31 after his brutal execution by Hamas. Seven Americans remain Hamas hostages.

That's not all, sadly. The Biden-Harris administration has also systemically dismantled our border security, resulting in the entry of some 12 million illegal immigrants, 1,800 individuals listed on the terrorist watchlist (that we know of), and 70,000 to 80,000 Special Interest Aliens each year from dangerous countries.

In May, two were arrested after attempting to breach the Marine Corps Base in Quantico. In June, eight Tajiks affiliated with ISIS were detained in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York City. In August, the FBI indicted a Pakistani man attempting to assassinate the former president and other former American officials.

Decades of neglect and the current administration's dismantling of global deterrence invites aggression and courts disaster. The recent Congressional Commission on the National Defense Strategy reaffirmed the conclusions of Heritage's 10th Annual Index of U.S. Military Strength, concluding our military's capability and capacity is insufficient to deter and respond to the growing threats arrayed against us.

Twenty-three years ago, systemic structural issues, along with the fact that we ignored abundant warning signs, led to the worst terrorist attack in our history. Today it's clear that we're at greater risk at home and abroad. Yet the threats we face have been appeased, ignored, resourced, and allowed unprecedented access to our homeland via an open border under the Biden-Harris administration.

Trump's administration confronted the threat of ISIS by defeating its caliphate and killing its leader. He stood up to Tehran, bankrupting its military and eliminating its most capable leader, Qassem Soleimani. He also closed our border and prevented terrorist infiltration.

"Global war on terror rages as ISIS, al Qaeda expand 23 years after 9/11",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/global-war-terror-rages-isis-al-qaeda-expand-23-years-after-9-11,2024-09-11T08:10:08Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. by al Qaeda jihadists changed the future of security for not only Washington, but for nations on every inhabited continent worldwide -- sparking the Global War on Terror that continues to this day.

More than 20 years have passed since 19 hijackers boarded four commercial flights and crashed into the Twin Towers in New York City, the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., and an empty field in Pennsylvania after passengers on United Airlines flight 93 thwarted what is believed to have been an attempt to strike either the U.S. Capitol or the White House.

The plan, outlined by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, killed 2,977 victims 23 years ago in what remains the largest terrorist attack in history and set in motion a global fight against extremism.

But despite the end to the U.S. war in Afghanistan and declared defeat over Islamic terrorist organizations like al Qaeda and the Islamic State, experts warn the threat posed by extremist groups remains acute to this day.

TOP GENERAL IN FIGHT AGAINST THE TALIBAN SAYS AFGHANISTAN HAS ONCE AGAIN BECOME A 'CRUCIBLE OF TERRORISM'

""The threat has evolved,"" Bill Roggio, senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of the Long War Journal, told Fox News Digital. ""It's certainly much more difficult to launch a 9/11 style attack, but there's much more opportunity for jihadists from both al Qaeda and the Islamic State to launch individual attacks, such as we've witnessed over the last decade and a half particularly.

""Prior to 9/11, al Qaeda was operating openly in Afghanistan and on cellular level, in dozens of countries. And now there are safe havens and battlefields with 10s of 1000s of fighters that exist throughout the world,"" he added.

The 2024 Global Terrorism Index released by the Institute for Economics & Peace in February analyzed the effects of terrorism over the previous year and found that deaths from terrorism increased by 22% from 2022 and ""are now at their highest level since 2017.""

The jump in terrorist-related deaths last year, which does include the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, are still 23% lower than at the global peak seen in 2015, though the Institute only began releasing the GTI report over a decade into the Global War on Terror in 2012.

While attacks by terrorist groups are once again on the rise and there is immense terrorist activity in the Middle East with the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's vigorous backing of terrorist groups like Hezbollah, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and subsequent safe haven granted to al Qaeda, and continuous ISIS attacks in Iraq and Syria against coalition forces, the Middle East is no longer the ""epicenter"" of terrorist activity.

""The epicentre of terrorism has shifted from the Middle East and North Africa into sub-Saharan Africa, concentrated largely in the Sahel region. This region now accounts for almost half of all deaths from terrorism globally,"" the GTI report found, noting that deaths from terrorism in the Sahel grew by 38% in 2023 from 2022.

Complex security and humanitarian crises driven by poor regional leadership and immense economic hardship have created a vacuum in places like Burkina Faso -- which alone accounted for nearly a quarter of all terrorism related deaths globally, as over 1,900 people were killed in 258 reported incidents last year.

2023 marked the first time since the Institute began releasing the GTI report over a decade ago that a country other than Afghanistan or Iraq was listed at the top of the index as the nation most impacted by terrorism in 2023.

3 YEARS AFTER US WITHDRAWAL FROM AFGHANISTAN, ISRAEL LOOKS TO LESSONS LEARNED FROM WAR ON TERROR

The State Department assesses that ISIS-Sahel and JNIM, an al Qaeda affiliate, are the most active terrorist groups in Burkino Faso, with JNIM having taken credit for the majority of claimed attacks in the country.

Though Burkina Faso was also ranked among the nations globally where attacks were not attributed to any specific group -- a trend most seen in areas where ISIS operates.

Charles Lister, Director of the Syria and Countering Terrorism & Extremism programs at the Middle East Institute (MEI), explained ISIS is one of the first terrorist organizations ever to routinely not claim credit for its attack in a ""clear attempt to conceal its activities from the international community.""

ISIS was declared defeated in December 2018 by Donald Trump, but experts have been sounding the alarm that the terrorist group is continuing to grow and expand its influence globally.

""We inflicted at best...an operational or tactical defeat. We did not inflict a strategic defeat on the Islamic State,"" Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Nagata, former Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) and an MEI Distinguished Senior Fellow on National Security, said during an event hosted by MEI on Tuesday.

""The evidence for our failure to inflict a strategic defeat of the Islamic State is best demonstrated by the fact we now have ISIS franchises stretching all the way from the western coast of Africa to the entire area of South Asia,"" he added. ""No other terrorist group, in my experience, has ever been able to build a global network of that size, sophistication, capable of using modern technology to conduct terrorist activities.""

ISIS THREAT RISING IN SYRIA, IRAQ AS US MILITARY WARNS TERROR ATTACKS COULD DOUBLE IN 2024

Attacks by IS and its affiliates accounted for 14% of all attacks worldwide last year according to the GTI report -- a figure it also noted was likely much higher in reality.

""[ISIS] has managed to tap into local conflicts and ungoverned spaces in a way that we've never seen al Qaeda succeed,"" Lister, a senior fellow with MEI told reporters this week. ""I think that's real cause for concern.""

ISIS, like other Islamic terrorist organizations including al Qaeda, has the strategic aim of collecting territory for the purpose of establishing a caliphate -- a governing system based on strict interpretations of Sharia law.

Though despite its expansion outside the Middle East, the nation most affected by the Islamic State is still Syria, where U.S. and coalition forces continue to combat the terrorist network.

The U.S., in coordination with allied forces in Iraq and Syria, have engaged in some 200 operations against ISIS this year alone, the majority of which have been carried out in Iraq.

Though despite the upswing in anti-ISIS missions in Iraq, the Pentagon this week confirmed it is in discussions with Iraqi officials over the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces by September 2025.

Currently, there are some 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq that work with Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish security forces to carry out the Defeat ISIS Mission, along with another 900 U.S. forces in Syria.

But security experts are deeply concerned over how this withdrawal could negatively affect the mission in Syria -- an area where the U.S. and coalition forces already have a more difficult time countering ISIS efforts, in part due to Iran-backed militias.

""That will have a knock-on effect on our ability to operate in Syria. It will likely mean we will leave Syria, and then we've got a whole lot of things to worry about,"" warned Lister.

The expert warned the only way to combat ISIS is to work with a coalition of nations to collect better intelligence and work against the terrorist group.

But ultimately, Nagata warned ISIS will remain until nations figure out a way to address deeper socio-economic and human rights-based issues.

""The hardest thing about dealing with a terrorist group, particularly one as gifted as the Islamic State, is defeating their idea, and that is not something that you do with a rifle or a hand grenade or a missile strike,"" he said. ""We could tactically defeat them until the cows come home, and it won't solve the problem,"" he said."
11 Important Takeaways From The Historic U.S. Presidential Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2024/09/11/11-important-takeaways-from-the-historic-us-presidential-debate/,2024-09-11T04:23:59Z,"In a historic face-off, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took to the stage in Pennsylvania in a fiery debate for the Oval Office, laying out their sharply contrasting visions for America's future. Moderated by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, the consequential debate kicked off with immediate tension, with former President Donald Trump focused on his familiar themes: border security and economic recovery, repeatedly pointing to his claim of record-breaking tariffs and tough immigration policies. Harris called out what she framed as Trump's failures -- public health mismanagement, saying Trump's administration had triggered a public health epidemic. Harris also ripped into Trump's recession-prone economic plan and his response to the January 6th attack. Sensitive issues like race, abortion, and voting rights also took center stage, with Harris accusing Trump of worsening the country's divides. Trump was also challenged for his controversial and misleading comments about winning the 2020 election.

The debate, which was distinctly different from the 2020 presidential debate, with no audience, saw the two presidential hopefuls rip into each other's policies, with words like ""weak"" and ""stupid"" thrown about. Here are 11 key takeaways from the US presidential debate.

In the first few minutes of her speech, Harris focused on the middle class, young families, and small businesses, pushing her bold ""opportunity economy"" plan by offering tax breaks for small businesses and a $6,000 tax cut for growing families. Her pledge: to lead as president for all Americans and act as a unifying buffer for both sides. Meanwhile, Donald Trump focused on doubling down on immigration and dismissing Harris's vision as a socialist threat. Trump fired at Joe Biden's policies and criticized Harris for aligning with what he called Marxism, claiming that their policies had deteriorated the US economy and led it into economic disaster. Trump also painted Harris as an advocate for Marxism, warning viewers that her economic plans would stifle economic growth. Harris, in response, dismissed these attacks, emphasizing that her ""opportunity economy"" was aimed at uplifting middle-class families, not just the wealthy elite, drawing a sharp contrast between her inclusive economic vision and Trump's policies, which she argued favored only the rich. Trump, in turn, fired back, stating that Harris' leadership was eroding the economy and depriving the American people of being able to afford basic groceries.

During the debate, Trump repeatedly zeroed in on immigration, noting it as a core issue of American national security and patriotism. Trump argued that his border policies had kept America safe and emphasized that a softening of these policies under Harris would open the country to job losses, crime, and economic regression. He pointed to his administration's success in implementing tariffs and border security measures as a defense against what he labeled as ""radical socialist"" policies from Harris. His rhetoric on immigration was designed to appeal to his base, framing the border as a frontline issue that threatened the livelihood and safety of everyday Americans. Harris, on the other hand, aimed to approach voters from a collaborative standpoint, welcoming voters to approach the election with unity and humanity. By leaning into her history as a public servant, Harris aimed to appeal to the people and chart a new path. In a particularly impassioned moment, Trump began to passionately speak about the harm that undocumented immigrants were causing, citing that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, a claim that moderator David Muir quickly challenged.

The abortion debate was one of the most heated exchanges of the night, with Harris passionately defending Roe v. Wade and women's rights. While Trump accused Harris of advocating for executing babies post-birth, Harris argued that her policies were centered around humanizing the conversation by focusing on the personal toll these decisions would have on families, either because of incest or rape. Trump, in contrast, reiterated his pro-life stance but admitted that he would consider exceptions for abortion in cases of incest and rape. He positioned himself as the candidate who would protect religious freedom. At the same time, Harris emphasized the need to separate government from personal medical decisions, particularly for women, and held Trump accountable for putting women through something ""unconscionable."" Harris argued for the reinstatement of Roe v. Wade to set protections in place for women to make collaborative decisions about their healthcare with their providers.

Both candidates clashed over their approaches to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Harris said that it was important to uphold international humanitarian law while supporting Israel's right to defend itself. She criticized Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting that his presidency had weakened America's global standing and that a ceasefire and a two-state solution would be pursued under her administration. Trump, meanwhile, argued that such conflicts would have never happened under his leadership, accusing Harris of abandoning Israel. He also claimed that Iran's growing influence was a direct result of Biden's weak policies, which he said had allowed terror groups like Hamas to thrive.

Trump claimed he could have ended the war between Russia and Ukraine before it began, positioning himself as a proficient leader who commands respect from adversaries like Vladimir Putin. He blamed Biden's ""weak"" foreign policy for allowing the conflict to escalate with no foresight. Harris, in contrast, defended the Biden administration's support of Ukraine and echoed the need for Americans to stand up for democratic values. She argued that Trump's admiration for dictators like Putin only emboldened autocrats, and that his foreign policy record was filled with mistakes that destabilized global security.

Like other raised issues, Trump and Harris offered different views on the state of the American economy. Trump framed his presidency as one of unprecedented economic growth, boasting job creation and record stock market highs. At the same time, Harris blamed the former Trump administration for the ""worst economy since the Great Depression."" He pointed to inflation and rising gas and grocery prices as evidence of Democratic failure, but Harris fired back by pointing to her economic plans, which she argues would focus on tax relief for middle-class families, investment in clean energy jobs, and $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers. Harris also positioned herself as a unifying bridge between both parties, arguing that addressing economic inequality and creating a fair economy would benefit all Americans.

The candidates' debate over national security was a flashpoint, with Trump painting Harris as weak and unprepared to handle global threats. He claimed that during his presidency, countries like China, Russia, and North Korea were ""afraid"" of him, and that his strength had kept the world more stable. Harris pushed back, challenging Trump's problematic relationships with authoritarian leaders and his tendency to admire dictators. She emphasized the importance of diplomacy, alliances, and upholding America's role as a leader in promoting global security and democracy. Harris also advocated for strength in national security, which means respecting and supporting the U.S. military and its veterans, which she accused Trump of neglecting.

Racial division was another major topic, with Harris accusing Trump of using race to divide the country. She recalled Trump's history of racial discrimination and raised his refusal to rent to Black tenants in the 1970s to his comments on the Central Park Five. The issue of race was brought up when Muir asked Trump about his comments on Harris' race. Harris, on the other hand, positioned herself as a unifying political figure who would be committed to addressing systemic racism and healing the divisions that have widened under Trump's leadership.

During the debate, David Muir grilled Trump about the January 6th riots at the Capitol and whether he regretted the incident, but the former president did not provide a direct response. Rather, he addressed other topics, challenging the Biden administration for their lackluster response to the riots in Minneapolis. This lack of direct acknowledgment has since drawn attention from critics who have raised concerns about Trump's evasion and his response to the rioters. In contrast, Harris took the opportunity to condemn the violence of January 6, 2021, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic institutions and holding individuals accountable.

Harris strongly positioned herself as an advocate for climate action and promised to continue expanding renewable energy and reducing America's dependence on fossil fuels. She also criticized Trump's lackadaisical approach to climate change, which Trump dismissed and, in contrast, doubled down on his support for deregulating the fossil fuel industry. He argued that his policies had led to American energy independence, while Harris's plans would cripple the economy with excessive regulations and economy-crippling green initiatives.

Apart from seemingly sidestepping questions about the January 6th riots, Trump also denied any association with Project 2025, a policy agenda outlined by the Heritage Foundation to take over the federal government. The initiative, which includes plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce and increase executive power, has been met with both support and criticism from different political factions. Trump distanced himself from the project during the debate, insisting that it was not part of his campaign strategy, despite speculation about his alignment with its goals. His denial came as part of a broader effort to reframe his policy vision, focusing instead on familiar themes like immigration and the economy, while avoiding detailed discussions on controversial policy proposals tied to his potential second term.

SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris prepare to go head-to-head for the first time on the debate stage in battleground Pennsylvania.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She was in charge of the border. It's the worst border in the history of the world. There's never been a country that allowed 21 million people to come in over a three-year period.

KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts and to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits.

BREAM (voice-over): The candidates going on the attack over the top issues for voters, from the border crisis to the economy, and guns after yet another school shooting in America -- all sure to come up at Tuesday's debate.

We'll hear from senators from both sides of the aisle, Republican John Cornyn, who represents the key border state of Texas, which has struggled to deal with millions of migrants, and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, a Harris-Walz campaign surrogate.

Then --

REPORTER: Do you think your father might pardon you now that he's no longer running for re-election?

BREAM: A twist in the Hunter Biden saga as the embattled first son pleads guilty to federal tax evasion charges, sparing the family a lengthy and potentially embarrassing trial.

We'll get reaction from our Sunday panel who also weigh in on how judges in two of Trump's four criminal cases may test the bounds of his Supreme Court presidential immunity victory.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM (on camera): Hello from FOX News in Washington.

Here's a look at some of your headlines:

A manhunt underway this morning in southeastern Kentucky after several people were hurt in a shooting and a crash on I-75. The sheriff's office says five people were shot, all are in stable condition, two other people were injured in a vehicle crash during all the confusion. Authorities do not think the gunfire was sparked by road rage. The search for the shooter resumed at daybreak.

Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in Tel Aviv this weekend, calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach an agreement with Hamas to release the rest of the Israeli hostages.

And former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are gearing up for the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday. In a moment, we'll bring in two senators to discuss the stakes, Texas Republican John Cornyn and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy.

But, first, we're going to give you some live team coverage of the campaign. Alexis McAdams live in Pittsburgh following the Harris team, but we begin with Rich Edson live in Hudson, Wisconsin with the Trump team.

Hey, Rich.

RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon.

Former President Donald Trump's final campaign event before Tuesday's debate, at least that's on his schedule, it was a rally here in Wisconsin part of the northern Midwest blue wall the Democrats will likely have to defend if they want to maintain control of the White House.

The president began the rally. His airplane flew a few hundred feet above the tarmac at Mosinee, Wisconsin, a conservative area, about 90-minute drive west of Green Bay. In a speech lasting 100 minutes, the former president said he'd raise tariffs, secure the border and have the war in Ukraine finished, done and settled before Inauguration Day.

He touted his VP pick, Senator J.D. Vance, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who suspended his campaign to endorse Trump.

He called the current administration stupid and corrupt.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: He is the worst president in history. She will be worse than him. She will be worse than him, and Trump is never wrong. I am never ever wrong.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

EDSON: Trump's been outlining plans for the economy. On top of tariffs, he's pushing a new commission on government efficiency led by Elon Musk. He says he also wants to cut regulations, in taxes. Democrats say his proposals are little more than a giveaway to the rich.

Now, we asked the Trump campaign how the former president is preparing for Tuesday's debate, campaign official responded, what's debate prep? Shannon?

BREAM: Okay, we'll see how that pans out.

Rich Edson, reporting from Hudson, Wisconsin, thank you.

Joining us now, Alexis McAdams, live in Pittsburgh where the prep is a little bit different.

Hello, Alexis.

ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Shannon. Trump might not be preparing and locked away in a room. He might be at rallies, but that's not the case here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Kamala Harris, the vice president, has been in a hotel for a few days, really hunkering down and trying to prep to get ready to take on Donald Trump on the debate stage on Tuesday.

She basically said it's like cramming for finals, right? Where you can't wait to get out and the getting out part was the best part. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Being at this spice store I finally got out of the debate prep, to look at these spices, best part of debate prep so far.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: But it was not just a visit to any spice store, Shannon. The vice president stopped at Penzeys Spices in downtown Pittsburgh. Penzeys is known for posting attacks about the GOP. The nationwide chain even offered a discount the other month to celebrate Trump's indictments, sending this out in an email, saying: Re-indicted and it feels so good, and calling that spice ""Justice"".

The Trump team firing back about that stop, saying: Sorry, Kamala, scary spice is already taken.

Despite being at that shop Harris says America is ready to move on from political attacks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Look, it's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together, charting a new way forward.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: Harris also thanking Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney for their endorsement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: I think that what they both as leaders who are well respected are making an important statement that it's okay and if not important to put country above party, and I'm honored to have their support.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: Ahead of the debate, the Harris campaign says they're not happy with some of ABC's rules, including muted microphones, which it claims will benefit Donald Trump, saying this, quote: We understand that Donald Trump is at risk to skip the debate altogether if we don't do this preferred format. We don't want to jeopardize this debate, so for that reason, we accept this full set of rules.

But they don't seem too happy about it.

Back out here live in Pittsburgh, Shannon, Trump won the coin flip, so he'll get the final word at the debate. We'll have to see what happens -- Shannon.

BREAM: All right. Alexis McAdams from Pittsburgh, thank you so much.

Joining us now, Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn.

Welcome to ""FOX News Sunday"".

SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): Great to be with you.

BREAM: So I know last year during the primary season, you had some concerns about whether President Trump was the right way forward for the party. You wanted to know whether he can expand beyond his fervent base which is clearly sticking with him.

Do you think he's done enough to build a coalition outside of that? What does he need to do Tuesday night?

CORNYN: Well, I think he needs to let Kamala Harris talk, something she's been reluctant to do unless she's reading a teleprompter. And I think -- you know, we've seen the polls very close, but mainly, she's coming off of this -- as James Carville called it -- a sugar high, after the coup d'etat that was committed against Joe Biden, and then, of course, the convention.

So I'm looking forward to a repetition of the good debate performance that President Trump had with President Biden and I think -- I think he's up to it.

BREAM: So after that change at the top of the ticket, there's been a lot of new enthusiasm, new fundraising and there is talk about how that's impacting down ballot.

""Politico"" says that Republicans are starting to get a little concerned about the fundraising gap, saying this: Panic is starting to set in. The only thing preventing us from having a great night in November is the massive financial disparity our party currently faces. That's from the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

He says: Unless something changes drastically in the next weeks, we will lose winnable seats.

Are you worried about this down ballot impact on efforts by the GOP to retake the Senate?

CORNYN: Well, fundraising is important, but so are the issues, so are the quality of the candidates. And I think we have an outstanding group of candidates running for the Senate. I'm optimistic about our chances to regain the majority, and I hope they have enough money to defend themselves and to talk about what they are for, what they would do if elected and I'm confident they will.

But, yeah, the money is just astronomical. It just blows my mind.

BREAM: It really is. I mean, when you watch she's taking in, the millions that have come in just at the presidential race, hundreds of millions just the last few weeks.

Of course, you were in the running to replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate's top Republican. What will your priorities be should you achieve that post and how might that differ if you're dearing (ph) -- dealing with a Harris-Walz administration versus a Trump-Vance administration?

CORNYN: Well, when President Trump is reelected along with my colleague J.D. Vance, I expect we'll be helping the administration pass their agenda and I don't see a lot of daylight between what Republicans in the Senate want to do or know we need to do, things like reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We need to reestablish ourself, our nation, as the preeminent leader in the world when it comes to national security matters under President Biden. Our friends don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. It was the opposite under President Trump.

So we'll be working very closely with the administration to accomplish their priorities, and I don't really see, as I said, a lot of daylight between what my colleagues in the Senate want to do next year.

We're going to have to also though look at the -- look at the debt. We're now spending more money on interest on the national debt than we are on defense.

And, right now, the world has gotten more dangerous, and most dangerous since World War II. So we have a lot of heavy lifting to do and it'll help the more -- the bigger our majority is.

BREAM: So let's talk about a couple things you mentioned there, the tax cuts. You know, Democrats from the vice president on down say that they are -- President Trump, a rich guy, giving cuts to rich people. And when you talk about the debt that those kinds of tax cuts actually leave a revenue lag for the federal government and contribute to things like the debt.

CORNYN: Well, the American people are not under taxed. The federal government spends too much.

BREAM: Do you mean (ph) both parties do that?

CORNYN: Well, there's some complicity there. Certainly during COVID-19, there was a lot of bipartisan efforts to keep our economy afloat and to help deal with this pandemic.

But there's been a lot of partisan spending, gasoline really on the inflation fire, $2.7 trillion in partisan spending bills post-COVID. But I think we're at an inflection point.

Part of the problem is we spend money in ways that are not just appropriations. We spend $1.8 trillion in the tax code. There's about $200 billion alone that's spent through the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit.

I'm for those but I do think they need to be offset. They need to be paid for. And so, we need to look at all of that $6 trillion in federal spending and determine what our priorities are as a nation. I think that's our job.

BREAM: Well, and we also are about to get to the end of government funding facing another continuing resolution sort of that short-term financial band-aid. It looks like the House is going to send it over with the SAVE Act attached, which basically says if you're going to go register to vote in federal elections, you have to show proof that you're a U.S. citizen.

A number of Senate Democrats have said that's dead on arrival. It's not going to happen.

How worried are you about this thing pinging back and forth and facing a shutdown? Is that going to hurt Republicans in, you know, this final stretch of an election?

CORNYN: Well, Shannon, in a sane world, the SAVE Act would be non- controversial. It essentially is a national voter ID, and I would think both parties and everybody would be interested in protecting the integrity of the ballot, making sure that people only legally qualified to vote do so.

But it's become a partisan issue which is amazing to me, and -- but I don't think there's going to be a shutdown. We'll see -- the House will have to move first and they got to get to 218. And then it comes to the Senate, I hope we'll have a debate and an opportunity to vote on it.

And I can't imagine that Senator Schumer is excited about having his incumbents who were running tough Senate races voting against a bill that just says you have to be an American citizen to vote.

BREAM: That'll be in the next couple of weeks we think.

But I want to touch down the border because, clearly, Texas bears a huge brunt of this and what's going on there. The vice president though has been touting her work. She says she -- she was tough on cartels and gangs and she's litigated against these people, held them accountable.

She also said this in her DNC speech:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades, the Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign. So he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.

(BOOING)

HARRIS: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: I won't be surprised if your colleague, Senator Chris Murphy, brings this up when we talk to him next. It has been a messaging talking point that has stuck for Democrats, this idea that President Trump is the one who kept the border problem alive because he told you guys not to vote for it.

CORNYN: Well, that's just false is a short answer to that. And the truth is that the Biden-Harris administration has spent three and a half years dismantling all of the Trump border security policies that produced a far better outcome at the border.

I was just down in the Rio Grande Valley a couple weeks ago with Senator John Boozman from Arkansas, and the way the Border Patrol explained it to me, they said, this is a shell game.

Now, the federal government if you use the CBP One app, Customs and Border Protection One app, you can schedule an appointment at a port of entry, and the Biden administration -- the Biden-Harris administration will simply usher you into the United States and give you a work permit.

That is a huge magnet on continued illegal immigration. So we need to return to the policies of the previous administration. Remain in Mexico just is one of them, but this is all a shell game in my view.

BREAM: We will see and whoever wins White House, House, Senate, whether it's divided or together, there hasn't been much progress on the issue of immigration. So, we'll see.

Thank you for stopping by. Always good to see you, Senator.

CORNYN: Thanks, Shannon.

BREAM: All right. Up next, less than 60 days until Election Day, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump revealing new details about their economic plans this week. We're going to bring in Harris-Walz campaign surrogate, Senator Chris Murphy, to discuss what Harris is proposing and whether she's actually breaking from President Biden. He's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BREAM: Ahead of Tuesday's showdown, Vice President Kamala Harris is in practice sessions sharpening her attack lines against the former president as a brand new ""New York Times/Siena"" poll shows the race in a dead heat.

Joining me now, Harris-Walz Campaign Surrogate, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, member of the Harris-Walz Campaign's National Advisory Board. Welcome back. Good to see you.

SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Yeah, great to be here.

BREAM: OK. So we're all looking at this debate. There is a lot at stake for both of these candidates, given how tight this race is. Mark Penn, longtime Democratic strategist, worked for both the Clintons, has this to say. He says, ""One interview. One debate. Some rah rah stump speech you read over and over. And voila, you have a 50% chance of being president."" He goes on to say, ""No two years of primaries, coalition building, no detailed policy development, and no daily press briefings or tests of leadership. It's only the most important job in the world, with a $6 trillion budget and thousands of nuclear weapons."" He says, ""real democracy calls for more debates, more interviews.""

Listen, the policy section of the website remains blank last I checked. So when are we going to get more from the Vice President?

MURPHY: Well, I think you have heard the Vice President roll out several very important detailed policy proposals. She just proposed a massive tax cut for small businesses. She's proposed a massive investment in housing to bring the cost of rent and mortgages down for Americans. She's going to go after price gougers to try to make sure that we continue to drive inflation down. She wants an expansion of the child tax credit. She's investing in the middle class.

She's talking about an opportunity agenda where everybody has the chance to succeed, which is very different than Donald Trump's agenda. Donald Trump has made it very clear, if you put him back in power, he's going to think about only one group of people, and that's his friends at Mar-a-Lago, another massive tax cut for the richest people in America.

So I don't doubt that Kamala Harris will continue to roll out proposals to invest in small businesses, to invest in the middle class. I think the contrast is pretty striking between a candidate on the Democratic side who wants to make sure that we grow the economy from the middle out. And Donald Trump, who still believes in this magical thinking of trickle-down economics, where if you give him and his friends billions of dollars, eventually that'll find its way down to everybody else. That's just not how it works.

BREAM: Well, you know there's analysis. These are IRS numbers, so we assume that's neutral data, and they say that every class of taxpayer benefited from the round of tax cuts that came under the Trump administration, that it wasn't just the top 1%, that it really did benefit everybody who pays taxes in any way.

We've also got, this week, in talking about the Vice President's economic rollout, one of the skeptics of her plans wrote this over the ""Washington Free Beacon,"" listening to Harris extol the virtues of enterprise, you'd have no idea that she cast the deciding vote on the spending splurge that drove historic inflation, that her administration has imposed almost $1.4 trillion in regulations, and that she wants to weaken right-to-work laws and wants Congress to pass $5 trillion of new taxes over 10 years.

MURPHY: Well, listen, let's compare the economic record of Donald Trump against the economic record of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Under this administration, we have seen record job growth in this country. We have manufacturing booming, unemployment at a record low.

When Donald Trump left office, we had unemployment at a record high. He told us if --

BREAM: We were in the middle of the pandemic, to be fair.

MURPHY: We were going to rebuild the manufacturing sector under Donald Trump. We lost manufacturers' jobs. So there is a clear contrast between Donald Trump's record as president where our economy fell to pieces and Kamala Harris and Joe Biden --

BREAM: In the middle of the pandemic.

MURPHY: -- who have rebuilt the economy. And by the way, driven down inflation at a rate faster than all of our other high-income nation competitors.

BREAM: But, again, President Trump handed off, he will argue I'm sure Tuesday night, an inflation rate of 1.4% in the middle of a pandemic, the majority of jobs lost during the pandemic had come back. We spiked to 9, more than 9%. I mean 40 years we haven't seen those kinds of numbers.

MURPHY: Correct and that happened in every single high-income economy because coming out of the pandemic no country had the supply chains sufficient to be able to withstand the surge in demand, but it is also true that over the last four years, inflation has come down faster in the United States than those other countries.

GDP has grown at a faster rate than those other countries and today we are sitting in an economy where anybody who wants a job can get one because we have record low unemployment.

Donald Trump is advertising that he is going to bring back the same kind of chaotic economic policies the same investment in the top 1% in corporations that helped drive our economy into a ditch during his time in office.

BREAM: OK, again, what he's going to say is poverty was down, home ownership was up, inflation was at 1.4, gas was at 230 something a gallon. I mean he's going to maybe be happy to stand on his policies. And when we poll people they tell us they were doing better under President Trump than they've done under this administration. So they do have a head-to-head comparison.

And on this issue of inflation and where we go from here, there was a study out this summer from a bunch of folks including some MIT professors who said, the research shows that mathematically the overwhelming driver of a burst of inflation in 2022 was federal spending not the supply chain.

I mean, I'm no MIT scholar so I'll defer to them. But he says it was the massive spending that as I talked about with Senator Cornyn, people on both sides of the aisle voted for under this administration. But there were tough things where the Vice President was the tie-breaking vote. She says proudly on the Inflation Reduction Act which President Biden said this week they shouldn't have named it that because that's not what it was.

MURPHY: Although, look at the chart, the minute we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, inflation started to decrease at stunning levels in this country. And by the way, that piece of legislation is growing manufacturing jobs all over the country, is cutting prescription drug costs for senior citizens.

I'm proud of the fact that we are doing our part to try to clean up the environment. I'm proud of the fact that that legislation finally took on the drug industry and said we're not going to put seniors in a position where they go bankrupt because of their prescription drug costs.

Donald Trump was in office for four years he did nothing to take power away from the drug industry. Prescription drug prices skyrocketed under Donald Trump. The Inflation Reduction Act for the first time did something about transferring power from the drug industry to regular people. That's the difference between these two candidates.

Donald Trump is going to put power in the hands of the big corporations. He's promised the big oil industry that he will do anything they want as long as they donate a billion dollars to his reelection campaign.

Kamala Harris says that he's going to continue to take power away from the big oil companies, the big drug companies, the big insurance companies and put that power back in the hands of regular people.

BREAM: Well, one of his -- his arguing points about the economy is he does want to enable, you know, the industry oil and gas industry to do more production. He says we shouldn't be dependent on places that don't have our best interests at heart.

MURPHY: So ask yourself this, were we producing more domestic oil and gas under Donald Trump or under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? We're producing more domestic oil and gas today under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris than under Donald Trump.

What we are also doing is making historic new investments in renewable energy so we're also bringing much more wind power and solar power onto the grid. What Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown is that you can do both. You can continue to develop and explore for oil here in the United States and you can do our part to solve climate change.

Under Donald Trump, we weren't doing either. We were drilling for less oil. We were exploring less gas and we weren't doing anything about the climate crisis.

BREAM: OK let's talk about something else the Vice President put out this week which was raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. The Joint Committee on Taxation bipartisan congressional entity says that actually would mean even the lowest income Americans, I mean, they would be paying higher taxes. Because of that they say, in reason, puts it this way:

""Higher corporate taxes are passed along to consumers, employees, and investors in the form of high prices, lower wages and lower investment returns. If you buy things, have a job or save for retirement, higher corporate income taxes will fall on you no matter how many times Biden or Harris try to pretend otherwise.""

MURPHY: Yeah, I mean, this -- this is obviously the argument made by the billionaire class and the corporate class --

BREAM: OK but by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

MURPHY: If you raise taxes on us, ultimately we will just pass those down to other people. Some people want tax fairness in this country. They are sick and tired of these massive American companies paying 0% tax rates. That's what some of the biggest companies in the country were paying, zero under Donald Trump.

There's nobody in this country Republicans or Democrats that thinks that's fair except for Donald Trump. So yes Kamala Harris believes that if you're a corporation in this country you should pay some taxes. Yes, she believes that if you're making a billion dollars in this economy, you should help pay for our schools. You should help try to make our communities safer.

I don't think Americans believe this argument that by raising taxes by a couple percentage points on a handful of billionaires that, that ultimately is going to ruin the economy.

Kamala Harris also says that she's going to cut taxes on small businesses. She's going to use the money that we raise in higher taxes for billionaires and transfer that to tax cuts for small businesses and low-income taxpayers.

BREAM: All of that's got -- it's got to work out somewhere on the ledger and so that's going to mean more taxes and Joint Taxation Committee says that falls to everyone. So, we will watch to see, if she wins, what you guys do in Congress and how you handle it. But thank you for coming in.

MURPHY: Thanks.

BREAM: Always good to see you.

MURPHY: Appreciate it.

BREAM: All right with the race so tight, Tuesday's debate could be make or break for these candidates. Next up, we've got two debate prep experts who've got some final words of advice for these two. And our panel is here to break down what we're learning about the Trump and Harris economic plans and how they're actually going to impact your wallets. Next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: It's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Secretary Clinton.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

TRUMP: Because you'd be in jail.

HARRIS: To hear you talk about the reputations of two United States Senators who have built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Just sampling of how this year's White House contenders have tackled their debate opponents in the past. So will Tuesday be more about substance or style?

I sat down earlier with two campaign veterans who've prepped presidential candidates for this, the debate stage.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM: Joining me now, former Obama campaign manager, Jim Messina. And GOP communications consultant, Brett O'Donnell, who has prepped several presidential candidates for their debates.

All right. It comes down to this week. This may be the only meeting between these two we get on the stage.

""New York Times"" puts it this way. ""The debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday will be, by far, the longest unscripted setting for Ms. Harris of her candidacy. A high-risk encounter against an opponent with little regard for decorum.""

Jim, who's got more at stake on Tuesday?

JIM MESSINA, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Oh, she does. I mean, let's be honest, you know, Donald Trump is the best counterpuncher in the history of American politics.

This is his seventh presidential debate over three cycles, and this is her first. And so we're in a tight race. It was -- it was under 60 days by the time we get to the debate. And she has still a bunch of swing voters who don't have an opinion of her or waiting to see who she is and what she's going to stand for. So, you know, I think the advantage is to Trump going into this. But, you know, as we all know, all strategy goes out the moment you get on that debate stage.

BREAM: Well, and I think it's fascinating. These two have never met face to face. Going to a presidential debate for your first meeting is a little bit intimidating. They've got different prep strategies. The vice president holding up in Pittsburgh for several days to hone what she's been working on.

President Trump and his team saying, he does debate prep every day simply by engaging in hostile interviews and doing these press conferences.

But, Brett, I want to play something about what he said he plans to do. Here's President Trump.

TRUMP: When I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion. And I let him talk. I'm going to let her talk because, you know.

BREAM: So, do you think he will be able to just simply sit back and let her explain her positions, get herself maybe into a hole she's got to dig out of?

BRETT O'DONNELL, GOP COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT: Well, he did in the first debate, especially for the first 30 minutes. That's where Biden done did himself. I mean, Biden actually fulfilled the one principle of presidential debates.

You can't win an election in one, but you can lose it. Joe Biden did it and it was because the president was more disciplined, particularly in those first 30 minutes.

BREAM: Well, and as for her debate, NBC News reports this about her strategy. They say, ""Harris and her team are focusing on homing in on how to needle Trump to rattle him. Another source said the Harris team plans to emphasize what it views as Trump's advanced age and lack of details on policy proposals.""

And, Jim, that's -- obviously, we've got different optics than we did about the June debate where President Trump and his team had spent, you know, tens of millions of dollars and invested in this strategy that President Biden was too old and unable to move forward in his campaign. Are the tables turned now?

MESSINA: Well, look, let me make you one guarantee, your first guarantee of this T.V. appearance. There's no way Donald Trump is going to sit back and let her just talk to country about what she wants and what she wants to do.

And the reason is, you know, we're in a tight race. He is -- he is stuck. He can't move over 47 percent. And so he's got to bring her down to him. And so what she wants to do is exactly that.

Her job -- she has two jobs. One is to look at the American public and be presidential. And the second is to draw a very clear contrast between him and her.

I used to say to Obama, if it's a referendum on you, we'll lose. If it's a choice between you and Romney or you and McCain, we will win. And so I think she's going into that exactly.

And Donald Trump, I promise you, is not going to sit there and let her have at it.

BREAM: All right. We'll see. Because it's 90 minutes. It's hard to resist the urge when both of these, you know, are, I would say, have known how to be combative fighter. She's been a federal prosecutor. You see him each time that he gets out there and defends his position.

Here's what we know about the rules. Obviously, no live audience, no opening statements, no props allowed. And candidates' microphones will be muted when their opponent is on the clock, a stipulation that's created controversy in recent days. The two teams fighting about this.

In fact, the Harris campaign, one of the senior advisors sent a letter to ABC which is hosting the event saying this. ""Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the vice president. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign's insistence on muted microphones.""

But, Brett, a lot of people who support President Trump actually felt it worked for him this particular rule in that Biden debate.

O'DONNELL: It did work for him from the first debate, but I do think that that message from the Harris campaign is nothing more than a head fake. It's meant to, again, bait the president into a personal debate.

I mean, I think the Harris campaign would love nothing more than if this debate was all about personality and persona and not about policy. Because as long as the debates focused on policy, that means Kamala Harris has to explain the differences between Kamala Harris four years ago and Kamala Harris now, which I think is an opportunity for President Trump to attack her on.

If the debate is about personality, and she can get under his skin, I think that is much better territory for the -- for the Harris campaign.

BREAM: OK. Real quick because we're almost out of time. I want to ask you both the same question. What's your, one, best piece of advice for, Brett, for you, for the Trump campaign?

O'DONNELL: Keep the debate focused on policy, not about persona.

BREAM: And, Jim, your piece of advice to the Harris team.

MESSINA: It's all about future. I would write future above my little white pad on there. And I would never stop putting her in the future and him in the past. And if she does that, she'll be the president of the United States.

BREAM: All right. Jim and Brett, we know you are both be watching as we all will on Tuesday night. Thanks for your insights.

MESSINA: Thank you.

O'DONNELL: Thanks for having us.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM: All right. Let's see what our Sunday group thinks. ""USA Today"" Washington Bureau Chief, Susan Page. You'll remember, she moderated the 2020 vice presidential debates. Mary Katharine Ham, Fox News contributor and OutKick columnist. Fox News senior political analyst, Juan Williams. And Guy Benson Townhall.com political editor, Fox News contributor, and host of The Guy Benson Show. Welcome, everybody.

All right. Susan, you have a piece out about this this morning. I mean, you were the last person to moderate a debate that Kamala Harris took part in.

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, USA TODAY: That's right. Can you imagine she hasn't debated in four years? That might be a little bit of concern for them that she's rusty.

You know, in that debate, she hadn't been universally good in the primary debates that in -- that in 20 -- in the 2020 cycle, but she was good in the vice presidential debate. She was prepared and she made especially effective use of a putdown of Pence when he interrupted her. This may be one reason they wanted mics to be live.

She said, Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. And the ""Mr. Vice President"" sounded very respectful and the, ""I'm speaking,"" made him risk looking disrespectful, if he kept talking over her.

BREAM: Well, we know how much is at stake. ""The New York Times"" today has brand-new polling saying this. The national poll of likely voters found Mr. Trump leading Miss Harris, 48 to 47 percent. The new poll underscores the risks and potential rewards particularly facing Miss Harris on Tuesday night when she and Trump face off.

I mean, Guy, it couldn't be any closer.

GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Tight race. Trump now slightly back in the lead to that big bounce she got in ""The New York Times"" poll from the month-long euphoria fueled by the media seems to have dissipated significantly.

And, Shannon, I think the most significant data point within that poll is a question about Jim Messina who was just talking about the future, the change question. A vast majority of Americans in this poll say they want change.

And in this survey, a majority see Donald Trump as an agent of change, and a majority see her as more of the same. That should be Trump's overarching hammered point on Tuesday night.

BREAM: And we saw at the DNC, there was very good messaging casting her as the challenger and him as the incumbent, but it sounds like within this poll, people are starting to have a reality check on that particular issue.

Now, they both rolled out economic plans this week. Reuters says this, citing a Goldman Sachs report. Under a Republican sweep, or even with a divided government led by Donald Trump, economic output would take a hit next year, mostly from increased tariffs on imports and tighter immigration policies, according to Goldman. They say he's not the one for your economy.

MARY KATHARINE HAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I think the tariffs are something that I personally disagree with and have some policy issues with. I think he needs to point out, look, I have a vision, she has nothing on her website.

She's giving you a hand -- a sprinkling of proposals that have been frankly widely panned, including this idea of giving individual homeowners this 25K that would up housing prices and end up hurting people.

I think that he can say, look, to the extent that he can connect the reality on the ground of what is happening right now and what people are feeling, people who are not Goldman Sachs, by the way. You can make that point about that division. He wins in the reality on the ground because he says, look what your life was like four years ago and look at it now. Compare the two. And I think that's what he has to drill down on.

BREAM: Well, and that's what this ""Hill"" opinion piece this week gets to. It says, ""If Trump's policies were so terrible, why do so many people think they were better off during his presidency? Why were small-business owners and consumers consistently more upbeat than they have been during the Biden-Harris years?""

I mean, Juan, how does she navigate that reality check that people get every day when they buy groceries?

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think people have a certain nostalgia about the past.

Joe Biden's numbers have gone way up since he decided --

BREAM: Well, now that he's off the ticket.

WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying. I think people's -- but, you know, the reality is, if you look at the numbers, the economy is better now than it was then.

So you're dealing with this kind of memory sense of things.

BREAM: OK. But what context? Just to -- just to give us a --

WILLIAMS: What the -- what the context is, Goldman Sachs, they're no left- wing organization. They're saying the economy will be better under Kamala Harris.

HAM: They're also not mom buying groceries.

WILLIAMS: And also, I think you also look at -- I think this week there was 88 top executives who came out and said, we think that the economy will spur, will boost under Kamala Harris.

And this week, Trump went before the New York Economic Club to give a speech. And it should have been, you know, given the perception that he wants to say the economy was better, it should have been a knock out for him in front of all those rich men. Instead, he delivered word salad on a question about childcare.

And my sense is, look, the job numbers are good, the stock market is good. And right now, the Federal Reserve is in a position where they're likely to raise -- I'm sorry, lower interest rates.

BREAM: Yes. Please don't say raise.

WILLIAMS: I'm sorry. Right.

Lower interest rates, which will raise, I think, opportunities for Kamala Harris to say, we have a future that's better coming under my administration.

BREAM: Well, Mary Katharine, you mentioned moms out buying groceries. You're a mom of four. That's certainly the circle that you often run in, is to hear from them about what they think.

HAM: Well, and my perspective is, if it's hurting us, I know it's hurting other people much, much more.

And it's hard to argue that the inflation, although the rate of it is falling, you're not getting back to the 1.9 that we had in January 2017, 2016, when Trump was in office, right? And this hurts people.

And your -- and when you talk about the jobs market, yet, we're adding jobs, but it's mediocre at best. And we're revising down every single month to a cumulative number that's taken a pretty big hit on those numbers.

PAGE: You know, nothing more frustrating to the Democrats than the fact that they feel that Biden and Harris do not get the credit they really deserve on the economy we have. We see a little bit of brightening of views.

But the fact is in the New York Times/Siena poll and in the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump continues to be preferred when it comes to handling the economy.

The change question is important. The who do you trust more to handle the economy, that is a crucial, basic question.

BENSON: Prices are up 20 percent under Biden and Harris. That's why the frustration is there because the frustration is deserved. Prices are up 20 percent. People feel that.

BREAM: All right. Just --

WILLIAMS: I think people know that we went to a coronavirus. This is what you were stressing earlier with the Senator. And that things had to be done and that this economy is the envy of the world. There's no better economy in the entire world after the virus.

BREAM: And just a quick note here, there are two cases that are out there pending. I just want to make sure, because this race is so tight, RFK Jr. trying to get off the ballots in a number of states, both Michigan and North Carolina appeals courts, they are ruled. He comes off the ballot.

Those have been now appealed to their state's supreme courts. So we stand by this week to see in these critical states where if his name is offer on that ballot, after he fought so hard to get on, now fighting to get off.

OK. Panel, don't go anywhere.

When we come back, college students back on campus and so are those anti- Israel protests. Hear from students who say the problem starts at the top. You'll hear from them next.

And we'll discuss the implications, as tensions escalate in the Middle East and here at home.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KATIE ARYEH, BARNARD COLLEGE GRADUATE: These are protesters who are being influenced by outside organizations. The Islamic Republic of Iran is thanking them for their work. They are giving permission to these terrorists to continue their horrific acts, like murdering the American hostage, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, after he survived 11 months in captivity and torture.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: That was Barnard College graduate from our Fox Nation special ""Anti- Semitism on Campus: Back to School.""

Anti-Israel protests are starting to pop up again on college campuses as students head back to place - places like Columbia University in New York City this week. Police clashing with protesters and making arrests.

We are back now with our panel.

NBC News says this. ""Students are barely back on campus, but pro- Palestinian protests have already returned, putting a divisive issue back in the spotlight that Democrats had hoped the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris might allow them to move beyond.""

Juan, it's not a good look.

WILLIAMS: Well, no. I mean, look, free speech is a right in our country, but there's no place for threats and intimidation and violence.

So, the thing about it is the politics, as you spotlight, Shannon, because the politics is big protests, pro-Palestinian protests, really are being used against the Harris campaign. The suggestion is that, oh, these people are more Democrats. Democrats embrace this chaos and all that.

But the Republicans have a problem with anti-Semitism. I mean this week, to see that Tucker Carlson, who spoke at the GOP convention, is giving a platform to a man who is saying that, you know, Winston Churchill was to blame for the Holocaust and the troubles during World War II, I mean that's just pathetic. That's sick! That's historical revisionism on a scale that's troubling. And I think that lots of people are starting to ask questions about this.

But in terms of the optics, if it's a big pro-Palestinian demonstration, the Republicans hope that, you know, it will be somehow a weight on the Democrats.

BREAM: Well, Mary Katharine, is it more of a problem for Democrats or Republicans, as Juan tries to make the point (ph)?

HAM: Well, one of the reasons that it can be connected to Democrats is because Tim Walz said just this week that the protesters are speaking out for all the right reasons. If you watch tape of these gatherings, yes, free speech is in action here. And the problem with colleges is they haven't been able to find the line between speech and vandalism and threats and violence. And at UCLA, blocking Jewish students from going to certain parts of campus. That was on a right-wing action happening there. But that's what I can be connected to them.

It can be connected to them also because they seem to be making, because of Walz's statement, they seem to be making political calculations about Michigan voters based upon how much they're able to come out and condemn these kind of things.

WILLIAMS: But I don't think - I think -

HAM: Although, I think Kamala Harris has had moments where she's gone there and been clear about these protesters.

WILLIAMS: I was just going to say to you that I think Walz's statement was a statement that if you look at the devastation in Gaza and the - a number of people who are dead. I don't think you have to be Republican or Democrat. You say, something is wrong here. You have a human instinct to say, can we get a deal? And you see thousands of Israelis in the street saying, let's get a deal. Let's bring the hostages home.

HAM: But if you say all the right reasons about a group of people who are carrying Hezbollah and Hamas flags and wearing masks, that is a problem. All the right reasons?

WILLIAMS: Stop the - stop the devastation!

BREAM: OK, well, Guy, we talked about the - during the commercial too, that Tim Walz is out there on the campaign trail and he did get a direct question about the death of Hersh Goldberg-Polin and said, OK, thanks, everyone, time to go. I am trying to figure out whether he didn't hear it or whether he does not want to touch that subject.

BENSON: Or any subject, right? They don't do a lot of interviews. They don't answer a lot of questions. And if you watch that particular video that you just referenced, it's - it's weird. He - he stands there. He absolutely clocks the question. You see his brain say, I'm not going to answer it. And he says, all right, thanks, everybody, and walks off with his ice cream. That's a strange response when you're asked about six hostages who have just been killed, including an American.

So, we'll see how he handles that question, if he gets something about that at the vice presidential debate, which I think we're still having. I think it's still on.

BREAM: I think it is. Yes, I hope so. We're looking forward to that one.

In the meantime, there have been protests in the streets in Tel Aviv. I mean thousands and thousands of people gathering as, Juan, you reference this, they want to deal done.

Here's a little bit of what Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is under a ton of pressure, said about trying to get there.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: It's clear Gaza must be demilitarized. And it can only be demilitarized if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control and is not a - a supply line for armaments and for terror equipment. I think that's clear to most Israelis, to all Israelis.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Susan, this is not an easy problem or - there are no easy solutions or we'd have that cease-fire. Are - are we getting further away or closer to one of those plans (ph)?

PAGE: Here's what's clear, we're not going to have a ceasefire. We're not going to have the kind of deal that the administration has - has been hoping to deliver for some time and some points said we were very close, within days of reaching. And that's because of - of actions on both sides.

Hamas has put new conditions on Israel, and Netanyahu has not been willing to make some of the compromises that the Biden administration wanted them to do. And this is an issue that divides Democrats more than Republicans. You've seen Kamala Harris continue to endorse U.S. support for Israel, not making threats about not continuing arm shipments here, but a kind of tonal shift with Harris in which she expresses more sympathy and concern about the plight of Palestinians. So, I don't know if that's enough to bridge the gap that Democrats have on this issue.

BREAM: I want to play something too from Secretary Blinken who's been traveling in the region again as they try to push towards some kind of ceasefire. Here's what he says about everyone not getting on the same page.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: Every day that goes by where it is not finalized, and the parties don't say, yes, period, is a day in which something else happens. And there is an intervening event, which simply pushes things off and runs the risk of derailing what is a - a pretty fragile apple cart.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Guy, do you agree, that the hopes for a ceasefire are over at this point?

BENSON: Probably because one side doesn't want one. One side wants the other side to be completely obliterated and dead. And they don't just say that, they do it. They did it on October 7th, and they just murdered some more of those hostages that they stole. So, it's really hard to talk about peace or even a temporary peace when one side overtly, explicitly doesn't want one. They're not even Hamas. They're not even at the negotiating table.

We've had this series of offers that Israelis have said yes to, and Hamas had said no every time. And I saw an ""Axios"" pieces this week saying that the administration, Biden-Harris, might finally be realizing that maybe Hamas doesn't want and deal and is not acting in good faith and it's like, well, if they're coming around to that, it's - it's very late to the party.

WILLIAMS: You know, when you started speaking, I thought you were talking about Israel when you said don't want to deal. I mean, to me, the United States, and the Israelis who are in the streets in Tel Aviv, are putting pressure on the Netanyahu government and saying, we need a deal here. We want to bring our hostages home. They're not aiming their protest at Hamas.

And what we've heard from Netanyahu, in the clip that was just played is, we are intent on keeping troops on this line there with Egypt and Israel in the Gaza. And that is the absolute must, not making a deal. And I think Netanyahu doesn't want a deal because he doesn't want to any - do any favors for the Biden administration.

HAM: Existence is an absolute must, which is why they want to hold that line.

WILLIAMS: Well, they - they will exist. Yes.

BREAM: OK, panel, thank you very much. We'll see you next Sunday.

Up next, those massive demonstrations on the streets of Tel Aviv overnight demanding the Israeli government get a deal done to get the hostages out. And three Israelis shot and killed at a key border crossing overnight. We're going to take you live to Israel, next.

BREAM: The Israeli government facing mounting pressure as called for a hostage deal intensify, as the country marks 11 months since Hamas' deadly attacks.

Joining us from Tel Aviv, Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst with the latest.

Hello, Trey.

TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good morning.

Organizer estimate half a million protesters gathered in the streets of Tel Aviv overnight demanding the release of Israeli hostages. The demonstration marked weekly calls for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, while putting pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Some of the protesters clashed with police and blocked the main highway that runs through Israel's second-largest city. Similar demonstrations unfolded in Jerusalem and at other locations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ZAHIRO SHAHAR MOR, NEPHEW OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE ABRAHAM MUNDER: As long as Netanyahu remains in power, we will keep getting hostages back in body bags. Netanyahu must be removed from power in order to save the lives of the hostages and the country itself.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

YINGST: While chances of an agreement to end the war and bring the hostages home remain low, American negotiators are drafting a new proposal this weekend, trying to close the gaps between the two sides. The latest taking point reportedly has to do with Hamas demanding the release of higher-level Palestinian prisoners in the expected exchange for Israeli captives.

While diplomatic efforts continue, Israel conducted multiple air strikes against Gaza since Friday killing at least a dozen people.

While the southern front remains active, Israel's northern front is still heating up. Dozens of rockets were fired by the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, as daily exchanges of fire are ongoing along the Israel-Lebanon border. No casualties were reported from the attack.

As if the current fronts weren't active enough, today three people were killed when a gunman crossed from Jordan along Israel's eastern border.

An Israeli strike on a Gaza humanitarian zone kills at least 19,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/g-s1-21885/israel-gaza-strike-mawasi-khan-younis,2024-09-10T19:17:22Z,"Palestinians look at the destruction following an Israeli airstrike in al-Muwasi, a designated humanitarian zone in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Tuesday. The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas command and control center and killed three Hamas commanders in the strike. Hamas did not confirm the deaths.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip, and TEL AVIV, Israel -- An Israeli airstrike early Tuesday morning on an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza killed 19 Palestinians and wounded 60 others, according to Gaza's ministry of health.

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas command and control center in al-Muwasi, west of Khan Younis, and killed three Hamas commanders. Hamas did not confirm the deaths.

First responders told NPR it took them hours to pull dead bodies from beneath the rubble, and the health ministry said dozens were still stuck, which would contribute to a higher casualty toll.

Palestinians in Muwasi said the attack occurred between midnight and 1:00 am local time. Those in the camp said they didn't receive an evacuation order to leave before the strike. In an official statement posted on WhatsApp on Tuesday, the Israeli military did not mention giving an evacuation order. It normally says when it has ordered Palestinians to leave.

Muwasi was a chaotic scene after the strikes. Dust and rubble covered tents and cars. Personal belongings like blankets, a deflated basketball, kitchen supplies and clothing were strewn across the camp. Parents looked for their children among the rubble, and a massive crater was left by an explosion in the middle of the camp.

This isn't the first time Muwasi has been struck. In July, 90 Palestinians were killed in a strike that the Israeli military said targeted and killed top Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Hamas denied that Deif was killed.

Palestinians were told by Israel's military in December that Muwasi was relatively safe, and that they would be able to find some resources like water and shelter. An area that was once hardly inhabited, today Muwasi is packed with hundreds of tents and tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians.

They live in squalid conditions, with little humanitarian aid reaching them because of the war.

""Nowhere is safe in Gaza,"" said 52-year old Maha al-Sha'er, whose tent was destroyed in Tuesday's strike. She said her family went to bed at 11 p.m. on Monday and were startled awake by loud booms. Sha'er said she was disoriented from the dust and explosions.

""'Where was I sleeping? Where am I?' I asked myself,"" Sha'er told NPR.

After making sure her children were safe, she looked around to find her husband, Ahmad. After searching, she saw him still alive stuck under the rubble. Sha'er said she used her bare hands to dig him out.

""I just kept screaming, 'Ahmad! Ahmad!' and digging until he got out alive,"" she said.

Fatima al-Ganna, 30, said her tent was just a few yards away from the crater in the middle of the camp.

""We were so surprised at this huge crater. We were so scared,"" she said. ""They told us to come here to be safe, but we just aren't.""

The spokesman of the Gaza civil defense said that entire families were wiped out and that between 20 to 40 tents were destroyed."

Eygi's family released a statement on Saturday saying Eygi -- also a Turkish citizen -- was ""peacefully standing for justice"" before she was shot by Israel's military. Her family argued that ""given the circumstances"" of Eygi's death, ""an Israeli investigation is not adequate."" Several Turkish and U.S. officials have condemned Israel's response to the Beita protest, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who called the IDF's shooting a ""barbaric intervention."" Sean Savett, a National Security Council spokesperson, said the White House was ""deeply disturbed"" by the incident, adding the U.S. had requested an investigation and more information.

Eygi is a recent graduate of the University of Washington and was raised in Seattle, her family said. Aria Fani, a professor of Middle Eastern languages and cultures at the university, told the Associated Press Eygi had previously participated in pro-Palestinian protests before traveling to the West Bank, which Fani tried to convince her not to do. International organizations have cautioned against traveling to the region since Hamas -- which controlled the Gaza Strip and is separate from the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank -- attacked Israel in October. As of Aug. 21, the United Nations estimated more than 600 people have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, mostly by Israeli forces and settlers in the occupied territory. Other civilians have been killed before the attack in recent years, however, including Al Jazeera journalist and U.S. citizen Shireen Abu Akleh, who was fatally shot while covering an Israeli operation in 2022. The IDF apologized for her death in 2023.

Two other activists with the International Solidarity Movement have been killed in Gaza since 2000. In 2003, American Rachel Corrie was crushed to death as she tried to block an IDF bulldozer from demolishing a Palestinian home, the Associated Press reported. A month later, British citizen Tom Hurndall was shot in the head by an IDF soldier. The IDF ruled Corrie's death as an accident, despite condemnation by human rights groups, and the soldier who killed Hurndall was sentenced to over 11 years in prison."

Tonight is the first chance Americans have to see Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump face off, in the same place, at the same time. A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows that 70% of respondents will be watching what could be the one-and-only scheduled debate between the presidential hopefuls. And 30% say it will help them decide who to vote for. This comes as polls show a very close contest between the candidates.

An Israeli strike on a crowded tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in the south of Gaza killed 40 people, officials said. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were told they'd find relative safety from Israeli airstrikes in the neighborhood outside Khan Younis called al-Muwasi. That's where the Israeli military struck today saying it was targeting a Hamas operations center.

The Miami-Dade Police Department released body camera footage showing the dramatic encounter between officers and Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill. It shows officers forcibly remove him from his car less than a minute after pulling him over. The officers ultimately detained him in handcuffs for nearly 20 minutes. It started after police spotted a black sports car zip by, and Hill was pulled over. He rolled down his window, handed over his license and then rolled up his window. A verbal disagreement sparked over the closed window and an officer then yelled at Hill to get out of the vehicle. The incident escalated from there. One officer has been placed on administrative duty over the incident, and Hill's lawyer says they'll be pursuing legal action.

Jordanian voters go to polls amid fears of a wider war,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/g-s1-21747/jordanian-voters-go-to-polls-amid-fears-of-a-wider-war,2024-09-10T11:10:55Z,"AMMAN -- Jordanian voters are going to the polls Tuesday in the kingdom's first parliamentary elections since a new election law two years ago paved the way for greater participation by political parties in the country's political system.

About 5 million Jordanians are eligible to vote - almost half of Jordan's roughly 11 million population. More than 600,000 of them turned 18 since the last elections and are eligible to vote for the first time.

Jordan, a key security ally of the United States and one of the few Arab countries to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, is a constitutional monarchy and the parliament has limited power.

But the election is seen as a key gauge of democratization efforts and the effect of public anger over Israeli attacks in Gaza.

The war in Gaza has overshadowed almost all aspects of life in the kingdom, where a majority of citizens are of Palestinian origin - those who fled or were expelled from their homes with the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and subsequent wars. Daily Israeli attacks in Gaza, and increasingly, the occupied West Bank, have sparked intense anger in the small kingdom. The war has also devastated Jordan's economy, where tourism is a major sector.

Jordan is the only other Arab country apart from Egypt to have signed a full peace-treaty with Israel. The treaty resulted in security cooperation and economic ties between Jordan and neighboring Israel but has done little over the years to tamp down anger among Jordanians over Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.

That anger has grown into rage over the war in Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in Israeli air strikes since the militant group Hamas attacked Israel last October. Israel says about 1200 civilians and soldiers were killed in that attack.

Jordanian leaders are particularly worried about increasing Israeli attacks recently in the occupied West Bank. Israel says it is targeting armed militants while many in Jordan believe that the military action and an increase in illegal Israeli settlement are meant to push Palestinians across the river and into Jordan.

The election law two years ago is meant to promote the establishment of political parties in a political system dominated by tribal ties. Forty-one of the 138-seat parliament have been set aside for political party candidates in this election. Analysts say The move paved the way for greater participation by liberal and secular parties in Jordan's conservative society.

""The political parties have not really dug in roots in terms of political organization,"" says Mustafa Hamarneh, a senior member of the Jordanian Social Democratic Party and a Jordanian senator.

He said, however, this election marks the first time that political parties are running on platforms rather than appealing to voters' sense of identity, such as religious or tribal links, he told NPR after casting his vote. ""Let's hope that this experiment will succeed at least a little and it will be a beginning for future development.""

Despite the changes in election law, the new parliament is expected to be roughly similar in outlook to previous ones - made up mostly of pro-government and tribal members. This election raises a quota for women's representation to 18 members from 15 in the last election.

It also lowered the age of eligibility for candidates to 25 from 30 years of age - a potentially significant development in a country where roughly half of citizens are under age 25.

Jordan, a small country lacking natural resources with a large population of Syrian and other refugees, is highly dependent on US and other foreign aid. Much of that aid is tied to Jordan's contribution to helping secure Israeli borders, including hosting a large U.S. military presence on bases outside the Jordanian capital.

Under King Abdullah II, the country has tried to balance its need to maintain relations with Israel while recognizing public anger over Israeli attacks in Gaza and the West Bank.

The militant Palestinian group Hamas sprung from Muslim Brotherhood ideology in the late 1980s after the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. The Brotherhood is banned in many Arab countries as a potential threat to hereditary rulers and autocratic leaders such as Egyptian president Abdul Fatah al-Sisi.

Jordan has allowed a Brotherhood-affiliated party, the Islamic Action Front, to operate but under relatively strict controls -- including approving mosque sermons and limits on public protests.

Hamarneh, a former head of Jordan's Center for Strategic Studies and the government-appointed Economic and Social Council, said all parties support the Palestinians in the war in Gaza and were unlikely to be able to differentiate themselves to voters on that issue.

""However, organization here matters and the Islamists or the Muslim Brotherhood, they have the best political organization in the country. So that could be effective,"" he said."
Morning Glory: ABC News and its pass/fail test,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-abc-news-its-pass-fail-test,2024-09-10T09:15:10Z,"Syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt reacts to Vice President Kamala Harris' first sit-down interview on 'Sunday Night in America.'

CNN ""passed"" its test in that came in the form of the first presidential date in June between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Opinions are divided on whether CNN passed or failed in its interview of Vice President Kamala Harris. (Having helped moderate five GOP presidential primary debates and being the only non-network individual in the debate prep rooms, the grade goes to the network involved, not the host. Debates and big interviews are collective efforts by the organizations hosting them.)

Tuesday ABC is carrying a heavy burden. To my knowledge, the network does not have on its payroll even one individual of significant stature as a host, contributor or executive who is a likely Trump voter. This means in a country that polling portrays as evenly divided between ""blue"" and ""red,"" inputs from Trump supporters into the debate preparation process are almost certainly unlikely to occur and thus it is extremely unlikely for the debate to feature questions that such voters believe are relevant and indeed crucial to the choice before the country.

How could ABC get to high ground from which the questions vetted by its debate team and posed by hosts David Muir and Linsey Davis don't result in a ""Bud Lite""-level meltdown for its brand and the brands of its parent company Disney? The surest path is to lean heavily on Commander-in-Chief questions. Presidents don't pass laws. They either sign what Congress sends them or veto such bills. Hypotheticals about whether a candidate would sign this or that hypothetical bill are just hobby horses for ideologues posing the queries.

A president does indisputably have control over America's national security and the deployment and use of its military. The primary relevant examples of this power relevant are (1) President Biden's decision to pull American troops out of Afghanistan in the way that he did with the consequences that pullout had and (2) support or refusal of support for Israel in its multi-front war with Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and of course Iran (the head of the snake"" as many supporters of the Jewish State deem the mullahs in Tehran.) A third obvious question in this category is whether former President Trump did the right thing when he ordered Qasem Soleimani killed in Iraq on January 3, 2020.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

There are many other extremely relevant questions in this area including whether American military force will be deployed to defend our treaty ally the Philippines in the escalating confrontations with China's People's Liberation Army Navy or to defend the island state of Taiwan if it is attacked by China?

Another obvious area is America's southern border. What both candidates will do about the more than 10 million migrants who crossed into the country without an invitation in the past three-and-a-half years should be on the agenda.

TRUMP ALLIES OFFER DEBATE STRATEGIES TO BEAT HARRIS

Because the enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 rests with the president and his or her executive branch appointees and the Biden/Harris Administration has proposed new, controversial regulations about Title IX, an obvious and pressing question should be whether and why the candidates support biological boys who identify as girls should be allowed to compete in scholastic sports?

While we know the positions of both candidates on abortion, it is not a priority question but as FDA-approved drugs that result in abortion have been much litigated, a question in that area would not be inappropriate but, if asked, should be matched with one about when such drugs become inappropriate to prescribe? Planned Parenthood states on its website that ""In general, you can have a medication abortion up to 77 days (11 weeks) after the first day of your last period."" The organization adds ""If it's been 78 days or more since the first day of your last period, you can have an in-clinic abortion to end your pregnancy."" A question about ensuring the interstate availability of this federally approved medication is not particularly germane as the Supreme Court has ruled on a case involving the medication's current availability but no doubt liberals and Democrats would welcome a question about these drugs and it's not a wholly hypothetical one. The next president has authority over the Health and Human Services Department which controls the FDA just like they will have authority over the Department of Education which enforces Title IX. These are questions for presidents.

So is the forthcoming response from a new president to the explosion of anti-Semitism on campuses. So is the pace and success of the massive expenditures of the already legislated Green New Deal provisions. So is the future of nuclear energy and permit reform to expedite fossil fuel extraction and export. If a president can unilaterally act in an area, it ought to be on the table.

All of these questions are legitimate. Will any of them get asked? Asking both candidates how they assess each other's choice of a running mate would be interesting. There are a hundred fair and tough questions to pose.

If ABC produces an equal number of questions that strike both red and blue America as pointed but fair, and as many that are difficult for former President Trump to answer as are posed in that category to Vice President Harris, the network, and by extension Disney, will pass. If not, the whole country and its electorate will have rendered a verdict of ""fail"" on both by Wednesday.

"Father of American held captive by Hamas says hostages 'are dying,' going through 'hell' in Gaza",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/father-american-held-captive-hamas-says-hostages-dying-going-through-hell-gaza,2024-09-10T09:11:34Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The family of an American hostage held in Gaza is warning about how innocents held in ""the worst place in the world"" under Hamas captivity are dying and in a fight for their lives.

Ronen and Orna Neutra said their lives have been shattered, and they live in constant pain and limbo, since Oct. 7 when Hamas captured their son, Omer, 22, while he was stationed at a base near Kibbutz Nir Oz. Omer grew up in Long Island, New York, and is a dual American-Israeli citizen serving in the Israel Defense Forces.

""It's insane. We're in constant pain and anxiety, and we still have to function on a very high, intense level. Every single day we're traveling all over. We're in this fight over his life,"" Orna told Fox News Digital.

'WEST POINT' FOR DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES HIRED DIRECTOR WHO CALLED TERRORISM THE 'DREAM OF POLITICS'

Orna and Ronen have been traveling the world, speaking with global leaders, and pleading with them to intervene and help their son. As for how they are handling the pressure, they said, they're just being parents.

""We don't consider ourselves special in any way. We're just normal parents. We have a small business on Long Island. We had a very quiet, regular life, and this was taken away from us. And we want to go back to that,"" Ronen said.

In remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas last week, Ronen said the only solution to the problem was a hostage deal

""This is urgent. They are in the greatest danger. They are dying,"" he said during a speech. ""Omer and the other 100 hostages are running out of time ... We know without a doubt that every moment in captivity is a risk for their lives and well-being. A deal is the only viable path to bring all hostages back home.""

Hamas killed six hostages last week - including American Hersh Goldberg-Polin - after torturing them in a tunnel in abysmal conditions, the IDF said. All six hostages were discovered dead on Saturday during an IDF operation in tunnels below Rafah, a city on the Gaza Strip. The IDF believes they were killed shortly before Israeli soldiers arrived on the scene.

The tunnel where they were reportedly killed by Hamas had absymal conditions and the hostages could barely breathe, according to Israel's Channel 13.

Omer's wife followed up at the reception with a message to their son, imploring him to be strong.

""Omer, if you can hear us, we love you. Stay strong. We won't stop fighting to bring you home. And we won't lose hope,"" she added.

Omer was born and raised in New York. His parents describe him as a friendly person, a sports fan - closely following the NBA and NFL - and an athlete.

""He's just a regular kid with a messy bedroom,"" his mom said. ""He's just this funny, very easygoing, fun guy. And on the other hand, he's the person that knows when to do the right thing and how to step up.""

His father said that Omer is strong, and they have faith in him.

""Our grandfathers managed to show great resourcefulness and survival skills by surviving the Holocaust in Europe while most of their families perished. And maybe those genes trickle down and Omer has them and got that survival instinct that hopefully keeps him strong and alive to go through this hell in the worst place, in Gaza. Probably the worst place in the world,"" he said.

Everything that the family does, every moment, they are thinking of their son.

""When we wake up. Is he waking up? When we shower, we ask ourselves, did he get a shower? Is he getting fresh clothes? When we eat, we think about him. Is he getting food?"" Omer's father said. ""How is he dealing with this? So everything is so personal. Everything is so difficult.""

His mother shared that a few days before Omer was taken captive, a conversation came up about plans for the future.

""Somehow they got to talk about family, and he told her that he knew that if something were to happen to him, that his parents would do everything for him. And of course, we're charged with that. He's our son. He's the one who is tormented and suffering here. And we have to do everything that we can to save him,"" his mother said."
"Dozens killed from an Israeli strike in a Gaza humanitarian zone, Palestinians say",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/g-s1-21731/israel-strike-gaza-deaths,2024-09-10T06:20:01Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on a crowded tent camp housing Palestinians displaced by the war in Gaza killed at least 40 people and wounded 60 others early Tuesday, Palestinian officials said. Israel said it targeted ""significant"" Hamas militants, allegations denied by the militant group.

It was among the deadliest strikes yet in Muwasi, a sprawl of crowded tent camps along the Gaza coast that Israel designated as a humanitarian zone for hundreds of thousands of civilians to seek shelter from the Israel-Hamas war.

The Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run government, said it recovered 40 bodies from the strike and was still looking for people. It said entire families were killed in their tents.

An Associated Press camera operator saw three large craters at the scene, where first responders and displaced people were sifting through the sand and rubble with garden tools and their bare hands by the light of mobile phones. They pulled body parts from the sand, including what appeared to be a human leg.

Attaf al-Shaar, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah, said the strike happened just after midnight and caused a fire.

""The people were buried in the sand. They were retrieved as body parts,"" she told an Associated Press reporter at the scene.

Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, one of three hospitals to receive casualties, said around two dozen bodies were brought in from the strike.

The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas militants who were operating in a command-and-control center. It said its forces used precise munitions, aerial surveillance and other means to avoid civilian casualties.

Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians throughout the war, which was ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. It blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques.

Hamas released a statement denying any militants were in the area. Neither Israel nor Hamas provided evidence to substantiate their claims.

The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders, which now cover around 90% of the territory, have pushed hundreds of thousands of people into Muwasi, a sprawling line of squalid tent camps along the coast.

Aid groups have struggled to provide even basic services in Muwasi, and Israel has occasionally struck targets there despite designating it as a humanitarian zone.

Gaza's Health Ministry says over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead.

The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent much of this year trying to broker an agreement for a cease-fire and the release of the hostages, but the talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas have accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands.

The war has plunged Gaza into a humanitarian crisis, and humanitarian groups have struggled to provide aid because of ongoing fighting, Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order. The international authority on the severity of hunger crises said in June that the territory is at high risk of famine.

The main United Nations agency providing aid to Palestinians said Israeli troops stopped a convoy taking part in a polio vaccination campaign for more than eight hours on Monday, despite it coordinating with the military. UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said the staffers who were held had been taking part in the campaign in northern Gaza and Gaza City.

""The convoy was stopped at gun point just after the Wadi Gaza checkpoint with threats to detain UN staff,"" he wrote on the social platform X. ""Heavy damage was caused by bulldozers to the UN armoured vehicles.""

He said the staff and the convoy later returned to a U.N. base, but it was unclear if a polio vaccination campaign would take place Tuesday in northern Gaza.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The vaccination drive, launched after doctors discovered the first polio case in the Palestinian enclave in 25 years, aims to vaccinate 640,000 children during a war that has destroyed the health care system."
"DOJ charges leaders of white supremacist 'Terrorgram' chat group accused of encouraging hate crimes, murders",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-charges-leaders-white-supremacist-terrorgram-chat-group-accused-encouraging-hate-crimes-murders,2024-09-10T02:16:32Z,"Former NSC senior director Michael Allen joined 'Fox News Live' to discuss ongoing calls for a cease-fire in Gaza after the execution of six Hamas hostages.

Federal prosecutors on Monday announced charges against two people for their alleged involvement in a white supremacist Telegram group that was used to spread hateful content and stir up a race war.

Dallas Humber, 34, of Elk Grove, California, and Matthew Allison, 37, of Boise, Idaho, are charged with a 15-count indictment for soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support for terrorists, the Department of Justice announced in a press release.

Law enforcement officials arrested Humber and Allison on Friday, the DOJ said.

According to the indictment, Humber and Allison were leaders of the ""Terrorgram Collective,"" a transnational terrorist group that operated on Telegram.

TELEGRAM BOSS' ARREST IN FRANCE IS 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO FREE SPEECH,' TECH ENTREPRENEUR SAYS

Federal prosecutors say the channel was used to promote ""white supremacist accelerationism"" and the idea that violence and terrorism were ""necessary to ignite a race war and accelerate the collapse of the government and the rise of a white ethnostate.""

The indictment accuses the two of soliciting followers via the Telegram channel to attack perceived enemies of white people, including government buildings and energy facilities and ""high-value"" targets, such as politicians.

Their incitement to violence included statements such as ""Take Action Now"" and ""Do your part,"" and users who carried out acts to further white supremacy were told they could become known as ""Saints,"" prosecutors said.

DOJ officials said the pair used the app to transmit bomb-making instructions and to distribute a list of potential targets for assassination -- including a federal judge, a senator and a former U.S. attorney -- and to celebrate acts or plots from active ""Terrorgram"" users.

""Today's arrests are a warning that committing hate-fueled crimes in the darkest corners of the internet will not hide you, and soliciting terrorist attacks from behind a screen will not protect you,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said. ""The United States Department of Justice will find you, and we will hold you accountable.""

The U.S. urges Israel to investigate the killing of an American woman in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/09/nx-s1-5106819/us-israel-american-woman-shooting-west-bank,2024-09-09T21:34:53Z,"Editor's note: This story contains descriptions of violence.

The State Department on Monday urged Israel to move quickly to investigate the fatal shooting of an American woman during a protest against Israeli settlements in the West Bank last week. Eyewitnesses said she was shot in the head by Israeli forces policing the protest. Israeli authorities have said they are investigating the incident.

Aysenur Eygi, 26, was killed last Friday while attending a protest as part of a pro-Palestinian activist organization called the International Solidarity Movement, or ISM. For the past two months, ISM volunteers and other international activists have been demonstrating against a settlement outpost called Evyatar, which was initially unauthorized offshoot of the more established settlement of Beita.

While the international community considers all Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to be a violation of international law, such unauthorized outposts are illegal even under Israeli law. But in July, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- himself an ultranationalist settler -- legalized Evyatar and several other outposts.

U.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters Monday that Israel has promised to share its findings with the United States first. ""We expect that to happen as swiftly as possible. We expect that process to be thorough. We expect that process to be transparent,"" Patel said.

That is likely not to be enough to satisfy Eygi's family, who are calling for the Biden administration to push for an independent investigation into the killing ""to ensure full accountability for the guilty parties,"" according to the family's statement Friday.

Eygi, a dual American and Turkish citizen, had recently graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle and had traveled to the West Bank to protest in solidarity with Palestinians. They have been demonstrating against the expansion of Israeli settlements across the West Bank -- a process they say has expanded since the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel last October. The attack in Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israel. In response, the Israeli military campaign in Gaza has killed almost 41,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials.

Eygi had arrived in Israel only two days before she was killed and joined prayers with Palestinians from local communities on top of a hill overlooking the Evyatar outpost before the demonstration began, ISM activists told NPR.

Vivi Chen, an activist who was at the scene, said the Israeli military showed up right after the prayers.

""They pushed us to the bottom of the hill, basically. The army, at this point, had been throwing tear gas. They had fired a few live rounds,"" she said.

The witnesses said there were some clashes and rock-throwing. Activist Jay Harrison hid behind a dumpster and started to run when a shot hit his cover. He said that's when he heard another shot about 15 feet away. ""I saw someone crumble and fall backward,"" he said. He realized it was Eygi. He ran to take her pulse but it was very weak.

""I could see blood coming out their nose. Eyes weren't quite fully shut. You could see her eyes rolled back,"" he said.

An ambulance took Eygi to the Rafidia Hospital in Nablus, the main city in the northern West Bank, where she was shortly pronounced dead. The hospital head, Dr. Fouad Nafaa, said she arrived with fixed, dilated pupils and no heartbeat. She wasn't breathing, and parts of her brain had spilled out. He said doctors performed six cycles of CPR but couldn't save her.

The Israeli military said in a statement that troops fired toward ""a main instigator"" who was throwing rocks at them.

But Harrison disputed that assertion. ""There was no way for anyone to be able to hit them with rocks,"" he said.

Chen, the other activist there that day, claimed it was a deliberate shot. ""It wasn't like there was hundreds of bullets flying in the air and she got struck by accident,"" Chen said. ""She was just moving down the hill, and then she was standing next to an olive tree.""

Israeli military raids and settler violence have risen since Oct. 7, including a major Israeli army raid on Jenin and two other towns in the northern occupied West Bank in recent weeks. Altogether, the attacks have killed more than 650 Palestinians, according to the United Nations.

The ISM says at least three of its activists have been killed since 2000. American ISM activist Rachel Corrie was crushed to death by an Israeli military bulldozer in Gaza in 2003.

Eygi's death was met with shock and grief at the University of Washington.

""I'm absolutely devastated. The whole community is,"" Aria Fani, Eygi's former translation studies teacher, told The Seattle Times. He described Eygi as ""one of the most brilliant students"" he had ever taught.

The Associated Press reported that the Palestinian Authority held a funeral procession Monday for Eygi in the West Bank city of Nablus, but Turkey wants the body transferred there for burial."
Nikki Haley defends Trump support after being called out by Liz Cheney: 'This is about America',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nikki-haley-defends-trump-support-after-being-called-out-liz-cheney-this-about-america,2024-09-09T16:28:47Z,"Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., discusses Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's vow to continue the fight against Hamas and the criticism she received from Liz Cheney for endorsing former President Trump.

Former Trump rival Nikki Haley defended her decision to throw her support behind the GOP nominee after Liz Cheney called her principles into question.

Cheney, a one-time rising Republican Party star who became a top GOP critic of former President Trump, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris last week. She then called out Haley on ABC Sunday for saying she's ""on standby"" to campaign for the GOP nominee.

""I respect [Cheney's] decision, but she can't say my decision is not principled,"" Haley told ""Fox & Friends"" in response, Monday. ""It actually is.""

""We can either vote based on style or we can vote on substance. I'm voting based on substance. I'm looking at the fact we can't live the next four years like we did the last four years. This is no contest. Harris raised taxes. Trump reduced taxes. Harris wants to stop any energy production. Trump built it up. Harris is weak on national security. Trump was strong on national security. Harris has allowed the border to be infiltrated by 8 million people. Trump was much harder on the border.""

HARRIS STOPS IN KEY SWING STATE THAT TRUMP CHARGES VP AND BIDEN 'DISRESPECTED'

Cheney told ""This Week"" yesterday that she can't understand the former South Carolina governor's position ""in any kind of a principled way"" following a contentious GOP primary.

""The things that she [Haley] said that she made clear, when she was running in the primary, those things are true,"" Cheney said. ""Casting a vote for Donald Trump or writing someone in means that you've made the decision in too many instances that so many elected Republicans have made, which is, is to abandon the Constitution.""

In response, Haley said she's ""happy to be helpful"" to Trump's campaign in order to stop a Harris administration.

""This is about my family. This is about America. These are about issues. We should be very clear. If you don't like him, say you don't like him, but you can't say that his policies are worse than Kamala Harris'. That's just not a fact.""

Haley added that Trump needs to work on getting support from ""conservative and moderate Republicans, suburban women, independents, conservative Democrats,"" and predicted that this will be a ""tight election.""

She urged Trump and running mate JD Vance to ""focus on the policies"" to win over voters.

Minutes after Cheney's Harris endorsement, the Trump campaign posted on social media an interview of Cheney on Fox News four years ago taking aim at the current VP.

""Her voting record in the Senate is to the left of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,"" Cheney argued at the time. ""It's very clear, she is a radical liberal.""

Cheney was ousted from Congress in 2022 after losing her Wyoming district's primary to a candidate backed by Trump.

Cheney -- who has argued that the former president is a ""liar,"" a ""con man"" and a potential ""tyrant"" who, if elected again, would ""torch the Constitution"" -- vowed after leaving Congress that ""I will do everything I can to make sure [Trump] is never anywhere near the Oval Office again.""

Iran threatens 'nightmare' for Israel as UN watchdog warns Tehran nuclear programs runs unchecked,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-threatens-nightmare-israel-un-watchdog-warns-tehran-nuclear-programs-runs-unchecked,2024-09-09T15:42:41Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran on Monday continued its threat of a ""nightmare"" attack on Israel following the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in late July, as international concerns remain high over Tehran's nuclear development program which has run unchecked for more than three years.

Commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Hossein Salami said ""the nightmare of Iran's inevitable response is shaking Israel day and night,"" reported the Jerusalem Post, citing Saudi-owned news outlet Al-Arabiya.

The commander reportedly claimed that Israeli leaders are anxious over the ambiguous threat of what will be a ""painful and different"" attack than ""what you expec[t].""

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

Despite the ominous tone set by Salami, Iran has been levying similar threats for over a month at the Jewish state following the killing of Haniyeh during a visit to Tehran on July 31.

Iran has laid the blame squarely on Israel for the assassination, in which it claimed a precision strike missile was used, though Jerusalem has not taken credit for the killing.

The U.S., along with other Middle Eastern nations, have warned Tehran against attacking Israel amid fears that a broader regional war could break out, though concerns remain that Iran could look to launch retaliatory strikes through Hezbollah - the Lebanon-based terrorist organization it has backed for decades.

A member of Israel's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset, Nissim Vaturi, echoed these concerns on Monday and said he believes it is just ""a matter of days"" before war between Israel and Hezbollah breaks out in Lebanon.

Vaturi said Israel needs to take a provocative approach and pre-emptively strike Hezbollah's strong holds in Lebanon through a series of airstrikes followed by ground invasion - a scenario experts have warned will cause casualty rates that could be higher than those that have incurred during the nearly one-year-long war in Gaza.

""I think it's time to deal with the north,"" he said, according to The Times of Israel. ""Our patience has run out.

""There's no other way,"" he continued, adding that Beirut's Dahiyeh suburb -- a major stronghold for Hezbollah outside the capital city -- ""will look like Gaza.""

Iran has yet to specify how it intends to launch this long-awaited retaliatory strike against Israel, though its reported supply of ballistic missiles to the terrorist organization has kept security experts on heightened alert.

HEZBOLLAH IS THE 'X-FACTOR' IN LOOMING ISRAEL, IRAN WAR WITH 'NATION STATE CAPABILITIES'

Iran is not believed to possess nuclear grade weaponry at this time, but a warning issued by the United Nations nuclear watchdog on Monday once again brought renewed attention to the fact that Tehran's nuclear program has run unchecked for the last three and half years.

""It has been more than three and a half years since Iran stopped implementing its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA,"" Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Mariano Grossi told the agency's board of directors. ""Therefore, it is also over three and a half years since the Agency was able to conduct complementary access in Iran.

""Consequently, the Agency has lost continuity of knowledge in relation to the production and inventory of centrifuges, rotors and bellows, heavy water and uranium ore concentrate,"" he added.

Grossi said that Iran is known to have increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium metals of not only 20% purity levels, but 60% - which is just shy of the steps needed to reach weapons grade uranium which is enriched to 90% purity.

""There has been no progress in resolving the outstanding safeguards issues,"" he said, pointing to Iran's false claims that it has declared all nuclear activities, materials and locations. ""I call upon Iran to implement the Joint Statement through serious engagement with the Agency's concrete proposals.""

Rossi said he called on new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to abide by agreements made under a March 4, 2023 joint statement and urged the president to meet with him in the ""not too distant future"" so the pair could ""establish a constructive dialogue that leads swiftly to real results.""

The European Union (EU) on Monday further accused Iran of providing short range ballistic missiles to Russia to aid its war effort against Ukraine, citing ""credible"" information provided by allied nations, reported Radio Free Europe.

The EU is reported to still be investigating the information, but EU spokesman Peter Stano said if Iran is discovered to have provided the escalatory arms to Moscow, the response would be ""swift"" and would include ""new and significant restrictive measures against Iran.""

The Kremlin on Monday did not directly deny having been sent the missiles which are capable of carrying nuclear, chemical and conventional warheads."

David Bellavia reacts to findings from the House investigation into the Afghanistan withdraw and how this event will impact veterans' choice in the upcoming election.

More Black Americans are planning to make their voices heard on Election Day now that Vice President Kamala Harris has replaced President Biden as the Democratic nominee, according to a Monday poll.

The Washington Post-Ipsos poll found that 69% of Black Americans say they are ""absolutely certain to vote"" on Election Day, compared to 62% in April. Meanwhile, a similar New York Times poll found Sunday that 56% of Black Americans said they were ""almost certain"" to vote, with an additional 33% saying they were ""very likely"" to vote.

The Post poll found that Harris' candidacy has had the largest impact on young Black voters, particularly women. The share of Black Americans under 30 who plan to vote has risen 15 points from April, to 47%. Meanwhile, intent to vote among Black women under 40 rose by 18 points since April, to 57%.

Among Black registered voters, 82% say they favor Harris over Trump, according to the Post, while only 12% say they favor Trump. In the Times poll, 78% of Black Americans said they favored Trump, and Trump again scored 14%.

The Post and Ipsos conducted the poll from Aug. 23 to Sept. 3, surveying 1,083 Black Americans. The poll advertises a margin of error of 3.2%.

Harris holds solid or dominating majority support from Black voters when it comes to the issues as well. Only when it comes to Israel's war with Hamas does she lose out on a majority, with 49% of Black Americans saying they trust her to handle the issue. A striking 28% said neither candidate could be trusted on the topic.

Trump's best performance is on immigration, where 19% of Black Americans say he is best to handle the issue. Harris maintains a commanding 55% support on the issue, however.

The poll lands just one day before Harris and Trump are set to square off in their first presidential debate on Tuesday. The pair's campaigns have already laid the groundwork for lines of attack.

More than 3,000 family members of 9/11 victims are demanding both former President Trump and Vice President Harris oppose any Middle East peace deal with Saudi Arabia unless the kingdom acknowledges and is held accountable for its involvement in the attack.

""We waited 23 years for truth, justice and accountability,"" Brett Eagleson, head of the advocacy group 9/11 Justice who lost his father in the World Trade Center, told Fox News Digital ahead of the 23rd anniversary of the nation's deadliest terror attack.

""As we continue to push and as we continue to make noise, we're seeing more and more evidence, smoking-gun evidence coming out about the kingdom's role in supporting 9/11 hijackers, and our government has done nothing to hold them accountable.""

Both Trump and President Biden have been pushing for a security deal that would normalize relations between Israel and the Saudis, allow for civil nuclear energy cooperation and defense guarantees to counter Iran. That deal was put on ice after the Hamas attack on Israel last October.

The families point to video footage of a Saudi government agent ""casing"" the U.S. Capitol as proof of Saudi involvement.

They sent an original letter to both Harris and Trump last week and a follow-up one this week. They also invited both candidates to meet with them at Ground Zero next Wednesday on the 9/11 anniversary.

""As you campaign to become the next President of the United States, we ask you to pledge that you will not endorse any Middle East peace deal involving Saudi Arabia unless it fully addresses the role of the Saudi Arabian government in the 9/11 attacks,"" their letter reads.

HARRIS' RECORD GIVES INSIGHT TO GOALS: GETTING TOUGH ON SAUDI ARABIA AND RENEWING IRAN DEAL

Omar al-Bayoumi, who the FBI says was an operative of the Saudi intelligence service with close ties to two of the 9/11 hijackers, can be seen filming a video published by CBS in June 2024 around the Capitol pointing out entrances and exits, security posts and a model of the building.

Al-Bayoumi noted the airport nearby and pointed to the Washington Monument and said he would ""report to you what is in there.""

Federal investigators believe the hijackers of Flight 93, which crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, had intentions of flying the plane into the Capitol.

""We're saying that if the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia truly wants to engage with the West, and they want to continue to buy our weapons, and they want our nuclear technology, and they want the defense of our troops, the least they can do is admit their fault and admit that the practices within their government 23 years ago, with supporting the hijackers and exporting this radical form of Islam, admit that it were not for that, 9/11 would have never had happened.""

Eagleson said Saudi Crown-Prince Mohammed bin Salman [MBS] ""had nothing to do with 9/11 - we were both 15 at the time.""

""To MBS' credit, he is sort of being a progressive, but ... it doesn't absolve them from the sins of their past.""

Formed by families of victims in Pennsylvania, New York and Virginia, 9/11 Justice has sued the Saudi government and pushed the U.S. government to declassify all remaining documents about 9/11.

Fifteen of the 19 al Qaeda hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, but the direct links of the Saudi government have remained murky for years.

""The leaders of our government, the two candidates for office, have refused to address this issue, and we're sick and tired of it,"" said Eagleson.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

In 2021, Biden signed an executive order for the review and declassification of 9/11 documents, but it's ""not working,"" Eagleson says.

""We're having to go outside of the country to get this information,"" he added, noting that the casing video had come from British police. The London Police provided the FBI with the video years ago, but it was never made available to the 9/11 commission or the CIA, according to Deputy Director Michael Morrell.

Columbia anti-Israel agitators to reach 'crescendo of intimidation' as school suffers latest black eye,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/columbia-anti-israel-agitators-reach-crescendo-intimidation-school-suffers-latest-black-eye,2024-09-09T08:08:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As Columbia University began its new semester on Tuesday, the tense anti-Israel demonstrations that have divided its campus showed no sign of slowing.

On the first day of the New York City Ivy League's term this week, demonstrators gathered at the school's gates as an NYPD police drone hovered over their heads - although there were at least two arrests, according to the agency, police categorized the gatherings as ""peaceful.""

Cornell Law Professor William Jacobson, president of the Legal Insurrection Foundation and of EqualProtect.org, told Fox News Digital that he did not foresee campus relations improving soon.

""I think we're going to see a crescendo of intimidation and hostility as we approach October 7,"" he said, referring to the anniversary of Hamas' attack on southern Israel, during which Palestinian fighters took hostages, killed civilians and committed other war crimes.

""[Protesters have] already announced plans to hold celebrations [that day].""

""We're dealing with a cult on campus, and that's dangerous and difficult,"" he said.

GOP LEADERS VOW 'ACTION' AS COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SWARMED BY ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS

Columbia's former president, Nemat Shafik, resigned last month after her handling of protesters on campus ""[took] a considerable toll on [her] family."" Sparks had flown after Shafik, the school's third president over an eight-month period, called in hundreds of armed police officers to arrest over 30 protesters who had barricaded themselves inside an academic building.

Now, interim president Katrina Armstrong is tasked with maintaining order on the embattled campus. Since she took her position, new restrictions and changes have been made on campus in an attempt to control the conflict, according to the school's updated code of conduct.

Camping is now banned on the school's campus, with new signs and guards dotting the school's south lawns, according to Reuters. Gates to the campus that were kept open to surrounding streets for decades have been closed under a new system that restricts access to students, with guards only allowing those with Columbia IDs and preregistered guests to enter. Officials have set up fences and gates on wheels around campus, which will be used to cordon off small areas.

The changes come as the non-profit Foundation of Individual Rights and Expression ranked Columbia in 250th place - second to last - in its annual College Free Speech Rankings.

JEWISH STUDENTS DESCRIBE GOING TO COLLEGE IN NYC AMID INTENSE ANTI-ISRAELI PROTESTS: 'TARGET ON MY BACK'

For every conservative student on campus, there are five liberal students, according to the group's survey. Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported that they had self-censored on campus at least once or twice a month.

""Surrounding my campus has been a 'doxxing truck' since October 2023, wherein students who express any criticism of Israel are identified by their full name and a giant picture under the label 'Antisemite of the Week' on a large truck with a digital screen,"" one rising junior told the surveyors.

""Students have reported this to the administration multiple times, and they did nothing for months. Friends of mine have also lost jobs and internship opportunities because of their political beliefs,"" the student said.

Another student said that ""most professors and classes assume progressive ideas as matters of fact"" and that ""most of the curriculum is curated to fit this narrative . . . students in agreement are catered to.""

MASKED ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DEMONSTRATE AS STUDENTS CHECK IN FOR FIRST DAY OF CLASSES

Jacobson said that in his experience at Cornell and based on what he has been told by Columbia students, a large part of protest culture is ""faculty driven,"" with professors ""liv[ing] out a fantasy that they're very revolutionary.""

""In fact, they're very careerist, very bourgeouis. They don't sacrifice themselves at all, but they're happy to have the students sacrifice themselves,"" he said.

In an effort to combat hostility on campus, Columbia's Antisemitism Task Force published its second report, which details complaints from students who were harassed for their Jewish faith on campus.

""On campus, my friends have been spit on, been called like terrible, terrible names. A very close friend of mine was called a lover of genocide and then a lover of baby killing,"" one student, who wears a traditional head covering, told the task force. ""This was only a couple of days after October seventh.""

Scores more students reported ""painful experiences of hostility"" in the 91-page report.

""You have denialism, just like you have denialism about October 7,"" Jacobson said of the report and abysmal free expression ranking. ""I think that's a good thing. It may not result in positive change, but at least people can no longer deny what's happening.""

""It would not surprise me that schools with the most activism have the least free expression. The activism is intended to be intimidating,"" Jacobson said. ""These are not protests where people are hoping to have a debate, they are protests meant to stifle a debate.""

When asked for comment by Fox News Digital on the purported lack of free expression on campus, interim president Armstrong reiterated a portion of a recent message sent to students.

""Everyone needs to feel engaged, that their voices matter and that they belong here,"" Armstrong wrote. ""Protests need to be managed effectively and fairly. That requires holding two truths at once. The truth is that our mission depends upon free speech and open debate. And the truth that our mission equally depends upon an environment free of harassment and discrimination, where our students can learn. There is no doubt that holding those two truths requires understanding and effectively implementing our policies, rules and procedures, just as it does in the society around us."""
"Hezbollah relies on 'sophisticated' tunnel system backed by Iran, North Korea in fight against Israel",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-relies-sophisticated-tunnel-system-backed-iran-north-korea-fight-against-israel,2024-09-09T08:08:09Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Despite Israel's nearly one-year-long war with Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks, security experts continue to sound the alarm that Jerusalem's greatest threat actually lies to the north in Lebanon, where Hezbollah has developed a sophisticated tunnel system.

Hezbollah, an Islamic terrorist organization that has long had the backing of Iran, has over the last two decades developed a network of tunnels that stretch more than 100 miles in cumulative length throughout southern Lebanon.

Though the existence of the tunnels has been known for decades, the significant role they play in arming Hezbollah has once again come to light during the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, where terrorists have not only relied on tunnels for operational rearmament and maneuvering capabilities but also to house hostages taken by Hamas nearly a year ago.

While it is estimated that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have eradicated roughly 80% of Hamas' tunnels, Hezbollah's tunnels, which have largely remained untouched since the war in Gaza began, are believed to be far more sophisticated and ""significantly larger,"" according to a report by the Alma Research and Education Center, a nonprofit organization that researches Israeli security challenges along its northern border.

NETANYAHU HITS BACK OVER GLOBAL PRESSURE TO MAKE CEASE-FIRE CONCESSIONS, SAYS DEMANDS ARE 'IMMORAL', 'INSANE'

Hezbollah is believed to have begun mining its tunnels after the Second Lebanon War in 2006 in close coordination between Iran and North Korea after Tehran reportedly derived ""inspiration"" from Pyongyang and the tunnels that it developed in the aftermath of the Korean War.

Iran deemed North Korea a ""professional authority on the subject of tunneling"" due to its experience in digging tunnels for military use when it attempted to drill tunnels across the Korean Demilitarized Zone in an attempt to militarily invade areas just north of Seoul, the capital of South Korea.

While the tunnels and their intended use were never realized by the authoritarian nation, two of the four neutralized tunnels uncovered were reportedly capable of accommodating up to 30,000 troops per hour along with armaments like armored personnel carriers, tanks and field artillery - an operational blueprint Hezbollah has turned to in its fight against Israel.

The report found that Hezbollah under the advisership of North Korea - a relationship that may have begun as far back as the 1980s - built two types of tunnels across southern Lebanon, ""offensive tunnels and infrastructure tunnels.""

The offensive tunnels were intended for similar operational use as North Korea's, and at least six tunnels were discovered by IDF forces that led into Israeli territory during Operation Northern Shield, which began in December 2018.

Alma's research found that some of Hezbollah's tunnels are also capable of transporting ATVs, motorcycles and other ""small vehicles,"" though it did not specify the number of terrorists that they could accommodate.

The tunnels are equipped with ""underground command and control rooms, weapons and supply depots, field clinics and specified designated shafts used to fire missiles of all types,"" the report said, noting that arms like rockets, surface-to-surface missiles, anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles can be fired from ""shafts"" in the tunnels. ""These shafts are hidden and camouflaged and cannot be detected above ground.""

DOJ CHARGES HAMAS LEADERS OVER 'TERRORIST ATROCITIES' IN OCT 7 ISRAEL ATTACK

The tunnels are believed to connect the capital of Beirut, where Hezbollah's central headquarters is located and its logistical base in the Beqaa Valley near the Syrian border, to southern Lebanon.

""We call this inter-regional tunnel network 'Hezbollah's Land of the Tunnels,'"" the Alma report first released in 2021 detailed, noting the tunnel system is more akin to a ""metro"" of tunnels rather than one long tunnel.

The second series of tunnels Hezbollah mined, known as the infrastructure tunnels, form an underground network in and near southern Lebanese villages that establishes the first and second ""lines of defense"" against an Israeli invasion - a project of ""enormous magnitude,"" according to the Alma report.

One such tunnel is estimated to be nearly 28 miles long, prompting the question as to how the terrorist organization was able to get away with building such a sophisticated system without opposition from the Lebanese government.

""Hezbollah does try to keep the locations, routes, internal structure, etc., of these tunnels a secret. [It] does this by expropriating territories, by preventing civilians from entering into certain areas and by taking advantage of [its] presence and influence in the government,"" Boaz Shapira, a researcher with Alma, told Fox News Digital.

Shapira said Hezbollah not only has the support of roughly 40%-50% of the Lebanese population, it is ""much better funded, organized, trained and armed"" than the Lebanese government, army, police or even the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which has a force of some 10,500 peacekeeping troops in Lebanon and that were put in place after the 2006 war.

Hezbollah's cooperation with authoritarian nations like Iran and North Korea has long made it a major threat to Israel.

But its growing power within Lebanon has moved it to the top of the list when it comes to Israeli security threats, according to not only Shapira but also former IDF Major Gen. Yaakov Amidror.

""Lebanon's government is too weak to counter Hezbollah,"" Amidror told Fox News Digital. ""Everything important is decided by Hezbollah, not by the government.""

HEZBOLLAH OPERATIVES KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES AS TERROR GROUP FIRES 100 ROCKETS AT JEWISH STATE

Hezbollah is believed to have as many as 50,000 terrorists and, according to Shapira, its sphere of influence has extended to nearly every branch of Lebanon's security apparatus.

""Taking action against Hezbollah would be perceived as cooperation with Israel and basically as treason in Lebanon, and in the past year also against the Palestinians,"" he said. ""That means that no one in the army has any incentive for challenging Hezbollah.""

Shapira said demographics inside the once predominately Christian nation have shifted over the last several decades, and it now has a majority Muslim population - though the U.S. State Department analyzes the breakdown in Muslim populations in Lebanon as nearly equally divided between Shiite and Sunni groups.

""This trend is happening in the army as well. That means that almost every Shiite soldier in the army has a brother, cousin, friend that is a Hezbollah terrorist,"" Shapira said.

Amidror, a distinguished fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America after serving as Israel's former national security adviser to the prime minister and a 36-year veteran of the IDF, told Fox News Digital he believes Israel needs to take a proactive approach when it comes to countering Hezbollah.

""We should initiate the war against Hezbollah,"" he said, noting that the timing of its operation is the main variable that needs to be determined.

""It will not be an easy job. It will be a very, very devastating war for us and for Lebanon,"" the retired major general said. ""Remember that at least 50% of their missiles had been hidden within populated areas.

""The casualties will be huge, [a] devastating war for us and for them,"" Amidror continued. ""This is why it is so problematic to fight these organizations, because they are fighting from within their own population, [and their] targets are the Israeli population.

""When you fight from within civilians and your targets are civilians, it's very complicated to fight it,"" he added."

A new report found the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) guilty of violating its own editorial guidelines over a thousand times in its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.

According to The Telegraph, the report analyzed four months of BBC output on television, radio, online, podcasts and on social media during the height of the conflict and found a ""deeply worrying pattern of bias"" against Israel.

British lawyer Trevor Asserson and a team of about 20 lawyers and 20 data scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze nine million words from the news outlet, starting the day of the October 7, 2023, terror attack.

The researchers allegedly identified 1,553 instances where the BBC violated its own editorial guidelines on impartiality, accuracy, editorial values and public interest.

BBC CHAIR DENIES PLEA FROM 200 JEWISH STAFFERS CALLING FOR FORMAL PROBE INTO ANTISEMITISM AT THE NEWSROOM

The report accuses the BBC of downplaying Hamas terrorism and painting Israel as the aggressor in dozens of instances.

Israel was associated with ""war crimes"" four times more frequently than Hamas (127 vs. 30); genocide 14 times more often (283 vs. 19), and breaching international law six times more often than Hamas (167 vs. 27).

BBC reporters who had shown hostility toward Israel on social media were also featured in the network's war coverage, the report claimed.

Researchers reportedly found 11 instances on the BBC's Arabic channel, where it featured reporters who had previously made public statements in support of terrorism and Hamas.

""The findings reveal a deeply worrying pattern of bias and multiple breaches by the BBC of its own editorial guidelines on impartiality, fairness and establishing the truth,"" the report said, according to the Telegraph.

BBC ANCHOR ASKS IF ISRAELI FORCES WARNED PALESTINIANS AHEAD OF HOSTAGE RESCUE MISSION: DEFEATS 'THE PURPOSE'

A spokesperson for the BBC questioned the report's methodology and said they would ""carefully consider"" the report's findings after reviewing it, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""We have serious questions about the methodology of this report, particularly its heavy reliance on AI to analyze impartiality, and its interpretation of the BBC's editorial guidelines. We don't think coverage can be assessed solely by counting particular words divorced from context. We are required to achieve due impartiality, rather than the 'balance of sympathy' proposed in the report, and we believe our knowledgeable and dedicated correspondents are achieving this, despite the highly complex, challenging and polarizing nature of the conflict,"" the spokesperson said.

""However, we will consider the report carefully and respond directly to the authors once we have had time to study it in detail,"" the spokesperson added.

The BBC also staunchly rejected the report's claims that its reporters ""celebrated acts of terror.""

Watchdog group Campaign Against Antisemitism claimed the report exposed the BBC's ideological bias.

""Despite its persistent claims of impartiality and stubbornness in the face of complaints, the BBC's ideological bias is now shamefully clear. This report vindicates with empirical data what we have said -- and the Jewish community has known -- for a long time,"" the group said with a link to The Telegraph report.

""Our polling shows that an overwhelming majority of British Jews -- 86% -- consider that anti-Israel bias in our media fuels antisemitism. The BBC should apologize for its biased and inflammatory reporting, but since the BBC has so stubbornly closed ranks and denied that there is a problem over the decades, the fundamental reform that is plainly necessary must come from outside. The answer to this report must begin with a transparent and unconstrained independent inquiry,"" the post continued.

The BBC has been criticized for refusing to label Hamas a terrorist group in the October 7 aftermath. In a previous statement to Fox News Digital, the BBC said they use the terrorist label when it's attributed to others, such as the UK Government."

A recent undercover video showing a United Nations legal affairs employee saying the world body is scared of a Trump presidency is shining a new spotlight on Trump's policy toward many of the U.N.'s scandal-plagued agencies.

The U.N. Office of Legal Affairs official was recorded on an undercover video stating, ""I'm not sure the United Nations as an institution is going to survive a second term by Trump."" The Louder with Crowder podcast conducted the undercover recording and first disclosed it.

While the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, as president he was viewed as being very tough on the world body by taking an aggressive posture against U.N. corruption, anti-Americanism and antisemitism while pushing American interests.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER: 'DOZENS' OF UNRWA STAFF TOOK PART IN HAMAS' OCT 7 MASSACRE

Trump stopped funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Fox News Digital reported in August that the U.N. had been forced to fire nine UNRWA employees over likely involvement in the Hamas massacre on October 7 of nearly 1,200 people in southern Israel, including over 30 Americans.

Trump withdrew from the U.N. Human Rights Council; the U.N.'s World Health Organization; the U.N.'s cultural organization UNESCO; and the Paris climate agreement.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson for Trump said at the time the decision ""reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO.""

Biden quickly rejoined the U.N. bodies, including the Paris climate deal, that Trump walked away from during his term. However, Biden suspended funds for UNRWA after its role in the Hamas terrorist attack was exposed by Israel.

DOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA

In 2021, former Trump U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley warned the White House about rejoining the Human Rights Council, because it is influenced by communist totalitarian regimes like China and Cuba, to name just a few.

""If President Biden truly cared about human rights, he would keep us far away from the cesspool that is the U.N. Human Rights Council,"" said Haley at the time.

A senior Republican Congressional staffer who works on international affairs told Fox News Digital, ""There are a list of things that are standard Republican positions now, which will happen immediately after President Trump reenters the White House, along with policies that he pursued in his first term which he will re-implement.""

The staffer continued that ""First and foremost, they will withdraw the U.S. from participating in the anti-American, antisemitic organizations across the United Nations that the Biden-Harris administration has been engaging and funding. They will also order our diplomats to start pushing back against international policies that undermine our interests, instead of trying to implement them the way the Biden-Harris have been doing.""

When asked about Paoletti's comment, Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for the U.N. Secretary General, referred Fox News Digital to his comments at his recent press briefing. He said, ""The gentleman you refer to is not a senior U.N. official. He is a junior staffer. From looking at the video, his comments were recorded in what seemed to be in a restaurant private setting without his knowledge. He was not speaking on behalf of the Organization in any way, shape or form.""

He added, ""But I will just state for a fact that this is not-you know, when someone is recorded without their knowledge in a private setting, I don't think any good journalist could interpret it as being the official position of the United Nations.""

Anne Bayefsky, president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital, ""So the U.N. gets caught weighing in on the U.S. election vehemently against Trump and the response is, ""Who, me?"" she added, ""Today's U.N. has forsaken its original purpose and threatens American fundamental rights and freedoms. One side of the American political spectrum tolerates America-bashing and Israel-hating under the guise of a phantom global messiah, and the other side gets it. Of course, the U.N. is afraid that Americans will get it, too.""

Bayefsky concluded, ""Obviously the U.N. has a mutual love affair with Democrats: Obama went to the Security Council to adopt the far-reaching and catastrophic Iran deal before bothering to ask Congress; Obama-Harris-Biden joined and legitimized the U.N. 'Human Rights' Council - home base for despots and antisemites looking to burnish their human rights credentials while Trump withdrew from it; Obama-Harris-Biden support UNRWA while Trump said no more money for the fake Palestinian U.N. 'refugee' agency perpetuating the Arab-Israeli conflict; Obama-Harris-Biden have used the Security Council to bludgeon Israel with resolutions that have never condemned Hamas while Trump repeatedly rejected U.N. ploys to do an end run around American and Israeli sovereignty.""

DAVID MARCUS: Why Kamala Harris' press pool deserves Pulitzer Prize,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-why-kamala-harris-press-pool-deserves-pulitzer-prize,2024-09-08T14:37:10Z,"Genius is often described as the ability to see a new way forward, to advance a discipline in a manner that transcends old, stuffy definitions and ushers us into brave new worlds. On this score, Kamala Harris' press pool is very deserving of just and proper recognition.

This is why I believe that the Harris press pool members should receive a Pulitzer Prize for their unique approach this election cycle, in which the candidate is never asked any questions relevant to being president, but rather given the joyous opportunity to simply share her deeply human qualities.

HARRIS VISITS SPICE SHOP KNOWN FOR HATING REPUBLICANS, CALLS FOR END TO 'DIVISIVENESS'

Just this weekend in Pittsburgh we saw the power of this New Journalism on display. The stodgy old, and let's face it, mostly white dudes of newspapers past might have been focused on Hersch Goldberg-Polin, the American murdered by Hamas, or this week's disappointing job numbers.

But instead, notice this gem from a Washington Post writer on X: ""Kamala just went into Penzeys Spices and bought Creamy Peppercorn Dressing Base, Fox Point Seasoning, Trinidad Lemon-Garlic Marinade, Turkish Seasoning, and Tuscan Sunset Salt Free Italian Seasoning.""

Woodward and Bernstein should be proud.

Notice the progressive and welcome diversity of the candidate's spice rack. Do you think Donald ""Big Macs"" Trump could even tell the difference between Trinidad Garlic Marinade and Turkish seasoning?

These are the issues that Harris' press pool has a laser-like focus on, rather than old school trivialities like economic policies. And just look at what the American voters have already learned:

Tim Walz loves 'white guy' tacos, apple cider donuts, and pork chops on a stick. Would-be first gentleman Doug Emhoff likes to eat pretzels at night, in fact, a few more than Kamala would prefer. Talk about a scoop!

And while Harris won't answer questions about domestic or foreign policy, she loves Doritos and her recipe for bathtub collard greens is right out there, thanks to her press pool, for anyone to make at home and judge for themselves. That's transparency!

But it isn't just print journalists changing coverage for the better. The 'folx' with cameras and microphones are breaking new ground with their unique approach of not asking any questions and pretending that they are filming a Bat Mitzvah.

Again at Penzeys, our fearless video press caught a candid moment of candidate Harris comforting an older white woman who was in tears for reasons nobody can quite understand.

Imagine how rude it would have been to yell out, ""Madam Vice President, when will you do a solo interview?"" or ""Do you still believe in reparations?"" at such a soul-touching moment.

No, this new generation of journalists understands that the American voters don't need to know pointless specifics about how Harris might govern. They need to feel how real and powerful the vibes are.

KAMALA HARRIS' MEDIA DODGING IS IRKING VOTERS

There could be no more appropriate honor for these ink-stained heroes than a Pulitzer Prize. This is the laurel, after all, won in 2018 by the New York Times and Washington Post for their bogus coverage of the phony Trump-Russia collusion story.

Of course, the story itself was a flaming bag of nonsense, but that's not the point. It afflicted the Trump presidency for four years and comforted Hillary Clinton supporters, many of whom are still convinced Trump cheated.

The Harris press pool has found an even more elegant way to uphold the ultimate duty of journalism, which is, of course, to get Democrats elected.

No need to smudge the truth, as in the Russia hoax or the Hunter Biden laptop denials. Instead, just cover the feels, just give us a movie montage of lovable 'Mamala' Harris and goofy Tim Walz.

Mark my words, this new form of journalism will be taught in re-education camps, I mean journalism schools, for years if not decades to come.

We are living through history, the end of the cold, hard journalism of the past with its demands for truthful answers, towards a warmer, softer news media that smothers honesty in a soft quilt of ignorance.

It is for this firm dedication to helping her obfuscate her politics that Kamala Harris' press pool could not be more deserving of a Pulitzer Prize, and not just for all the recipes, but for reminding us that what really matters most is defeating Donald Trump."
"An inside look at Israel's special forces rescue unit fighting terrorists, rescuing hostages: 'Full on Fauda'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/inside-look-israels-special-forces-rescue-unit-fighting-terrorists-rescuing-hostages-full-fauda,2024-09-08T13:22:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

When commandos from Israel's elite Yamam counter-terrorism force launched a daring daytime raid on two homes deep within central Gaza and successfully rescued four hostages who had forcefully been taken across the border on October 7, it was the first time many people would learn of the unit's existence.

For years, the operations of Yamam have been shrouded in secrecy. Often, credit for its missions was given to other units. ""Up until a few years ago, not many people knew about Yamam's activities,"" a unit source told Fox News Digital. But in the age of smartphones and social media, videos of their operations have spread online. ""Today, with social media broadcasting operations in real-time, we understand that the rules of the game have changed,"" the source says.

Yamam -- Yeḥida Merkazit Meyuḥedet, in Hebrew, or Special Central Unit -- was founded in 1974 as a special unit of Israel's Border Police, with the primary mission to take control of and resolve hostage situations. In this regard, it is similar to the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, but because it also is capable of rapid offensive raids, such as the hostage rescue executed in Gaza in June, it is closely aligned with such elite American units as Delta Force and Navy SEALs, with whom they are also said to train and cooperate.

ISRAEL RESCUES HOSTAGE AFTER 325 DAYS IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY

""Yamam is like an aircraft carrier with a wide range of in-house capabilities,"" said Zohar Dvir, a retired unit commander, told Fox News Digital. The unit includes specialists like snipers, bomb disposal experts, canine handlers, medics and undercover agents known as ""mista'aravim."" ""It's full on 'Fauda,"" Dvir added.

""Yamam equips its personnel with cutting-edge technology,"" David Tzur, a retired commander from the group, told Fox News Digital. ""The unit serves as a testing ground for innovations, collaborating with civilian and defense industries to refine and replicate technologies for broader use.""

""What sets Yamam apart is their ability to carry out thousands of high-risk operations with exceptional precision,"" Dvir explained.

""Yamam is considered one of the most experienced -- if not the most experienced -- counter-terrorism units globally,"" a unit commander speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News Digital. ""Because of the realities we face daily, countering terrorist threats in the West Bank, Yamam fighters participate in hundreds of operations each year. After Oct. 7, we joined the fight in Gaza.""

As part of a condition of talking to Fox News Digital all current Yamam members withheld their full names due to security considerations.

Intelligence pinpointing the location of the hostages in the densely populated Nuseirat refugee camp had been gathered weeks earlier by Shin Bet, Israel's internal intelligence service, with the help of American and British drones. ""We knew about the situation weeks before,"" explains Captain A., a team leader told Fox News Digital. ""We received the mission, studied the target, and began our preparations.""

On a Saturday morning, the operatives arrived in civilian trucks at the target locations, which were just a few hundred meters apart. Storming the two locations, they rescued the four hostages. At the first site, Noa Argamani, whose terrified image was seen worldwide as she was shown being taken away on a motorcycle by terrorists from Israel on the morning of October 7, was found. At the second location, they rescued Shlomi Ziv, Andrey Kozlov and Almog Meir.

There was resistance, but ""everything went according to plan,"" said Deputy Superintendent A, a key figure in the operation.

The team faced a particularly challenging situation at Argamani's location, where they feared one of the terrorists was close to her. ""The goal was to get as close to her as quickly as possible, and that's what we did. We only realized she was alive when A. and D."" -- two operatives on the team -- ""shouted, 'We have a diamond! We have a diamond!' Once we confirmed she was with us, our priority was to get her out safely,"" Sgt. Major Y. recounts.

Operatives shielded Argamani with their bodies as they moved her to safety under heavy fire. ""She was barefoot, so D. carried her on his back. She was terrified and couldn't believe what was happening, even when we told her, 'We're here to take you home,'"" A. told Fox News Digital.

While Argamani's rescue went smoothly, the situation at the second apartment was far more complicated. As the team entered, they faced ""very effective"" fire. In the ensuing battle, the team's commander, Arnon Zmora, was critically injured. ""Everything happened very quickly. It was a matter of seconds,"" recalls Captain A.

As with the rescue of Argamani, the team shielded the hostages with their body armor and helmets as they evacuated them under fire. ""The area was like a hornets' nest, packed with militants inside and outside,"" A. says. ""We quickly moved [the hostages] towards the military vehicles, all the while taking effective fire from within the apartment and its surrounding.""

Though the hostages were rescued unharmed, the end of the mission was tragic for the members of the Yamam team. ""We saved the hostages, but we lost one of our own,"" one of the fighters told Fox Digital News, speaking of Arnon Zmora, a 36-year-old father of two young boys. ""But this is both our privilege and our duty,"" he said. ""We'll fight until the last soldier, no matter the cost.""

""While these operations are heroic, they create the illusion that military pressure alone will free the hostages,"" said Tzur. ""If there's an operational window for a rescue, we should take it, but ultimately, we'll need to make a tough and ugly deal. On October 7th, we were caught off guard, and now we're forced to negotiate with the devil. Only a deal can bring the hostages back alive,"" he said.

The Nuseirat raid was the third time Yamam was involved in the rescue of hostages kidnapped by Hamas, including that of Private Ori Megidish, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) lookout held captive in the Gaza Strip, and Fernando Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70, who were held in Rafah.

As one of Israel's most elite forces -- its operations are often authorized at the highest levels, including the Prime Minister's Office -- the unit's fighters generally are older than conscripts in the IDF, and they have already experienced intense combat during their service in the IDF.

When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, YAMAM operatives were the first to respond to the unfolding crisis, fighting across 15 different locations that day, including a 27-hour-long battle against Hamas's elite Nukba force at the police station in Sderot, an Israeli city adjacent to the northern border with Gaza. Nine Yamam fighters were killed in that fight.

""They prevented the advance of Hamas' elite forces northward, stopping them at Yad Mordechai and neutralizing many of them. The team, led by Arnon Zmora, halted their progress towards Ashdod, Ashkelon, and even as far as Tel Aviv,"" said Dvir and added, ""they eliminated more than 200 terrorists.""

""We fight for two reasons,"" said G., a Yamam fighter who was in the Sderot battle. ""One is the desire to destroy the enemy and to be the first to engage them. But much stronger than that,"" he says, ""is the desire to save lives."""
Netanyahu blasts 'Iran's axis of evil' after Jordan border terror attack kill 3 Israelis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-blasts-irans-axis-evil-after-jordan-border-terror-attack-kills-3-israelis,2024-09-08T12:27:05Z,"Former President Trump vowed to ""end chaos in the Middle East"" during a rally on Saturday, warning that Israel will be ""doomed"" if Kamala Harris is elected president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted what he called Iran's ""axis of evil"" in remarks Sunday after a terrorist attack at the West Bank-Jordan border crossing killed three Israelis.

""It's a hard day. A despicable terrorist murdered three of our citizens in cold blood at the Allenby Bridge. On behalf of the government, I send my condolences to the families of the victims,"" Netanyahu said at the beginning of his cabinet meeting Sunday. ""We are surrounded by a murderous ideology led by Iran's axis of evil. In recent days, despicable terrorists have murdered six of our hostages in cold blood and three Israeli police officers. The killers do not distinguish between us, they want to murder us all, until the last one; right and left, secular and religious, Jews and non-Jews.""

The Israeli military said a gunman approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces, who killed the assailant in a shootout. It said the three people killed were Israeli civilians. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said they were all men in their 50s.

Jordan, a Western-allied Arab country with a large Palestinian population, is investigating the shooting, its state-run Petra News Agency reported.

TRUMP CLAIMS ISRAEL WILL BE 'GONE' WITHIN TWO YEARS IF HARRIS IS ELECTED PRESIDENT: VIDEO

Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri celebrated the attack, connecting the shooting to Israel's offensive in Gaza.

""We expect many more similar actions,"" he said, according to Reuters.

It marked the first attack of its kind along the West Bank-Jordan border crossing since Hamas terrorists killed approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. Another 250 were taken as hostages into Gaza, and Hamas are still holding approximately 100 of them. Around a third of the remaining hostages inside Gaza are believed to be dead.

""What prevents the elimination of our people as in the past is the strength of the State of Israel and the strength of the Israel Defense Forces,"" Netanyahu continued Sunday. ""The heroic spirit of the soldiers, the policemen, the men and women of our security forces, the supreme sacrifice of our fallen heroes and the resilience of our people - that's all the difference. When we stand together - our enemies cannot, so their main goal is to divide us, to sow division within us.""

Over the weekend, Netanyahu noted, ""the German newspaper Bild published an official Hamas document that reveals its plan of action: to sow division within us, to wage psychological warfare on the families of the hostages, to exert internal and external political pressure on the Israeli government, to tear us apart from the inside, and to continue the war until further notice, until the defeat of Israel.""

""The vast majority of Israeli citizens do not fall into this trap of Hamas,"" the prime minister said. ""They know that we are committed with all our might to achieve the goals of the war - to eliminate Hamas, to return all our hostages, to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel and to safely return our residents in the north and south to their homes.""

NETANYAHU SAYS SECURITY IN GAZA IS CRITICAL TO STOP HAMAS SMUGGLING HOSTAGES INTO IRAN: 'LOST FOREVER'

""We will stand together, we will hold on to David's link together, and with God's help we will win,"" Netanyahu said. ""And lastly, some ask - 'Will you forever hold a sword?' In the Middle East, without a sword there is no eternity.""

The Allenby crossing over the Jordan River, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, is mainly used by Palestinians and international tourists, as well as for cargo shipments. The crossing has seen very few security incidents over the years, but in 2014 Israeli security guards shot and killed a Jordanian judge who they said had attacked them, the Associated Press reported.

Authorities in Israel and Jordan said the crossing was closed until further notice, and Israel later announced the closure of both of its land crossings with Jordan, near Beit Shean in the north and Eilat in the south."
Opinion | Why the DOJ just filed charges against Hamas leaders it is unlikely to ever arrest,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doj-charges-hamas-leaders-arrest-israel-rcna169910,2024-09-08T11:54:00Z,"As Attorney General Merrick Garland noted in his press remarks this week, ""the Justice Department has a long memory.""

Those were the first questions that sprang to mind Tuesday, when the Justice Department unsealed a criminal complaint charging six leaders of Hamas for their roles in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel that killed around 1,200 people, including 40 U.S. citizens. A DOJ press statement said the attack was the ""culmination of Hamas's decades-long campaign of terrorism and violence against Israel and its allies, including American citizens.""

According to the complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Hamas was founded ""to create an Islamic Palestinian state throughout Israel by eliminating the State of Israel through violent holy war."" The complaint further states that ""Hamas has murdered and injured dozens of Americans as part of its campaign of violence and terror,"" and has done so ""in retaliation for and in an effort to weaken American support for Israel's right to exist and defense of that right."" The 38-page document details decades of brutal attacks and atrocities going back to 1997 that were allegedly committed by a group the U.S. government has designated a foreign terrorist organization since.

Let's start with the first question. Why would the DOJ file charges against Hamas leaders it is unlikely to ever arrest and bring to trial, particularly when three of those leaders have been already been killed?

First, the Justice Department has long been in the business of using criminal prosecution to hold terrorists who kill American citizens accountable, even when the conduct occurs overseas. For example, in 2002, the Justice Department announced charges against Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh for his role in the brutal killing of journalist Daniel Pearl, despite the defendant's pending charges in Pakistan. In 2017, Ahmed Abu Khatallah was convicted in a U.S. court for helping to plan and carry out the 2012 attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi that resulted in the death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans posted in Libya.

In some instances, it can take years or even decades to bring defendants to justice, but the DOJ has pursued terrorists relentlessly across administrations. In 2020, the Justice Department unsealed charges against the accused maker of the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103 and killed 190 Americans over Lockerbie, Scotland, 34 years earlier. In 2021, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York announced charges against Taliban commander Haji Najibullah for his alleged role in the killing of three American service members in 2008. In 2011, prosecution of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was completed with the life sentence of the fifth defendant, Ahmad Ghailani.

As Attorney General Merrick Garland noted in his press remarks this week, ""the Justice Department has a long memory,"" vowing to pursue terrorists responsible for murdering Americans ""for the rest of their lives.""

The second reason to file criminal charges is to achieve what the DOJ and other experts sometimes refer to as ""naming and shaming."" Even when charges do not result in a criminal conviction and penalty, they can serve as a sort of moral condemnation on the world stage, in this case forcing foreign governments to take note of Hamas' record of terrorism.

To the extent Hamas portrays itself as a legitimate political entity or one engaged in humanitarian efforts, the indictment paints a starkly different picture of a group that engages in vicious violence. The complaint describes the October 7 attack as a ""massacre,"" detailing abductions, the burning of homes, shootings with machine guns at point-blank range and sexual violence against women, including rape and genital mutilation. It details brutality against grandparents and young children.

The complaint also calls out Iran for allegedly supporting, supplying and training Hamas to achieve its own objectives of ""damaging, weakening, and ultimately destroying both the United States and Israel."" Hezbollah, another group the U.S. government designates a terrorist organization, is also named in the complaint as an ally of Hamas that assisted in the Oct. 7 attack. Calling Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas the ""axis of resistance,"" the complaint lays out a damning account of their conduct against the United States and its citizens.

A third reason to file a criminal complaint against Hamas may be to curtail its fundraising capabilities. The complaint specifies in great detail how the organization solicited and received $7.7 million in funds to promote terrorist activities through cryptocurrency payments, ostensibly to protect donor anonymity. By disclosing that the U.S. government is capable of tracking payments, prosecutors may hope to deter donors from contributing further.

But even if the reasons for filing the complaint may be compelling, the question remains as to why now. The announcement of charges comes at a time when cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Gaza seem especially fragile. During the weekend, Israeli authorities recovered in a tunnel beneath Gaza the bodies of six hostages who had recently been killed. On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu responded to massive protests seemed to double down on his demands. His remarks made the odds of a resolution soon feel even less likely.

The complaint offers some tells about its timing. The last page of the complaint asks the court to seal the document except as needed ""to secure the defendants' arrest, extradition, or expulsion, or as otherwise required for purposes of national security."" That page also indicates that the complaint was filed in February, before the three deceased defendants were killed. To the extent authorities had hoped to find and arrest them in a country that permits extradition, their deaths reduce the complaint's need for secrecy.

This is not the DOJ going rogue. I know from my own experience as a federal prosecutor that policy prohibits charging decisions on the basis of politics. When a case may affect national security or foreign policy, it always involves interagency coordination. The White House and the State Department most certainly would have been briefed and asked to assess this case in light of the United States' objectives in the Middle East. Garland himself hinted at this coordination when he referred to ""the whole-of-government effort to bring the Americans still being held hostage home."" Similarly, State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Tuesday, ""when it comes to U.S. policy, we have long made clear that our first priority when it comes to terrorists is to see terrorists apprehended and brought the United States to stand trial for their crimes.""

It's also possible recent events actually prompted the DOJ's decision to unseal the complaint. Hamas' refusal to release hostages will remain a sticking point to any cease-fire resolution. This may be DOJ's way of reminding Hamas that the U.S. is in the fight for the long haul.

As Miller said Tuesday, ""It is time to finalize that deal. The people of Israel cannot afford to wait any longer. The Palestinian people, who are also suffering the terrible effects of this war, cannot afford to wait any longer. The world cannot afford to wait any longer."""
Education In Peril: The Human Cost Of War,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2024/09/08/education-in-peril-the-human-cost-of-war/,2024-09-08T10:25:42Z,"On September 9, the world observes the International Day to Protect Education from Attack, a day established by the U.N. General Assembly to raise awareness of the plight of millions of children living in countries affected by conflict. The day should be used to affirm the importance of safeguarding schools as places of protection and safety for students and educators and working to make it happen. As attacks on education continue, action is urgently needed. No child should fear for their lives at school. No child should have to choose between education and staying safe.

In the period between 2022 and 2023, the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (the Coalition), an inter-agency coalition formed in 2010 to address the problem of targeted attacks on education during armed conflict, identified around 6,000 attacks on students, educators, schools, and universities, as well as cases of parties to conflict using educational facilities for military purposes. As the Coalition analyzed, attacks on education and military use increased by nearly 20% in 2022 and 2023 compared to the two previous years. Furthermore, according to their new report, more than 10,000 students and educators were killed, injured, abducted, arrested, or otherwise harmed by attacks on education in those two years. The number of students, teachers, professors, and education staff killed or injured increased by over 10% compared to the two previous years.

The report details how the escalation of the war in Ukraine translated into an increase in attacks on schools and universities - attacks involving artillery shelling, rockets, and airstrikes. The conflict in Sudan, which erupted in April 2023, has seen a wave of attacks on educational facilities and their military use. Attacks on education in Palestine peaked in October 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israel and the escalation of hostilities. In Syria, the Coalition recorded an increase in cases of children being recruited while on their way to school, and schools coming under increasing attacks. In Nigeria, the military use of schools rose, while abductions from schools continued.

The U.N. reported that in 2023 alone, 32,990 grave violations were verified against 22,557 children, with 5,301 being killed - the equivalent of almost 15 children killed every day. The U.N. indicated that the highest numbers of grave violations were verified in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Somalia, Nigeria, and the Sudan. The U.N. attributed almost 50% of the violations to non-State armed groups, while ""government forces were the main perpetrator of the killing and maiming of children, attacks on schools and hospitals, and the denial of humanitarian access."" The U.N. also identified a significant increase of 21% in attacks against children in armed conflicts and a 35% increase in the number of instances of killing and maiming.

The reported increase of attacks on education, despite the increased awareness of such attacks constituting violations of international humanitarian law, and many of them meeting the legal definition of international crimes, require urgent attention.

In 2024, the 5th Observance of the International Day to Protect Education from Attack is convened in Doha, Qatar, as a High-Level Panel led by Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Education Above All Foundation (EEA) and U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Advocate. The High-Level Panel on ""Education in Peril: The Human Cost of War"" will focus on the devastating impact of war on children and on the loss of education opportunities for entire generations who have been displaced due to prolonged and widespread conflict.

As attacks on education rage on and are on the increase, one must stress the importance of education as a catalyst to ensure social cohesion and more sustainable and peaceful societies. Attacks on education are crimes, crimes that must be addressed with all the tools in the toolkit to put an end to the culture of impunity for such attacks. Accountability is key to ensuring justice for victims/survivors and their families, but also to prevent future atrocities. Justice and accountability are key to prevention."
"3 Israelis killed in attack at West Bank-Jordan border crossing, Israeli military says",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/08/g-s1-21433/3-israelis-killed-shooting-west-bank-jordan-border-crossing,2024-09-08T09:08:58Z,"JERUSALEM -- Three people were shot and killed Sunday at the border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, Israeli officials said, in what appeared to be an attack linked to the 11-month-old war in Gaza.

The military said the gunman approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces, who killed the assailant in a shootout. It said the three people killed were Israeli civilians. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said they were all men in their 50s.

Jordan is investigating the shooting, its state-run Petra News Agency reported. The Western-allied Arab country made peace with Israel in 1994 but is deeply critical of its policies toward the Palestinians. Jordan has a large Palestinian population and has seen mass protests against Israel over the war in Gaza.

The Allenby crossing over the Jordan River is mainly used by Israelis, Palestinians and international tourists.

The Israeli-occupied West Bank has seen a surge of violence since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Israel has launched near-daily military arrest raids into dense Palestinian residential areas, and there has also been a rise in settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

In Gaza, meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed five people, including two women, two children and a senior official in the Civil Defense -- first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government.

The Civil Defense said the strike targeted the home of its deputy director for north Gaza, Mohammed Morsi, in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The army says it tries to avoid harming civilians and only targets militants.

Gaza's Health Ministry says over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. They abducted another 250, and are still holding around 100 of them after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages inside Gaza are believed to be dead.

The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent months trying to broker a cease-fire and the return of the hostages, but the negotiations have repeatedly bogged down.

Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem -- territories the Palestinians want for a future state -- in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintained control over its airspace, coastline and most of its land crossings. Along with Egypt, it imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007."
Man arrested over alleged plot to kill Jewish people in NYC around Oct. 7,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/oct-7-nyc-terror-plot-arrest-rcna170040,2024-09-07T16:27:36Z,"A 20-year-old Pakistani citizen planned a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of ISIS, the Justice Department said.

A Pakistani man who resides in Canada was arrested this week for planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish center in New York City around Oct. 7, the first anniversary of Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, the Justice Department said on Friday.

Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, had allegedly planned to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of the Islamic State group, or ISIS. He also considered carrying out a shooting on Oct. 11, which is Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, federal officials said.

Khan, also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was arrested on Wednesday in or around Ormstown, Canada, which is about 12 miles from the U.S. border, the Justice Department said. The U.S. government said it will seek to extradite him from Canada.

Khan has been charged with one count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which carries up to 20 years in prison. It's unclear if he has obtained legal representation. The Federal Defenders of New York did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on Friday.

According to the criminal complaint, Khan began expressing his support for ISIS and his desire to carry out terrorist attacks in support of the group as early as November 2023 by way of social media and in communications with an FBI informant.

From late July 2024 on, Khan started communicating with two undercover law enforcement officers, telling them through encrypted messages that he was planning an attack on Jewish Chabads in a U.S. city with AR-style rifles and claiming that he had found a smuggler to take him across the border from Canada into the U.S., the complaint states. He then allegedly changed his location target to New York City, citing its large Jewish population.

""The defendant is alleged to have planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7th of this year with the stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""Jewish communities -- like all communities in this country -- should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,"" he added.

There has been a sharp increase in reports of antisemitism and anti-Muslim hate in the U.S. since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched its attacks on Israel, killing over 1,200 people. Israel responded with a mass assault on Gaza that has killed more than 40,000 people to date, Palestinian health officials say. The war has also sparked multiple violent -- even deadly -- incidents against Jewish and Muslim people in the U.S."

JENIN, Israeli-occupied West Bank -- Israeli forces have withdrawn from the Jenin urban refugee camp in the northern Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to Jenin's mayor. This comes after a major military raid into Palestinian towns, as the Israeli army vows to root out militant groups.

Mayor Nidal Ebeidy said the troops left a trail of destruction, bulldozing roads under which the Israeli military says Palestinians hide improvised explosives, and destroying homes and mosques where they say militants operate from.

The operation on Jenin, Tulkarem and al-Faraa urban camps is the largest since the start of the war against Hamas in Gaza almost a year ago, and has so far killed 39 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and three Israeli police officers, according to the Israeli military.

The Israeli military said it launched the raids on Aug. 28 to root out fighters who operate within these towns to stave off an attack similar to the one on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The attack triggered the war in Gaza which the Gaza health ministry says has killed over 40,800 Palestinians.

""The Israeli forces have destroyed 70% of infrastructure of Jenin,"" Ebeidy told NPR. ""It encircled the hospitals and killed civilians, and destroyed our power grid. Now we are starting to rebuild Jenin one more time.""

The heart of Palestinian armed resistance

The Israeli government built the Jenin refugee camp outside Jenin city in the northern West Bank for displaced Palestinians after the 1948 war, when Israel was created. It's home to about 24,000 residents, according to the United Nations.

Like most refugee camps across the West Bank, Jenin's began as a collection of temporary housing for Palestinians to shelter in, but over time, residents built concrete buildings, schools and shops, turning it into an urban town.

Israeli troops have raided the Jenin refugee camp many times since the beginning of the war in Gaza. Once bustling with residents in markets and schools, its roads are now piles of rubble from Israeli military bulldozers, and mosques and homes are blown up, with people's belongings strewn everywhere.

For decades Jenin has been a stronghold for many militants who say they are fighting the Israeli occupation.

One of those men is 30-year-old Tareq Abu Mohammed, who is part of the militant group Islamic Jihad. When NPR met him in July, before the current fighting, he was standing guard on the side of a street outside a supermarket with another fighter. Both were carrying an automatic weapon.

Nearby was the Damaj neighborhood. It's normally where the fighters can be found, but on the day of NPR's visit it was eerily quiet. A drone faintly hummed overhead. Someone had spray-painted the words ""The Alley of Death"" in Arabic on the walls of buildings. The fighters normally sleep here during the day in preparation for potential Israeli military night raids.

Jenin was a flashpoint even before the Hamas attack from Gaza on Oct. 7.

It was the site of several battles during the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s known as the Second Intifada, and while the Palestinian Authority is meant to be policing the camps, it's really the fighters who control things around here.

In July 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was launching a new crackdown on militants from these camps.

""If Jenin will return to terrorism, then we will return to Jenin,"" Netanyahu said.

Since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, the Israeli military has stepped up its incursions into the West Bank's refugee camps.

Israel says they are breeding grounds for new militants.

A fighter's purpose

After agreeing to an interview with NPR, Abu Mohammed sat on a stack of soda cans in a grocery store, cradling his gun.

He said he was in and out of Israeli prisons for about five years.

After Oct. 7, he got a call from Israeli security to turn himself in. Instead he picked up his weapon.

""Whoever sees the injustice we go through in those prisons, comes out and continues fighting,"" Abu Mohammed said.

He described getting little food in prison and prisoners being beaten and humiliated by Israeli forces.

Abu Mohammed said there was no use trying to wipe out the militants.

""Kill one of us, a thousand will pop up, our morale is high,"" he said.

Abu Mohammed said he was ready to die for the sake of his land, but it's not what he actually wishes he was doing with his life.

A farmer by trade, he said he's always wanted a wife, children and a job, but there was hopelessness under occupation.

""We all want to live,"" he said. ""We are fighting so we can live, not just for the sake of dying.""

Youth with a death wish

On the outskirts of the West Bank's largest city, Ramallah, is another urban refugee camp called Qalandiya. The Israeli military has raided Qalandiya almost nightly since the war in Gaza began.

Ahmad Aslan, 24, lived in Qalandiya until his death on July 24. His family told NPR that on that day, the Israeli military entered their town and soldiers started breaking into homes, searching them. Aslan's parents said Israeli soldiers surrounded the camp, and he was stuck in his uncle's house with his cousins. They ran to the roof to look down, and that's when, they said, Ahmad was shot.

The Israeli military told NPR the raid was to demolish the home of a man who had killed two Israelis at a gas station in the West Bank.

It said that during the raid, soldiers opened fire at people gathered on rooftops to throw rocks and Molotov cocktails at them.

A day after his death, Aslan's cousin released a video Aslan sent him days earlier. In it, Aslan shyly introduces himself as ""the martyr Ahmad Aslan"" and says he wishes to die fighting the Israeli occupation. He points to an empty grave in the Qalandiya cemetery.

""God willing, I want my grave to be here,"" he says. ""Here is Yasser, and here is Ahmad Aslan's.""

Yasser was his best friend, whose family says also died in an Israeli military raid a few months earlier.

A week later, the Aslan family was still receiving mourners paying their condolences. His mother, Amina Aslan, wore all black and maintained a brave face. She said he would always talk about hoping to die fighting the occupation, a topic that would make her mad. She pulled out a text message exchange they had a few days before he died.

""I told him: I swear if you keep talking like this, I will stop speaking to you!"" she read out loud. ""Go die! I'll stop speaking to you!""

Aslan is one of a rising number of young men in the West Bank with such a death wish, according to Palestinians in the camp.

The war in Gaza, and Israel's expanding settlements in the West Bank, have made the prospect of a Palestinian state ever more distant.

Unemployment is high, and with no future in sight, hopes are even lower.

Like Aslan, many young men say that their only choice is to fight the Israeli occupation.

Some take up arms and join militant groups, others throw rocks at Israeli soldiers during raids.

Aslan's mother said that every time there was an Israeli military incursion, her son would rush to join the youths on the streets.

In Aslan's bedroom, his father, Nidal, pointed to items laid out neatly on his son's bunk bed -- a baseball cap, cigarette lighters, a piece of clothing blotted with blood.

He said these are all mementos his son collected and kept from his friends who were killed in Israeli raids. He said his son's ultimate wish was to join his friends in heaven.

""Ahmed used to say, 'sure I have friends, but those who have gone are dear to me,' "" said Nidal Aslan."
Pakistani man who wanted to carry out 'largest' U.S attack 'since 9/11' arrested over plot to kill Jews in NYC,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/pakistani-man-wanted-carry-largest-us-attack-9-11-arrested-plot-kill-jews-nyc,2024-09-07T02:14:15Z,"Attorney General Merrick Garland said Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and others were charged for planning, supporting and perpetrating Hamas' October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.

An alleged would-be terrorist was arrested in Canada on Wednesday, accused of plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in New York City in support of ISIS.

Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, a Pakistani national who lives in Canada and also goes by the name Shahzeb Jadoon, has been charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

""The defendant was allegedly determined to kill Jewish people here in the United States, nearly one year after Hamas's horrific attack on Israel,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said. "" This investigation was led by the FBI and I am proud of the terrific work by the FBI team and our partners to disrupt Khan's plan.""

Khan was arrested by Royal Canadian Mounted Police on a material support of terrorism warrant issued out of the Southern District of New York.

""As alleged, Khan attempted to travel to the United States to carry out a terrorist attack and murder as many Jewish people as possible, all in support of ISIS,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. ""Khan's alleged crimes are a vivid reminder that we must remain vigilant in the fight against antisemitism and terror.""

EXPERTS WARN IRAN COULD HAVE A NUCLEAR BOMB BEFORE THE NEXT PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE

Williams added, ""Thanks to our law enforcement partners and the career prosecutors of this Office, Khan's alleged plan was disrupted before he reached the United States. Let this be a reminder to anyone who seeks to harm our community: This Office will stop at nothing to root you out and bring you to justice.""

Khan had used encrypted messaging apps to plan the attack in Brooklyn since last November, including distributing pro-ISIS propaganda and videos and literature, the Department of Justice said in a news release.

He soon unknowingly began communicating with two undercover officers, telling them that he and an associate in the U.S. wanted to create ""a real offline cell"" of ISIS supporters to carry out a ""coordinated assault"" using AR-style assault rifles, and that they planned to ""target Israeli Jewish chabads . . . scattered all around"" an unnamed city other than New York.

He allegedly told the undercover officers to stock up on AR-style guns, ammunition and other supplies for the attack on the city, naming the specific locations where the shootings would happen.

He later told the officers to also get ""some good hunting [knives] so we can slit their throats.""

""Oct 7th and oct 11th are the best days for targeting the jews"" because ""oct 7 they will surely have some protests and oct 11 is yom.kippur,"" Khan allegedly told the officers.

Prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz announced his departure from the Democratic Party, citing several ""anti-Jewish"" lawmakers that make up the ranks of the party and the recent Democratic National Convention in which Vice President Kamala Harris became the party's presidential nominee.

Speaking with radio host Zev Brenner on ""Talkline with Zev Brenner,"" Dershowitz cited the DNC, which he said gave legitimacy to anti-Israel speakers, and anti-Israel protesters outside the gathering.

""It was the most anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, anti-Zionist convention I've experienced,"" he said. ""I was disgusted at the Democratic National Convention. Absolutely disgusted.""

""I am no longer a Democrat. I am an Independent,"" he added, noting that he wouldn't reveal whom he was voting for president until possibly after Nov. 1. ""I want to see how they deal with Iran. I want to encourage the current administration to support Israel.""

The Harvard Law professor emeritus said his departure from the party was a long time coming and that he gradually resigned over time.

""Alot of things pushed me in that direction,"" he said. Dershowitz noted Harris' failure to preside over a joint session of Congress during an address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu played a big role in his decision.

Some Democrats skipped Netanyahu's speech as a form of protest.

In addition, there were anti-Israel protesters outside the gathering who called for the destruction of Israel, he said.

""That's not my party,"" Dershowitz said.

The Democratic Party has seen a sharp split within its ranks following the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. Some members of the party have refused to condemn the terror group and have blamed Netanyahu for Israel's military response.
