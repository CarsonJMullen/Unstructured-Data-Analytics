0,Follow the Money: Understanding FEMA's disaster budget in Hurricane Milton aftermath,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/follow-money-understanding-femas-disaster-budget-hurricane-milton-aftermath,2024-10-10T21:55:39Z,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on growing concerns over FEMA's disaster response on 'America Reports.'

It's hard to understand the money when it comes to natural disasters.

Does FEMA have enough to respond? Will residents get money after their car, home, business, town are destroyed by floodwaters? Will Congress approve additional tranches of disaster relief - both in the near-term and down the road.

So, let's follow the money.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WITH NO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN SEPTEMBER

FEMA's coffers for ""immediate needs"" and the Disaster Relief Program (DRF) were nearly bone dry as Congress approved an interim spending bill to keep the government from shutting down in late September. Lawmakers awarded FEMA more than $20 billion to reload the DRF, which dwindled to around $1 billion and change in September.

Congress restocked the DRF simply because it was prudent to do so. Lawmakers had to return to Washington in an emergency session in the late summer of 2005 to refurbish the DRF after Hurricane Katrina. Front-loading the DRF with $20 billion this year would be enough for FEMA to get through any natural disaster until Congress returned in mid-November.

That's why FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell signaled things were fine with money for FEMA.

For now.

""I have the funding and sufficient resources to support the ongoing responses to Hurricane Helene, as well as Hurricane Milton,"" said Criswell. ""We had thought that we would go into immediate needs funding in December or January. I need to assess that every day to see if I'm going to be able to wait that long.""

This is why House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., resisted demands to recall Congress to address the storms. President Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre have insisted that Congress come back ahead of schedule. The House and Senate are on recess until after the elections in mid-November.

Regardless of the severity of both storms, it's hard to envision a scenario where Congress returns to replenish FEMA's coffers. Yes. It's good politics for the President, Mayorkas and lawmakers in the affected areas and others to implore Congressional leaders to summon the House and Senate back to Washington. It gives the illusion of exhausting all options. Plus, if Johnson or Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., don't call people back, those from the opposite party can suggest that they aren't responsive or taking the damage as seriously as they should.

Moreover, it's probably not even necessary for Congress to come back into session until November 12th. The DRF is now well stocked. Only something as catastrophic as thermonuclear war could draw down the DRF to zero before next month. So draining the fund that fast - prompting Congressional action - is not likely.

When lawmakers returned in a dramatic, emergency, witching-hour session in 2005 to replenish money for FEMA in the wake of Katrina, it did so with a skeleton crew. Only a few lawmakers showed up. Then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., approved the bill on the floor after a few quick remarks and ""unanimous consent.""

HOW US GOVERNMENT WILL DOLE OUT AID TO VICTIMS OF HURRICANES MILTON, HELENE

There are three methods for the House and Senate to vote. A roll call vote where each Member is recorded as yea or nay. A ""voice vote."" That's where those in favor yell ""aye"" and those opposed shout ""nay."" The louder side (supposedly) prevails. Then there is ""unanimous consent."" That's where a bill comes to the floor and a Member simply asks to pass a bill (more often in the Senate). If all Members agree, the bill is passed. But if there is a single objection, everything stops. The bill is dead.

Approving an emergency storm relief bill with a handful of people may have worked right after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But American politics now occupies a very different galaxy than the one 19 years ago.

In late March 2020, Congress attempted to approve a staggering $2.3 trillion relief package as the COVID-19 pandemic burned across the planet. Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution says that a ""Majority"" of the House and Senate ""shall constitute a Quorum to do Business."" But the House and Senate conduct business all the time without a proper quorum. It's usually not a problem so long as no one presses the issue.

When the COVID bill hit the House floor, leaders insisted on social distancing. The aim was to approve the bill via unanimous consent or a voice vote. A formal roll call would require that all 435 House members come to the floor at once. Not an optimal scenario in the initial, dangerous days of the pandemic.

However, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wanted to ""make a point of order"" that the House lacked a quorum and demand a roll call vote. Even former President Trump torched Massie, tweeting that the Kentucky Republican was ""grandstanding"" and should be evicted from the GOP.

Former Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md., presided over the vote. He quickly counted Members present. Both the majority and minority devised a way to bring a large number of Members into the House chamber to represent a quorum. Some materialized, spread out on the floor. Others appeared on the balcony of the then-closed public viewing gallery.

For Brown, that was enough. The quorum was present. He gaveled the bill to passage without a roll call vote.

In today's toxified atmosphere, it's hard to believe that lawmakers from both sides wouldn't protest if leaders try to summon the House and Senate back to Washington for an emergency vote, ala, Katrina. Even though it's disaster aid, some will carp about the extra spending. They might accuse leaders of trying to ram through the measure without enough vetting. The 2020 coronavirus package vote hints at potential problems unless all lawmakers are recalled to debate and vote on emergency spending.

FORMER NIH OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF MAKING EMAILS 'DISAPPEAR' PLEADS FIFTH TO COVID SUBCOMMITTEE

Then there is the question of offsets.

Republicans representing the path of both storms certainly want the federal government to send disaster aid to stricken areas. But deficit hawks will demand offsets before authorizing new spending.

""We should definitely take take it from other places that the government just doesn't need to be spending money in,"" said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., on Fox. ""There are areas that our government is spending money in that we should not be. It's really just political pet projects.""

But what one Member views as a pet project is essential spending to another. Congress will gore someone's ox if it takes this approach.

As we often say, it's about the math.

""Tell me where you can get the votes to do it?"" asked one senior House Republican source familiar with the spending process. ""That isn't going to happen. That never happens.""

The federal government is already into Fiscal Year 2025 and there is no agreed-upon topline spending number. So that makes it harder to find offsets.

So the fate of disaster relief?

""This will just go on the credit card,"" said the source.

Here's what to look for in the coming days:

There will be clamor for Congress to return to session. President Biden wants Congress to come back. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution says the President ""may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them."" However, both House and Senate are not in the proper parliamentary posture for a presidential recall. The House and Senate are not ""adjourned."" They are technically ""in session,"" meeting at regular three-day intervals with only a Member or two present until after the election.

Also, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., intends to bring Criswell before his panel in mid-November for a hearing.

Finally, Congress will struggle with refurbishing funds to the National Flood Insurance Program and helping the Small Business Administration have enough money to assist storm victims. Mayorkas said that he has always known the flood program ""to be in the red.""

There's a lot of money to follow in the coming months when it comes to the dual disasters. Was it too much? Too little? Did they spend it in the right places? Was it spent quickly? Too slowly? And inevitably, lawmakers will find something which went wrong.

The storms may have passed. But storm clouds on Capitol Hill about the federal response are just brewing."

Democratic strategists are calling on the Harris campaign to get more aggressive amid concerns her early momentum, spurred largely by Harris' debate performance and the Democratic National Convention, has waned due to a number of factors.

""I'm scared to death,"" Democratic strategist James Carville said Wednesday.

""Now that the sugar high is gone, people have realized what Kamala Harris has said from the start, which is that she is the underdog,"" Anthony Coley, a former Biden and Obama staffer turned political consultant, told The Hill.

""If you're not nervous, you're not paying attention,"" former Harris communications director Jamal Simmons added.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

Meanwhile, David Axelrod, widely regarded as the political mastermind behind former President Obama's 2008 victory, recognized that ""Harris had a great launch, right through the convention and the debate,"" but he acknowledged ""the race has plateaued.""

Carville's remarks that he is ""scared to death"" about Nov. 5, came during an interview Wednesday with MSNBC's Ari Melber. Carville estimated that with Hurricane Milton dominating the news cycle, Harris only has about 20 days to amplify her messaging.

JAMES CARVILLE SAYS DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT JANUARY 6 AND 2020 ELECTION TOO MUCH, SHOULD MOVE ON

An anonymous Democratic strategist told The Hill that Harris is still ""fine-tuning her message"" way too close to Election Day. ""We are in the 'make the sale' phase of the campaign now. We're not still tweaking the message,"" the strategist pointed out.

Some of the criticism from Democratic strategists also included suggestions the Harris campaign get more aggressive.

""They need to be sharp. They need to be aggressive. They need to stop answering questions and start asking questions,"" Carville insisted Wednesday. ""I think she and the whole campaign need to be much more aggressive and much less passive than they are.""

""In these campaigns, every time you clear a bar, the bar gets raised,"" added Axelrod. ""You have to lift your game and adjust your strategy.""

With Election Day rapidly approaching, polling in three critical battleground states show former President Trump making gains, but the race still remains a toss-up between the two candidates.

According to polling from Quinnipiac University, Harris is maintaining a three-point advantage over Trump in battleground Pennsylvania. However, that is a drop from Harris' six-point lead in Quinnipiac's September polling of Pennsylvania voters.

Quinnipiac polling in Michigan shows Trump with a three-point edge, and it shows him with a two-point advantage in Wisconsin. Quinnipiac's Michigan polling last month had Harris leading by five points, while its Wisconsin polling had her at a one-point advantage over Trump.

""That was then, this is now,"" Tim Malloy, a polling analyst at Quinnipiac, said. ""The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt."""

There's no let up in the war of words between President Biden and former President Trump over the federal government's response to back-to-back devastating hurricanes that slammed into the southeast.

After Trump continued to charge that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been slow and ineffective in steering the government's storm efforts, the president once again fired back.

Biden told reporters on Thursday that Trump needed to ""get a life man, help these people.""

And he argued that ""the public will hold him [Trump] accountable"" for making false claims regarding the capabilities of FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) to assist storm victims.

The former president's son, Eric Trump, posted on X on Wednesday that the family has opened up one of its Florida hotels to house over 200 linemen who are helping in the storm's aftermath.

Trump has also launched a GoFundMe campaign for victims of Hurricane Helene in Georgia, which has raised more than $7 million so far.

BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES ROCK PRESIDENTIAL RACE

The president spoke as millions in Florida remained without power after Hurricane Milton tore a path of destruction across the central and northern parts of the state late Wednesday into Thursday.

Meanwhile, cleanup and recovery efforts continue across the southeast, which was hit hard by Hurricane Helene nearly two weeks ago.

With less than four weeks to go until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a narrow margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election, the politics of federal disaster relief are again front and center on the campaign trail.

""Vice President Harris and I have been in constant contact with the state and local officials. We're offering everything they need,"" Biden emphasized on Thursday.

Among those the president spoke with was Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.

While DeSantis and Harris have traded verbal fire this week over whether he ignored hurricane-related calls from her, the governor and Biden have worked together on storm response and relief efforts.

""I spoke with the president this morning,"" DeSantis said during one of his numerous briefings on Thursday. ""He said he wants to be helpful. And so if we have a request, he said, send them his way, and he wants to help us get the job done. So I appreciate being able to collaborate across the federal, state and local governments and work together to put the people first.""

Despite those comments and others from DeSantis as well as other leading Republican officeholders in the storm-struck southeast, Trump has continuously slammed Biden and Harris.

DESANTIS AND HARRIS TRADE FIRE OVER HURRICANE CALL

""THE WORST RESPONSE TO A STORM OR HURRICANE DISASTER IN U.S. HISTORY,"" Trump claimed in a social media post on Tuesday.

""The worst hurricane response since Katrina,"" the former president charged on Wednesday as he pointed to the much-maligned initial federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was heavily criticized for being slow and ineffective.

Trump, speaking at a campaign rally in battleground Pennsylvania, lobbed another political bomb at Harris, arguing that ""She just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina...the worst ever, they say.""

And the former president once again made false claims that FEMA diverted money intended for disaster relief and spent it on undocumented migrants in the U.S. as he turned up the volume on his inflammatory rhetoric over the combustible issue of illegal immigration.

""You know where they gave the money to: illegal immigrants coming,"" Trump said as the crowd of MAGA supporters loudly booed.

Hours later, Biden pushed back, accusing the Republican presidential nominee of leading an ""onslaught of lies.""

Biden charged that the rhetoric from Trump and other Republicans was ""beyond ridiculous"" and that ""it's got to stop.""

But on Thursday at a campaign event in Michigan, Trump kept up the attacks. He praised southern Republican governors for doing a ""fantastic job"" reacting to the storms and argued that ""the federal government, on the other hand, has not done what you're supposed to be doing, in particular, with respect to North Carolina. They've let those people suffer unjustly, unjustly.""

Harris, in a Wednesday interview with the Weather Channel, also chided Trump.

""This is not a time for us to just point fingers at each other as Americans,"" the vice president said. ""Anybody who considers themselves to be a leader should really be in the business right now of giving people a sense of confidence that we're all working together and that we have the resources and the ability to work together on their behalf.""

The West's response to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 has been brought under fresh scrutiny this week - as outgoing NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg insisted the war in Ukraine may not have happened if the U.S. and NATO had a stronger response to that incursion.

""If we had delivered a fraction of the weapons we have delivered after 2022, we may have actually prevented the war,"" he said in an interview with Politico.

Stoltenberg, a Norwegian politician, led NATO from 2014 until last week.

President Biden reportedly expressed a similar sentiment.

""They f---ed up in 2014,"" Biden said, according to Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward's upcoming book, ""War,"" obtained by Fox News Digital.

""That's why we are here,"" the 81-year-old said. ""We f---ked it up. Barack never took [Russian President Vladimir] Putin seriously.""

NORTH KOREA TROOPS NOW FIGHTING FOR RUSSIA IN UKRAINE, SEOUL SAYS

""We did nothing. We gave Putin a license to continue!"" the president went on. ""Well, I'm revoking his f---ing license!""

In 2014, the Kremlin annexed the Crimean Peninsula after the so-called Revolution of Dignity, when Ukrainians ousted Moscow-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. It was a quick and bloodless takeover. Russia flooded the regions with migrants and fended off Ukrainian efforts to take it back.

The Obama administration provided Ukraine with defensive weapons, sanctioned the Kremlin and kicked Russia out of the G-8, but some, even reportedly including Obama's then-vice president, Biden, believe he should have done more.

It came as Russia had also invaded Ukraine's Donbas region and shot down a Malaysia Airlines flight with nearly 300 people on board.

He stopped short of providing Ukraine with lethal weaponry. As president, Donald Trump reversed Obama's policy, approving a plan to sell Ukraine Javelin missiles for $47 million.

In a 2014 interview with The Atlantic, Obama said he saw no benefit in the U.S. getting involved in the unfolding events in Europe related to Russia and Ukraine.

""The fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do,"" Obama said. ""This is an example of where we have to be very clear about what our core interests are and what we are willing to go to war for.""

In 2012, Obama famously downplayed the threat of Russia during a debate with Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Romney had asserted that Russia was the U.S.'s greatest geopolitical foe.

RUSSIA JAILS MERCENARY STEPHEN HUBBARD FOR FIGHTING AS A MERCENARY IN UKRAINE

""The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War's been over for 20 years,"" Obama chided at the time.

He also tasked his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, with pursuing a ""reset"" in U.S.-Russia relations, scrapping plans by President George W. Bush to build a missile shield in Eastern Europe that Russia saw as a direct military threat. Putin called that decision ""correct and brave.""

Obama defended his 2014 policy in a 2023 interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

""Ukraine of that time was not the Ukraine that we're talking about today,"" Obama said. ""There's a reason there was not an armed invasion of Crimea, because Crimea was full of a lot of Russian speakers, and there was some sympathy to the views that Russia was representing.""

The U.S. has offered some $175 billion in security assistance and financial aid since the outbreak of war in 2022.

Earlier this week, Ukraine struck a large oil terminal off the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea in the latest wave of attacks on Russian-controlled energy facilities."

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., discusses new whistleblower allegations about former President Trump's Secret Service protection on 'Hannity.'

New whistleblower records allege a failure of the Secret Service to provide funding for Homeland Security ""jump teams"" and their travel to support security efforts on the campaign trail ahead of the November election.

One email sent on Sept. 26 read, ""Subject: Jump Team ‐ Out of Money,"" according to a record obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and his oversight team.

The Department of Homeland Security's investigation unit jump team provides ""a mechanism to build the connections between mission support and the front-line,"" according to the DHS website.

FOR WISCONSIN DEMS, A 2024 WIN IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE IS YEARS IN THE MAKING

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), an agency within DHS, is charged with addressing global threats.

""Jump Team members are responsible for helping to solve immediate issues, guide how funding is allocated, and to assist in developing solutions to deliver support most effectively to our front-line,"" the DHS website added.

In the wake of two separate assassination attempts against former President Trump, who is currently campaigning to be president again, jump teams have been deployed to assist the U.S. Secret Service.

However, the documents provided to Grassley's office via legally protected whistleblower disclosures show that fears of unpreparedness and mismanagement in the DHS and Secret Service could still be true, despite efforts to ramp up security.

""Please do not submit or resubmit Jump Team authorizations. There is only $33 on the line right now,"" DHS officials told HSI agents on Sept. 9, per Grassley. The senator's office pointed to this email as an example of just how low the funds had fallen.

On Sept. 26, agents were informed, ""We will not receive more money for Jump Team this year.""

The email instructed agents not to use the usual methods of expensing items, laying out a process of what to do instead.

""If by some miracle money is added, you will be notified immediately,"" the email continued.

""The Secret Service has a critical, no-fail protective mission to carry out. Based on protected whistleblower disclosures, it neglected to transfer enough funds for HSI to reimburse its agents, calling into question the agency's ability to manage federal resources and raising major concerns,"" Grassley said in a statement. ""Congress and the American people have witnessed too many Secret Service shortfalls in recent months - they deserve answers, and it's Congress' job to bring transparency and accountability.""

WISCONSIN SENATE RACE SHIFTS TO 'TOSS UP' BY HANDICAPPER AS TAMMY BALDWIN FIGHTS FOR RE-ELECTION

In the Sept. 26 email from a DHS official, they revealed that ""we had over $371,000 worth of Jump Team Authorizations Fail last night.""

According to Grassley's office and the documents it has obtained, agents have been required to pay for expenses the agency can't cover. The senator noted that this would be in violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from obligating or spending federal funds before they are appropriated.

Reimbursements to agents are also apparently being delayed, and employees are left with uncertainty about their pay.

In a Wednesday letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas; acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe; Patrick Lechleitner, the deputy director and senior official performing the duties of the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Katrina Berger, HSI executive associate director, Grassley described that ""HSI agents are deployed, usually on very short notice, across the country on Jump Teams from as short as a few days for as long as multiple weeks, several times throughout the year.""

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT

""The whistleblower disclosures further show that in some cases HSI agents have had to pay for their own travel expenses such as flights, food, rental cars, and hotels, and other incidentals, because HSI has delayed reimbursing agents for costs due to the Secret Service failing to transfer funds to HSI.""

""If you have an explanation to add context to these emails, I welcome it,"" he told the leaders.

Grassley requested additional information from the department and agencies, including documentation about the finances of HSI and its jump teams.

Neither the Secret Service nor Homeland Security immediately provided comment to Fox News Digital."
5,Trump calls for federal education dollars to 'follow the student' in push for universal school choice,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-federal-education-dollars-follow-student-push-universal-school-choice,2024-10-10T20:08:49Z,"Marking the kickoff of 'National School Choice Week,' senior fellow at the American Federation for Children Corey DeAngelis joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the National Education Association launching an anti-school choice campaign.

Former President Trump is proposing that federal education dollars ""follow the student"" in his possible second term, while pushing his ""universal school choice policy,"" and stressing that he backs it ""all the way.""

The former president championed school choice last week, making his strongest case yet for the movement on the federal level.

""We want federal education dollars to follow the student, rather than propping up a bloated and radical bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.,"" Trump said at an event in Milwaukee.

TRUMP PUSH TO DISMANTLE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT MET WITH ENTHUSIASM IN HOUSE GOP

""If you want a better education for your child, Kamala Harris stands in your way,"" Trump said. ""Kamala and the Radical Left Democrat Party want to keep Black and Hispanic children trapped in family government. I think that's really the reason.""

The former president said he believes school choice ""is the civil rights issue of our time.""

""A child's fate should be determined by their love of education, by their parents, by so many factors. But it can't be determined by a ZIP code,"" Trump said. ""And no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government-run school.""

Trump's universal school choice would allow parents to send their children to public, private or religious schools.

Trump's stance is reflected in the 2024 Republican Party platform. According to proponents of school choice, it recognizes a role for both federal and state governments in expanding tax credit scholarship programs and Education Savings Accounts, which currently serve more than a million K-12 students across the country.

The Trump campaign said school choice ""leads to higher graduation rates, higher parental satisfaction and involvement, lower costs, increased competition among schools, and higher reading and math test scores.""

At this point, 11 states have universal school choice, and 32 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one private school choice program - but 18 states have none.

""Before President Trump took office, zero states had a universal school choice policy. Now, almost a dozen do, and it is in large part because of the voice and visibility that he gave to elevate the issue into the national consciousness during COVID - but even before that,"" former Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News Digital.

""There is an increase in the number and needs of American school children with respect to alternatives to conventional public schools,"" Conway said. ""There is an increase in resistance among Kamala Harris and Democrats to allow these types of alternatives - these types of options and choices - to be in the hands of parents.""

On the other side of the aisle, Democrats are expanding their opposition to school choice, and teachers' unions rejoiced when Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, dubbing the ticket as a major win for public educators.

Walz is a former teachers' union member who has said he is opposed to the school choice ""agenda.""

MINNESOTA WALZ-APPOINTED BOARD REQUIRES TEACHERS TO 'AFFIRM' THEIR STUDENTS' GENDER IDENTITIES

Teachers' unions pushed hard to prolong school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many districts shuttered for more than a year.

Former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Walz was a ""5-alarm fire for parents and students.""

As for the Democratic Party platform, Democrats support all children ""no matter their ZIP code"" to have access to a ""quality public K-12 education and for college to be affordable for every American.""

Democrats are looking to push federal dollars toward public schools in an effort to ""expand opportunities for higher education and job training.""

Harris' campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, but her website lays out her plan to ""ensure parents can afford high-quality child care and preschool for their children.""

Harris also plans to focus on working to ""end the unreasonable burden of student loan debt and fight to make higher education more affordable, so that college can be a ticket to the middle class.""

Harris said she would work to ""scale up programs that create good career pathways for non-college graduates.""

But Conway explained that parents are focused on having more of a role in their child's education - now more than ever.

""There is a continuation of the parent's rights renaissance that started during COVID and spilled over into 2021 and into Glenn Youngkin's election over Terry McAuliffe in 2021 and continues unabated in so many states across this country,"" Conway said, noting that since the COVID-19 pandemic, which shuttered schools at the request of the teachers' unions, there ""are a higher number of people running for school board, and you have more parents engaged in choices of schools and character of curricula.""

""There is a need for a charismatic and compelling leader to take this on,"" Conway said, referring to Trump.

By December 2020, Trump signed an executive order to expand education opportunities for American children and families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. That order offered flexibility to provide children with emergency K-12 scholarships to access in-person learning opportunities - an effort to provide an in-person learning option after prolonged school closures.

The Trump administration also invested nearly $1.5 billion in the development of public charter schools and, under his tax reform bill, made it possible for parents to withdraw up to $10,000 tax-free per year from 529 education savings plans to cover public, private, or religious K-12 schooling costs.

""President Trump says this is the civil rights issue of our time, and it is true, but also, when you look at the sheer numbers of charter schools and school choice scholarship recipients and even the alternatives, like homeschooled students - and that is still a growing piece - but parents want to take things into their own hands. They know their children best,"" Conway said. ""If Trump is re-elected, this is going to be a biggie.""

As for the word ""choice,"" Conway said the left ""wants to own that word"" but only when it relates to abortion.

""The Democrat Party really only wants to talk to women from the waist down, whereas, these parents of school-aged children want people to talk to them from the waist up - their eyes, ears, brain and hearts - and that includes them giving choices,"" she said. ""We should not be ceding the word 'choice' and the idea that women have a right to choose to the left based on abortion. It should be, women have a right to choose where their children go to school and what is taught there.""

But Democrats believe school choice is anti-public schools - something Conway pushed back on - and argue that it would take funding away from teachers and schools themselves.

""It is just about competition,"" she said. ""You can customize your coffee 14,000 different ways at Starbucks. You can get Amazon to deliver anything to your home this afternoon. And yet, you are stuck with one choice for school.""

She added: ""It is like shopping in a Soviet Safeway for your child's education, and it makes no sense, and it does not match the rest of the way we live our lives.""

Former President Trump took aim at CBS News over the ongoing controversy involving ""60 Minutes"" editing comments made by Vice President Kamala Harris for its primetime election special.

""A giant Fake News Scam by CBS & 60 Minutes,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better. A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal.""

""TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE,"" he continued. ""Election Interference. She is a Moron, and the Fake News Media wants to hide that fact. An UNPRECEDENTED SCANDAL!!! The Dems got them to do this and should be forced to concede the Election? WOW!""

CBS '60 MINUTES' AIRS TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS FROM VP HARRIS TO THE SAME QUESTION

Trump further slammed the liberal network during a speech later in the day to the Detroit Economic Club.

""The other big news is the fraud committed by 60 Minutes and CBS together with the Democrat Party, working together with them, which will go down as the single biggest scandal in broadcast history I predict,"" Trump said.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN DISTANCES ITSELF FROM '60 MINUTES' EDIT: 'WE DO NOT CONTROL CBS'S PRODUCTION DECISIONS'

FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel released a statement denouncing Trump's call to revoke CBS' broadcasting license.

""While repeated attacks against broadcast stations by the former President may now be familiar, these threats against free speech are serious and should not be ignored,"" Rosenworcel wrote. ""As I've said before, the First Amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy. The FCC does not and will not revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The controversy stems from an exchange Harris had with ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker about the Biden administration's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which was released in full in a preview clip that aired on Sunday's ""Face The Nation"" but was edited for the primetime special.

Harris was mocked by conservatives for offering a lengthy ""word salad"" when she was asked why it seemed like Netanyahu wasn't listening to the United States. However, the vice president's lengthy answer didn't make the version that aired on Monday night and a shorter, more focused answer to the same question was shown instead.

""Well Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,"" Harris responded in the ""Face the Nation"" version.

Sometimes interviews are edited to save time, but when CBS aired the interview on Monday night, Harris had a different response to the same question.

""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,"" Harris said.

Critics have accused CBS News of aiding the Harris campaign by cleaning up her messy answer for the network's primetime audience.

The Harris campaign insists it had nothing to do with the edit, an aide telling Fox News Digital ""We do not control CBS's production decisions and refer questions to CBS."""

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday doubled down on his fierce criticism of those he accused of deliberately spreading false information about the work the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is doing during hurricane season.

""There is so much false information being spread, and we cannot have people relying on that false information or actually deterred from seeking relief that's available to them that they need because of that false information,"" Mayorkas said on ""Morning Joe"" Wednesday before Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida Wednesday night. ""It's really pernicious.""

Mayorkas, along with DHS and FEMA, have been under pressure over the handling of Hurricane Helene. The agency has been pushing back against claims online that it has diverted resources to illegal immigrants, that it is out of money, that it has been slow in responding and that it is blocking recovery flights.

MAYORKAS RIPS 'POLITICIZED' ATMOSPHERE OVER FEMA DISASTER RESPONSE AMID GOP CRITICISM'

Focus on the agency was fueled when Mayorkas said last week that FEMA does ""not have the funds to make it through the season"" although he said it did have enough for ""immediate needs."" The administration has pushed for Congress to return and pass a spending bill to provide additional funding for the hurricane season.

But the questions over funding led critics to look at the $650 million provided for grants to help illegal immigrants in the Shelter and Services Program (SSP). It led to accusations, including from former President Trump, that money that could have gone to disaster relief was being diverted. The administration pointed to the fact that the funding is congressionally appropriated and is separate from the much larger Disaster Relief Fund. But Republicans have still expressed concern that an ""entanglement"" in the border crisis has had a knock-on effect.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

Others have pointed to a possible political bias after an ""equity"" blueprint went vital, saying ""Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot be optional.""

Republicans have accused the administration of mishandling the response more broadly, with House Speaker Mike Johnson accusing it of ""egregious errors and mistakes"" and a lack of leadership.

But FEMA and DHS have been pushing back against numerous viral online claims that it says are false, including claims that FEMA grants must be repaid, that it is distributing aid based on demographic characteristics and that it is restricting airspace for recovery operations.

President Biden has also slammed ""reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies that are disturbing people.""

On Wednesday, Mayorkas warned that misinformation can stop recovery efforts.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""Historically, this country has come together as one in times of crisis, in times of disaster. We need that history to be lived today. We cannot have the irresponsible voices that actually wreak damage to individuals in need and prevent survivors from seeking the relief that is available to them,"" he said.

He had made a similar appeal on Tuesday night on MSNBC, speaking on the impact on the workforce and on the ability for individuals to get help.

""It is extraordinarily damaging. Most of all, it is extraordinarily damaging to the survivors of Hurricane Helene, of natural disasters. Individuals lose trust in their government, they are reluctant to seek the assistance that they need to meet their immediate demands -- food, water, shelter. They don't seek it. They are entitled to it. They need it,"" Mayorkas said. ""We implore them to ignore the false information that is being spread and to seek the help that we have available to them.

""It is also extremely demoralizing to our federal law, our emergency response personnel, the state and local emergency response personnel who are risking their lives in the service of those in need. When we reach into flooded zones, when we reach into a home that has been destroyed to assist another individual, we don't ask about their party affiliation. We are there to help, and they need to understand that. They need to trust us. They can rely on us.""

Earlier this week, Mayorkas warned that people ""are not seeking that relief because of the disinformation, the intentionally false information they are receiving."""
8,Voters in key battleground states give Trump an edge over Harris on this top tier issue: poll,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dominates-harris-key-issue-battleground-states,2024-10-10T19:06:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A new poll released this week shows former President Trump with a strong lead over Vice President Kamala Harris on the subject of immigration - even after Harris has sought to present herself as the best candidate to secure the southern border.

The Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday found Harris leading Trump in Pennsylvania, while Trump is ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin. The three Rust Belt states are being closely watched as they could determine which candidate is the next president.

But on the question of who is best to handle immigration, Trump has the edge in all three states. He carries a four-point lead in Pennsylvania (50-46), a nine-point lead in Michigan (53-44) and an eight-point lead in Wisconsin (52-44).

Trump was also preferred in all states on the economy and handling the conflict in the Middle East, while Harris was preferred on abortion and preserving democracy.

Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, along with Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided President Biden's 2020 White House victory over Trump. And the seven states are likely to determine if Trump or Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.

Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are also the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called ""Blue Wall.""

The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.

A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris on immigration, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

Harris was tasked with tackling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to surge. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics - although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have accused her of playing a key role in the border crisis and the policies they believe fueled it, including the rolling back of Trump-era policies. Trump has promised to launch a massive deportation operation if elected, restart border wall construction and end Biden-era parole policies.

Critics have also highlighted her more left-wing policies as a senator and presidential candidate in 2019 - including her positions on immigration funding and the detention of illegal immigrants.

Harris' campaign says her views have changed since 2019 and have been shaped by her involvement in the administration. This year, her campaign has highlighted her past as a prosecutor and noted her backing of a bipartisan Senate bill to increase funding to the border.

Her campaign has noted a recent sharp drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has accused Trump of scuppering the border bill for political purposes and of ""playing political games.""

Wisconsin Democrats Chair Ben Wikler told Fox News Digital in an interview that their ""everything, everywhere, all at once"" and neighbor-to-neighbor organizing has been building the infrastructure for Democrat nominee Vice President Harris to win the critical battleground state.

He said Democrats in Wisconsin have been ""building teams of neighbors to take responsibility for talking to folks in their surrounding area"" continuously ""for the last seven years.""

The Harris campaign is then building off the groundwork they have spent years laying for Democrats, he said.

Wikler attributed recent statewide electoral wins for Democrats in the last six years to this organizing strategy.

""What we know is that a trusted messenger matters almost as much as the message,"" Wikler said. ""And there are Democrats in rural areas talking to other rural voters, in suburbs talking to other suburban voters, in cities talking to other city-dwellers about their votes.""

""We think that the messages that Harris and Walz are carrying, they can resonate with everybody,"" he said. ""And having a messenger who can actually start that conversation and have it not at the talking-point level but at 'what's actually happening in our lives and communities' level makes all the difference. ""

Wikler noted that ""Wisconsin is the perennial tipping-point state,"" referencing its past electoral shifts from going for former President Trump in 2016 to President Biden in 2020.

""That 'glitch' certainly had a negative impact on my life,"" Amanda Kiefer, who suffered a brutal attack at the hands of an illegal immigrant in 2008 while she walked down the street with friends, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""It would be easier to believe it was a mistake if Democrats in San Francisco didn't have a long history of enabling illegal immigration, choosing not to prosecute illegal immigrant criminals and refusal to deport anyone.""

""It wasn't a ""glitch"" that the Biden Harris administration has let in millions of illegal immigrants, including tens of thousands of known, convicted criminals and those on the terror watch list. At a certain point, it can't be incompetence, it's intentional. Harris doesn't care about Americans' safety.""

Then San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris, in a resurfaced speech, blamed a ""glitch"" in the system while discussing the attack on Kiefer.

CBS '60 MINUTES' AIRS TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS FROM VP HARRIS TO THE SAME QUESTION

""But whenever you're rolling out something new, there will at some point become apparent that there is a mistake or a glitch in the design, and when you're in these kinds of positions, that mistake or glitch is on the front page of the paper,"" Harris said during a 2010 Women in Leadership conference at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business while discussing the ""Back on Track"" program she launched that allowed non-violent offenders to avoid jail and instead enter job training and eventually have their records expunged.

""And so you have to take a knock for that,"" Harris said in the speech. ""When I rolled out Back on Track, I took a big political hit, when a couple of years later, it turned out, especially in criminal law, because when you're taking, when you're doing innovation in the criminal justice system, let me tell you what that means. That means I'm doing something differently with somebody who's on my radar. Why are they on my radar? Because they committed a crime.""

Kiefer was brutally attacked by 20-year-old Alexander Izaguirre, an illegal immigrant, while she walked with friends down a San Francisco street in 2008. Izaguirre stole her purse and then attempted to run her down in a waiting SUV, fracturing her skull.

Izaguirre had been arrested a few months prior to the attack on drug charges but was able to roam free, thanks to the program launched by Harris.

Harris continued in the speech, ""Now, remember, I'm focused on the non-violent offender with these innovative programs, right? The fear will always be that guy will go out and kill a baby and a grandmother tomorrow, and then everyone will look backwards and say, 'Why didn't you do it the way it's always been done? Why did you try something new?' It's a big risk. And so when I rolled out Back on Track, couple years in, we learned that there was basically, there was a participant who went out, during the time he was in the program, committed a robbery, there was a horrible injury to the victim. And turned out that this individual is an undocumented immigrant.""

In her speech, Harris went on to mention an article written about her at the time that said, ""'Kamala Harris has created a program to shield illegal aliens.'""

""Right?"" Harris said. ""And that's when my friends came really in handy to just say it's, you know, because I was upset about the unfairness and the mischaracterization and . . . 'Don't people want these things fixed? Don't they understand what innovation requires?' And, and that's when you have to rely on your friends who understand what you do and care about you and will support you without judgment, but also give you critical feedback when you need it.""

KAMALA HARRIS STRUGGLING TO SAY HOW SHE'S DIFFERENT THAN BIDEN ON 'THE VIEW' SURPRISES CNN PANEL

In 2009, Harris told the press that Izaguirre is ""being prosecuted"" and ""will be deported with my full encouragement and support."" Harris also said at the time that Izaguirre's release was a ""flaw in the design"" that was fixed.

Kiefer also spoke out about her experience earlier this year, Fox News Digital reported. She said that the experience was a ""red pill moment"" for her, leading her to abandon what she said were her liberal political views from the time and embrace candidates such as former President Trump.

Kiefer appeared alongside Trump when he visited the Arizona border earlier this year and spoke along with other victims of illegal immigrant crime.

""I moved out of San Francisco because I didn't feel safe there and I don't think our country is going to be safe under Kamala Harris,"" Kiefer said.

Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, remained silent Thursday on whether he still supports eliminating the Electoral College, after the Harris campaign insisted his position did not reflect that of the campaign's.

""I think all of us know, the Electoral College needs to go. We need a national popular vote,"" Walz said during a campaign fundraiser Tuesday at the home of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Walz made similar comments at an earlier fundraiser in Seattle as well.

While running for president in 2019, Harris said she was ""open"" to the idea of abolishing the Electoral College. However, according to campaign officials pressed on the issue following Walz's remarks, eliminating the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote is not an official position of Harris' current campaign.

Fox News Digital reached out to representatives for Walz repeatedly to inquire whether he still supports replacing the Electoral College with a national popular vote, particularly after his campaign came out against it. A response was never received, but the Harris-Walz campaign did release a statement to certain news outlets suggesting Walz's remarks were intended to express support for the Electoral College process.

IF 2024 POLLING ERRORS MIRROR THOSE IN 2020 ELECTION, TRUMP 'WINS IN A BLOWOUT,' CNN DATA GURU SAYS

""Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College and he is honored to be traveling the country and battleground states working to earn support for the Harris-Walz ticket,"" a Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement sent to select media outlets like CNN and USA Today. ""He was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win 270 electoral votes. And, he was thanking them for their support that is helping fund those efforts.""

Debate over whether a national popular vote should replace the Electoral College surged in 2016 when Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote, cementing his victory despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. ""I think it needs to be eliminated,"" Clinton told CNN after her 2016 loss to Trump. ""I'd like to see us move beyond it, yes."" Clinton made similar calls earlier in her career as well.

Just last month, Democratic Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin suggested there could be deadly consequences for Americans if the Electoral College was not done away with. Raskin said a national popular vote was a far better option than the current ""convoluted, antique, obsolete system from the 18th century, which these days can get you killed as nearly it did on Jan. 6, 2021.""

NEBRASKA GOP SENATOR OPPOSES ELECTORAL COLLEGE CHANGE THAT MAY HAVE HELPED TRUMP WIN RE-ELECTION

The Electoral College has been something that both Republicans and Democrats have tried to do away with in the past, but contemporary calls for its abolition surged among Democrats after Clinton's loss. The process was established by the nation's Founding Fathers, seen as a compromise between the election of president by vote in Congress and election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Electoral College votes, of which 270 are needed for any presidential candidate to win, are allocated based on the Census. The process effectively allows voters in states with lower populations to have a similar impact on the election as those voters living in higher population densities. The Electoral College is also thought to be a protective measure against super thin margins and excessive recounts.

In May 2023, as governor, Walz signed a broad ranging election bill that included a provision to allocate the state's electors based on who receives the most votes nationwide, even if it doesn't match the outcome in their state. The measure, known as the ""National Popular Vote Interstate Compact,"" has been supported by 17 states and the District of Columbia, but will only take effect after all the states that have signed on have a total electoral vote count of 270. Right now, those supporting the reform only have 209, according to CBS News.

Polling from the Pew Research Center released last month showed a majority of Americans favor moving away from the Electoral College. Since 2016, the sentiment has steadily increased, and, according to Pew, more than 6 in 10 Americans today prefer the national popular vote over the Electoral College.

Jason Snead, executive director of Honest Elections Project Action, a nonprofit that advocates in favor of retaining the Electoral College, argued Walz ""said the quiet part out loud"" when he insisted the Electoral College should be eliminated.

""Democrat leaders don't think they should have to campaign in places like Michigan and North Carolina, they want California and New York to decide every election,"" Snead argued. ""There is a pattern here. Democrats claim to love democracy, then set their sights on any institution that stands between them and political power: the Supreme Court, the Senate filibuster, and the Electoral College."""

Elise Stefanik joins 'America Reports' to discuss the Republican counterprogramming during the DNC, focusing on the border.

Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego faced off against Republican challenger Kari Lake on Wednesday night and wasted no time exchanging blows over the illegal immigration crisis plaguing the state's southern border.

Lake, trailing behind Gallego entering into the debate, appeared much more on the offensive. Meanwhile, Gallego - a five-term member in Congress - appeared more relaxed, given his comfortable lead in several recent polls.

The two candidates sparred over border security and abortion in the first half of the debate night. Lake touted H.R. 2 - the House GOP-led bill that would tighten border security - while Gallego pointed to his support for the failed bipartisan border bill that Democrats, Republicans and White House officials negotiated earlier this year.

Gallego also accused Lake of wanting to deport Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, while Lake accused Gallego of not wanting to deport any of the illegal immigrants who have crossed the border over the last three and a half years.

""Dealing with the people who've poured in during the Bidenvasion, the 20 million people who have come in unvetted into our country, we must deal with them in order to save our homeland,"" Lake said during the debate. ""We must send them back to their homeland. I'm talking about the people came in unvetted in the past three and a half years. I'm not talking about the dreamers.""

""Do you want to deport any of the people who've invaded our country in the last three and a half years? Ruben, do want to deport any of them?"" Lake probed.

""Yes, actually we should have a proper deport deportation proceedings,"" Gallego replied. ""But I also think that we shouldn't deport Dreamers.""

""She says she's going to deport people. Will you deport those Dreamers? Just be honest, yes or no,"" Gallego said.

Lake responded that former President Donald Trump wanted to make a deal when it came to Dreamers, which Gallego did not support.

""You said no. Unfortunately, the radical Democrats, like my opponent, would rather use people as political pawns. I want to secure the border,"" Lake said.

Though it was a debate for the Arizona Senate seat, the debate did not shy away from weighing into national waters. Other issues like reducing inflation and re-federalizing Roe v. Wade came up later in the debate.

At one point during the night, Gallego took a swipe at Lake, accusing her of spending more time at Trump's Mar-a-Lago than visiting the border.

Lake also made sure to align herself as a strong Trump ally throughout the night who would restore a ""strong Trump economy,"" while painting Gallego as a supporter of ""Kamala Harris, the border czar, and Joe Biden's open border.""

When it came to abortion, which Democrats have selected as one of their winning platform issues this election cycle, Lake said she opposed a federal abortion ban, but Gallego pointed to her supporting the state's 1864 near-total ban in 2022.

Gallegho said ""it is absolutely abhorrent"" that his 15-month-old daughter ""has less rights in control of her body than her mother and then her grandma."" State law currently bans abortion at 15 weeks gestation.

""And the reason we need to codify [Roe v. Wade] because people like Kari Lake are the ones that make this a dangerous situation,"" he said.

Kamala Harris' most likely path to the presidency hinges on her winning the swing state of Michigan - but with just weeks left until Election Day, she is facing an unexpected groundswell of opposition from the state's Jewish population, which has increasingly soured on the Biden administration's response to the Middle East conflict.

The drop-off in support among Jewish voters could spell trouble for Harris in Michigan, considered to be a must-win state, and where the state's Muslim and Arab American populations have been increasingly vocal about their disapproval of the U.S. response to Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

Now, discontent now appears to be spreading to the state's Jewish voters as well, threatening a key bedrock of support in the state.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., whose suburban Detroit district is home to a large Jewish American population, told the New York Times this week that she has seen a drop-off in support for Harris among younger Jewish voters who are disenfranchised by the Biden administration's handling of the Middle East crisis and failure to take stronger action on a policy reset in the region.

Stevens told the Times that the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that Hamas launched on Israel have indeed rallied some Jewish constituents together to combat what they see as rising hatred and antisemitism. But she noted that other, younger voters in the community are turned off by the administration's unwavering support for Israel in the face of the intensifying conflict - policies enacted under the Biden administration, but which Harris must now confront as the party's presidential nominee.

GEORGIA'S MUSLIM VOTERS OPPOSING HARRIS, TRUMP IN ELECTION OVER BOTH CANDIDATES' SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL

Nearly two-thirds of Michigan's Jewish electorate identifies as Democratic or Democratic-leaning, according to data collected by Brandeis University's Steinhardt Social Research Institute. In previous elections, this majority has been a fairly reliable bedrock of support for Democratic presidential nominees.

But that support is anything but guaranteed this year. ""I do know some more independent-type voters, and I have heard from friends with young families, of friends of theirs who have traditionally voted Democrat, that they feel a little split,"" Stevens told the Times.

This loss of support among Jewish voters in the state could be particularly damaging to Harris' chances of victory in Michigan and her broader path to the presidency, which hinges on victory in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Still, it's Michigan where Harris could find herself in particularly hot water.

As the violence in the Middle East escalates, Harris has struggled to earn the support of Michigan's Muslim and Arab American populations, including some who have organized local voters to withhold support for the vice president in order to protest the Biden administration's response to the war.

In recent months, some groups have urged communities to back Green Party candidate Jill Stein, while others said they are weighing the idea of backing Republican candidate Donald Trump - an almost unthinkable position just four years ago, when the former president's so-called ""Muslim ban"" and other policies prompted Muslim voters to support Joe Biden by a strong 64% to 84% majority in 2020, according to exit polls."

She traveled to the Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge to receive a dilation and curettage procedure to remove the remaining tissue from the terminated pregnancy, but hospital staff allegedly waited about 20 hours before performing the procedure.

High-profile civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump will represent the family in their upcoming case against the hospital. Crump pinned blame for Thurman's death on the hospital and not Georgia's recent law that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, Spectrum News reported.

""Even under Georgia law, the doctors had a duty to act to save Amber,"" Crump said last week. ""She had taken the abortion pills and there were tissues left. There was no viable fetus or anything that would have prevented them from saving her life while she suffered.""

HARRIS ECHOES DEBUNKED CLAIM ABOUT GEORGIA ABORTION LIMITS CAUSING WOMAN'S DEATH DESPITE PUSHBACK FROM DOCTORS

""You have a duty to stabilize her and then give her the option to go to another hospital facility,"" Crump said. ""But you cannot let her suffer and die on your hospital bed when the death is preventable.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the LIFE Act into law in 2019, but it did not take effect until 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which effectively ended the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion.

Thurman's death in August 2022 has since become the first known abortion death since the Supreme Court's decision, with Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, citing her death as the result of ""restrictive"" Republican-backed abortion laws.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy."" The law makes exceptions for abortions after the six-week mark, including in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy, or a pregnancy through rape or incest when the probable gestational age of the baby is less than 20 weeks.

ProPublica first published an article on Thurman's death last month, blaming her death and another Georgia woman's death, Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

Harris cited Thurman's death on Sunday during an interview on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

""[Thurman] was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

In a previous press release announcing Crump would represent Thurman's family members in court, he did blame Thurman's death on Georgia's abortion law.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

""Amber Thurman's preventable death is a horrifying consequence of draconian abortion laws that put politics ahead of women's lives. These lawmakers bear responsibility for creating hesitation among health care workers, who are fearful of the legal consequences when providing necessary care. Her family deserves accountability for the delays in life-saving care that cost Amber her life. We are committed to seeking justice for Amber and fighting for a country where no other family suffers such a devastating loss due to dangerous, unnecessary legal barriers,"" Crump said in the press release.

OB-GYNs have criticized the recent narrative from Democrats as a misleading story that is pushed by the media.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

AMBER NICOLE THURMAN WAS A 'VICTIM OF HIGH-RISK ABORTION DRUGS': DR. CHRISTINA FRANCIS

Thurman's stepfather, Elijah Warren, has called on Democrats, specifically Harris, to stop politicizing the death, saying when he sees politicians talking about Thurman's death, it is ""like a funeral happening over and over.""

""I can see [Harris] using that as the only tool in Georgia against Trump,"" Warren told the New York Post this week.

""She is going to push that; I expect it. But it's too much. It's kind of like a funeral happening over and over again every time I see that.""

Warren said he views Thurman's death, which was caused by septic shock, ""more as a neglect of the hospital"" than the Georgia law.

""They should have watched over my stepdaughter ... The abortion already happened. There wasn't a heartbeat going on,"" he said. ""They should have just cleaned the tissue; that would have saved her life.""

Brittany Mahomes has company in the club of NFL quarterback wives who support Donald Trump.

The wife of Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Annah Tagovailoa, posted a story to her Instagram on Wednesday that praised former President Trump's preemptive response to Hurricane Milton.

She re-posted a video from conservative influencer Benny Johnson that showed footage of the former president hosting 275 Florida Power and LIght linemen at one of Trump's resorts in Miami. Trump hosted the workers free of charge as a safe place for them to wait out the hurricane while it made landfall in more northern areas of Florida.

Tagovailoa's post follows a trend set by Mahomes, the wife of Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who began to show support for Trump in mid-August. Mahomes liked a post of Trump's policy platform on Aug. 13 and a comment on one of her own Instagram posts read ""TRUMP-VANCE 2024,"" a few weeks later.

Mahomes was hit with a wave of hate comments after screenshots of her like of Trump's policy platform circulated across social media, so much so that she needed to make multiple posts speaking out against the hate she was receiving.

While Tagovailoa has received some praise for her post, there were a few negative comments aimed at her and her husband, Tua Tagovailoa.

Many of the negative comments addressed Tua's recent concussion that he suffered in Week 2 of the season against the Buffalo Bills. It was the third concussion of the quarterback's pro career, and has brought widespread concern over his long-term brain health and NFL future.

""Looks like she's suffering from concussions as well,"" one X user wrote in response.

Another user wrote, ""Her brain is as mush as her husband's.""

Tagovailoa suffered two concussions in a single season in 2022.

TUA TAGOVAILOA'S RETIREMENT COULD COST DOLPHINS $124 MILLION AFTER GM RELIED ON JIUJITSU TO END HIS CONCUSSIONS

Tagovailoa was placed on injured reserve on Sept. 17 after suffering his latest concussion. The concussion brought about cries by fans, pro athlete peers and media pundits for the quarterback to retire from football over concerns of CTE and further brain damage. The NFL has not weighed in as to when or if the quarterback will return.

Dolphis said head coach Mike McDaniel said Tagovailoa told reporters this week that the quarterback will meet with brain health experts during the team's bye week, as he still hasn't cleared concussion protocol. When asked if the team has been advised to hold Tagovailoa out longer even after he's been cleared to return, McDaniel said he has received ""nothing negative"" from experts.

Tua and Annah reportedly met during their time at the University of Alabama and got married in secret in July 2022. The couple has chosen to keep their relationship private from the media since Tua came into the NFL. The couple has two children, their son Ace, who was born in August 2022, and their daughter Maisey in 2023.

Annah, born Annah Gore in 1999, is from North Carolina. She went to a private Catholic school, St. Gertrude High School in Virginia, and then attended college at Alabama with Tua.

Tua, meanwhile, was born and raised in Hawaii, and also attended a private Catholic school, the St. Louis School in Honolulu.

""The only thing I feel is the election is coming November 5th. I'm scared to death,"" he told MSNBC's Ari Melber. ""I'm very, very concerned.""

Carville made the case that Harris really only had around 20 days to boost her messaging, as Hurricane Milton was likely to dominate coverage for the next few days.

""They need to be sharp. They need to be aggressive. They need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. They're doing all this and sitting down with '60 Minutes' and sitting down with Colbert and sitting down - no matter what, if I come on your show, you will ask me the questions. If I have a press conference, I get to ask the questions,"" he said.

JAMES CARVILLE PREDICTS ELECTION 'PLOT TWIST' AHEAD OF NOVEMBER: 'SPRINT TO THE FINISH'

""You'd like to see her do more press conferences?"" Melber asked.

Carville said he wanted Harris to have more events and control the narrative.

""Where she's out saying, 'What is J.D. Vance talking about that Trump saved Obamacare? He tried to destroy it at every point.' I would put President Obama out to make that. He only has a 92% approval with Democrats. He is only the author, the father, of 23 million people having insurance,"" Carville said.

Obama will be campaigning for Harris on Thursday in Pennsylvania.

Carville also argued Democrats were not countering messaging from the Trump-Vance campaign enough.

""And I think she and the whole campaign need to be much more aggressive and much less passive than they are,"" he said.

Harris has yet to conduct a formal press conference in the 81 days since becoming the Democratic nominee following President Biden's exit from the race.

Ron DeSantis should take Vice President Kamala Harris' calls.

President Biden praised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for being ""gracious"" as he spoke with him about mitigating multiple hurricanes hitting Florida.

There has been an ongoing feud between Vice President Kamala Harris' team and DeSantis in recent days. NBC News reported Monday that DeSantis has been denying phone calls from Harris' team, but it seems the governor and the president are on far better terms.

During a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday, Real Clear Politics reporter Philip Wegmann asked, ""Mr. President, does Governor DeSantis need to take Vice President Harris's calls?""

""All I can tell you is I've talked to Governor DeSantis,"" Biden answered. ""He's been very gracious. He thanked me for all we've done. He knows what we're doing, and I think that's important.""

RON DESANTIS: 51 COUNTIES ARE UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY

Biden has had multiple phone calls with DeSantis since Hurricane Helene began barreling down on the southeast two weeks ago, followed by Hurricane Milton making landfall late Wednesday, and told both DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to ""call him directly"" if any further support is needed.

DeSantis, meanwhile, noted Tuesday morning that all his federal requests for more support have been answered.

Harris has accused DeSantis of ""playing political games"" amid the hurricanes.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games with this moment, in these crisis situations, these are the height of emergency situations, it's just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris told reporters Monday.

Biden, by contrast, had instead referred to the Florida governor as ""cooperative.""

""The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday, and I said - no - you're doing a great job, it's all being done well and we thank you for it,"" Biden said at a press conference from the White House Tuesday. ""There was a rough start in some places, but every governor, every governor - from Florida to North Carolina - has been fully cooperative and supportive.""

BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA; DESANTIS TELLS VP 'IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU KAMALA'

NBC News reported late Wednesday, ""Biden hadn't been briefed about the dynamic involving Harris and DeSantis, the person familiar with the situation said."" That source told the outlet that Biden ""wasn't tracking a specific back-and-forth"" and was ""focused on the response itself.""

After a DeSantis staffer told NBC on Monday that the Florida governor had chosen not to take the vice president's call, DeSantis later clarified that he was never even aware Harris was trying to contact him. The governor instead argued that Harris was the one engaging in political gamesmanship.

""I've worked on these hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now,"" DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning following reports of the vice president's criticism. ""Why, all of the sudden, is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics, we know it's because of her campaign.""

Republicans in Michigan are attempting to capitalize on Vice President Kamala Harris' struggles with blue-collar voters in the state, a demographic that has traditionally supported Democrats but has been trending in the direction of former President Donald Trump.

""Michigan's working class isn't fooled by Kamala Harris' word salads and dog and pony shows. Her policies, like the radical Green New Deal, are anti-worker,"" Team Trump Michigan Communications Director Victoria LaCivita told Fox News Digital. ""Her attack on American energy has made the cost of living unaffordable, and her plan to ban gas-powered cars will decimate the backbone of our economy.""

The comments come as the race to win Michigan, a vital swing state in the upcoming election, heats up, with the Real Clear Politics polling average showing Harris with just a slim 0.5 point lead in the state with just under four weeks to go before the election.

Republicans have hit the state repeatedly in recent weeks, with both Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, making several appearances in the state.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

Those appearances come as Michigan Democrats have begun to worry about the vice president's prospects in the state, with some imploring her to visit the state more frequently as the race hits the home stretch.

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, prominent Michigan Democrats, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, have made appeals to the Harris campaign to focus on the state more as the election draws to a close. They have also warned Harris to sharpen her economic messaging, the report notes, with fears spreading that Trump has done well to court the state's working class voters.

Harris has struggled to distance herself from past positions that remain unpopular in the so-called ""Blue Wall"" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, including her previous support for transitioning fully to zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 and a ban on fracking.

Those concerns were also highlighted by an internal poll shared with the Wall Street Journal that was conducted by Sen. Tammy Baldwin's campaign that showed Harris down by three points in Wisconsin, another key Midwestern state with similar voting habits to Michigan.

""The big thing is people don't know her -- they need to see more of her,"" former Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, a Democrat, told the Wall Street Journal.

FIREFIGHTERS UNION PRAISED FOR 'SIGNIFICANT NON-ENDORSEMENT' AFTER BACKING BIDEN IN 2020: 'HUGE WIN FOR TRUMP'

Republicans believe that is because Harris has failed in her outreach to the types of workers that have now started gravitating toward Trump.

National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital that Harris' message does not ""resonate with working class voters"" such as those in the upper Midwest, something that could also help down-ballot Republicans in the critical swing states.

Harris' struggles have also extended to union members, a group that has long been a stronghold for Democrats in the state. However, an internal poll conducted by Teamsters, one of the country's largest and most influential unions, found that members in Michigan preferred Trump (61.7%) over Harris (35.2%), while national union leaders declined to make an endorsement in this year's presidential race, despite supporting President Biden's campaign in 2020.

Harris also failed to gain the support of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which also supported Biden in 2020, though she did gain the support of both United Auto Workers and the Service Employees International Union.

""The Teamsters' own polling shows exactly what we knew - that rank and file Michigan Teamsters are supporting President Trump and his pro-worker policies,"" LaCivita said.

The influx of Haitian migrants into the U.S. has become a major political issue in recent months, as both former President Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance repeated claims about the impact they are having on towns like Springfield, Ohio.

It has become a political issue in part due to the Biden administration's parole processes for four nationalities -- Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Under that program, migrants can arrive in the United States and be given a two-year parole term, along with temporary work permits.

Some of those are eligible for protection from deportation by the redesignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status by the Biden administration this summer.

MAYORKAS MOVES TO SHIELD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FROM DEPORTATION BACK TO TROUBLED CARIBBEAN NATION

The Biden administration announced on Friday that it will not be extending those parole periods for any of the four nationalities, meaning they will have to apply for a different immigration status or leave the country.

The impact that the influx of migrants has had on some towns in the U.S. has become a 2024 election issue after it was put into the spotlight by former President Trump. Most notably, Trump repeated claims that migrants have been eating cats and dogs in Springfield Ohio, which officials have denied.

""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats,"" Trump said. ""They're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.""

But others have pointed to the impact it has had on social services.

Vance recently said that he does not consider those who come through via the parole programs to be legal immigrants as he sees the programs as illegal. Here is what to know about Haitian migration into the U.S.

VANCE SAYS HE WILL KEEP CALLING HAITIAN MIGRANTS 'ILLEGAL ALIENS' DESPITE PAROLE STATUS

There are approximately 1,152,604 Haitian immigrants residing in the US according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2023 American Community Survey (ACS).

That is up from nearly 731,000 Haitian immigrants in 2022.

Florida has the largest Haitian population in the U.S., at about 511,621 individuals, while New York's population is a distant 2nd with 196,698 individuals. Massachusetts has 72,677 and New Jersey has 69,069.

The top four counties for Haitian immigrants were Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties in Florida, and Kings County in New York. Together, these counties accounted for 41 percent of Haitian immigrants in the United States.

Meanwhile, in Springfield, officials estimate that between 12,000 and 20,000 Haitians live in the city.

More broadly on the CHNV program, during an eight-month period from January through August 2023, roughly 200,000 migrants flew into the U.S. via the program from all four nationalities. Of those, 80% of them, (161,562) arrived in the state of Florida in four cities: Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa Bay, according to DHS data obtained via a subpoena by the House Homeland Security Committee and provided to Fox News.

The Biden administration expanded the CHNV program to include Haitians in January 2023 and since then, 214,000 Haitians have entered the U.S. under the program. Recipients are given a two-year parole and a work permit if they have a sponsor and pass certain background checks.

However, the administration announced this month that it will not be extending those paroles beyond that period, meaning Haitians and others protected under the program will have to find another immigration status or potentially leave the country.

The Biden administration, however, has also redesignated and extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which protects designated migrant groups from deportation and allows work permits, until February 2026.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS

To be eligible, Haitians must have been in the U.S. as of June 3. DHS predicts that it will allow an estimated 309,000 additional nationals to file for TPS, on top of those already protected.

TPS grants protection to nationals in countries found to be unsafe for them to be returned and is based on three grounds: armed ongoing conflict, environmental disasters or ""extraordinary and temporary conditions.""

""Several regions in Haiti continue to face violence or insecurity, and many have limited access to safety, health care, food, and water. Haiti is particularly prone to flooding and mudslides, and often experiences significant damage due to storms, flooding, and earthquakes. These overlapping humanitarian challenges have resulted in ongoing urgent humanitarian needs,"" DHS said in a release.

It has led to concerns from conservatives that the revoking of parole status will not lead to significant numbers of Haitians leaving the U.S. after their status expires."

The Breakfast Club radio show co-host Charlamagne Tha God said Monday that former President Trump's rhetoric about putting ""America first"" is a winning strategy.

Charlamagne was discussing the messaging from both presidential tickets, particularly as America navigates crises at home and abroad. After a co-host played a clip of Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Charlamagne highlighted one key way in which Democrats are being outperformed by their opponents.

""You know, one place where I think they mess up in regards to messaging?"" Charlamagne asked. ""Like, you know, you'll listen to a lot of reporters and they'll be talking to Trump or JD Vance and they'll be talking to them about things that are happening right here in America, because it is an election season right here in America.""

""So it's always America first. But then you go to Tim Walz and they're asking him about geopolitical politics, and I think a lot of times that makes them sound, you know, very out of touch. That makes them sound very out of touch to what's going on right here in America,"" he said.

IN ARIZONA SPEECH, VANCE SAYS NEXT PRESIDENT MUST PUT AMERICANS FIRST, SLAMS FEMA MONEY FOR MIGRANTS

When a co-host noted that these are the questions being asked of the candidates, Charlamagne agreed and said that international issues are being ""highlighted over what's happening right here in this country, and when you hear, you know, the Vances and Trumps talking about what's happening here at home and saying things like 'America First' and 'Make America Great Again,' that messaging sometimes resonates a lot more.""

He then corrected himself and said, ""Not sometimes, it does resonate a lot more.""

He then noted that as Americans are struggling at home with natural disasters, they have had little tolerance for money being sent abroad.

On Saturday, Harris pledged $157 million in ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon which, she argued, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

Dokoupil, who is Jewish and has children living in Israel, grilled ""The Message"" author Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose new book is critical of Israel.

""The content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil told Coates, asking him ""why leave out so much"" and ""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state that is a Jewish safe place?""

What transpired was a spirited conversation between Dokoupil and Coates that, despite its intensity, never boiled over on-air. The same, however, cannot be said inside the network, according to various reports.

CBS leadership reassured offended staff members that following a review, they concluded that the interview did not meet the company's ""editorial standards,"" the Free Press reported, which obtained audio of the staff meeting.

While a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital that Dokoupil would not be punished over the interview, he was forced to meet with the network's in-house Race and Culture Unit following complaints. According to The New York Times, the conversation ""focused on Mr. Dokoupil's tone of voice, phrasing and body language"" during the interview.

CBS PARENT COMPANY CEO SAYS NETWORK LEADERSHIP MADE 'MISTAKE' IN RESPONSE TO TONY DOKOUPIL INTERVIEW

The New York Post also reported that Dokoupil expressed regret to staffers at a meeting, one network insider describing it, ""There were tears. [People were] very upset.""

Some have rallied in his defense, like CBS News legal correspondent Jan Crawford, who went to bat for him during a network conference call, and Shari Redstone, chair of CBS News' parent company Paramount Global, who called the network's handling of Dokoupil a ""mistake."" CBS CEO George Cheeks issued a memo standing by the news network's leadership.

The ideological takeover of CBS newsroom appears to be in full swing. And it's far from the only news outlet impacted by its far-left staffers.

Earlier this year, NBC News was engulfed in scandal fueled by its own staffers after the network announced it had hired former RNC chair Ronna McDaniel as a contributor.

The practice of major news organizations hiring ex-lawmakers, government officials and political insiders has existed for decades and has largely been non-controversial, but a chorus of NBC talent, particularly from its staunchly liberal sister network MSNBC, publicly disavowed McDaniel's hiring, citing her alleged actions in trying to block the certification of Michigan's election results in 2020.

""We weren't asked our opinion of the hiring, but if we were, we would have strongly objected to it for several reasons including, but not limited to, as lawyers might say, Miss McDaniel's role in Donald Trump's fake elector scheme and her pressuring election officials to not certify election results while Donald Trump was on the phone,"" Joe Scarborough said on ""Morning Joe.""

""To be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage,"" co-host Mika Brzezinski followed. ""But it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier. And we hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on 'Morning Joe' in her capacity as a paid contributor.""

NBC'S CHUCK TODD EXPLODES ON NETWORK BOSSES ON THE AIR FOR HIRING RONNA MCDANIEL AS ANALYST, CALLS FOR APOLOGY

Rachel Maddow, MSNBC's biggest star, blasted NBC's ""inexplicable"" decision to hire McDaniel and expressed hope that the network would reverse its decision.

""Ronna McDaniel will not appear on MSNBC, so says our boss since Saturday. And it has never been anything other than clear,"" Maddow assured viewers.

Several among the network's liberal talent including Chuck Todd, Nicolle Wallace, Joy Reid and Jen Psaki also spoke out against the move.

Just four days after NBC News announced McDaniel's hiring, she was terminated.

""There is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,"" NBCUniversial News Group Chairman Cesar Conde told staff in a memo. ""After listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.""

Conde acknowledged McDaniel's hiring had undermined the goal of a ""cohesive and aligned"" newsroom and offered an apology to his staff.

""I want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,"" Conde wrote. ""While this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.""

Last year, CNN staff openly revolted when it welcomed former President Trump for a live town hall.

""It's hard to see how America was served by the spectacle of lies that aired on CNN,"" CNN's then in-house media reporter Oliver Darcy wrote in his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. ""Yes, some news was made... But for most of the night, the nation's eyes were transfixed on Trump's abuse of the platform that he was given.""

CNN's Anderson Cooper offered a somber monologue addressing the town hall, telling his viewers ""Many of you have expressed deep anger and disappointment. Many of you are upset that someone who attempted to destroy our democracy was invited to sit on a stage in front of a crowd of Republican voters to answer questions and predictably continued to spew lie, after lie, after lie"" before attacking Trump's supporters in the audience and offering a lukewarm defense of the town hall.

CNN FACING 'FURY' FROM STAFFERS OVER TRUMP TOWN HALL: 'IT FELT LIKE 2016 ALL OVER AGAIN'

The most blistering takedown of the Trump town hall came from veteran CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour, who went on a tear during a commencement address she gave at the Columbia Journalism School, revealing she had confronted her then-boss Chris Licht directly about her disapproval.

""My management believes they did the right thing, a service to the American people. Some reports have written about important new thoughts and things that we learned from Trump's very mouth that night... Time could very well prove that Trump's electroshock therapy to the world jolts the undecided into greater awareness,"" Amanpour said. ""For me, of course, the fact that the American people voted three times against Trump and Trumpism- 2018, 2020, 2022- also speaks volumes. We've done our duty. We have told the story. We have put that in everybody's awareness and people have had the opportunity to make their choices and they have done.""

She continued, ""I still respectfully disagree with allowing Donald Trump to appear in that particular format,"" which sparked applause from the audience.

Amanpour's speech was liked and shared on social media by dozens of CNN staffers, including Jake Tapper. The town hall was widely believed to be the moment when Licht lost the trust of CNN's workforce. He was ultimately fired weeks later.

Perhaps the first instance in which a news organization faced such public backlash from within the newsroom was in 2020 when The New York Times published the now-infamous ""Tom Cotton op-ed.""

The Republican senator argued in a piece titled ""Send in the Troops"" that the president should deploy the military to quell the George Floyd riots that sparked havoc in cities across the country.

Dozens of Times employees rushed to social media in a coordinated campaign, many of them echoing the phrase ""Running this put Black @nytimes staff in danger.""

THE NEW YORK TIMES REMAINS HAUNTED BY THE TOM COTTON OP-ED ALMOST 4 YEARS LATER

Days later, the Times updated Cotton's piece with a lengthy editor's note declaring it ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, who initially defended the op-ed's publication, later reversed himself, blaming ""a rushed editorial process.""

Two members of the Times Opinion staff, James Bennet and Adam Rubenstein, were pushed out at the Times as a result. Another staffer, James Dao, was reassigned to a different department.

It was following that meltdown when Bari Weiss declared in her resignation letter as one of the paper's opinion staff editors, ""Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has become its ultimate editor."""

""Definitely the economy,"" Nick said. ""I think immigration is a big deal, I just think energy is probably a big one, too. I think people are tired of paying $4 a gallon of gas.""

Bri, a realtor, agreed.

""The inflation seems to be wearing on people,"" she said while out for a morning walk in Henderson. ""I see how it's affecting my clients [and] other people who are looking at purchasing real estate, but they really just don't know what's going to happen with the economy.""

NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAS TO 'GET SERIOUS' ABOUT IMMIGRATION, SAY VOTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

Nevada is one of a handful of states where former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a neck-and-neck race.

Joao, a Trump supporter, said illegal immigration is his top priority.

""Close the border,"" Joao said. ""Don't let no one in unless you are [here] legally.""

Donna, who was protesting outside a campaign event for GOP Senate hopeful Sam Brown in Las Vegas, had several priorities including safeguarding legal abortion.

""Even though abortion is protected in Nevada for right now, it's a key issue when I'm talking to other people who are voting,"" Donna told Fox News Digital. ""And they're very concerned about people like Sam Brown and their stance against abortion and a woman's right.""

HISPANIC VOTERS RAIL AGAINST 'DISHONEST' BIDEN-HARRIS BORDER RECORD AS POLL SHOWS TRUMP GAINING IN KEY STATES

Brown supported Texas' 20-week abortion ban during an unsuccessful bid for state office there in 2014, The Nevada Independent reported. More recently, Brown has maintained that, although he is personally pro-life, he would oppose a federal abortion ban.

Jerrie agreed that abortion was among the top issues for Clark County voters, who trend slightly more Democratic than the state as a whole. The rising cost of living also ranked high for him, though.

""Go to the grocery store, you get three items, and there's 50 bucks right there,"" he said.

Who are American evangelicals, and what do they want? This is one of the questions perplexing politicians, pollsters and strategists in the run-up to Election Day.

Recent research from Dr. George Barna conservatively projects a national population of 25 to 30 million adults who qualify as theologically-defined evangelicals - and estimates that one third of them do not vote.

Election Forum estimates that nearly 7 million evangelicals in swing states alone did not vote in the 2020 election. Whether out of disillusionment, disconnection or distrust, millions of would-be Christian voters sat out an election that was decided by tens of thousands of votes.

Both major political parties have tried to appeal to faith voters in a way that demonstrates a partial (at best) understanding of who these Americans are and what they believe. Tactics like concocting candidate faith testimonies, parading denominational ""roots,"" or drumming up doctrinal statements just don't work to activate truth-loving voters.

WHY EVANGELICALS ARE WEDDED TO TRUMP AS HE MAKES A MORE BIBLICAL APPEAL

Recent polling indicates there is no presidential candidate in 2024 with the ability to decisively command the ""Christian"" vote. There are several possible reasons why evangelical Christians have not been energized to turn out as a unified voting bloc.

One such reason is backlash to emotional manipulation in politics. Politicians and their proxies in religious circles have distorted public policy issues to manipulate and confuse well-meaning Christian voters.

Policies like unrestricted abortion and open borders have been painted with a veneer of Christian-like empathy and understanding. Well-funded special interest groups have employed sophisticated measures to influence evangelical voting behavior from within the church.

Christians have lost trust in politicians and surrogates who attempt to hijack their sincerity to provoke sympathy for lawlessness or pressure them into tolerating beliefs that harm those who hold them. But attempts to shame and suppress conservative evangelicals using words like ""political idolatry"" and ""divisiveness"" are no longer working. Christians who are waking up to the fact that niceties do not convert fundamentally bad ideas into good or biblical policies should express this at the ballot box.

'EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS' HOST HAS SAID 'WHITENESS IS WICKED,' POLICE NEED TO BE 'DESTROYED AND REBUILT'

Second, most Christian voters have not had the opportunity to hear their own pastors speak freely about the issues at stake. Pastors have long been hindered from doing so by the Johnson Amendment, the provision in the Internal Revenue Code that restricts 501 (c)(3) nonprofits, including churches, from making statements of support or opposition to political candidates or even comparing the positions of candidates to Scripture.

Absent such restrictions, this would be a critical time for faithful Christian clergy to speak with one voice to energize and activate their congregations to vote in alignment with their genuine interests and concerns. National Religious Broadcasters recently filed a challenge to the Johnson Amendment to preserve robust First Amendment freedoms in future elections, ensuring that pastors can speak freely on all matters that their faith informs - including issues on the ballot.

But at this stage in the 2024 presidential election, there are very few truly undecided voters. Most evangelical Christians have already concluded which candidates best align with their Christian beliefs and their hopes for America's future. While there may only be a small number of voters still contemplating the choice between former President Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris, or other federal, state or local candidates further down the ballot, many more are wavering between action or inaction. The decision at hand is whether to put their vote into the ballot box.

FAITH VOTERS WILL 'DECIDE THIS ELECTION,' ACCORDING TO PROMINENT GOP MEMBERS

The justification for participating in the 2024 presidential election does not rest on the religious devotion or clean moral track record of any candidate for office. I believe that every Christian has a moral and ethical duty to participate in this election for three main reasons.

First, the magnitude of what this president will inherit cannot be overstated. The job of the 47th U.S. president will not be to charm and delight the U.S. public. On the contrary, the individual who takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2025, will be responsible for the following:

An untenable situation at the U.S. southern border, which constitutes a massive humanitarian and public safety crisis billable to the American taxpayer; a dangerously destabilized Middle East, with Iranian missiles sailing into Israel in recent days; the urgency of negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia; the troubled state of the U.S. economy and much more.

To deliver this job to someone without the strength, fortitude and moral clarity to choose the correct course of action - and do what they say they will do - would be a great disservice to America and to the world.

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

Second, the violence and bloodshed surrounding this presidential election is a direct reflection of America's spiritual condition. Trump is only the second U.S. president (after President Gerald Ford) to survive multiple assassination attempts, with the attack on Trump's rally in July resulting in the death and injury of innocent bystanders.

Far from being defined by ""joy,"" the run-up to this election has been murderous and bloodthirsty. The 2024 presidential election has been a national encounter with spiritual darkness. The forces of evil have shown up. Will Christians respond? We must not only pray steadfastly for America's spiritual welfare, but we must show up to vote with determination and resolve come Nov. 5.

Third, Harris and Trump offer two radically different visions for America, implicating serious issues of Christian concern beyond the obvious national priorities.

Trump does not assert that his policies are informed by Christianity or the Bible, but by principles of common sense and consensus-building. Indeed, he has acted with an eye toward pragmatism and political viability on some issues where Christians have asked for stronger commitments. Trump has nonetheless demonstrated openness to persuasion on moral issues and has pledged to safeguard the free exercise of religion and conscience protections that are cherished by religious believers.

NEW 'GOD'S NOT DEAD' FILM INSPIRES CHRISTIANS TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD AT BALLOT BOX

Harris has cited faith as a direct justification for her positions and ideas and has asked that faith leaders use their credibility to support these aims. In 2022, Harris told the National Baptist Convention, ""As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.""

One cannot help but conclude that Harris would not favor strong conscience protections for these ""extremists,"" nor spare the taxpayer dollars of her coreligionists from being spent on unrestricted abortion.

Single-issue voters should be aware that there are multiple issues at stake in this election which Scripture addresses clearly. Bound up in these diverging visions for America are numerous proposals that Christian voters must diligently examine from a biblical viewpoint, such as protecting the innocence of children, promoting a culture of life and family formation, empowering parents, ending the unjust weaponization of government and defending against persecution of Christians.

REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM CALLS OUT 'EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS' FOR 'TRYING TO MISLEAD PEOPLE' USING HIS FATHER IN AD

If you are not certain of the importance of your voice on Nov. 5, I urge you to further research the policies connected to the names on the ballot. Learn what your candidates are promising to do, and consider whether they can keep their promises. Voters who feel torn by the presidency need to remember that there are issues and candidates up and down the ballot whose decisions will directly impact the state and community where you live.

Christian, your vote will influence the outcome of the 2024 election whether you cast it or not. Our country needs you at the ballot box. As Christians, we willingly render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's.

In this era of our nation's history, our elections involve questions of moral good and evil, the lives and health of the next generation, and the future of global peace and security. Christian presence and participation is critical to preserving our nation for the glory of God.

Your duty as a Christian in election season is not to be entertained, amused or cheered up -- but to be a sober-minded and watchful guardian of what God has entrusted us. Make it your mission to convert inertia and inattention among your friends, relatives, and fellow Christians into participation and purpose.

Don't sit this one out. Vote, and encourage others to vote, by Nov. 5."

President Biden, making calls with elected officials in Florida on Wednesday evening, as powerful and extremely dangerous Hurricane Milton crashed into the state.

And the president also speaking with Democratic and Republican senators from the states hard hit by Hurricane Helene, which tore a path of destruction through the southeast nearly two weeks ago.

""I directed my team to do everything we can to save lives and help communities before, during, and after the hurricane -- the one that has just passed and this awful one that's about to hit,"" Biden said at the end of a long day overseeing the federal response to the storms.

And the president stressed that ""my most important message today is for those who are in impacted areas, please, please listen to your local authorities, follow all safety...instructions and evacuation orders. This is serious, very serious.""

BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA

With less than four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump locked in a narrow margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election, the politics of federal disaster relief are again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump for nearly two weeks has repeatedly attacked Biden and Harris and accused them of being incompetent in steering the federal efforts in responding to the back-to-back deadly hurricanes.

EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE

""The worst hurricane response since Katrina,"" the former president charged on Wednesday as he pointed to the much-maligned initial federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was heavily criticized for being slow and ineffective.

Trump, speaking at a campaign rally in battleground Pennsylvania, lobbed another political bomb at Harris, arguing that ""She just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina...the worst ever, they say.""

And the former president once again made false claims that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) diverted money intended for disaster relief and spent it on undocumented migrants in the U.S. as he turned up the volume on his inflammatory rhetoric over the combustible issue of illegal immigration.

""You know where they gave the money to: illegal immigrants coming,"" Trump said as the crowd of MAGA supporters loudly booed.

A couple of hours earlier, as the president and vice president received their latest briefing from FEMA and other federal agencies on storm preparations in Florida and relief efforts across the Southeast, Biden said that ""we have made available an unprecedented number of assets to deal with this crisis, and we're going to continue to do so until the job is done.""

Biden also took aim at Trump, accusing him of leading an ""onslaught of lies.""

The president charged that the rhetoric from Trump and other Republicans was ""beyond ridiculous"" and that ""it's got to stop.""

Harris, who in July replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, had a similar message during an interview Wednesday on the Weather Channel.

""This is not a time for us to just point fingers at each other as Americans,"" Harris said. ""Anybody who considers themselves to be a leader should really be in the business right now of giving people a sense of confidence that we're all working together and that we have the resources and the ability to work together on their behalf.""

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTON

But earlier this week, Harris and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida traded verbal fire over whether he ignored hurricane-related calls from her.

The vice president called DeSantis ""selfish,"" and the governor accused Harris of playing ""political games.""

""Natural disasters present perils and promise for presidential hopefuls,"" longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed, a veteran of multiple GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

Reed noted that ""for the incumbent, it's an opportunity to demonstrate competence and steady leadership and prove that their government is able to function at a core level during a time of peril.""

But it doesn't always play according to the script for an incumbent president.

Then-President George H.W. Bush took a political hit over FEMA's disorganized efforts to provide relief in Florida from Hurricane Andrew, which pounded the then-key battleground state weeks before the 1992 election.

Fast-forward a decade and his son - then-President George W. Bush - enjoyed a political bounce in Florida during his 2004 re-election thanks to his aggressive response to Hurricane Charley, which hit in August of that year.

Bush was narrowly re-elected, thanks in large part to carrying the Sunshine State, but his administration's image in handling storms took a major hit the next year, over the botched response in Louisiana to Hurricane Katrina.

As he ran for re-election in 2012, then-President Barack Obama's aggressive response in dealing with Superstorm Sandy -which slammed into the Eastern Seaboard days before the election - likely boosted him to victory.

Reed argued that ""without a real role to play in the response to Helene and now Milton, Vice President Harris is betwixt and between, wary about being seen as too close to a deeply unpopular administration but also well aware that its failures will be seen as her failures and political baggage to carry the next three weeks."""

On one point, at least, the Kremlin has sided with Bob Woodward against Donald Trump.

Woodward is coming out with a new book, and among its headline-making disclosures is his report on what happened when the pandemic struck, when the death toll was soaring and people could not get home testing kits for Covid-19.

FROM KISSY-FACE SITDOWN ON 'THE VIEW' TO A TOUGHER GRILLING ON '60 MINUTES,' KAMALA HARRIS IS MAKING NEWS

President Trump, at that point in 2020, secretly sent Vladimir Putin a number of Abbott Point of Care Covid test machines ""for his personal use.""

The Trump campaign said Woodward's book, an advance copy of which was obtained by CNN, consisted entirely of made-up stories.

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov confirmed the receipt of the Covid machines.

""As for the tests, when the pandemic began, countries did not have enough equipment,"" Peskov said. ""And many countries then exchanged such gestures of support and sent each other shipments of various equipment they had.""

In fact, during that spring of 2020, Russia sent the Trump administration 60 tons of medical equipment.

Woodward also quotes the Russian dictator as telling Trump: ""I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me.""

KAMALA 2.0'S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS

But Peskov disputed another assertion by Woodward, that Trump has stayed in touch with Putin since he left the White House, with as many as seven calls between them. ""As for the calls, that's a lie,"" Peskov said.

In the book ""War,"" however, the Washington Post sleuth recounts a scene where Trump tells a top aide to leave the room so ""he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin."" Trump officials now say they're not aware of any such conversations.

The former president granted Woodward 18 taped interviews for his previous book, but they had a falling out after the veteran reporter wrote that Trump was unfit for office - and was sued by his subject for releasing the recordings.

I know Woodward's work extremely well, and while any journalist can be misled by sources, he does not make things up.

Other parts of the book deal with Joe Biden confronting Putin about the coming invasion of Ukraine, had Kamala Harris warn a skeptical Volodomyr Zelenskyy, and - with officials assuming a 50 percent chance that he might use a tactical nuclear weapon against the Ukrainians, called the Kremlin boss the ""epitome of evil.""

The president repeatedly cursed out Bibi Netanyahu, calling him an SOB and, later, a ""f***ing liar"" after the Israeli prime minister invaded the crowded area called Rafah despite American pressure.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

In the statement from Trump's spokesman, which sounds like it was dictated by the boss, Woodward is described as ""a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Woodward is an angry, little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously. President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue. Woodward is a total sleazebag who has lost it mentally, and he's slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality.""

Why stop there?

Trump, who prides himself on being a counter-puncher, wastes little time before swinging away.

After Harris' friendly radio interview with Howard Stern, who said it would be insanity to vote for Trump, this post appeared on Truth Social:

""BETA MALE Howard Stern made a fool of himself on his low-rated radio show when he 'interviewed' Lyin' Kamala Harris, and hit her with so many SOFTBALL questions that even she was embarrassed.

""He looked like a real fool, working so hard to make a totally incompetent and ill-equipped person look as good as possible, which wasn't very good. I dropped Howard a long time ago, like most others, and have since been credited with very good judgment!""

Donald and Howard were, of course, once New York pals, and Trump attended his wedding.

Trump also had campaign manager Chris LaCivita take a swipe at Fox News for covering (along with other networks) a government briefing, featuring both Biden and Harris, on Hurricane Milton as the monster storm was heading toward Florida.

""@FoxNews ⁩just as bad as every other 'cable news' network ...running literally propaganda and @KamalaHarris ⁩TV ads disguised as a news conference,"" Chris LaCivita posted on X.

Of course there's a political benefit for Harris showing that she and FEMA are working hard to prepare for the Florida storm, just as there is when Ron DeSantis holds a presser on the Category 5 threat.

But with Kamala's media blitz finally making some news after weeks in which Trump has dominated the campaign coverage, this reflects his determination to insert himself into every story that surfaces, no matter how negative."

The New York Mets are leaving just about everybody speechless, including Ivanka Trump.

The Mets advanced to the National League Championship Series on Wednesday after their 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the NLDS.

All four runs came on a Francisco Lindor grand slam, because of course they did - he's been their MVP all season long, and some believe he should get the NL vote over Shohei Ohtani.

Nonetheless, Lindor got the party going in Citi Field on Wednesday, and after the game, the daughter of the former president couldn't help but contain her excitement - and all she needed was nine characters.

""OMG! METS"" Trump posted on X.

The interjection could be out of pure excitement, but ""OMG"" has been the team's rallying cry since the summer. Mets infielder Jose Iglesias released a song by the same title, and it's become every Mets fan favorite tune.

After every home run, members of the Mets take a photo with a bright orange sign that says ""OMG.""

FRANCISCO LINDOR'S GRAND SLAM LIFTS METS INTO NLCS AS MAGICAL RIDE CONTINUES

The Trumps are no strangers to the Mets; Donald Trump was at Game 7 of the 2006 National League Championship Series at Shea Stadium and could be seen in many photos right after Carlos Beltran's infamous strikeout.

The Mets are starting to feel like a team of destiny. New York had a chance to be eliminated from postseason contention on the final day of the season, but the Mets split a wild doubleheader to clinch. Then, in their wild-card series, they were two outs away from going home.

Trailing 2-0, Pete Alonso belted a three-run homer. It was the first in MLB history by a player when his team was trailing in the ninth inning or later of a winner-take-all postseason game.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 81 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump has held six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August, including another on Friday after meeting with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about hurricane relief efforts.

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits, a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station, and friendly appearances with ""The View,"" Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

HURRICANE MILTON MAKES LANDFALL, SLAMMING INTO FLORIDA WITH DESTRUCTIVE WINDS, CATASTROPHIC STORMS

JESSE WATTERS: As Hurricane Milton brings biblical damage to Florida Biden came out today and defended his administration's slow response to Hurricane Helene, calling any criticism of it disinformation and pointing fingers at Trump.

Biden is fighting Trump harder than the hurricane. If he should be angry at anybody, he should be angry at his team.

They didn't pre-positioned assets in North Carolina to help in the foothills. Just like Afghanistan and the border, the hurricane is now Trump's fault.

...

They're not worried about what politicians say on TV. They are worried because they haven't seen FEMA all week. Criticizing your government isn't misinformation. It's a God-given right of every American.

32,Progressive journalist unleashes on liberal intolerance that drove her away from Democratic Party,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/progressive-journalist-unleashes-liberal-intolerance-drove-her-away-from-democratic-party,2024-10-10T01:16:40Z,"During a discussion on feminism, progressive pundit for ""The Young Turks,"" Ana Kasparian, took a beat to chastise the left's obsession with identity politics.

""The Young Turks"" co-host Ana Kasparian explained what drove her to ditch the Democratic Party while on Jillian Michaels' ""Keeping It Real"" podcast on Monday.

The progressive media host described feeling ""politically homeless"" over the past few years, as she started seeing an intolerance to debate and the free exchange of ideas as well as an embrace of soft-on-crime policies by the left that she believed were detrimental to society.

She ripped efforts to ""demonize and even dehumanize the other side"" while admitting she used to be a person who believed you could not be friends with conservatives or someone who supported former President Trump. Both women said they identified with disaffected Democrats who now feel unwelcome in their former party.

Kasparian said a turning point for her was when she was scolded by liberals after confessing she was fearful to leave her house after being sexually assaulted by a homeless man while walking her dog in Los Angeles in 2022.

DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE WHO DITCHED PARTY AFTER DNC BLASTS 'HYPOCRISY': 'I DON'T RECOGNIZE THIS PARTY ANYMORE'

""Before I knew it, I started getting these messages, and it's really, really harsh stuff, about how, 'You are painting a picture of the homeless community. How could you be like this? These are your unhoused neighbors and they need help,'"" she said of the negative messages she received.

""A few people accused me of being racist, even though I had never disclosed the race of the individuals who did this to me. And in fact, they were White,"" Kasparian continued.

""That woke me up,"" Kasparian said. ""Some of the people that I've associated myself with because I thought they were the good people....They definitely have stereotypes in their head and are totally blind to the fact that they have those stereotypes and go around accusing others of being bad actors when they themselves need to do the work.""

Kasparian said she also disagreed with the ""defeatist mentality"" shown towards minorities.

FORMER DEMOCRAT TURNS REPUBLICAN: KAMALA HARRIS 'DID NOTHING TO CHANGE THE SCHOOLS' IN CALIFORNIA

""At some point last year, the other thing that really hit me was the difference between my upbringing and what the Democratic Party espouses,"" Kasparian said.

She described being raised by ""very tough"" parents who taught her to work hard to be self-sufficient and create her own opportunities. While she acknowledged there are obstacles today that some younger people are facing that older generations may not have had to face, she still sees America as a land of opportunity, which she said goes against messaging from the Democratic Party.

""However, we all get to wake up in the morning and make choices for ourselves. And when I hear the Democratic Party constantly disempower people of color, because that's what they're doing,"" she said.

""They keep using this messaging that infantilizes them and makes them seem as though, you know, if it weren't for us White saviors, messing around with these laws and policies, they would never be able to survive. And I find that so gross,"" she continued.

CALIFORNIA EXODUS CONTINUES AS CONSERVATIVE STATES ATTRACT BLUE-STATE RESIDENTS: REPORT

Kasparian gave examples of how a Los Angeles school district scrapped its honor student program because there wasn't enough Hispanic students enrolled in the program.

""That p---d me off,"" Kasparian said. ""It's doing away with an opportunity rather than seeing what the flaws are in our education system and then rising to the occasion to help these students, where we do see the disparity, to get to where we want them to be. That's the right way to approach it. But there's just this weird defeatist mentality. And I'm honestly also very sick of White people going around being offended on behalf of marginalized people.""

""They're just virtue signaling. It's disgusting,"" Michaels agreed.

""We should celebrate people who want to better themselves and better their lives,"" Kasparian said later in a discussion about the ""fat-acceptance"" movement on the far-left.

""Instead, there's this effort to basically tell people, 'you're fine the way you are, you don't need to change a thing,' even if that thing is slowly killing you. It doesn't make any sense,"" she continued.

The pair also said they've seen their home state of California become ""crazy"" over time from when they were growing up.

Michaels, who left California in 2021, has previously shared how the deep blue state's soft-on crime policies drove her and her family to leave and move to Miami.

""Nothing was crazy like this right?"" Michaels told Kasparian. ""Homelessness, crime, advocating for medicalization of children, advocating for late-term abortion?""

Gov. Gavin Newsom is leading the ""madness"" in the state, Michaels said. ""The concern is that it goes from California to a federal problem.""

""Unfortunately, some of the failed policies we've started here have been exported to other states,"" Kasparian agreed.

Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment, but did not immediately hear back."

JD Vance, R-Ohio, rallied supporters in Tucson, Arizona, on Wednesday, the same day early voting began in the battleground state.

The Republican vice presidential nominee's message Wednesday underscored the Trump campaign's ""America First"" agenda, insisting to rallygoers that putting Americans first is the essence of why politicians exist in the first place.

""This country ought to work for the American people and the American people first,"" Vance said. ""We can have compassion for people ... by all means, we ought to be compassionate. But you know who our leaders owe compassion to most and above all? It's American citizens. We ought to focus on our own people and put their interests first.""

ARIZONA BEGINS IN-PERSON AND ABSENTEE VOTING, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Vance pointed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) administration of funds to migrants for housing and relocation purposes. The roughly $1.7 billion was approved by members on both sides of the aisle in Congress and allowed a slice of FEMA's funding to go to helping states and localities deal with the ongoing migrant crisis.

Simultaneously, FEMA's disaster relief fund, which is entirely separate from the program helping migrants, has continued to receive funding to the tune of nearly $244 billion, ProPublica reported.

""Disaster relief ought to go to prepare and to respond to a disaster when it strikes American territory. Our government has got to focus on our citizens, put their interests first, take care of American citizens when a disaster hits,"" Vance said. ""Unfortunately, under Kamala Harris's leadership, you've got FEMA, which is doing resettlement and relocation for illegal immigration.

""FEMA should take care of American citizens when a disaster strikes. That's all it should be doing. And when Donald Trump and I are back in office, that's all it's going to do.""

SWING STATE GOP CHAIR SLAMS BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN FOR BEING OUT OF TOUCH ON KEY ISSUE: 'ABANDONED THIS COUNTRY'

At Wednesday's rally, held at Tucson Speedway, Vance was joined by his wife, Usha, former national security adviser under Trump, Robert O'Brien, RNC Chair Michael Whatley and Arizona GOP Chair Gina Swoboda.

Vance implored people to get out and vote early if they have to, despite past criticisms from both him and Trump about early voting. Vance hearkened back to 2020, when, according to Vance, people who were going to vote for Trump on Election Day could not because of unforeseen circumstances.

NEW POLL REVEALS WHICH VOTER GROUP ARE FUELING TRUMP TO A NARROW EDGE OVER HARRIS IN BATTLEGROUND

""I don't like election season. I like Election Day. But we are where we are, my friends,"" Vance said. ""We've got an election season, and if the Democrats are taking advantage of it, we've got to do the exact same thing. So whether you're voting on Election Day, or voting by mail or voting early, get out there and make your voice heard.

""I talked to a lot of people who planned to vote for Donald Trump in 2020, and 95 out of 100 of them actually went out and voted for Donald Trump. But you talk to the five who didn't vote for Donald Trump, and it's not because they changed their mind, it's because ... their kid got sick, so they had to go pick him up from school, or they worked late that night and weren't able to make it to the polls before they closed. The best way to make sure your voice is counted is to make sure it's counted early.""

A majority of states have already begun early voting by mail and in person.

Montana has seen the largest percentage of registered voters request absentee ballots. Biden won Arizona in 2020, but Trump won the state in 2016.

Following Wednesday's rally, Vance headed to the Mesa, outside Phoenix, for a town hall hosted by the Conservative Political Action Conference.

""The worst hurricane response since Katrina,"" the former president said as he pointed to the much-maligned initial federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was heavily criticized for being slow and ineffective.

Trump, at a campaign event in battleground Pennsylvania, spoke as an extremely powerful and dangerous Hurricane Milton was hours away from slamming into Florida, and as the death toll rises and more than 100,000 people remain without power or running water nearly two weeks after Hurricane Helene tore a path of destruction through the southeastern United States.

BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA

With less than four weeks to go until Election Day in November, Trump and Harris are locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene - North Carolina and Georgia - among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election, the politics of federal disaster relief are again front and center on the campaign trail.

EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Trump for nearly two weeks has repeatedly attacked Biden and Harris and accused them of being incompetent.

""She's just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina,"" Trump said as he lobbed another political bomb at the vice president. ""The worst ever, they say.""

And the former president once again made false claims that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) diverted money intended for disaster relief and spent it on undocumented migrants in the U.S. as he turned up the volume on his inflammatory rhetoric over the combustible issue of illegal immigration.

""You know where they gave the money to: illegal immigrants coming,"" Trump said as the crowd of MAGA supporters loudly booed.

A couple of hours earlier, as the president and vice president received their latest briefing from FEMA and other federal agencies on storm preparations in Florida and relief efforts across the Southeast, Biden said that ""we have made available an unprecedented number of assets to deal with this crisis, and we're going to continue to do so until the job is done.""

And the president had a message for his predecessor in the White House.

""Over the last few weeks, there has been a reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies that are disturbing people. It's undermining confidence in the incredible rescue and recovery work that has already been taken and will continue to be taken, and it's harmful to those who need help the most. There is simply no place for this to happen.""

And pointing to the Republican presidential nominee, he said ""former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies. Assertions have been made that property is being confiscated. That's simply not true.""

Biden said rhetoric from Trump and other Republicans was ""beyond ridiculous"" and that ""it's got to stop.""

""In moments like this, there are no red or blue states. There's one United States of America where neighbors are helping neighbors. Volunteers and first responders are risking everything, including their own lives, to help their fellow Americans; state, local and federal officials are standing side by side,"" the president said.

Harris, who in July replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, had a similar message during an interview Wednesday on the Weather Channel.

""This is not a time for us to just point fingers at each other as Americans,"" Harris said. ""Anybody who considers themselves to be a leader should really be in the business right now of giving people a sense of confidence that we're all working together and that we have the resources and the ability to work together on their behalf, on behalf of the people of our country. And that's what I'm focused on.""

Earlier this week, Harris and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida traded fire over whether he ignored hurricane-related calls from her.

But when it comes to the federal response, DeSantis, along with other Republican governors in the storm-affected region, had no complaints about the federal assistance.

The governor reiterated those comments Tuesday morning in an interview on ""Fox and Friends.""

""Every request that we've made - I've been in contact with the president, I've been in contact with the FEMA director. All of our requests have been answered,"" DeSantis said.

Democrat Angela Alsobrooks holds a healthy lead over Republican Larry Hogan in Maryland's 2024 U.S. Senate contest, according to a UMBC poll.

The survey was conducted Sept. 23 to Sept. 28. When asked who they would vote for if the Senate contest ""were held today,"" 48% of likely Maryland voters picked Prince George's County Executive Alsobrooks, while just 39% picked former Gov. Hogan, according to the poll.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, has endorsed Alsobrooks' Senate bid.

MARYLAND DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE SAYS THERE SHOULD BE NO LIMIT ON ABORTION

GOP Presidential nominee Donald Trump told Fox News earlier this year that he would like Hogan to win the Senate race. And when asked whether he was endorsing Hogan, Trump replied, ""Essentially I would be endorsing him, yeah.""

But Hogan indicated that he was not interested in the former president's endorsement, saying during an interview with WTOP, ""I didn't seek it, I didn't wanna have it, and I have no interest in it.""

Hogan has never voted for Trump and has said that he will not vote for Trump in 2024. In 2016, Hogan wrote in his father Larry Hogan Sr., and in 2020, he wrote in the late President Ronald Reagan.

Hogan has said that as a senator, he would support legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into law. Roe was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022.

He has also indicated that he would not support confirmation of Supreme Court nominees who cannot earn bipartisan support.

""Today, I made a commitment to Maryland that, as Senator, I will only vote for nominees who can earn support from both sides of the aisle,"" the moderate Republican noted in a recent post on X. ""If there's one place that we should not be playing politics, it's appointments to the Supreme Court and the cabinet.

Maryland consistently goes to Democrats during presidential elections. The last Republican to win the state in a presidential contest was George H.W. Bush, who won Maryland in 1988.

The trend appears likely to continue in 2024.

Asked who they would cast their ballot for if the election ""were held today,"" 57% of Maryland likely voters chose Harris while just 35% picked Trump, according to the poll.

""There is a 95 percent probability that the survey results have the following percentage point sampling error from the actual population distribution for any given survey question,"" the poll notes, listing a +/- 3.3% margin of sampling error for the sample of 863 likely Maryland voters."

Democrats are worried about the state of the 2024 presidential race and fear the election could be a repeat of 2016, according to a new report.

Sources close to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign reportedly told CNN that Democrats were panicked because polls have largely remained stagnant with less than four weeks to go until the election.

""People are nervous. They know the polls are tight,"" one source told CNN. ""A lot of us are having these flashbacks to 2016 too. We know when it can go the wrong way, and it can still feel fresh.""

On the liberal network on Wednesday, CNN reporter Priscilla Alvarez discussed her conversations with Democratic insiders close to the Harris campaign who are worried that the race remains deadlocked, despite the campaign's efforts to reach more voters.

""This has been a campaign that was described by multiple Democrats, allies, aides to the vice president as a good vibes campaign. But what's also creeping in now is that anxiety,"" Alvarez explained. ""The reason for that is because these polls are not really moving. Despite multiple battleground blitzes, despite the opportunities she has had across media outlets, there is still not a lot of movement from voters who are moving more towards her versus former President Donald Trump.""

The Harris campaign is trying to address pitfalls from Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign in its outreach to red, rural districts that Clinton lost in that election, like Cambria County, Pennsylvania, Alvarez explained.

""The vice president has already visited twice. And so that is the type of strategy that they're trying to deploy to try to make up that ground where they saw Hillary Clinton wasn't able to in 2016. Then, too, there's the mobilizing. Talking to Democrats, they're always pretty boastful about their ground game and they continue to be so, but that needs to turn into votes. So certainly some anxiety and nerves setting in as Election Day gets closer and those polls just remain deadlocked,"" she continued.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.

Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, a former staffer for Harris, also commented on anxiety swirling around the vice president's campaign in comments to The Hill on Wednesday.

""Everything is deadlocked and the composition of the electorate is unknowable, and there are so many things that are unprecedented,"" Simmons, who formerly served as Harris' communications director, said.

""We can't look back with any level of security because we haven't had an African American woman on the ticket. We haven't had a former president running again. We haven't had a campaign with two assassination attempts. We haven't switched out a candidate two months before Election Day before,"" he added.

""So it's just hard to know,"" Simmons continued. ""If you're not nervous, you're not paying attention.""

Political analyst Mark Halperin characterized the Harris campaign as an ""experiment"" that's encountering issues, during his livestream show on Wednesday.

""In the conversations I'm having with Trump people and Democrats with data, they are extremely bullish on Trump's chances in the last 48 hours. Extremely bullish,"" Halperin said.

""Can you win a short campaign with an untested candidate? And what I'm telling you is happening in private polling is she's got a problem now,"" he said.

According to the latest Fox News poll from September, Harris tops Trump by two points nationally, which is a three-point shift in her direction since August.

Former first lady Melania Trump has been an advocate for the LGBT community, but where she draws the line is biological men competing in women's sports.

The 54-year-old model and mother spoke out against transgender inclusion in women's sports in an excerpt of her new memoir ""Melania,"" which released on Tuesday. She called the premise of biological men competing in women's sports ""unfair,"" due to natural physical advantages that males hold over females in terms of strength and speed.

""Male bodies generally have physical advantages - muscle strength, height, bone density, and lung capacity - that can affect fairness in competition, even at the high school level,"" she wrote. ""High school athletes often dedicate years to training with the hope of being recruited by universities. Seeing that dream collapse is an unnecessary and avoidable consequence.""

The former first lady also spoke out against groups that are advocating for transgender inclusion in women's sports, and condemned their ideologies.

""Today, some groups attempt to impose their ideologies on everyone, deepening the divisions in our society. One example is the ongoing debate over trans inclusion in sports, specifically when male-born athletes who identify as female compete against women,"" she wrote. ""Some argue that the number of trans-athletes is low, but even one can upset the balance in a female league or tournament due to these physical advantages.""

More than anything, Trump wants what is best for women's athletes. This includes their protection and privacy from men in locker rooms, as well as their financial well-being as their earnings could be impacted by competing against biological males.

""I fully support the LGBTQIA+ community. But we must also ensure that our female athletes are protected and respected,"" she wrote. ""This issue also has broader implications, including the loss of future earning potential as professional athletes and a potential setback for equal pay in sports.""

Her husband, former President Trump, has been a vocal opponent of transgender inclusion in women's sports for years, and has even made it a part of his policy agenda in the upcoming election.

Trump re-affirmed his stance in late August at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty - a national nonprofit that has spearheaded efforts to keep LGBT identity and critical race theory out of classrooms. The former president preached at the event that transgender women should not be allowed to play in women's sports and said access to gender-affirming health care should be restricted.

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

The Trump campaign launched a series of ads attacking Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, during NFL football this past Sunday, focused on her stance on transgender inclusion. The ads all contained the slogan ""Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.""

In April, the Biden administration issued a sweeping rule that said Title IX's ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions.""

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and, for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person's gender identity. The Biden administration insisted that the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that Biden's claims that it would not result in biological men participating in women's sports weren't true and that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

The Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject a Biden emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule that includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX, after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general sued to block the Title IX changes in their own states.

Trump invited former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines to his rally in Glendale, Arizona, on Aug. 23. Gaines has testified in Georgia about her experience competing against and sharing a locker room with a biological male, Lia Thomas, alongside four other NCAA All-American women athletes in the 2022 NCAA championships. The women filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in March alleging the association knowingly violated Title IX in allowing Thomas to compete.

Gaines lambasted Democrats for their positions on multiple gender identity issues at the event, including transgender inclusion in women's sports.

""They don't believe in school choice; they don't believe in parental rights or the safeguarding of children; they don't believe in freedom unless it's the freedom to have an abortion or chemically and surgically castrate children,"" she said. ""You have one ticket that knows what a woman is and has vowed to take decisive action at protecting our sex-based rights, compared to the other ticket that thinks men can become pregnant and that tampons belong in boys' bathrooms."""

Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney won't endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president despite his outspoken criticisms of former President Trump.

""I've made it very clear that I don't want Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States,"" Romney said on Tuesday at the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah, the New York Times reported.

""I want to continue to have a voice in the Republican Party following this election. I think there's a good chance that the Republican Party is going to need to be rebuilt or reoriented,"" he later added during the political forum.

Romney announced last year that he would not seek re-election as a senator representing the Beehive State, and will leave office in January. The Republican has long criticized Trump, and indicated in June that he was unlikely to support the 45th president's re-election.

""With President Trump, it's a matter of personal character,"" Romney told CNN at the time. ""I draw a line and say when someone has been actually found to have been sexually assaulted, that's something I just won't cross over in the person I wouldn't want to have as president of the United States."" Romney's comments referred to a federal jury's decision in New York City last year, which ruled Trump was not liable for the rape of E. Jean Carroll, though the former president was liable for sexual abuse and defamation.

Romney has also slammed Trump for Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of the then-president breached the U.S. Capitol, arguing Trump incited an insurrection due to his ""injured pride"" over the 2020 election. Romney subsequently was one of seven Republican members of the Senate who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6.

Romney was also the only Republican who voted to impeach Trump in 2020 over abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges. Trump was acquitted in both impeachment cases, and is the only president in history who was impeached twice and acquitted twice.

Trump has also hit back at Romney, saying in 2020 that the Utah senator ""can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency,"" referring to his 2012 bid for the White House, and calling him a ""disgrace"" that same year for voting to impeach.

Though Romney has previously broken with the GOP on other key issues, he indicated Tuesday that he will not offer his endorsement to Harris despite other Republicans recently throwing their support behind the vice president. Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney officially endorsed Harris last week and joined her on the campaign trail in Wisconsin, while former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake also endorsed Harris.

Fox News Digital reached out to Romney's office for additional comment on the matter, but did not immediately receive a reply.

Vice President Kamala Harris is facing growing pressure from within her own party to lift the Biden administration's pause on liquified natural gas (LNG) exports amid growing fears that the moratorium could cost the Democratic Party presidential nominee the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania -- a natural gas powerhouse.

Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes are considered critical to winning the White House. Its reputation as a slightly left-leaning swing state, which former President Donald Trump carried by a razor-thin margin of just 0.7% in 2016, is complicated somewhat by its status as a major producer of fossil fuels.

""It's obvious that the pathway to the presidency goes through Pennsylvania,"" Amanda Eversole, the chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute, told Fox News Digital.

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN PENNSYLVANIA

The chorus of Democrats now criticizing the moratorium is something of an about-face from January, when the Biden administration first ordered its temporary halt on new LNG exports, citing a need to better evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of such projects.

Now, nine months later and less than a month away from Election Day, Harris is under pressure from some Democrat lawmakers and industry leaders to lift the pause completely.

Critics of the pause argue that removing or delaying U.S. LNG supplies from the market deprives European buyers of a cleaner, lower-emission form of energy -- forcing some countries to turn to Russian gas or coal instead.

It could also affect U.S. relationships, American energy leadership and investments in massive domestic projects in the years ahead.

Pennsylvania is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the U.S., behind Texas. Its gas reserves are contained behind shale rock and must be extracted by fracking -- a technology viewed as controversial at best by many on the left and one that Harris has only recently endorsed.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: THE BIGGEST SURPRISES COME AFTER OCTOBER

The fossil fuel industry supports more than 423,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, and contributes more than $75 billion to its economy, according to estimates from PwC. Therefore, the future of the LNG industry carries outsize importance to most voters, industry group leaders and former DOE officials told Fox News in a series of interviews.

In fact, Pennsylvania's Democratic Senate delegation, Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman, were among the first lawmakers to criticize the LNG pause following Biden's announcement earlier this year. Their counterparts in the House have also followed suit as they seek reelection in competitive districts.

Meanwhile, Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate hoping to flip Casey's seat this fall, has lambasted the Democrat incumbent for failing to do enough to protect energy interests in the state. A spokesperson for Casey's office pointed Fox News to the senator's earlier letters and remarks opposing the LNG pause.

A recent poll published by API this month found that 85% of voters in Pennsylvania wanted to hear more from both Harris and Trump about their energy polices.

To date, Harris has declined to comment on whether she will lift the LNG pause, and neither the campaign nor the White House responded to Fox News' requests for comment.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

If Harris does intend to break with Biden or push for an end to the pause and unleash more production, API's Eversole said Harris needs to make that clear -- and fast.

""If she, in fact, is going to be different from the Biden administration,"" Eversole said, ""then specifically how?""

Rhetoric, she said, is not enough. Especially when private investors in the U.S. have also backed out of some projects in recent months, citing regulatory uncertainty.

According to surveys from Quinnipiac University, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, holds a 49% to 46% advantage over Trump, the Republican standard-bearer, in Pennsylvania.

But the former president edges the vice president 50% to 47% in Michigan and 48% to 46% in Wisconsin.

Harris' three-point edge in Pennsylvania is down from a six-point lead in Quinnipiac's previous survey from a month ago.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SHOW

The results in Michigan, where Trump's up by three points, are a switch from last month, when Quinnipiac's survey indicated Harris leading by five points.

And in Wisconsin, where the new poll gives the former president a two-point edge, it's a slight change from September, when the vice president held a one-point edge.

""That was then, this is now. The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.

Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, along with Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided President Biden's 2020 White House victory over Trump. And the seven states are likely to determine if Trump or Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.

Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are also the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called ""Blue Wall.""

The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.

Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states by razor-thin margins to put them back in the Democrats' column and defeat Trump.

Both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, as well as their running mates, have made repeated stops in the three states this summer.

Trump is holding campaign events Wednesday in Scranton and Reading, Pennsylvania. And Harris returns to Pennsylvania early next week for a stop in Erie.

Both candidates have also campaigned in Michigan and Wisconsin over the past few days.

All three states are also holding crucial Senate elections that will likely determine if the GOP wins back the chamber's majority.

In Pennsylvania, the Quinnipiac University poll indicates Democratic Sen. Bob Casey leads Republican challenger Dave McCormick 51% to 43%.

According to the survey, in the race to succeed Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and former Rep. Mike Rogers are deadlocked at 48%.

And in Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin edges Republican challenger Eric Hovde 50% to 46%, the poll indicates.

The Quinnipiac University polls were conducted Oct. 3-7, with 1,412 likely voters in Pennsylvania, 1,007 likely voters in Michigan and 1,073 likely voters in Wisconsin questioned.

The sampling error in Pennsylvania is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. In Michigan, it's plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. And, in Wisconsin, it's plus or minus 3 percentage points."

JD Vance's Midwestern roots can help former President Donald Trump win rust belt battlegrounds like Michigan.

Voters in a critical county in the swing state of Michigan believe that Ohio Sen. JD Vance's Midwestern roots help him appeal to people in Michigan, even if the Republican nominee for vice president is a graduate of a hated rival.

""Besides being a Buckeyes fan, he's got a good story. He grew up kind of truly in poverty and was able to overcome that,"" one voter in Detroit told Fox News Digital ahead of a Vance event in the city Tuesday, adding that Vance's story shows how people can accomplish the ""American Dream.""

The comments come as the presidential election hits the home stretch, with the venue event in Detroit coming exactly four weeks before Election Day. Michigan figures to play a key role in determining the eventual winner, having narrowly gone for former President Donald Trump in 2016 before another close race swung the state to President Biden in 2020.

MELANIA TRUMP ADMITS SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S SAFETY AS NOVEMBER ELECTION LOOMS: 'TOXIC ATMOSPHERE'

The 2024 version of the race is shaping up to be close again, with the Real Clear Politics polling average showing Vice President Kamala Harris with a slim 0.5 point lead over Trump as of Wednesday.

Wayne County, which includes Detroit and is Michigan's most populous county, could play a key role in determining who emerges with the victory in the state.

While the county has traditionally supported Democratic candidates, Republicans have made inroads with voters in Wayne County since Trump's 2016 campaign. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, captured just over 26% of the vote in the county during his 2012 campaign, while the late Sen. John McCain was only able to capture just under 25% during his 2008 White House bid. But Trump has performed better during his two runs, garnering over 29% and over 30% of the vote in Wayne County in 2016 and 2020.

The Trump campaign is hoping its appeal to working class voters will help it make even more inroads with Wayne County voters, a strategy that Vance is at the center of.

""I think that JD Vance is an incredible statesman, effective communicator,"" one voter attending the rally told Fox News Digital, adding that the Ohio Senator's Ohio roots also help shore ""up support in the Midwestern states.""

""He kind of gets the concerns of the country people. Smart as a whip. He knows tech,"" the voter said.

""Absolutely, even though Ohio and Michigan have a rivalry,"" another voter said when asked if Vance's roots help him in Michigan. ""I know that the Midwest Rust Belt states feel very strongly about Vance and of course about Trump.""

""JD Vance is a gentleman. He's energetic. He certainly is a patriot. He served in the Marines for four years... He's really proved that he is a true American,"" the voter added.

""I don't know about them U of M fans. I don't know how deep that Buckeye traditions go,"" another voter quipped, adding that at the end of the day he believes people from Ohio and Michigan are similar and that they will ""come together.""

Other voters in Detroit praised Vance's demeanor, arguing that he provided a contrast to his more brash running mate.

""He is very well balanced and he's younger, and he comes from a different upbringing than Trump,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""He's engaging... He's got great points.""

""JD Vance brings us a lot of great common-sense thinking. He can formulate his answers a lot better than I could,"" another voter said. ""He can bring the facts to the case so we can bring more people to the table."""
43,Biden and Netanyahu speak after report US president called Israeli counterpart a 'bad f---ing guy',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-netanyahu-speak-after-report-us-president-called-israeli-counterpart-bad-fing-guy,2024-10-09T19:42:31Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst provides details on Israel's air strike that killed Hashem Safieddine, the likely successor to slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone on Wednesday for the first time in more than 50 days.

It came after fresh tensions emerged in their relationship: Netanyahu refused to approve his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's trip to the U.S. on Tuesday until Biden called him.

The call came together in short order after that.

Netanyahu spoke with former President Trump earlier Wednesday before he spoke with Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the call along with the president.

It comes as Israel has been weighing its options to retaliate for the barrage of missiles Iran fired toward the Jewish state last week.

Gallant warned on Wednesday the Israeli response was sure to catch Iran by surprise.

""As we have shown until now in this war and in all arenas - whoever attacks Israel will pay a price. Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all - surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,"" he told the IDF's intelligence unit in a briefing.

Biden has warned Netanyahu to make sure his response is ""proportional"" and to avoid hitting Iran's nuclear facilities.

The longtime relationship between the two men soured in the months that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.

Further indication of their mutual disdain came on the one-year anniversary of the attacks, when Biden called Israeli President Isaac Herzog over Netanyahu.

HOPE FADES FOR A DEAL TO BRING HOSTAGES HOME

Since the world leaders' last call, Israel has launched an aggressive offensive operation in Lebanon, and successfully taken out top Hezbollah leadership over a short timeframe.

Israeli airstrikes killed the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and now his successor too, according to Netanyahu.

Netanyahu is also known to be distrusting of his defense minister, who he's tried to fire twice. Gallant has publicly criticized Netanyahu for not articulating a postwar plan for Gaza.

In a particularly heated April phone call, Biden asked Netanyahu, ""What's your strategy, man?"" according to Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward in his new book, ""War.""

Netanyahu, at the time, said Israel had to go into Rafah, a Gaza-Egypt border city, that he claimed to be a Hamas stronghold.

""Bibi, you've got no strategy,"" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, who he also allegedly claimed ""doesn't give a damn"" about Hamas and ""only about himself.""

After Israel entered Rafah, Biden said of Netanyahu: ""He's a f---ing liar.""

""That son of a b----, Bibi Netanyahu, he's a bad guy,"" said Biden privately, according to Woodward. ""He's a bad f---ing guy!""

Biden said he felt, in Woodward's accounting, that Netanyahu ""had been lying to him regularly."" With Netanyahu ""continuing to say he was going to kill every last member of Hamas."" Woodward wrote, ""Biden had told him that was impossible, threatening both privately and publicly to withhold offensive U.S. weapons shipments."""

In the second quarter of a game Monday night, nine-time Pro Bowler Travis Kelce grabbed one of his nine catches on the night. Aikman, the ""Monday Night Football"" analyst, proceeded to praise Kelce for the reception.

But as the television cameras switched to a shot of Taylor Swift, who has been dating Kelce for a little over a year, Aikman offered some additional color about the couple.

""The missus likes it,"" he said.

Aikman's longtime broadcasting partner, Joe Buck, corrected Aikman, telling him they're not married. The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback then joked that he was sure he was ""in trouble for saying that.""

Aikman may or may not have a scoop on the superstars' relationship.

""Someone reached out to me and said they might actually be engaged. I might have broke the story,"" Aikman told TMZ Sports earlier this week.

TMZ later reported that the couple is not engaged.

""It's not true, and the recent erratic and unfounded speculation on this couple is just proving that media and overzealous fans do not know what's going on with them and shouldn't make wild assumptions based on zero facts,"" a source told the outlet. ""Two days ago, everyone had decided they were broken up. Now they're allegedly secretly engaged? It's whiplash-inducing.""

Swift attended the Monday night contest, a 26-13 victory for Kansas City, which improved to 5-0 in its quest for a three-peat.

Kelce had a slow start but is getting back in a groove. In his first three games, he caught just eight passes for 68 yards, but in his last two, he caught 16 passes for 159 yards. He still has not scored a touchdown.

Last season was Kelce's first since 2015 in which he did not eclipse the 1,000-yard mark, although he was absent for two games. He finished with 984 yards and made his ninth consecutive Pro Bowl.

Swift has been to two Chiefs games this year, both of which were at Arrowhead Stadium. Swift and Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Patrick Mahomes, were spotted in a suite together after they attended the first game separately. Many thought there was a possible rift between the two due to assumed political beliefs. Swift has publicly endorsed Harris, while Mahomes has seemingly shown support for Trump.

It should be noted, though, that Patrick and Brittany and Kelce and Swift were in a suite together for the men's U.S. Open final just three days after the Chiefs' season opener.

""I want to do what President Trump's asking us to do, to swamp your vote, because we want everybody across the country and in the state of Ohio to get out there and vote early so that their voices, their votes are locked in, then the campaign can then move on to make sure that they're focusing resources on people who may not have gotten out and voted,"" Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted told Fox News Digital at the Franklin County Board of Elections on Tuesday as he voted on the first day of early voting.

""It's a really important part of the campaign strategy.""

The former president's 2024 campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced earlier this year the launch of what they call their ""Swamp the Vote USA"" effort, which was a shift from 2020, when Trump spoke in opposition to early-in-person voting and mail-in ballots.

""Whether you vote absentee, by mail, early in person, or on Election Day -- We will Secure Your Vote,"" Trump posted online at the time. ""JUST VOTE! They are all good options. The way to win is to Swamp Them with Votes!""

Republican voters are typically known for voting on Election Day, while Democrats often have the advantage when it comes to early voting efforts. Husted told Fox News Digital that people should vote in whatever way they are most comfortable, but encouraged early voting.

""If you want to vote on Election Day, that's fine,"" Husted said. ""But we're encouraging those who are willing to vote early because once the campaigns know you voted, they can devote their resources to turning out people who haven't voted. The system of elections here in Ohio is a place where we make it easy to vote and hard to cheat and when you get that done early, you can know that the system is working for you and that you can encourage your friends and neighbors to go out and get it done.""

Husted continued, ""I think it's really important that Republicans don't let Democrats get the lead through early voting. Think about this. If you vote early, then if something comes up on Election Day, there's a hurricane that hits you, a storm that happens, something might get in the way of you getting to the polls. When you do it early, you ensure that your vote happens, that it's going to be there, it's going to get counted, and something doesn't get in the way between now and Election Day.""

Although Ohio is no longer viewed as the battleground state it was for many years for presidential elections, the Buckeye State is home to several critical House races and a Senate race that could potentially shift the balance of power in Congress.

Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno, running as a Republican in that Senate race against incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown, rallied supporters outside the Franklin County Board of Elections on Tuesday and also pushed Trump's ""Swamp the Vote"" plan.

A spokesperson for the Franklin County Board of Elections told Fox News Digital that over 4,000 Ohioans voted early at the Columbus voting site on Tuesday.

""The election is down to the hands of the voters and regardless if you want to support me or my opponent, President Trump or Kamala Harris, it's your civic duty to show up and vote,"" Moreno said. ""Our elections in Ohio are secure. They're safe. On Nov. 5, we'll have an outcome and everybody will agree on that outcome. I encourage everybody to vote early. Bank that vote.

We don't have to text you, email you, knock on your door - if that alone doesn't motivate you. But look, at the end of the day, here's a very simple equation where we're at right now. You vote for me, for Bernie Moreno, for the United States Senate, and your vote for me is a vote to fire Sherrod Brown.

Democratic strategist James Carville urged his party to move on from Jan. 6 discussions during an interview on Wednesday, and focus on more pertinent things like attacking GOP vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance.

""They need to sell harder. We need to really sell because you've got all of this disinformation ... and they've got to selectively pick out what it is that they want to talk about. We've talked about January 6th ad infinitum, ad nauseam,"" Carville said on MSNBC. ""We've been talking about who won the election. Leave it alone.""

Carville specifically suggested Democrats focus on Vance's comments from the vice presidential debate, where he argued that Trump ""salvaged"" the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while he was president. Trump and Republican allies made several efforts to repeal the ACA, also known as Obamacare.

""Have Obama come out and say, how dare he say this about our healthcare plan,"" Carville said.

""I think the Liz Cheney, the Dick Cheney stuff, all these national security people coming out, I think that helps,"" he said. ""I really do.""

During his ""Politics War Room"" podcast earlier this month, Carville said Harris should be going after Vance and Trump for the Obamacare comments. He called Vance's claim ""an out-and-out lie,"" repeatedly asking why Harris herself wasn't out in the media talking about it.

Mahomes is pregnant with her third child with NFL star Patrick Mahomes. The quarterback's wife posted a photo on Instagram on Wednesday that shows Swift rubbing her pregnant belly. The photo was taken at the Chiefs game against the New Orleans Saints on Monday night.

""Same girls, new bump,"" the caption on the post read.

It was the first time Mahomes and Swift were seen together at a Chiefs game this season.

It was also the first time that the pair had been seen together at all since Swift publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 10.

Swift did not list any specific policy stance for her endorsement of Harris in her Instagram post. However, in the past, Swift has advocated for abortion, LGBT rights and gun control in multiple interviews, including one with The Guardian in 2019 when she said she believed in telling people who to vote for, despite not watching the news for the sake of her ""mental health.""

Swift has endorsed Democratic candidates dating back to 2018, when she endorsed Democratic candidates Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections in Tennessee.

Swift's support for Harris prompted a vocal response from former President Donald Trump, who Mahomes has been tied to supporting. Trump posted a message to his Truth Social platform that read ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,"" on Sept. 15, and in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" on Sept. 11, the former president said he ""liked Mahomes much better"" than Swift.

Swift had not been seen in the same room as Mahomes since they were at the U.S. Open men's singles final on Sept 9, when they were seen hugging, until Monday night.

Mahomes had been linked to multiple displays of supporting Trump via social media activity dating back to mid-August.

It started with a simple Instagram like of Trump's 2024 policy platform on Aug. 13. Images of the like were rapidly spread around social media channels, inciting backlash so fierce the pregnant mother posted additional statements to defend herself and her beliefs. Mahomes later liked a comment that said ""TRUMP-VANCE 2024"" on one of her Instagram posts.

Multiple online Swift fan pages contributed to spreading screenshots of Mahomes' initial like of Trump's policy platform, inciting much of the backlash against Swift's friend.

Mahomes' husband Patrick defended and commended her political influence after Trump praised her over Swift on Sept. 11.

""I think you see Brittany does a lot in the community,"" the 28-year-old QB said. ""I do a lot in the community to help bring people up and give people an opportunity to use their voice,"" he said. ""In political times, people are going to use stuff here and there, but I can't let that affect how I go about my business every single day of my life and trying to live it to the best of my ability.""

Patrick himself said he would not endorse a political candidate, but he encouraged Americans to do what is right for ""their families.""

BRETT FAVRE BACKS PATRICK MAHOMES ON PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT STANCE AMID TRUMP VS. TAYLOR SWIFT CONTROVERSY

""At the end of the day, it's about me and my family and how we treat other people,"" he said.

Brittany and Patrick were born and raised in east Texas and started dating when they attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas. Whitehouse is a town with a population of about 8,500 and has a history of voting Republican, according to Data USA. The couple got married in March 2022 and have two children, 3-year-old daughter Sterling Skye and 1-year-old son Patrick ""Bronze"" Lavon Mahomes III.

Shortly after the scrutiny began about Brittany liking Trump's Instagram content, Patrick wished her a happy birthday on Aug. 31.

On a recent episode of the ""Whoop"" podcast, Brittany said she has leaned on her three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback husband to get her through the recent public scrutiny.

""Having him to help me get through it has helped a lot because he is very good at managing those things and blocking people out and doing all that type of stuff,"" she said. ""Having him beside me and kind of guiding me, coaching me through it has helped a ton. I think that's kind of gotten to where we are at now.

""I think the main thing he always told me is like, 'Stop caring about what people think, especially the people that don't even know you,'"" she said. ""And so I think social media used to get me a lot, and now it's just like, honestly, I don't give a f--- about what people have to say about me anymore.""

Meanwhile, Swift's boyfriend and Patrick's teammate Travis Kelce has not made an endorsement in the upcoming election either, nor has he commented on her political stances or his own since Swift's endorsement.

However, in March, Kelce told the Los Angeles Times he and Swift shared values after they started dating just a few months earlier, both at the age of 33.

Pennsylvania is suffering from a ""liberal myopia,"" fueling an exodus from the Democratic Party as more voters flee to the GOP, one Pittsburgh business owner told Fox News on Wednesday.

""We're suffering from a liberal myopia. They can't see the crime. They can't see the vacancies on the buildings. They can't see the crumbling infrastructure. And downtown Pittsburgh, we have the largest homeless encampment in the tri-state area,"" Rich Cupka, who owns Cupka's Cafe in the Steel City, told ""Fox & Friends First.""

He appeared alongside two other voters from the Keystone State, a hotly-contested battleground zone up for grabs between Trump and Harris, with polls indicating no clear winner. With just under four weeks until voters cast their ballots, its political attitudes on the ground are in focus.

The sentiment draws on a recent article from The Philadelphia Inquirer, finding that working-class voters in deep blue Philadelphia are making a pivot to the GOP. The article warned that Democrats losing ground in lower income areas could signal bad news for Vice President Harris next month.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Pennsylvania also saw one of the most pivotal moments of the current election cycle, when shots rang out at former President Trump's first Butler rally in July, marking the first of two attempts on his life.

Noreen Johnson, also a resident of the state, said those shots heard around the world had a lasting impact.

""They say there were 100,000 people there over the weekend,"" she said, speaking of Trump's recent return to the site. ""That alone, I think, speaks volumes.""

""Butler's attempted assassination, I think, really changed the landscape, not only in Pennsylvania, but across the nation,"" she added.

""To see a former president be nearly killed by a hair. I think a lot of people - even people that don't care for Donald Trump - that affected them and that may or may not have swayed their vote... We are where we are with our candidates. It is crunch time but, at the same time, people are hurting all over the country, and while Kamala is busy with her last-minute interviews and not answering questions and word salads, people are suffering, dying all over the country, and we have to make a change, and there's only one change, and that is Donald Trump on November 5th.""

Registered Democrat Jahmiel Jackson, a resident of Philadelphia, also joined the panel and was asked to weigh in on Harris' recent media tour, during which she has spoken to personalities like Howard Stern, Stephen Colbert and the women of ""The View.""

Jackson, echoing many others, voiced concern about her reluctance to answer tough questions.

""I think when we see her, what we're really missing from her is a really hard interview where she's being grilled, where she's being fact-checked, and her feet are being held to the fire because Donald Trump has been doing this for eight years but, even when he's been running now, it's been two years. He hasn't been scared of a single interview, so I think when we see her keep dodging on very important issues, then she doesn't represent Philadelphia at all,"" he said.

""For example, with the economy that's looming over her, she keeps saying that, 'We aren't going back.' That's one of her main catchline phrases that so many young people see as well, but when I talk to many people in Philadelphia, when I'm doing street interviews, I'm talking to my friends and families and their friends, they're always saying, well, we do want to go back to lower priced groceries, to a more stable world where there aren't as many embassy evacuations or there aren't as many foreign wars, a more stable country, for example, so a lot of us do want to go back to the 2019 amazing economy."""

""If you don't know them by now, there ain't no hope,"" one man who declined to give his name told Fox News Digital in Acworth, Georgia, last week.

There is less than a month left until Election Day, and Georgia residents are bracing for early voting to begin in their state next week.

The Peach State is in play this election after President Biden flipped it blue for the first time in years during the 2020 race, winning over Trump by less than 1%.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

A not insignificant amount of that support came from Cobb County, Georgia, where Biden won by an even wider margin than he did statewide.

And like Biden and Trump in 2020, the ex-president and Harris have only had one debate.

Trump has refused to participate in a second one, while Harris and her allies are eager for another head-to-head.

But people in Cobb County who spoke with Fox News Digital seemed unenthusiastic about the prospect of a second debate.

""I really don't think so,"" Howard Segan, who spoke with Fox News Digital outside of a Marietta Whole Foods, answered when asked if Americans needed another debate. ""I don't think Trump is a very good debater at all. And I think [Harris is] an empty suit.""

Another man who identified himself as Scott noted his grandfather was involved in politics and suggested he himself was disenchanted with its pageantry at an early age.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

""I realized most of it is staged anyway, so I really don't care about the debates,"" Scott said.

A woman named Deb who is opposed to Harris said, ""She says nothing, it's word salad. So what's there to debate? She can't even answer questions.""

Meanwhile, a man in Marietta named Toli said he ""honestly"" would like to see another debate but saw little value in the exercise.

""It doesn't really matter at this point, because people are going to have their own views, no matter what they do,"" Toli said. ""Maybe 20 years ago we had debates where people watched, they were riveted to the screen trying to figure out what their opinions are. But now it's so polarized. Because of social media and everything else, people get their opinion of the candidate... every day.""

Sandy, one of the few people who spoke with Fox News Digital who did want a second debate, suggested she was not excited about either of its would-be participants.

Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican former Congressman Mike Rogers clashed over national security, immigration and abortion at a debate Tuesday as each candidate vies to be the next U.S. senator from Michigan.

Retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., has endorsed Slotkin, a three-term lawmaker who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District, to fill her seat. Rogers served in the House from 2001-2015, was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and has been endorsed by former President Trump.

This race in battleground Michigan is close, though Slotkin has enjoyed an average 5 percentage point lead in public opinion polls. The victor could very well determine which major party gains control of the Senate next year. Fox News' Power Rankings list the Michigan Senate race as Lean D.

The hour-long debate hosted by NBC affiliate WOOD TV was mostly polite and issues-focused. However, there were several times when the candidates accused each other of lying or twisting the facts of their records.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

""Dishonest and deceptive,"" Rogers fumed after Slotkin insisted he repeatedly voted to ""privatize or cut Medicare and Social Security"" while he was a member of Congress. ""I'm not even sure she could pass the polygraph test in the CIA anymore,"" he said, referring to Slotkin's former career as a CIA analyst.

Slotkin hit back later after Rogers said she was ""huffing at the microphone"" during a discussion about nuclear power and competition with China.

""It's just sad that a guy who considers himself a national security guy can't see that we need to work together on this issue, not lie repeatedly,"" she said.

Early voting is underway in swing state Michigan and both candidates pitched themselves as willing to work with the other side. Each attacked the other as a partisan.

""We're a very purple state. Lots of Democrats, lots of Republicans,"" Slotkin acknowledged. ""I was voted the 14th most bipartisan member of Congress out of 435.""

She noted that Rogers served as deputy whip in the House, ""the guy who got everyone to vote with the Republicans.""

MICHIGAN DEM LAUNCHES ANTI-EV AD IN BID FOR SENATE RACE AFTER VOTING AGAINST A BIPARTISAN PUSHBACK ON MANDATES

Rogers in turn said Slotkin contributed to high gas prices, inflated grocery bills and increasing crime by ""voting 100% with the Biden-Harris agenda."" He said that if elected to the Senate, he ""will look for every opportunity to be bipartisan.""

The candidates appeared deeply divided on issues of foreign policy, national security, immigration and abortion.

Slotkin framed electric vehicle production in Michigan as a national security issue. ""I don't care what kind of car you want to drive,"" she said, before adding that it will either be ""us or China"" that builds the next generation of vehicles.

""China is eating our lunch on these types of vehicles,"" Slotkin continued, warning that Michigan's auto industry may repeat a historic mistake by ""ceding ground"" to a foreign competitor if America does not invest in EVs.

Rogers accused Slotkin of supporting EV mandates and pointed out, ""85% of everything processed in electric vehicles has to go through China.""

""Why in God's green earth we would cede that auto market to the Communist Party of China is beyond me,"" he said. ""My opponent has multiple times supported EV mandates, trying to pick the cars that our companies have to build and the cars that you're going to have to buy. And by the way, that got us 2,400 layoffs at Stellantis, a thousand layoffs at General Motors. Ford is talking about closing two lines. The CEO of Ford came out and said this is unworkable. It won't work for America.""

The debate became heated as each candidate tried to accuse the other of having a close relationship with China. Rogers repeated allegations he's made on the campaign trail that Slotkin signed a non-disclosure agreement with Gotion, a Chinese-linked company that has received $175 million in taxpayer money to build a battery plant in Big Rapids. Slotkin said her opponent's claims were ""offensive"" and shot back that Rogers was chief security officer of AT&T ""when they were actively working to get Chinese companies into our telecoms."" Rogers denied the charge.

In another exchange on the Middle East, Rogers jabbed at ""my opponent's notion that their somehow serving in Iraq gives permission to be wrong in the entire effort toward Iran."" Slotkin accompanied troops as a CIA analyst during three tours in Iraq.

THE BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON

When the topic turned to abortion, Rogers said the choice to terminate a pregnancy is ""the most heart-wrenching decision a woman will ever have to make.""

Acknowledging that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, permitting states to regulate abortion, Rogers said, ""The people of Michigan voted overwhelmingly to make abortion legal in a part of the state constitution of Michigan. I will do nothing when I go back to Washington, D.C., to do anything that would change what the Michigan Constitution, voted on by the people of Michigan, have given us that guidance to go back.""

Slotkin said she would vote for a bill to codify Roe - thereby erasing state restrictions on abortion - and said Rogers could not be trusted on the issue. ""He voted for every single ban, every restriction, every bill that came across his desk to make it harder for a woman and to ban, in some cases, a woman and her right to choose 56 times in total.""

""He voted and sponsored bills that would make it impossible to have IVF and contraception,"" she asserted. ""If he does not trust us to protect our own rights, do not trust him.""

""Deceive and deception,"" retorted Rogers. ""I have come out and talked about making sure that IVF is available for families so they can grow their families. It's a very personal thing for these families, and I support it 100%.""

Slotkin also framed Rogers as a carpetbagger, noting that he was living in Cape Coral, Florida, while Michigan voters took up the abortion question in a ballot initiative in 2022, before Rogers returned to Michigan to run for Senate.

On immigration, Slotkin said the ""system is broken"" and that Congress must do more to secure the border. ""To me, if you are not here legally, you should not be here. You should go back to your home country and be removed to your home country."" She accused Republicans of using the issue as a ""political talking point,"" noting that a bipartisan border security deal in the Senate fell apart after GOP opposition.

Rogers said he was ""delighted to hear that my opponent has had a conversion about border security"" after supporting the Biden administration's policies.

""Here's the thing. You can't vote against the wall. You can't vote against sanctuary cities,"" he continued. ""You cannot do the things that you've been doing in allowing 10 million people to come into our country. We spent something like $450 billion on taking care of illegals' room and board and phones and health care. That's enough money to pay for every Michigan teacher and every Michigan state trooper for 15 years.""

He called the bipartisan bill Slotkin referenced ""a bill to exacerbate and make permanent the problem.""

Tuesday's debate was the first of two planned debates between the Senate hopefuls. A second debate hosted by Detroit's WXYZ-TV Channel 7 is scheduled for next Monday."
51,Kamala Harris' failure at 'prosecutor 101' basics led to hundreds of drug convictions being tossed out: expert,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-failure-prosecutor-101-basics-led-hundreds-drug-convictions-being-tossed-out-expert,2024-10-09T17:05:28Z,"Fox News host Laura Ingraham calls out Vice President Kamala Harris' leadership as Hurricane Milton approaches Florida on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed hundreds of drug convictions and cases when she served as San Francisco district attorney amid an evidence lab scandal involving cocaine use that rocked her office.

Ahead of her run for the White House, Harris' district attorney's office was hit by a scandal in 2010 involving a lab technician with a criminal background who allegedly took cocaine home from the evidence lab and possibly tainted hundreds of other cases. The scandal unfolded as Harris hit the campaign trail to become the Golden State's attorney general.

The lab tech had reportedly become unreliable at work in the weeks leading up to the alleged cocaine theft, with the DA's lead drug prosecutor sounding the alarm in a 2009 email to a colleague, stating the lab tech had become ""increasingly UNDEPENDABLE for testimony"" and that the situation at the lab was ""ridiculous"" and jeopardized drug cases, SF Gate reported at the time. Lab techs frequently testified when San Francisco prosecutors headed to court.

The issue that plagued Harris' office was that the DA team did not inform defense attorneys of the issues involving the technician and cocaine. Since the Supreme Court's 1963 ruling in Brady v. Maryland, prosecutors have been required to turn over evidence that could exonerate suspects.

FLASHBACK: DA HARRIS' PLAN TO PROSECUTE DRUG DEALERS STARTING ON THEIR 3RD OFFENSE SHOT DOWN BY POLICE

In Harris' office, however, the team had no written procedure on how to handle ""Brady material"" or ""Brady implications,"" sparking a scandal that dragged out for months in 2010. Harris said amid the scandal that she was not made aware of concerns surrounding the drug lab and the technician until February 2010, months after lead drug prosecutor Sharon Woo sent an email in November to a colleague outlining the ""ridiculous"" state of the lab, SF Gate reported.

Harris is currently running for the White House against former President Donald Trump, and she has heavily relied on her background as a law and order candidate while citing her years as a prosecutor in Alameda County, San Francisco and as attorney general of the state.

Fox News Digital spoke to Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Zack Smith, a former assistant United States attorney, who recently published a report on Harris' ""pro-crime policies"" that highlighted the 2010 DA scandal.

'SICKENING': VP HARRIS SLAMMED BY SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS' FAMILIES OVER RECENTLY UNEARTHED COMMENTS

""I think it shows incompetence by Kamala Harris as district attorney. This is the basic blocking attack that is expected of a DA is to make sure that the rights of criminal defendants are being protected and that the community is being kept safe. And she failed at both of those basic tasks,"" Smith told Fox News Digital.

Smith explained that informing defense attorneys about issues in the lab and potentially tainted evidence is ""prosecutor 101,"" noting that Harris had already served as DA for about six years and still did not have a Brady policy in place.

""This is a big, big deal. It's kind of every prosecutor's nightmare scenario, is getting tagged with a Brady violation, because not only does it put your case in jeopardy, but you're also essentially being accused of committing an ethical and constitutional violation as well,"" he said.

""I can't emphasize enough, this is prosecutor 101, it's the basic blocking attack that any district attorney is going to be required to do. And so the fact that Kamala Harris, at that point, had been in office for a number of years that she didn't have a policy in place to deal with to deal with this type of situation is astounding.""

Harris attempted to pass blame for the issue on the police department, which oversaw the lab, and initially said only about 20 cases would be affected. The DA's office ultimately dismissed 600-1,000 drug cases, including convictions where criminals were already serving their sentence, according to the Washington Post.

VOTERS REPORT KAMALA HARRIS IS MORE RADICAL THAN TRUMP: 'TOO LIBERAL OR PROGRESSIVE'

The lab tech, who had been convicted of a 2007 domestic altercation, ultimately retired in March 2010, admitting to police that she consumed drugs from the police lab, according to SF Gate at the time. Police were aware of the woman's criminal background and admitted they made a mistake not informing the DA's office about her previous conviction, SF Gate reported.

The tech's supervisor told authorities that cocaine was missing from several cases the tech handled. The police department, which was led by current Los Angeles DA George Gascon at the time, shut the lab down after learning of the allegations, SF Gate reported.

In May 2010, a superior court judge excoriated Harris and put blame for the scandal squarely on her shoulders.

Harris ""failed to disclose information that clearly should have been disclosed,"" Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo wrote in a decision in 2010.

Amid the scandal, drug suspects called on the judge to dismiss their cases, sparking the DA's top narcotics prosecutor, Woo, to testify before the court to answer questions surrounding the handling of evidence and the drug cases. Woo testified that the DA's office had no written guidelines on how to handle Brady material and that Harris relied on the police department to let her know when evidence was exculpatory, the Washington Post reported in 2019.

A court transcript between Woo and Massullo showed the judge was shocked.

HARRIS PROMOTED BAIL FUND DURING HEIGHT OF DEFUND-THE-POLICE PUSH, CONTRARY TO SAYING 'NOT TRUE' IN DEBATE

""It's not the police department who has the affirmative obligation. It's the district attorney. That's who the courts look to. That's who the community looks to, to make sure all of that information constitutionally required is provided to the defense. . . . What I am gathering from what you are saying is that there is no formal way for your office.""

""In terms of a written policy, I don't think there's a written policy,"" Woo responded.

After dismissing an estimated 1,000 drug cases and convictions surrounding the scandal, Harris was elected California attorney general during the 2010 election cycle. She parted with the DA's office in January 2011, when she was sworn in as the state's top cop.

In 2019, when Harris unsuccessfully launched a campaign for president before becoming President Biden's running mate, she took ownership of the scandal.

""No excuses,"" Harris told the Washington Post. ""The buck stops with me.""

When asked why she had not implemented a Brady policy across her six-year tenure in the office, Harris said she had worked to implement it for about two years but did not complete the guidelines over complications regarding police personnel information, according to the outlet.

""I cared a lot about working out a Brady policy. ... I was saying in my office, we have to have one. It was a big controversy,"" she told WaPo. ""We were working on this, and it was much too slow. It took too long.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the campaign for additional comment on the matter.

Harris' office did implement a Brady policy following the scandal, which she said was subsequently lauded as ""a model"" for other district attorneys.

""It took too long to implement, but I am proud we implemented a Brady policy in the D.A.'s office that was later called 'a model for other jurisdictions'"" by the California Supreme Court, Harris said in a comment to the Wall Street Journal in 2019."

Trump also held a rally in the Bronx over the summer at Crotona Park, which had a permit allowance of 3,500 people. The New York Post reported the Bronx rally drew up to 10,000 supporters.

Meanwhile, Trump has drawn massive crowds for his latest rallies, with more than 20,000 people attending his second rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, over the weekend.

The campaign also said they saw more than 100,000 people at the former president's rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, in May.

New polling shows former President Trump has a 9-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to handling the economy, the single most important issue for voters going into the 2024 presidential election.

The new poll from Gallup found that 54% of Americans say Trump is more capable of handling the economy, compared to 45% for Harris. The economy ranked as the most important issue for Republicans and for all Americans, but it didn't rate in the top five for Democrats.

Veteran Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf says Democrats are simply confident in Harris' plan to handle the economy.

""Independents are looking for a reason to vote for a candidate, but they just haven't found it yet,"" Sheinkopf told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Americans focus on the issue most important to them in every election. This time it's their pockets. And they are still feeling pain no matter what candidates say. Time is running out for Harris to prove she can make it better.""

He went on to argue that the economy is no less politicized an issue as immigration or abortion, suggesting polarization has an outsized impact on voter's opinions on the economy.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

For Republicans, the top issues after the economy are immigration, terrorism and national security, crime and taxes.

For Democrats, the top issue is democracy in the U.S., followed by the type of Supreme Court justices a candidate would pick, abortion, health care and education.

Trump also holds leads over Harris on immigration (54%-45%) and foreign affairs (52%-47%). Harris holds her own leads on the top issues for Democrats, however, including health care (54%-44%), abortion (56%-40%) and climate change (61%-35%).

Climate change ranks as the least important issue for Republicans, with just 5% saying it is a priority. The least important issues for Democrats are the federal budget deficit and trade with other nations, both tied at 16%.

Gallup conducted the poll from Sept. 16-28, surveying 941 registered voters via telephone interviews on cellphones and landlines. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4%.

A New York Times/Siena College survey released on Tuesday found that Harris has a slight lead over Trump in a national poll. The survey found that Harris stands at 49% support among likely voters nationwide, with the former president and GOP nominee at 46%.

According to the poll, Harris stands at 47% and Trump at 44% in a multi-candidate field. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver each grabbed 1%, with roughly 7% supporting another candidate or undecided.

The letter to USSS Director Ronald Rowe and DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari alleges a whistleblower's claims that government auditors are being denied access to certain Trump campaign events in an effort to hide these apparent protection shortfalls for the former president.

""[Y]ou should be aware of these allegations, which indicate that the Secret Service is not in fact cooperating with your auditors and is instead painting a false picture.""

TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN-HARRIS 'RHETORIC' FOR LATEST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS HE WILL 'SAVE THE COUNTRY'

Since the July 13 assassination attempt against the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania, Hawley has been collecting whistleblower claims to expose potential USSS deficits and errors.

About two months after 20-year-old gunman Thomas Crooks shot Trump in the ear, Hawley released a wide-ranging whistleblower report detailing various allegations against the agency.

Hawley found a ""compounding pattern of negligence, sloppiness, and gross incompetence that goes back years, all of which culminated in an assassination attempt that came inches from succeeding,"" the report read.

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee passed Hawley's legislation requiring DHS to submit all information regarding the July 13 and Sept. 15 assassination attempts against Trump.

Crooks' gunfire during the first assassination attempt left rally attendee Corey Comperatore, a husband and father of two, dead. Crooks also shot and critically wounded two other rally attendees, James Copenhaver and David Dutch."

Political analyst Mark Halperin said this week that both Democrats and Republicans believe former President Trump's chances of winning the election are looking strong after seeing recent private polling data.

Appearing on a livestream on his media platform 2WAY, Halperin said people on both sides of the political aisle familiar with the polls have told him they've seen Vice President Harris' electoral prospects slip, and that they're leaning towards a Trump victory being in the cards.

""In the conversations I'm having with Trump people and Democrats with data, they are extremely bullish on Trump's chances in the last 48 hours. Extremely bullish,"" Halperin said.

The pundit characterized the Harris campaign as an ""experiment"" that's encountering issues.

KAMALA HARRIS TELLS 'THE VIEW' SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN

""Can you win a short campaign with an untested candidate? And what I'm telling you is happening in private polling is she's got a problem now,"" he said.

He pointed to a recent New York Times poll showing that Harris is up over Trump by three points nationally. However, he noted this lead is just on the cusp of the poll's margin of error and that her team would rather her be at +4 to be confident she's winning.

Halperin then mentioned a Wall Street Journal report on internal polling done by Sen. Tammy Baldwin's, D-Wis., re-election campaign showing that Harris is down by three points in Wisconsin.

""There's no path without Wisconsin,"" he said, bringing up the numbers from Baldwin's camp. He added, ""We all said yesterday, Wisconsin and Michigan are looking worse for Harris than before.""

FOUR CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE REJECTED CONSERVATIVE FANS: 'I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU'

He then spoke to his fellow pundits, including former Trump White House press secretary Sean Spicer and Democratic political strategist Dan Turrentine, about how Baldwin publishing these numbers is an ""alarm bell"" for the rest of the party.

""And so you do it to sound the alarm bell, you are sounding the alarm bell in the party,"" Turrentine added.

Further on in the stream, Halperin chastised his pro-Harris viewers, stating, ""For you Harris people on here complaining that we're talking about problems in the Harris campaign, you're welcome to put your head in the sand about it. If you want to go watch MSNBC primetime and hear how great things are going for the Harris campaign, you're welcome.""

""But if you want to understand what's actually happening, we're here to tell you. I just saw some new private polling today, that's very robust private polling, she's in a lot of trouble.""

Halperin added his belief that Harris is in ""danger"" of losing every swing state except for Nevada.

PHOENIX- Arizona GOP Chairwoman Gina Swoboda told Fox News Digital she was not impressed with VP Kamala Harris' recent trip to the border which she called a ""photo op"" while explaining her belief the Biden-Harris administration has failed the American people at the border.

""I think President Biden abandoned this country and I think Vice President Harris is without a clue,"" Swoboda told Fox News Digital. ""She's without a clue of what regular people are going through. She's without a clue about the border. I do not think she cares.""

Swoboda told Fox News Digital she often talks to ranchers along the border who have lived there for 100 years and described the situation as ""total devastation"" and said that VP Harris' recent trip to the border was nothing more than a ""photo op.""

""I've been to the border, you have to do more than just go down there and do a photo op and leave,"" Swoboda said. ""You have to consistently, I don't expect the politicians themselves to be able to spend time here all the time, but when President Trump built the wall, I mean, he kept coming down, and you have to have people on the ground that are reporting to you.""

""This administration that's in office has not called the head of the Border Patrol. The head of the Border Patrol union was giving remarks that said, like for a year, for two years, for three years, they didn't even hear from the administration as we're having the biggest crisis on the border we've ever had.""

Swoboda told Fox News Digital she doesn't think Harris is ""competent or qualified"" to solve the border issue.

58,NY Times columnist mocks Kamala Harris' friendly interview with radio host Howard Stern,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ny-times-columnist-mocks-kamala-harris-friendly-interview-radio-host-howard-stern,2024-10-09T14:28:38Z,"Reason senior editor Robby Soave and syndicated columnist Josh Hammer on the media interviews agreed to by Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton suggesting social media censorship.

New York Times columnist Michelle Cottle mocked Vice President Kamala Harris' interview with liberal radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday and said the Democratic nominee spent an ""hour in the warm embrace"" of the radio host.

""Stern was a little too openly butt-smoochy for my taste, but I like a little more spice in my political interviews,"" Cottle wrote, suggesting Harris go on ""Hot Ones"" next, where host Sean Evans asks his guests questions as they attempt to eat hot wings covered in various sauces.

Stern, was one of three friendly interview stops for Harris this week, as she also appeared on ABC's ""The View,"" and with late night host Stephen Colbert. Stern, a big critic of former President Trump, told the vice president that he was voting for her during the interview, and repeatedly went after Harris' opponent.

""Yes, folks hoping to find serious policy talk on the Stern show were out of luck. But honestly, any voters still undecided at this late date are unlikely to be making their decision based on the nitty-gritty of the candidates' tax plans,"" Cottle wrote.

KAMALA HARRIS TELLS 'THE VIEW' SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN

""Who could resist the opportunity to outsource some Trump bashing to a professional trash-talker like Stern, who famously disdains the MAGA king?"" the columnist added.

During an hour-long live interview with the Democratic presidential candidate, Stern repeatedly ripped into Trump and expressed disbelief that anyone would vote for him. At one point, he claimed the sun would ""go out"" if Trump was re-elected.

""With all this pressure on you right now, and you've got to win, you just have to,"" he told Harris. ""I really believe we're in for the darkest skies on the planet, like the sun's literally going to go out. God bless you for doing this,"" he said about her presidential bid.

""Howard, I'm doing everything I can to make sure he does not win,"" Harris responded.

Cottle wrote that the ""juicy bits"" of the interview included, ""that the V.P. isn't a napper; that she digs Doritos and jigsaw puzzles; that her favorite F1 driver is Lewis Hamilton; that she went to see U2 at the Sphere; and that a rare area of musical agreement between her and Doug, her husband, is their love of Prince.""

Noting that she's spoken to the Harris campaign about her media strategy, she wrote that the Democrat's team is hoping to meet voters where they are.

Fulton County, Georgia sued the Georgia State Elections Board this week in what was the latest development in an unfolding battle between the two entities over how to monitor and ensure election integrity in November.

The county board filed the lawsuit on Monday, the Associated Press reported, asking a judge to declare that the state board lacks the authority to force it ""to accept, and Fulton County to pay for, additional monitors for the 2024 election that have been hand-picked by certain State Election Board members.""

""The State Election Board has no statutory authority to force the Fulton County BRE [Board of Registration and Elections] to accept, and Fulton County to pay for, election monitors hand-picked by the State Election Board,"" the lawsuit says.

On Tuesday, the Georgia State Elections board responded by voting 3-2 to subpoena a trove of 2020 election documents from the Fulton County clerk of court, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.

'TOUGH CALL': ATLANTA VOTERS SPLIT ON WHO WILL WIN GEORGIA

The State Election Board in May found that the county violated some parts of the state election code. It voted to issue a letter of reprimand, which included instructions for an agreement on a mutually acceptable monitor to be entered into by the board's August meeting.

But the county and state election boards have been unable to reach an agreement. The county favors a team it has already approved that was proposed by Ryan Germany, a former chief lawyer for the secretary of state's office, and the Atlanta-based Carter Center. The Trump endorsed majority on the State Election Board has proposed an alternative slate that includes people who questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election.

An Aug. 19 legal opinion written by state Attorney General Chris Carr and obtained by The Associated Press says final decisions of the State Election Board are ""preclusive"" and that ""re-litigation of all claims which have already been adjudicated, or which could have been adjudicated, is therefore prohibited."" Fulton County attorneys assert that the approval of the motion at the May meeting and resulting reprimand meant the case is closed and can't be reopened, and that ""argument is likely correct,"" Carr wrote.

Asked about the attorney general's guidance, Johnston said, ""That was opinion. That's not a legal finding. That was their advice or opinion. We have different opinions about that.""

The Republican majority on the State Election Board repeatedly said during meetings in August that they did not approve of the county's team. But the county board reaffirmed its selection, and county commissioners voted to approve the contract days later.

The recent development comes a week after the Georgia State Election Board sparked controversy by voting 3-2 to approve a rule that requires poll workers to count the number of paper ballots by hand after voting is completed in a decision that was opposed by the state attorney general's office, the secretary of state's office and an association of county election officials but supported by many conservatives.

The new rule, according to the Associated Press, requires that the number of paper ballots -- not the number of votes -- be counted at each polling place by three separate poll workers until all three counts are the same. If a scanner has more than 750 ballots inside at the end of voting, the poll manager can decide to begin the count the following day.

60,5 reasons why Zelenskyy's victory plan for Ukraine is a no-win gamble,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/five-reasons-why-zelenskyys-victory-plan-ukraine-no-win-gamble,2024-10-09T11:12:52Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Last month, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the United States in an effort to revitalize U.S. support for his country's defense against Russia's invasion, which is now in its third year.

During his trip, in what appears to be the last push, before November's presidential election, the Ukrainian leader presented to the Biden administration his so-called ""Victory Plan"" intended to compel Russia to end the war. Tragically for the Ukrainian people, Zelenskyy's plan is highly unlikely to restore peace in Ukraine. Here's why:

First. The plan lacks a realistic definition of victory and a viable strategy to achieve it. President Reagan famously described in 1977 his vision for winning the Cold War with the Soviet Union to his confidant and adviser Richard Allen - ""We win, they lose."" Sounds simple.

But underpinning this approach was a thoroughly thought out strategy of containment, developed and executed by Reagan and his team over the course of many years. This strategy comprised of a series of very specific measures that centered on boosting America's military might and defense economics while weakening the Soviet Union's.

AMID SOARING THREATS FROM IRAN, RUSSIA AGAINST US HOMELAND, BIDEN-HARRIS MUST FOCUS ON PROTECTING US ALL

Unlike Reagan's, Zelenskyy's plan is little more than the same old plea he's been employing for over two years - more U.S. and European weapons and permission to launch missile strikes deep into Russian territory. This repackaged request that lacked a comprehensive strategy to win left senior U.S. and European officials ""unimpressed,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.

What is billed as a new ""concrete"" plan contains no clear path to winning the war. Moreover, Zelenskyy's definition of victory over Russia remains all but wishful thinking. In an interview Zelenskyy gave to the New Yorker during his visit, he admitted that there's been ""no change in my mindset"" regarding total victory for Ukraine.

He seeks ""justice"" victory, which he defines as retaking all of Ukraine's territory from Russia, including Crimea, and a path to NATO membership for Kyiv. Russia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine and has occupied Crimea for a decade.

NATO membership for Ukraine, which Russia views as part of its strategic security perimeter, has been Moscow's long-standing red line. It's Putin's version of the Monroe Doctrine. To enforce it, Putin started this war. Therefore, while Zelenskyy's aspirations can be sympathized with, they are currently unachievable.

Second. Zelenskyy's plan ignores the reality on the ground. Russia has been making gradual but steady advances on the battlefield. Having claimed control of the eastern coal-mining town of Ugledar (""gift of coal"") on Wednesday, the Russian forces are pushing deeper into Pokrovsk. Seizing Pokrovsk would give Russian forces a strategic advantage in capturing the rest of the Donbas. A hub city connecting seven different roads and railways, Pokrovsk is used by Ukraine to resupply its troops.

WHY PUTIN PREFERS HARRIS OVER TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE

Meantime, Kyiv has been under heavy bombardment throughout September by Russian missiles and drones. Russia fired 1,300 Iranian Shahed drones at Ukraine, a record-high number. Not a single day went by in September without a drone strike. Russia has destroyed 50% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, according to the United Nations. Many areas of the country are becoming unlivable, lacking water, heat and electricity, as winter is approaching.

Reversing the current situation is a monumental task that Ukraine is not in a position to achieve. Even U.S. intelligence admitted in a recent report leaked to the New York Times, likely intentionally, that even if President Biden were to allow Ukraine to use U.S. long-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia, it wouldn't change the trajectory of the war in a fundamental way. The number of long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) supplied to Ukraine is insufficient to do the job. Neither the U.S. nor Europe has extra reserves to spare or the production capacity to rapidly beef up their depleting arsenals.

The key factor that Zelenskyy and the Biden-Harris administration have ignored concerns the disparity in combat potential between Russia and Ukraine. It's a combination of the quantity of weapons, number of troops, defense economics, and production capacity of the military industrial complex. Here are the facts.

Third. Ukraine is dramatically outgunned and outmanned by Russia. There's a reason why the Pentagon considers Russia a ""near peer competitor"" against whom even the U.S. military would struggle to prevail, because Russia, if the U.S. were to deploy forces into the theater, would highly likely join forces with China, Iran and North Korea. Each of these three countries supports Russia's war effort.

The United States is simply not ready for such a multi-theater war, according to the recently released report of the Commission on the National Defense Strategy (NDS). The commission concluded that ""the U.S. military lacks both the capabilities and the capacity required to be confident it can deter and prevail in combat.""

It is exactly why Biden wouldn't permit Zelenskyy to use U.S. long-range weapons to strike deep into Russia. Biden knows full well that the risk of Putin using nuclear weapons and the risk of the U.S. being dragged into a direct war with Russia is real, as revealed by a large body of intelligence and confirmed by extensive wargaming we conducted in the intelligence community.

Fourth. The manpower also overwhelmingly favors Russia. Out of roughly one million killed or wounded in this war, Ukrainians have lost approximately 480,000 and Russians - 600,000. But Russia's population is three times larger than Ukraine's, allowing Putin to fight the war of attrition to the last Ukrainian.

As Ukraine is bleeding out, with the average age of a Ukrainian soldier fighting Russia having reached 43-45, Russia has already fielded a 15% larger force than it had at the start of the war, according to the same NDS Commission report. In September, Putin, ordered, by decree, another (a third one, since the beginning of the war) increase of the Russian armed forces, adding 180,000 troops.

The Russian military is now 2.38 million people, of which 1.5 million are active servicemen. (By comparison, the U.S. military is approximately 1.3 million active duty service members and 738,000 reserve and National Guard members as of June 30, 2024.) And just last week Putin approved a law giving immunity to convicts who join the military and get deployed to fight in Ukraine.

Fifth. Russia also beats Ukraine when it comes to defense economics. Ukraine's GDP fell by almost 30% in 2022, as a result of Russia's invasion, according to the European Parliament. While its tax revenue fell, its total expenditures grew by 270% from 2021 to 2023, with defense and security expenditures rising dramatically. In August, Ukraine narrowly avoided a default on its debts, when S&P Global cut Ukraine's credit rating to ""selective"" default, pending the foreign currency commercial debt restructuring taking effect.

The IMF calculates that if Ukraine fights an intense war for one year longer than the end of 2024, its public debt level, currently at almost 100%, would reach almost 140% of GDP. In the coming years, Ukraine will continue to be dependent on external financial support, with the largest share of financing having to come from official creditors such as the EU and the U.S.

Russia, in the meantime, has massively expanded its defense spending, which has risen to 7.5% of GDP. Putin transitioned Russia's military and economy to a wartime footing seven years prior to the invasion, by invoking a legal regime called a ""special period"". As a result, manufacturing plans that produced civilian goods were re-tooled to manufacture ammunition and military hardware; factories are now running 24/7 in mandatory three-shifts; and supply chains have been redesigned to avoid Western sanctions. With the military-industrial complex boosting the economy, 29% of Russia's federal budget is spent on national defense in 2024.

Former President Trump was criticized for refusing to say during his debate with Kamala Harris whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war with Russia. But Trump isn't afraid to be called ""Putin's apologist"" by the wishful thinkers. Unlike Team Biden-Harris and many bureaucrats serving in the U.S. government, Trump is a successful businessman who lives in the real, not imagined world. He understands ""The art of the possible"" - what can we achieve (possible) given available resources, rather than what we want (sometimes impossible).

As a strategic thinker who adheres to the realpolitik school of thought, Trump fully grasps the complex world of geopolitics. His actions, therefore, are based on rational calculations, not on emotions.

It is why Trump's response to the debate moderators was ""I want the war to stop."" Volodymyr Zelenskyy and anyone interested in saving Ukraine from total destruction would do well to heed Trump's wisdom.

Yet, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, at a U.N. Security Council meeting last month, has said he has no doubt Ukraine can win the war."
61,Mark Cuban defends NBA's China partnership despite opposing 'Chinese and all human rights violations',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mark-cuban-defends-nbas-china-partnership-despite-opposing-chinese-all-human-rights-violations,2024-10-09T11:05:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban doubled down on his public approval for the NBA's partnership with China on Monday.

During a long and wide-ranging group thread on X that began earlier this week, Cuban was confronted with a question of whether he approves of the NBA's business partnerships with China amid human rights violations that have occurred under the current regime.

The question was asked by Chuck Flint - former chief of staff to Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, who has been a strong opponent of the NBA's partnership with China.

Flint's question specifically pointed to the NBA-backed training camps in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government represses the Uyghur population, which the U.S. government has deemed as genocide.

""I have said I'm against Chinese and all human rights violations. The NBA exports content to China and gets paid for it. I'm ok with that,"" Cuban wrote in response. In that same post, Cuban promoted a film he claims to have produced about Chinese influence in the American stock market.

Cuban's response was the result of a branching dialogue of different mentions, responses and re-shares with captions that originated from a single post of him posing with former President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.

Cuban clarified that the post did not mean he is endorsing Trump.

Meanwhile, Cuban has been complicit and an advocate of the NBA's partnership with China despite multiple human rights violations that include the Uyghur genocide, coercive population control through forced abortion, forced sterilization, and involuntary implantation of birth control and forced labor in facilities nearby or affiliated with internment camps. All of those violations have been documented and recognized by the U.S. Department of State.

Cuban's team has embraced its relationship with the Chinese government and taken aim at tapping into the country's market so much that in 2018, it even re-branded itself with a new name to target the Chinese demographic. The change switched the team's translated name from ""Little Cows"" to ""Lone Ranger Heroes.""

Cuban previously defended the NBA's business with the communist regime in an interview on Megyn Kelly's podcast in October 2020.

""They are a customer. They are a customer of ours,"" Cuban said. ""And guess what, Megyn? I'm okay with doing business with China. You know, I wish I could solve all the world's problems, Megyn. I'm sure you do too. But we can't. And so we have to pick our battles.""

In that same interview, Cuban did not condemn the genocide in Xinjiang specifically when asked if he would condemn the regime for that issue.

""I personally put a priority on domestic issues. When it comes to human rights, I'm against all human rights violations around the world. China's not the only country with human rights violations,"" Cuban said. ""The way proclamations work in this country, the minute you say them anywhere, you're going to use this as a headline.""

MARK CUBAN SPARS WITH RILEY GAINES OVER HARRIS BORDER CRISIS THAT LET MIGRANTS CHARGED WITH MURDER AND SEXUAL ASSAULT INTO THE US

A 2022 ESPN investigation found that NBA owners had more than $10 billion tied up in China, including one owner whose company has a joint venture with an entity that has been sanctioned by the U.S. government. Another ESPN investigation in July 2020 found that one of the basketball training camps in Xinjiang was called ""a sweat camp for athletes,"" by a coach who was stationed there. At least two coaches left their positions in response to what they believed was mistreatment of young players.

Concerns have also grown about the use of forced Uyghur labor in the making of sports apparel for firms like Nike, whose products are then used by the NBA.

Cuban's refusal to condemn China coincides with a lack of any major figures in the NBA ever condemning China for its violations or the league's business with the country, including superstar LeBron James.

In a rare instance of an NBA executive being linked to opposition to it, the Asian country responded harshly.

In October 2019, former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a photo on social media in support for protestors in Hong Kong against the Chinese government. Shortly after, Morey's tweet was deleted, then the Chinese Basketball Association announced that it would be suspending all cooperation with the Rockets. Morey was eventually made to apologize, and the NBA put out a statement characterizing his tweet as ""regrettable"" and clarifying that his support for Hong Kong protesters ""does not represent the Rockets or the NBA."" The Rockets even reportedly considered firing Morey in an effort to appease the Chinese, according to multiple reports.

Meanwhile, former NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom testified before congress in July 2023 arguing that his criticism of China for its treatment of Uyghur Muslims has affected his NBA career.

""After the third game, one of my teammates walked up to me and said, 'Enes, you know this is your last year in the NBA right, if you ever criticize China, NIKE then you never gonna be able to play basketball in this league. So have fun, smile and I hope we win a championship this year because this is your last year, and your basketball career is going to end,"" Kanter wrote in his written testimony to Congress.

Kanter was released by the Houston Rockets in February 2022 and has not played in the NBA since then. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said that Freedom's departure from professional basketball has nothing to do with his stance on China.

Outside of Kanter and Morey, there have been very few instances of a major figure in the NBA speaking out against China since then, and several NBA stars, including Cuban's own Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic, have made trips to China as part of the NBA China Games.

Back in February, Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai told reporters that the NBA is ""in a very good place"" in its relationship with China, more than four years after Beijing took the league's games off-air following Morey's remarks.

""China is actually the NBA's biggest fan base. So what happened before, I think it's water under the bridge,"" Tsai said.

Meanwhile, Taiwan's top official in the U.S. is warning that China has ramped up its aggression toward the island, and that its people are ready to fight. Taiwan's ministry of defense tracked eight Chinese military aircraft and two naval ships near the island earlier this week. The defense ministry said four of the eight planes crossed the median line dividing China and Taiwan's territory in the Taiwan Strait - though Beijing, which claims ownership of Taiwan, does not recognize the geographic delineation, Fox News Digital previously reported."

During his tenure in Congress, DeSantis gained a reputation as an ardent defender of President Donald Trump by opposing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In 2018, he won the Florida gubernatorial campaign against Democratic Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum by a thin margin, triggering a recount. DeSantis would go on to win the governorship by a 0.4% margin.

DeSantis's stardom in conservative politics took off partly due to the coronavirus and vaccination policies he implemented in Florida during the pandemic. He prohibited private businesses from enforcing face masks and vaccination requirements. He received praise from conservatives such as Trump but was criticized by those on the left, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. In October 2021, Florida recorded the lowest COVID-19 daily average case per 100,000 residents in the United States, according to the state government.

DeSantis also signed a law prohibiting educational instructors from teaching students about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to the third grade. Critics of the bill have referred to it as the ""Don't Say, Gay Bill."" After the bill's passage, Disney admonished the Florida government and vowed to help fight the law in court. As a result, DeSantis stripped ""Walt Disney World"" of its self-governing status in the state. During the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election on November 8th, 2022, Desantis was reelected by nearly 60% of the electorate."
64,Harris dodges when asked by Howard Stern if she'd leave the country for her safety if Trump wins,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-dodges-when-asked-howard-stern-shed-leave-country-her-safety-trump-wins,2024-10-09T10:39:00Z,"Reason senior editor Robby Soave and syndicated columnist Josh Hammer on the media interviews agreed to by Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton suggesting social media censorship.

Vice President Kamala Harris avoided answering whether she would leave the country or feel safe if former President Trump wins re-election in November.

Harris appeared on Sirius XM's ""The Howard Stern Show"" Tuesday as part of a ""media blitz"" this week on mostly friendly outlets. During the interview, Stern talked about the existential threat of Trump winning the presidential election.

""If he wins, God forbid, would you feel safe in this country? Would you stay in this country?"" Stern asked Tuesday.

""Howard, I'm doing everything I can to make sure he does not win,"" Harris responded.

Stern pressed, ""But what if he does? How can you be safe? He's saying, 'No, I'm just going to do whatever the hell I want. This time, I know what I need to do.'""

Harris pivoted to touting the support she has gotten from Republicans such as former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney.

""We are building a coalition of people that are Republicans, independents, Democrats, libertarians, all stripes of Americans who are coming together to say, you know what? This election is about putting country before party,"" Harris said.

She continued, ""This is about saying, do we want a president who's going to abide by the oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, or someone who is full-time engaged in flattery from Vladimir Putin of Russia and sending COVID testing kits over to him? When Americans are dying every day?""

Several liberal figures, mostly celebrities, have infamously threatened in both 2016 and 2020 to leave the United States if Trump won. Most recently, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen said he has ""no choice"" and is already making plans.

""I'm already working on a foreign passport with a completely different name. I don't know how it's going to work as far as dealing with my wife and my children. I certainly don't want them moving to where I'm looking to go,"" Cohen said. ""And the worst is the Supreme Court's recent decision that gave him immunity, presidential immunity. Now, he thinks it's not only is it I can do whatever I want, but I can't even be prosecuted. It's a get out of jail free card solely for the president."""

Critics of Vice President Kamala Harris said she damned her campaign by telling ""The View"" she couldn't think of anything she would have done differently from President Biden.

The Biden presidency has been consistently dogged by crises ranging from domestic issues like inflation and chaos at the border, to international scandals like the disastrously managed withdrawal from Afghanistan. As Harris has tried to prove to the American people that she would be a competent president, many have argued that her connection with Biden's unpopularity is a liability for her election prospects.

As Harris spoke to co-hosts of ""The View"" on Tuesday, she was asked by co-host Sunny Hostin, ""If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?""

Harris responded, ""There is not a thing that comes to mind.""

The Trump-Vance campaign jumped on the response.

""Kamala Harris is more of the same,"" Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, wrote. ""She admits it herself.""

Many conservatives on social media expressed joy and disbelief that Harris chose to hitch her reputation to the embattled president, with some arguing she is helping her opponent, former President Donald Trump.

OutKick's Riley Gaines suggested, ""She's done more to elect Trump than she has to elect herself.""

""Oh my goodness,"" Fox News' Guy Benson responded to the clip, later joking it would make an excellent campaign ad for Trump, ""'I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.'""

""This will be the nail in Kamala Harris's coffin,"" The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis predicted.

""It reminds me of John Kerry's 'I voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it' comment about Iraq war funding when he was fighting charges of being a spineless flip-flopper,"" he added. ""That single comment ended his campaign.""

""I'm floored by this,"" CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings said. ""Honestly can't believe it.""

Political strategist Chris Barron argued Harris' comment would sink her chances at the White House, ""Say good night to Kamala's campaign.""

""The View Lady accidentally asks the most brutal question Kamala's gotten,"" podcaster Wade Stotts posted.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

Some public figures argued that ""more of the same"" is an election-losing proposition.

""More of the same,"" Former Trump ambassador Richard Grenell said. ""Wars. Bidenomics. Open borders. Gas prices. Grocery prices.""

The official account of the Republican Party cited a few key issues on American voters' minds, ""Prices up over 20%, the worst border crisis in U.S. history, and the world on the brink of world war III...and Kamala says she wouldn't have done anything differently.""

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders slammed Harris for a similar litany of issues, saying, ""Prices are up 20%, millions have crossed our southern border illegally, and our allies around the world are under attack. But don't worry, America. Kamala says she wouldn't change a thing.""

""13 brave service members losing their life, run away inflation, 14 million illegals over our southern border, 300,000 unaccounted for children sold into God knows what,"" Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said as he recalled the infamously bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan. ""Should I go on?""

Last week, Biden said during a White House press briefing that he and Harris were in constant contact and ""singing from the same song sheet.""

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden said.

66,5 key numbers that will decide the 2024 presidential election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/5-key-numbers-decide-2024-presidential-election,2024-10-09T09:18:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As we start the final month of the presidential campaign, the race appears to remain very close - much like every election of this century (except for Barack Obama's first race in 2008). The latest Fox News national poll shows a two-point race in the national popular vote, with Vice President Kamala Harris slightly ahead of former President Trump 50-48 - and each of the seven key battleground states similarly showing the candidates within the margin of error from each other.

If you want to drop into the weeds (and I guess that's why they pay me), I think there remain five key numbers that will indicate which candidate has the momentum in the race - and tell you which campaign is closer to achieving its goal.

I'd argue the key ""weeds that count"" are: Trump's ""number,"" Trump's support among Hispanic and African American voters, Harris's support among Republicans who don't describe themselves as ""MAGA,"" and Harris-Walz support among voters in rural America.

TRUMP CAN WIN ON THESE 3 KEY ISSUES, MICHIGAN VOTERS TELL FOX

Trump's number is the number I've looked at all year: His share of the popular vote. All year it has hovered around 48% - in all the most-respected public polls. Trump's political persona is about as solidified as any American politician in my professional lifetime. There is little that he, his detractors, or his supporters can say or do that will shake voters' impression of him - either positively or negatively. His vote share has basically remained what it is through almost a decade of his public life.

So, all year I've focused on Trump's share of the vote. It isn't going to change dramatically, but small swings may indicate strength or emerging weaknesses. The arc of Harris's campaign - she quickly consolidated support among the bulk of voters who'd told pollsters from 2023 until July that they were ""undecided."" They weren't really undecided. They were voters who didn't like Trump but were lukewarm about President Joe Biden. And now the bulk of them are in the Harris column.

But what about the rest? Now when I look at the undecided number (and it's remarkably small), I think there might be some hidden Trump vote there. For example, Trump is at ~47% in the better polls in Florida, and hovering around 50% in Texas in similarly respected polls. That's below the 52% he got in Texas in both 2016 and 2020, and the 51% he got in Florida in 2020.

He will almost certainly win both states, which suggests that some folks telling pollsters they're ""undecided"" will, in the end, choose Trump. On the other hand, it could be a sign of some weakness among Trump voters.

The voter groups where Trump is showing surprising strength is his support among minorities, especially Hispanic and African American voters. Prior to dropping out of the race, Biden was doing remarkably poorly among those groups; Trump had gotten less than 10% of the African American vote in 2020, and 35% of Hispanic support.

In the latest Fox News national poll (September), Trump is getting over 40% of the Hispanic vote and almost 30% of the Black vote. And it explains the closeness of the contests in the battleground states. Looking at those numbers is key. If Trump can continue to run strong among Hispanic voters, he'll likely win Arizona and Nevada. If Harris can recapture some of the 2020 Biden strength among African Americans, she'll be able to win Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.

Conversely, the Harris numbers to look at are her support among rural voters (the locus of Trump's base) and at her support among Republicans who say they aren't part of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement.

One of the reasons Harris picked Minnesota Governor, and occasionally folks, Tim Walz, was to try to make inroads among rural voters. They didn't want to win the rural vote - they just wanted to lose by less. It was the rural vote that likely earned Trump victories in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 2016 and propelled him into the White House.

Can he do it? So far, the jury is out. His suboptimal performance in the Vance-Walz debate likely did little to win over rural voters - but they're still at it. He doesn't appear to mind going into rural settings - where he is often greeted by Trump supporters booing him - so it is a number that is key to study.

Finally, there remains the non-MAGA GOP voters. Somewhere between a quarter to a third of GOP voters describe themselves as ""non-MAGA."" This was the group who supported former Ambassador Nikki Haley in the primaries. At that time, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis of Iowa caucus goers and New Hampshire and South Carolina primary voters, almost half of them said they would not vote for Trump in November.

There are only limited signs of Trump weakness among that group now that we're in a general election campaign. Still, in the most recent Fox News Arizona state poll, roughly one-in-five non-MAGA GOP voters said they were supporting Harris. That translates to roughly 6% of GOP voters ""defecting"" to Harris. That's enough to keep the state close, but probably not enough to win. Still, it represents a clear danger signal for Trump.

Of particular concern are other signs of non-MAGA defection. For example, the same poll tested the Senate race between Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Reuben Gallego. In that race (where Gallego has a clear lead), Fully 16% of Republicans said they'd vote for Gallego. 6% of GOP Arizona voters would vote for Harris and another 10% said that while they'd vote for Trump, they'd defect from the GOP in the Senate race.

Either way, it shows the instability of GOP support - and a wavering among some parts of the GOP.

If Trump is able to shore up that non-MAGA weakness, he'll be well positioned in November - if Harris is able to pull some of them to her side, she'll be well-positioned. So, looking at her numbers among non-MAGA GOP voters is key.

Suprisingly enough, in that Vance-Walz debate, Vance did a good job of trying to appeal to that non-MAGA group. I say surprisingly, since when Trump picked Vance, some analysts complained that Trump had doubled down on the MAGA wing of the party - and left the non-MAGA (the Haley voter) by the wayside.

But Vance's smooth explication of his (and Trump's) positions on school violence, the war in the Middle East, and immigration - probably went a long way to trying to ameliorate Trump's non-MAGA weakness.

Yes, it's in the weeds, and, yes, the subgroups are small relative to the overall nation. In looking at these numbers, note that they are subject to a significant margin of error. They may show evidence of a shift or just statistical noise. But they are the key numbers to watch in the coming weeks: Trump's overall number, Trump's support among minorities, the Harris vote in rural America, and the Harris vote among non-MAGA GOP voters."

NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAS TO 'GET SERIOUS' ABOUT IMMIGRATION, SAY VOTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

President Biden scored a crucial victory in Arizona in the last presidential election, flipping the state to the Democrats for the first time since 1996.

Four years later, the state remains highly competitive. In late September, a Fox News Poll put Republican former President Trump at 50% and Democrat Vice President Harris at 47% among likely voters; an AARP survey around the same time had Trump two points ahead of Harris at 49%-47%.

Maricopa County remains the most important battleground in the state. It is the fourth-highest populated county in the United States, represents more than 60% of Arizona's registered voters and has a large suburban population, particularly in Mesa.

Arizona is also home to a higher proportion of Hispanic voters than the rest of the country, and while they favored Biden by 19 points in the last election, they have shown signs of shifting toward Trump.

Republicans are strongest in sparsely populated rural areas, particularly Mohave County (Trump +51) and Graham County (Trump +45), but they run up the margin most in the outer suburbs and exurban areas in Maricopa, Pinal and Pima counties.

Arizona is a Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings.

The Grand Canyon State will also vote for a new senator after independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema decided not to run for re-election this year.

""We are tired of the vision of Donald Trump and his Republican Party, because right now what we know is there are Republicans out there willing to put country over party, and we need more like-minded people willing to do that.""

Likely nowhere will that strategy prove more critical than Georgia, which Democrats are fighting to hold onto after President Biden took the Peach State by less than 1% in 2020, breaking a yearslong streak of the state voting Republicans into the White House.

Williams, who took over as state party chair in 2019 and was elected to Congress in 2020, said Democrats were not taking those recent victories for granted when asked how the Left's strategy has shifted since then.

""When I became chair in 2019, nobody believed that Georgia was in play,"" Williams said. ""We are a true battleground state, which means we have to talk to every voter, take nothing for granted.""

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

The Democratic leader said the state party's organizing efforts spanned all of Georgia's 159 counties, with nearly 30 field offices and more than 200 paid staffers.

""We've got to have conversations with the voters about the issues that matter to them. I'm hearing about people who are so concerned that their freedom and our freedoms are on the ballot,"" Williams said.

When pressed later about what issues voters are most concerned about, Williams suggested abortion access was a top topic.

She referenced the death of 28-year-old Amber Thurman, a Georgia mother who died after allegedly being denied emergency abortion care for 20 hours after a rare complication from abortion pills.

Democrats and pro-choice activists have blamed her death on the Republican Georgia state government's recent law banning abortion after six weeks except in cases of rape, incest, or medical emergencies.

Republicans and pro-life groups have pushed back on those attacks, however. They have instead blamed Thurman's death on complications caused by the abortion pills she took, and argued that there was nothing stopping doctors from performing surgery on her after the fetus's heartbeat was already stopped.

""She has an eight-year-old son growing up without a mother. But it doesn't have to be this way. These are policy decisions,"" Williams said.

Meanwhile, both the Harris and Trump campaigns have courted Georgia's Black population -- voters who were key to Biden's 2020 victory.

Trump has made it a point in particular to try to appeal to Black and brown men, a group of voters who Republicans believe are growing disenchanted with Democrats' progressive policies.

Williams said Black voters were ""not a monolith,"" however, and signaled that the Harris campaign is also working to appeal to as many people as possible.

So a gang from Chile came and started hitting houses in Scottsdale on a pretty routine basis and they were calling them like dinnertime robberies and you're sitting down to dinner after you worked all day and now here comes the Chilean gang to rob your house.""

NEW POLL SHOWS WHO HISPANICS ARE BACKING IN SOUTHWEST SWING STATES

Migrant gangs have garnered national attention in recent months, particularly in Aurora, Colorado, where a Venezuelan gang has been tied to numerous crimes in the city.

Hamadeh told Fox News Digital that the ""radical"" immigration policies of the Biden-Harris administration are playing a major role in the increase of gang activity in Maricopa County.

""Everybody knows it's a joke,"" Hamadeh said about the immigration policy put forward by Harris during her recent speech along the southern border. ""We can't escape the commercials that are on constantly, she's walking on our southern border with Trump's border wall which we all know she opposed. She's the most radical person ever to run for president.""

""Everybody who's law enforcement, Border Patrol, anybody who knows what's going on is supporting President Trump because Kamala Harris is in a position of power and has done nothing about it. So we all know that this is her attempt at trying to just, you know, get votes. But we know that the radical left is adamant about keeping our border open, and it's creating a national security risk.""

That national security threat, Hamadeh told Fox News Digital, will ultimately result in voters supporting Trump in a key swing state where 11 electoral votes could decide the election.

"" In my district, particularly, you know, we have all these Taiwanese companies moving into my district for the microchip industry, it's 50 to $100 billion. That's creating a national security risk,"" Hamadeh said. ""It's great for economic development, but we have an open border, and you've got 30,000 Communist Chinese who have crossed our southern border last year. Unvetted.""

""That's a prime intelligence target. I'm a former military intelligence officer in the U.S. Army Reserve and we're putting a target right now here in Arizona for some of these foreign adversaries to take advantage of. Just last week, we discovered that Iran or somebody may have snuck through ten shoulder-fired missiles possibly. I mean, we're talking about the United States. How are we not securing our border? It seems like the easiest concept for everybody to understand and that's where, in my district that's why it is the number one issue and Kamala Harris is failing at it and that's why she's going to lose the election.""

But Whoopi Goldberg introduced her by bellowing ""the next president of the United States,"" it was a slap-your-forehead moment."" Seriously?

The whole session yesterday was an in-kind contribution to the Harris campaign.

KAMALA 2.0'S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTS

I know, they're not straight journalists, they're liberal commentators slash entertainers. They read their questions verbatim off blue cards. That's precisely why she wanted to do the show.

There were some reasonable questions: How would her presidency differ from Joe Biden's? How would she handle the border? Why wouldn't Ron DeSantis take her calls about hurricane preparations with a Category 4 storm about to hit Florida?

And then there was Joy Behar, who went on about Trump's lies and asked how anyone could possibly support him. That enabled the Vice President to say Trump was all about personal grievances, not the voters.

Kamala made good use of the forum, such as dishing on how she was working out and with her kids when Joe Biden called to say he was stepping aside.

Bottom line: ""The View,"" an ABC program founded by Barbara Walters - it's still in the news division - was even more embarrassing than I expected, with the ladies falling all over themselves to praise Harris and trash Trump.

Some reasonable questions were asked, but Kamala ran circles around them and deflected what she didn't want to answer while getting her familiar talking points in.

It was a good forum for her, and for once she came prepared to make news. In a move earlier leaked to Politico, Harris made her pitch for having Medicare reimburse caring for the elderly at home instead of only in expensive institutions - the first new policy proposal she's made in weeks. She said she would pay for it by demanding deeper discounts on certain drugs paid for by Medicare. Needless to say, she was not exactly cross-examined on the subject.

WALZ-HARRIS WILL BE THE MOST 'RADICAL' ELECTED OFFICIALS THE WORLD HAS SEEN: COREY LEWANDOWSKI

The ladies seemed awed that Kamala Harris was even there.

It was a very different Kamala who appeared on a ""60 Minutes"" prime-time special aired the night before.

To be sure, the news magazine show repeated some of her criticisms of Trump, with Bill Whitaker saying: ""You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants. In Springfield, Ohio. When it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville, in fact, you have called him a racist and divisive, yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans.""

The veep's talking-point response: ""I believe that the people of America want a leader who's not trying to divide us and demean.""

But Whitaker was a bulldog when it came to asking for followups again and again when the Democratic nominee offered generalities.

When asked about the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget saying her plan would add $3 trillion over the next decade - it was much higher for Trump - Harris talked about economists liking her plan and pivoted to praising small business.

Whitaker's response: ""Pardon me, Madam Vice President. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

This time, Harris said she'd make sure billionaires and big corporations would have to pay their ""fair share,"" and Whitaker expressed skepticism that Congress would approve that.

This was the question that Harris hasn't really had to answer.

""Let me tell you what your critics and the columnists say, okay? They say that the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things,"" said Whitaker. ""You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you're tightening them up. You are for Medicare for All. Now you're not so many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for.""

'60 MINUTES' DEFENDS HANDLING OF HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP COVERAGE AS IT HITS TRUMP FOR SKIPPING INTERVIEW

Harris offered this answer: ""In the last four years I have been vice president, United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus."" Translation: The world has changed and I have to be realistic about what I can get passed.

The interview was so heavily edited that you could see the changes several times as Harris magically limited her answers to two sentences. That's the overproduced ""60 Minutes"" style, but I think it was a mistake. CBS should have run the whole thing, or a major chunk of it, unedited.

Scott Pelley said Trump had agreed to an interview but backed out with shifting explanations, including that there be no fact-checking.

By yesterday afternoon, Kamala was taping her interview with Howard Stern, who loved Trump back in the day when they were rating women and has been totally opposed to him as a candidate and president.

Reacting to Bob Woodward's forthcoming book saying Trump secretly sent Vladimir Putin a COVID test machine during the pandemic - which the former president denies - the VP said: ""I believe that Donald Trump has this desire to be a dictator. He admires strongmen and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends and they are manipulating him full-time and manipulating him by flattery and with favor...

""This guy who is President of the United States is sending them to Russia? To a murderous dictator for his personal use?""

Stern called it ""maddening"" and ""insanity"" that anyone would support Donald Trump. He told Harris he would vote for her, but could also vote for ""that wall over there"" over the ex-president.

Harris is finally starting to make some news. Imagine if she'd started some of these interviews weeks ago."

Vice President Kamala Harris refrained from saying what ""major changes"" her administration would bring versus the Biden administration she is currently serving during an interview Tuesday night.

Harris sat down for a friendly interview with ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert, who pointed to polls showing voters want the 2024 election to be about change.

""You are a member of the present administration, but under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be, and what would stay the same?"" Colbert asked.

KAMALA HARRIS TELLS 'THE VIEW' SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN

""Sure, well I'm obviously not Joe Biden,"" Harris responded.

""I've noticed,"" Colbert quipped.

""So that would be one change in terms of - but also I think it's important to say with 28 days to go, I'm not Donald Trump,"" Harris said, sparking cheers from the liberal audience.

""And so when we think about the significance of what this next generation of leadership looks like, were I to be elected president, it is about - frankly, I love the American people, and I believe in our country. I love that it is our character and nature to be an ambitious people. You know, we have aspirations, we have dreams. We have incredible work ethic. And I just believe that we can create and build upon the success we've achieved in a way that we continue to grow opportunity and in that way, grow the strength of our nation,"" Harris continued before touting her ""opportunity economy"" pitch and talking about her small business owner mother.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Earlier in the day on her media blitz, Harris was similarly asked on ""The View""whether she would have done anything differently from the Biden presidency.

""There is not a thing that comes to mind,"" Harris responded, adding ""I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.""

Critics panned the Democratic nominee's comments, insisting they would be immediately used in a Trump ad to tie her to Biden, who was forced out as the nominee by anxious Democrats in July. Biden dropped out of the race under pressure and Harris quickly replaced him."

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 80 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump has held six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August, including another on Friday after meeting with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about hurricane relief efforts.

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits, a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station, and friendly appearances with ""The View,"" Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus discuss on 'Hannity'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday called for the elimination of the Electoral College during a fundraiser in California, a move some Democrats have advocated for in the past after election defeats.

Walz was in California Gov. Gavin Newsom's private home in Sacramento when he remarked about the process by which U.S. presidents are elected.

""I think all of us know the Electoral College needs to go,"" he said, according to a pool report at the event, Bloomberg reported. ""We need a national popular vote, but that's not the world we live in.""

THOUSANDS OF NONCITIZENS REMOVED FROM VOTER ROLLS, DOZENS OF LAWMAKERS WANT ANSWERS FROM GARLAND

In 2023, the Minnesota governor signed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an agreement in which each state would allocate all its electoral votes to whoever wins the popular vote for president, regardless of how individual states voted. The compact would take effect only if supporters secure pledges from states with at least 270 electoral votes.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the campaigns of Vice President Harris and former President Trump.

The Electoral College comprises a certain number of electors from each state who cast votes for the president and vice president. In 48 states and Washington, D.C., whichever candidate receives the most ballots in their favor is awarded all the electoral votes for that state. Maine and Nebraska assign their electors using a proportional system.

The winner needs 270 electoral votes to win the presidential election.

The Electoral College was created by the Founding Fathers in an effort to make sure large states didn't dominate small ones in presidential elections or wield too much power. Abolishing the system would require a major constitutional change.

TRUMP CAN WIN ON THESE 3 KEY ISSUES, MICHIGAN VOTERS TELL FOX

In recent years, some Democrats have called for eliminating the process in favor of a popular vote. Recent examples cited include former President Trump's 2016 win over Hillary Clinton, in which she won the popular vote but received fewer electoral votes.

In 2000, former President George W. Bush lost the popular vote but narrowly won the electoral vote. Many Republicans have argued against getting rid of the Electoral College system, saying such a move would result in states with larger populations having undue influence.

Others argue it would cause presidential candidates to focus on a few states during the campaign season while ignoring others.

In 2012, Trump panned the electoral system, calling it ""a disaster for a democracy."" In 2018, he again voiced support for the idea because a popular vote would be ""much easier to win.""

JESSE WATTERS: Barack's not happy. After hiding Harris all Fall, Democrats watched her numbers drop. It was time to change strategy. Obama ordered Kamala, 'you're doing a media blitz.' But Harris couldn't handle the pressure. She couldn't even survive ""The View"".

This was the one excuse she had for not solving problems for four years. And, you know, 'I was only VP.' I don't call the shots. This was her one saving grace that let people think maybe she's not Joe Biden. Maybe she can be different. Maybe she can bring change.

And she just went on ""The View"" and said 'I'm Joe Biden. I wouldn't have done anything differently the last four years.' At the debate, she declared, I'm not Joe Biden. And today she says she is. She even flip-flopped on whether she's Joe Biden. Afghanistan wouldn't have done anything differently, inflation, the border.

If she had to go back and do it over, she would have done everything the same. If she had a time machine, she'd hurt the country all over again. She has no regrets. She must really hate you. Joe Biden was so unpopular, he got whacked by Democrats and she learned nothing from that.

She just went on live TV and said, 'yep, Biden, that's my guy. I'm a Biden Democrat.' Now we know how Kamala climbed her way to the top. Blind loyalty. And now that she's all alone at the top, she doesn't know what to do with herself. She's still kissing up to the guy she couped. This whole election is about change.

""In October 2023, under the darkening shadow of the U.S.-backed Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation, the Abandon Harris campaign - formerly Abandon Biden - was born. Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise,"" the group declared in a press release.

Stein has expressed her gratitude to the group and its support of her candidacy.

The Abandon Harris campaign says on its website that its ""current goal is to hold Harris accountable for her continued support of genocide.""

""It's painfully obvious that Kamala Harris can only sound articulate and firm when parroting US support for Israel,"" the group wrote in an August post on X.

At another point, Stern defended the idea of people going to therapy, and asked Harris if she could ""unload"" from the pressures she's under at a therapist's office.

""This is my form of therapy right now, Howard,"" Harris joked, before explaining she had support from her friends and husband when she needed someone to talk to.

FOUR CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE REJECTED CONSERVATIVE FANS: 'I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU'

Stern's interview with Harris also covered the vice president's career as a prosecutor, her relationship with her husband Doug Emhoff, her pledge to bring Republicans into her cabinet if elected, and a discussion on whether voters were ready to elect a female presidential candidate.

The softball interview follows Stern telling his audience last month that he hates Trump supporters.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" he said on his show in September.

Harris' appearance on Stern's show came after she sat down for a friendly interview on ABC's ""The View."" Her friendly media blitz will continue Tuesday night on ""The Late Show,"" where she will be interviewed by Democratic Party supporter and comedian Stephen Colbert.

On CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, Harris repeatedly dodged questions about her economic policy proposals and if the Biden administration's immigration policies were ""a mistake.""

While Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have ramped up their media appearances in recent weeks, the Democratic ticket still lags behind the Republican ticket in the number of formal interviews they have sat for.

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 69 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to at least 31 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far."

-North Carolina residents will see changes to early voting after Hurricane Helene

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program...Read more

84,Biden undermines Harris claim that Ron DeSantis is politicizing hurricane response: 'Doing a great job',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-undermines-harris-claim-ron-desantis-politicizing-hurricane-response-doing-great-job,2024-10-08T21:36:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

President Joe Biden praised GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for being ""cooperative"" and doing a ""great job"" in his response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, despite Vice President Kamala Harris slamming DeSantis for ""playing political games"" instead of doing his job in response to the storms.

NBC News reported Monday that DeSantis was denying phone calls from Harris' team. ""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games with this moment, in these crisis situations, these are the height of emergency situations, it's just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris told reporters Monday.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, President Joe Biden's opinion about the GOP Florida governor's response to Hurricane Helene and his preparation for Milton, diverged substantially from that of his vice president's.

""The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday, and I said - no - you're doing a great job, it's all being done well and we thank you for it,"" Biden said at a press conference from the White House Tuesday. ""There was a rough start in some places, but every governor, every governor - from Florida to North Carolina - has been fully cooperative and supportive.""

RON DESANTIS: 51 COUNTIES ARE UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY

After a DeSantis staffer told NBC on Monday that the Florida governor had chosen not to take the vice president's call, DeSantis later clarified that he was never even aware Harris was trying to contact him.

DeSantis also shot back at Harris' claims that he was playing politics with the storm, accusing her of being the actual culprit of engaging in political gamesmanship.

""I've worked on these hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now,"" DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning following reports of the vice president's criticism. ""Why, all of the sudden, is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics, we know it's because of her campaign.""

""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this,"" DeSantis added. ""The idea that I should be, like, worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is just quite frankly absurd.""

BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA; DESANTIS TELLS VP 'IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU KAMALA'

Biden, who has had multiple phone calls with DeSantis since Hurricane Helene began barreling down on the Southeast, told him and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to ""call him directly"" if any further support is needed. DeSantis, meanwhile, noted Tuesday morning that ""every"" one of his federal requests for more support have been answered.

DeSantis pointed out as well that, at the state level, he has been reallocating resources as necessary to help Florida's smaller communities that have fewer resources.

Fox News Digital also reached out to the Harris campaign for comment, but did not receive a response in advance of publication time.

As Florida continues to clean up the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, it is now preparing for a potentially even worse storm in Hurricane Milton and is calling on millions of residents to evacuate.

85,Islamic group calls out Jets for firing Robert Saleh after wearing Lebanon pin amid Israel war,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/islamic-group-calls-out-jets-firing-robert-saleh-after-wearing-lebanon-pin-amid-israel-war,2024-10-08T21:12:39Z,"Emmanuel Acho reacts to the New York Jets firing HC Robert Saleh after a 20-36 record and 2-3 start this season.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a statement on Tuesday addressing the firing of former New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh.

CAIR called on the Jets and owner Woody Johnson to explain reports that Saleh was escorted out of the building by security following his firing, and also brought up the fact that Saleh was fired just days after wearing a pin with the Lebanese flag amid ongoing attacks on the nation by Israel.

Saleh is of Lebanese descent and was the first Muslim head coach in NFL history.

""We commend Coach Robert Saleh for making history as the first American Muslim head coach in NFL history. Although no one should jump to conclusions about why the Jets fired Coach Saleh, the report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility -- especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks. We encourage the Jets to thoroughly explain its unusually hostile reported treatment of Coach Saleh,"" the statement read.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Jets for comment multiple times but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Both of Saleh's parents were born in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States ahead of his birth in 1979. Saleh previously wore the Lebanese flag on his arm during a game against the Giants, just weeks after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Saleh wore that patch during the week that NFL executive vice president of club business Peter O'Reilly released a statement encouraging players to represent their heritage via decals to the back of their helmets with their flags, while coaches added a patch to their team gear.

Saleh's decision to wear the patch in London on Sunday came amid Israel's ongoing strikes on Lebanon and Gaza as it seeks to combat Hamas and Hezbollah.

CAIR's point that Johnson ""has been accused of making racially charged remarks,"" references an investigation in 2020 that never confirmed whether Johnson made those remarks. Johnson was accused of making racist and sexist comments to staff while serving as an ambassador to the United Kingdom under the Trump administration. Johnson was investigated in July 2020 by the State Department watchdog after the allegations.

Johnson denied the allegations in a post on the official X (then known as Twitter) account for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. that same month.

FORMER JETS QUARTERBACK REVISITS AWKWARD HUG BETWEEN ROBERT SALEH, ARRON RODGERS AFTER FIRING

""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times. These false claims of insensitive remarks about race and gender are totally inconsistent with my longstanding record and values,"" Johnson wrote.

The investigation's findings have never been made public.

At the time, Johnson was not involved with the Jets, as he was tending to his diplomatic duties for Trump. Still, the Jets released a statement regarding the allegations against Johnson and noted his denial of them.

""Since the Johnson family became owners of the New York Jets, the organization has consistently and actively supported, engaged and encouraged the development of many different social justice, diversity, women's, and inclusion initiatives,"" the team said in a statement. ""One of our fundamental principles is treating employees, players, coaches and fans with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, color, religion, or gender. These principles have been established by the Johnson family, which Woody implemented in our organization over the past 20 years.""

Saleh was hired by the Jets in January 2021 while Johnson was in the final month of his duties as ambassador to the U.K. Therefore, the owner did not make the final decision to hire Saleh. It was Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, who made the decision to hire Saleh.

When Trump left office and Woody Johnson returned to his duties as Jets owner, he kept Saleh employed for three straight seasons, none of which resulted in trips to the playoffs or winning records. Saleh went 20-36 with New York and never won more than seven games a year while at the helm.

Then, when Saleh was fired on Tuesday, the coach was reportedly escorted out of the team facility by security, according to multiple reports. The most recent head coach to be fired by the Jets, Adam Gase, was fired after the conclusion of his second season and was reportedly not removed by security.

The Jets were off to a 2-3 start this year after losing to the Minnesota Vikings 23-17 in London on Sunday, as New York is among the most penalized teams in the league this year. The Jets have struggled this year despite veteran star quarterback Aaron Rodgers starting all five games this season."
86,"If 2024 polling errors mirror those in 2020 election, Trump 'wins in a blowout,' CNN data guru says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/2024-polling-errors-mirror-those-2020-election-trump-wins-blowout-cnn-data-guru-says,2024-10-08T20:50:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that if the 2024 presidential election polls are as off as they were in 2020, former President Trump ""wins in a blowout.""

Enten broke down current swing state polling numbers between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, noting that they show a race ""too close to call."" However, he pointed out that polls have been off significantly in recent elections, and if that's the case this time, Trump could win by a landslide.

""But let's say we have a polling miss like we had in 2020,"" Enten told CNN anchor John Berman.

""What happens then? Well, then Donald Trump wins the election in a blowout with 312 electoral votes because he carries all these Great Lake battleground states plus Nevada, plus the other states he was leading in -- Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia,"" he said.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

The reporter began by displaying the close race numbers between Trump and Harris in the seven battleground states. As his aggregate polls showed, Harris is up by one point in Nevada and Pennsylvania, and up by two in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump, on the other hand, is up by one in North Carolina and Georgia, and two points up in Arizona.

Enten reminded viewers that these point differences are within the polling margin of error according to FiveThirtyEight, so currently, it's impossible to know who is winning.

He mentioned that on average since 1972 - provided that presidential candidates are polling within ten points of one another ­- swing state polls have an error rate of 3.4 points, so there is room for the actual race to swing in Harris' or Trump's favor when they're within one or two points of each other.

He further noted that in 5% of cases, swing state polling can be off by 9.4 points, making things even less certain for people looking at the polls right now.

""So, the bottom line is, the state polling averages tell us- what it tells us is it's just a race that is too close to call. Maybe one candidate has an advantage over the other one. But the bottom line is, it is way too close to call and it will remain so,"" he said.

Still, Enten offered multiple hypothetical situations, the first one being what the election results would look like if the current swing state polling is 100% accurate. ""If the polls are exactly right, Kamala Harris gets 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 262 because she carries those Great Lake battleground states despite losing North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona.""

He then followed up by showing what would happen if polling errors matched those found in the 2020 election. According to Vanderbilt University, polls overstated President Biden's lead over Trump by 3.9 percentage in the two weeks prior to election day, calling it the ""largest polling error since 1980 when support for Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter was overestimated by 6 percentage points.""

Enten argued if today's polls had the similar errors of the last cycle, Trump could walk away with 312 electoral college votes to Harris' 226.

Conversely, Enten discussed what would happen if polling errors predicting a red wave in the 2022 midterm elections appeared on Nov. 5, 2024.

""What happens if we have a polling miss like 2022?"" he asked. ""Well, in that particular case, now, the winner has flipped again. And Kamala Harris wins in a blowout with 319 electoral votes because she retakes those Great Lake battleground states, carries North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona."""
87,"Reporter's Notebook: With no government shutdown, it feels like Christmas in September",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reporters-notebook-no-government-shutdown-feels-like-christmas-september,2024-10-08T20:39:29Z,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest news emerging from Hurricane Helene as FEMA struggles with funding.

Triangles of orange and yellow candy corn are now spread around the house. Reese's Cups have now morphed into chocolate and peanut butter pumpkins from their original, fluted wafer form. The dog regularly freaks out when you take it for a walk and some mechanical ghoul begins cackling in an evil laugh when you 'round a corner in your neighborhood.

The calendar flipped seamlessly from September to October. It's especially seamlessly in Congress. And while September is ""government shutdown season"" on Capitol Hill, Congress escaped unscathed this year. Bipartisan lawmakers approved a stopgap spending measure which keeps the lights on through Dec. 20. That's why those who toil on Capitol Hill - or for the federal government - can enjoy the ""Halloween"" season this October. They don't have to focus on ""Continuing Resolutions"" to keep the government afloat. They can instead embrace apparitions rather than appropriations.

September's salvation also rescued Thanksgiving next month. It's customary for Congress to approve a stopgap spending bill or two each fall. Depending on the congressional schedule - and if it's an election year - one might run the government through mid-October, or later. Another may punt until just before Thanksgiving or just afterward.

But this year's emergency spending plan is special. It funds the government for autumn. All of October. All of November. It expires just before Christmas. So does everyone on Capitol Hill get to celebrate Christmas? Don't bank on on it.

You got Halloween and Thanksgiving. Two out of three ain't bad.

""Why have we picked December 20th?,"" asked Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., during a meeting of the House Rules Committee prepping the temporary spending package. ""Because it's the same reason we always have (with) December 20th. Everybody up here is human. There are no AIs or robots in Congress. And when you get to December 20th, you're five days from Christmas. You're four days from Christmas Eve. And you desperately want to be there with your family. This is when the leadership here has the maximum influence.""

FORMER NIH OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF MAKING EMAILS 'DISAPPEAR' PLEADS FIFTH TO COVID SUBCOMMITTEE

Massie argues that bipartisan congressional leaders choose such a date so they can maximize their leverage over members. The proximity to the holiday helps leaders wrangle the votes to pass another spending plan - anything - to avoid a holiday government shutdown.

Massie said he's been in meetings where a Speaker of the House basically threatens Republicans that they'd better vote 'yes' on a spending measure.

""(He) walks in and says 'If you vote for this you can go home and unwrap presents with your kids. And if you don't vote for this, you're going to spend Christmas here with Nancy Pelosi.' And then the chants start. 'Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!' Literally, people get enthusiastic to vote for something that they haven't read,"" said Massie.

The soupcon of jet fumes will permeate the Capitol in mid-December as lawmakers try to fund the government and avoid a shutdown over Christmas. The question is how long a spending plan might run? Deep into calendar year 2025? Maybe until February? Perhaps late March as some conservatives advocated? Or, will lawmakers actually reach an agreement on the 12 annual spending bills or even knock a few out, one by one?

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is ruling out an ""omnibus."" He's also spoken out about doing ""minibuses."" That's where they glom several spending measures together. It's not an ""omnibus."" It's smaller, hence the ""Volkswagen"" comparison.

What would Herbie the Love Bug say?

However, the length of another interim spending plan likely hinges on which party controls the House and Senate next year - as well as who won the White House. The wishes of the President-elect will prompt lawmakers to bend the spending bill in his or her direction.

But in September, the goal was to avert a shutdown - and hash out the hard stuff later.

""We're out of time. We cannot afford a shutdown,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., last month. ""This path ensures Americans aren't needlessly punished with a costly shutdown and allows, importantly, the next president, to have a say in the appropriations process.""

Even though the Democratically-controlled Senate advanced zero spending bills on the floor this year, the Republican-operated House did a little better, approving five appropriations measures. But Cole partly blamed his own GOP colleagues for the legislative stumbles.

""We're the majority. The majority ought to be governing,"" said Cole.

He added that it was ""disappointing"" that the House GOP majority had to again rely on Democrats to avert a shutdown.

That's why Cole and others hope the House is able to knock out a few if not the remainder of outstanding spending bills after the election. Otherwise, a harrowing holiday season awaits.

Like Massie, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tex., warned against ""a crazy, massive, omnibus train, which is the inevitability of doing something right before Christmas.""

So how is Johnson going to manage this? Especially with the distinct possibility of Congress having to boost FEMA with an ""immediate needs"" bill nearly as soon as lawmakers return in mid-November? Then there's the question of a shutdown in December. And that's to say nothing of approving some plan to address Hurriances Helene and Milton along with other natural disasters.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ALL ABOUT THE POLITICS OF DISASTER RELIEF

By the way, if it's clear Democrats lost the Senate, failed to capture the House and lost the presidency, there's a good chance they'll balk at assisting Republicans with any spending bills. That could well launch the potential second-term of former President Donald Trump under a government shutdown.

There are headaches galore for Mike Johnson as he attempts to fund the government, address multiple crises, satisfy irate conservatives who are already grumbling about his leadership and possibly cling to power. Calling the wrong play could jeopardize Johnson's status in the Speaker election on January 3 if Republicans maintain the majority.

But, what is the right play call for Johnson? No one knows. Johnson tried to appease the right with a spending plan which included a provision to require proof of citizenship to vote last month. However, Republicans couldn't even pass their own bill. In other words, kowtowing to the margins doesn't automatically guarantee success in the House Republican Conference.

But regardless, there was little drama passing the interim spending bill to avoid a government shutdown in late September.

That opened the door for the denizens of Capitol Hill to enjoy the end of the rest of the month. Embrace Halloween in October. Even Thanksgiving.

Face it. Christmas came early this year. In September. There was no government shutdown.

Which is why actual Christmas could be a nightmare this year."

A package of crystal meth from Europe shut down a board of elections office in New York for hours this week.

The Dutchess County Board of Elections office shut down for three hours on Monday, when officials discovered a suspicious package from Europe, sparking a Hazmat team to respond to the office and investigate.

""It came in through UPS from Greece. Prior to Greece, the inner envelope had been around a few other countries as well including France and then UPS'ed to the Dutchess County Board of Elections,"" Republican Elections Commissioner Erik Haight told the MidHudson News. ""The FBI is involved and I know they will be working with the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office and State Police to determine who sent this to us and why.""

A bipartisan team of BOE employees flagged the suspicious package to commissioners, with the team then donning Personal Protective Equipment to further investigate the package before calling law enforcement. The Dutchess County HAZMAT team ultimately responded to the scene, according to a press release from the county's board of elections.

89,Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-iran-biggest-us-adversary-china,2024-10-08T19:40:49Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told the women of ABC's 'The View' that she would put a greater emphasis on small businesses and crimes against women and children.

Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said the regime is America's biggest foe.

In a sit-down with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.""

""This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""

Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.

""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,"" she told Bill Whitaker.

The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows -- as China is thought by many to be foe No. 1.

""Iran is our biggest adversary, not China?,"" Mary Kissel, former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America's greatest adversary rather than China,"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.

""Really? It's not Russia? It's not China? A middle power is America's greatest adversary?"" Iranian nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.

Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel -- at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,"" she said.

Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,"" asserting it is ""without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""

Still, she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She added, ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

""China is the far greater threat just about, I think, everyone's estimation,"" said Rob Greenway, a former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as a threat, then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""

Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctions on Iran, which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period,"" and prompted the turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

During a rally last week, Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets from oil sales.

""If they have somebody who was kidnapped, it's always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump said. ""Somebody else gets like $4,000.""

Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on Monday.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But ""it's not enforcing any sanctions,"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion per year from oil sales.

Last week, Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv, many of them intercepted by both Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran's proxies have long attacked both Israeli and U.S. postures, it was the regime's first direct attack on Israel since April.

Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S. administration,"" Greenway said.

HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE

The Trump administration's policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""

After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran, the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb to 7,000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear weapon.) It went from exporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump administration's harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.

Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

Last week, Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was ""proportional,"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'"""

Increased support from Republicans appears to be one factor fueling Vice President Kamala Harris with four weeks to go until Election Day in her White House showdown with former President Trump, according to a new national poll.

The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee stands at 49% support among likely voters nationwide, with the former president and GOP nominee at 46%, in a New York Times/Siena College survey released on Tuesday.

According to the poll, Harris stands at 47% and Trump at 44% in a multi-candidate field. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver each grabbed 1%, with roughly 7% supporting another candidate or undecided.

Harris' edge - which is within the survey's sampling error - is up from the New York Times/Siena poll from last month, when the two major party nominees were deadlocked at 47%.

The top-line number in the new poll is in the range of most other national surveys, which indicate the vice president with a slight edge over Trump.

The poll indicates Harris' support among Republican voters stands at 9%, up four points from last month.

As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court Republicans disgruntled with Trump, Harris last week teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience as she formally endorsed the Democrat presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The new poll also indicated Harris consolidating her support among older voters, and for the first time taking a slight edge over Trump in being identified as the candidate of change.

That's crucial in a race where voters have repeatedly shared with pollsters that they think the country's headed in the wrong direction. And the Trump campaign, feeding off such polling data, has repeatedly tied Harris to President Biden and their administration in the nearly three months since she replaced her boss at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket.

The poll was conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 6, with 3,385 likely voters nationwide questioned. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points."

""Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?"" Whitaker asked.

""I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong ... than a pathological liar like Donald Trump,"" Walz told the journalist.

""But I think it comes down to the question of whether - whether you can be trusted to tell the truth,"" Whitaker followed.

During his appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Walz shrugged off the criticism.

""60 Minutes"" defended its coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal while taking a swipe at former President Trump for skipping an interview for its traditional election special.

CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley addressed the behind-the-scenes drama that unfolded between the network and the Trump campaign leading up to the now-scrapped sit-down.

Pelley said that the campaign ""offered shifting explanations"" for its apparent reversal.

""First, it complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story,"" Pelley said. ""Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020. Trump claims correspondent Lesley Stahl said in that interview that Hunter Biden's controversial laptop came from Russia. She never said that.""

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Pelley was likely referring to comments Trump told reporters last week when CBS News announced the former president would not be appearing on ""60 Minutes.""

""Last time I did an interview with them, if you remember, they challenged on the computer. They said the laptop from Hell was from Russia. And I said it wasn't from Russia, it was from Hunter. And I never got an apology. So, I'm sort of waiting,"" Trump said. ""I'd love to do '60 Minutes.' I do everything. I mean, I do you right now, right? And you're tougher than '60 Minutes' frankly. The laptop from Hell was from Hunter. It wasn't from me ... Lesley Stahl, we got into a little bit of an argument on the camera, talking about that and other things. And you know, they really owed me an apology.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREED TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Pelley didn't mention how Stahl dismissed the laptop scandal during her interview with Trump shortly before the 2020 election.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal,"" referring to reports about the email's contents showing his involvement in his son's overseas business dealings.

""He's not,"" Stahl replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually went on and verified the infamous laptop in 2022. Numerous other mainstream media outlets dismissed or downplayed the laptop initially before eventually acknowledging its authenticity.

Pelley also doubled down on CBS News' assertion that Trump ""backed out"" of the interview after the Trump campaign insisted it never committed to one.

""The Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. They also asked us whether we would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was grazed in an assassination attempt. We agreed,"" Pelley told viewers. ""On September 9th, Trump's Communications Director Steven Cheung sent a text that said, quote, 'I'm working with our advance team to see logistically if Butler would work in addition to the sit-down.' 'Sit-down' meaning the interview in Florida. Days later, Cheung called to say, quote, 'The president said yes.' Then, a week ago, Trump backed out.""

Last week, Cheung denied Trump had ever officially accepted the invitation, posting on X, ""There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in."""
93,North Carolina residents will see changes to early voting after Hurricane Helene,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-residents-see-changes-early-voting-after-hurricane-helene,2024-10-08T18:33:53Z,"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier explains how disaster declarations in counties are causing closures for some boards of elections offices on 'Special Report.'

North Carolina election officials are adjusting their voting rules to ensure residents in areas impacted by the recent hurricane damage can vote early in the upcoming election.

Hurricane Helene made a damaging sweep across the southeast, covering swing states that had already started early voting.

But the storm caused severe damage to several predominantly red counties and early voting centers as focus shifted to disaster relief.

On Monday, the North Carolina Elections Board passed a bipartisan emergency resolution that reformed the state's early voting process in 13 counties. Notably, all except one, Buncombe, voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020.

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

The adjustments include changing or adding voting sites and maintaining their availability, extending the hours when a voting site is open, and adding or reducing days that any site is open within the early voting period, according to the election board.

Voters in these counties will also have more time to request an absentee ballot, with the deadline being Nov. 4.

RESIDENTS IN KEY NORTH CAROLINA DISTRICT REVEAL HOW THEY THINK THEIR COUNTY WILL VOTE IN NOVEMBER

The state's elections board identified 13 counties in western North Carolina as the most impacted by the hurricane.

The counties that will see the changes applied to their early voting processes include: Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, and Yancey.

Voters in these counties will now have the option of turning in absentee ballots to another county's election board, rather than following previous protocol that mandated they only submit their ballots to their local counties.

Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020 by roughly 1.4 percentage points, and early voting has since been made a focus of Republican ground game efforts this cycle, the state's GOP told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.

The former president, however, told Fox News that he believes despite the storm's impact, voters will still turn out for the election.

""I believe they're going to go out and vote if they have to crawl to a voting booth,"" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham in an interview that aired Monday. ""And that's what's happening.""

The former president added that his daughter-in-law, who co-chairs the Republican National Committee (RNC), is working on helping North Carolinians in impacted areas cast their votes.

""Lara is working on it. Other people are working on it, and we're trying to make it convenient for them, but they just lost their house,"" Trump said.

Tim Walz shared a laugh with host Jimmy Kimmel after the Democratic vice presidential nominee made a comical gaffe during his first appearance on late-night TV.

ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Democratic vice-presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., Monday night without disclosing that he has both endorsed and led fundraising for the Harris campaign.

The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" host hosted a celebrity-studded fundraiser in June that raised tens of millions of dollars for the then-Biden-Harris campaign and lent his name to a Harris campaign fundraising email last month, in which he endorsed Harris for president and trashed former President Trump.

Viewers would have missed those details in his interview with Walz, where they talked about the Harris campaign's vision for America, softened the vice-presidential candidate's recent gaffes with jokes and slammed the Trump campaign.

The anti-Trump late night host made no mention that he is backing the Harris-Walz campaign while giving Walz a late night network platform to speak to voters.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

During the interview, Kimmel called Walz a ""really nice man"" that the country needs, and referred to him as ""America's sweetheart.""

In turn, Walz told Kimmel about his campaign's positive vision for the country, noting that they will ""turn the page"" on the Trump era.

""For me, and being an eternal optimist, I always say that. I supervised a high school lunchroom - you're an optimist or you're dead,"" he said, adding, ""This idea that look, we get to turn the page on that, and I plan on waking up on November 6 with Madam President.""

Kimmel poked fun at Walz's last line, stating, ""I want to be clear, you won't be waking up together."" ""No,"" Walz replied laughing, as the host shot back, ""Unless you guys have gotten closer than we thought.""

""I have a problem about not being specific with my language. So thank you for that, specifically right,"" Walz responded, referencing the fact that he has been criticized for inaccurate claims about his career which he has chalked up to having ""misspoke.""

That Kimmel conducted a softball interview with Walz is no surprise considering how much the comedian has supported the Democratic presidential ticket.

JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS BIDEN'S TRUMP JOKE WAS CLEVER 'FOR A GUY WHO CAN'T PUT TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER'

In a joint September email from Kimmel and the Harris campaign that Fox News Digital recently obtained, the host stated, ""Sorry to break your cold little heart, Donald, but I endorse Kamala Harris for president. I've had the privilege of interviewing our Vice President several times. She is a kind, brilliant and delightful person who cares very much about our country.""

The email provided links for recipients to send money to the Harris-Walz campaign, and added another message from Kimmel. ""I want my four children to know I was on the right side of history (which is the left side). We need to protect our kids from the self-serving trolls who pretend to be fighting for 'freedom.' I believe in truth, justice and all the stuff we learned from Superman. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are our best hope in this battle for sanity.""

Kimmel also hosted a June fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign that featured celebrity guests George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and others, along with former President Barack Obama and raked in over $30 million for the Democratic ticket.

Kimmel's network, ABC, has also been scrutinized for its connections to the Harris-Walz campaign, as Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Vice President Kamala Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

The executive has donated to dozens of Democrats and contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003, when she ran for district attorney in San Francisco. She went on to donate to her subsequent campaigns for California Attorney General and U.S. Senate, as well as her 2020 White House bid. Harris even credited the Waldens for her marriage at a fundraiser in April 2022, which was held at their home in Los Angeles.

Former President Donald Trump holds a razor-thin two-point edge over Vice President Kamala Harris in battleground Arizona, according to a new public opinion poll.

Fueling the former president's margin appears to be support from voters age 50 and over.

Trump stands at 49% among likely voters in Arizona, with Harris at 47%, according to an AARP poll conducted Sept. 24-Oct. 1 and released on Tuesday. According to the survey, Green Party candidate Jill Stein grabs 1% support, with 3% undecided.

The survey points to a generational divide.

The poll also points to a gender gap in Arizona which favors Trump.

The former president and Republican nominee is up 11-points over the vice president and Democratic nominee among men, but down only 6 points among female voters, the survey indicates.

The survey is the latest to indicate a margin of error race between Harris and Trump in Arizona, a state President Biden narrowly carried over Trump in the 2020 election.

Arizona's one of seven crucial battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's White House victory four years ago and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump win the 2024 election.

""It bothers the heck out of me that we're thinking about electing a person that just six weeks ago... told us 'Oh, Biden's on top of it. He's really aggressive and really knows what he's doing,'"" Oberhaus said.

""We all seen that in the debate, you know, he's past his time,"" he said of Biden's June debate with former President Trump that preceded his campaign suspension.

Critics have claimed Trump is bad for farmers, pointing to his fondness for tariffs and his past trade conflict with China. But Oberhaus said the tariffs, which ramped up in 2018, ""certainly didn't hurt us.""

""We're much better off with tariffs than having that government printing press printing out money,"" he added.

At Cozy Nook Farm, Oberhaus said their biggest struggle has been inflation. ""We've been [eaten] alive by inflation,"" he claimed.

He explained that they do not set their own prices, and they tend to ""run a couple of years behind everybody else.""

""Little town of Whitewater 35 minutes away,"" he said. ""It's a town of, what, 15,000 people? And then they got a thousand new immigrants.""

Local Wisconsin outlets reported that last year Whitewater Police Chief Daniel Meyer and City Manager John Weidl penned a letter to Biden, asking for help after the ""rapid increase"" of about 800 to 1,000 immigrants since 2022.

With a second powerful hurricane in less than two weeks bearing down on Florida, President Biden on Tuesday canceled an upcoming international trip in order to oversee federal storm preparations and response efforts.

As the death toll rises and nearly 200,000 people remain without power or running water over a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, Hurricane Milton - an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm - is on course to slam into Florida on Wednesday.

""Given the projected trajectory and strength of Hurricane Milton, President Biden is postponing his upcoming trip to Germany and Angola in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton, in addition to the ongoing response to the impacts of Hurricane Helene across the Southeast,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Tuesday.

The president was scheduled to leave for Berlin on Thursday, followed by a stop in Angola before returning home on Oct. 15. The trip would have marked Biden's first stop on the African continent during his tenure as president.

EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, the president called Milton a potentially ""devastating"" storm that could be one of the worst to hit Florida in a century. He also urged anyone under an evacuation order to ""evacuate now, now, now.""

""It's a matter of life and death,"" Bien emphasized.

Biden also said he spoke on Monday with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, adding that the conservative governor had been cooperative and that he gave his personal phone number to DeSantis.

When asked about the federal storm response, DeSantis said during a news conference on Monday that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds... the president has approved what we asked for... I'm thankful for that.""

""Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved,"" DeSantis highlighted.

The governor reiterated those comments Tuesday morning in an interview on ""Fox and Friends.""

""Every request that we've made - I've been in contact with the president, I've been in contact with the FEMA director,"" DeSantis highlighted. ""All of our requests have been answered.""

While DeSantis has complimented the president's actions, he has taken aim at Vice President Kamala Harris. The Democrats' presidential nominee on Monday - reacting to reports that the governor had refused to take her calls regarding federal storm efforts - described him as ""selfish.""

When asked about the dispute, DeSantis argued in his ""Fox and Friends"" interview that ""my focus has not been on dealing with Kamala Harris. I saw the news report. I didn't know that she tried to contact me. But I'd also say it's not about you, Kamala. It's about the people of Florida. My focus is exactly where it should be.""

""I've worked on these Hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She's never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now. Why all of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games,"" DeSantis charged.

The war of words appeared to be triggered by reports from NBC and later ABC News on Monday afternoon that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

When asked a couple of hours later, DeSantis said he was not aware Harris was trying to reach him.

""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""

Speaking around the same time, as she departed the nation's capital for New York, the vice president took aim at DeSantis.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations...is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris charged. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

However, DeSantis, pushing back in his Fox News interview, argued that ""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this. The idea that I should be...worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is quite frankly absurd.""

When asked if his vice president has been helpful as the federal government deals with back-to-back dangerous hurricanes, Biden nodded and told reporters ""yes.""

Harris, speaking on Tuesday on the popular daytime program ""The View,"" said ""I have called and talked with, in the course of this crisis, this most recent crisis, with Democrat and Republican governors.... So, obviously, this is not an issue that is about partisanship or politics for certain leaders, but maybe it's for others.""

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump, for a week and a half, has been repeatedly attacking Biden and Harris over the federal response to Hurricane Helene, and making unproven claims.

On Monday, Harris clapped back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

Congress recently freed up $20 billion for the disaster fund, but officials have called on Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill.

Critics quickly pointed to FEMA's role in distributing more than $650 million in funds to help illegal immigrants as part of its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). Former President Trump recently accused the Biden administration of stealing FEMA money ""for their illegal immigrants.""

However, the Biden administration has noted that that funding, which comes from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is congressionally appropriated for grants to local governments and nonprofits, is entirely separate from the significantly larger Disaster Relief Fund.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA said in a release this week.

It has still faced questions from some Republican senators about whether its ""entanglement"" in the border crisis has affected its operational readiness.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., meanwhile, told Fox News Digital last week that the administration has ""failed in that response.""

""They are scrambling to cover their egregious errors and mistakes. And there's an effort to blame others or blame circumstances when this is just purely a lack of leadership and response,"" the speaker said.

FEMA also faced backlash last week after its unearthed emergency management ""equity"" blueprint went viral. The number one goal listed in the Biden-Harris agency's priorities is to ""instill equity as a foundation of emergency management.""

According to FEMA's plan, ""Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot be optional.""

This week, FEMA has been pushing back against claims that FEMA grants have to be repaid, that it is restricting airspace for rescue and recovery operations, and that it is distributing aid based on demographic characteristics. It has published a fact sheet to check some of those claims.

Mayorkas, who was impeached by the Republican-led House this year, on Monday again stressed that there is help available for those who need it, and warned of the effects of misinformation.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""What happens is the people who are victimized by the natural disaster are the ones who will suffer,"" he said. ""It sows distrust in their government, and therefore they don't seek the help that they truly need.""

""We have funds to put in their pockets to be able to help them address immediate needs. These individuals are not seeking that relief because of the disinformation, the intentionally false information they are receiving.""

99,Kamala Harris's 'joy' is quietly turning to panic for Democrats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harriss-joy-quietly-turning-panic-democrats,2024-10-08T16:59:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a made-up media story, I saw it, but with less than a month to go, the joy is gone and a quiet panic is setting in.

In the first week of August I was, appropriately enough, in Harrisburg, Pa. and Democrats I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.

Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn't love how Biden had been shown the door but that they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month, it sure looked that way.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

In San Francisco, most voters I spoke to, red and blue alike, felt like Harris was likely to win, that the Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA, gotten a jump, and was back on the road.

Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden, quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and much like a new restaurant opening in a small town, voters were eager to give her a try.

While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional interviews or hold so much as one press conference, her arrogant advisers smirked and said basically, ""So what? She's winning.""

Well, she's not winning anymore, and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this week, showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.

Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America's influence with our Middle East ally Israel, the veep once again proved herself to be a walking, talking salad bar, here is what she had to say:

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying, ""we're trying,"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.

Over the past two weeks in my travels, it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about the presidential race, much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is avoiding the sports page, they just don't want to talk about it.

As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it, ""I don't know, she's just kind of there.""

It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny, when joy gave way to frustration, but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her, and the massive union's internal polling showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

It was only after that, that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back in August, namely, ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.

Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference, something he is at least still capable of, quipping ""I'm back in.""

Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge, they insist she still leads in the polling averages, she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox, and a ground game that Trump can only envy.

These points are all true, and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf and not grassroots, much like her crowning as the nominee, but those busloads of supporters in matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.

But still, there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today, ""60 Minutes"" wasn't it, and her appearances on podcasts, late night shows, and ""The View"" make her look like she is pitching a new Rom Com, not running for president of the United States.

The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the joy is gone, and it is, the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage, against the dying of the light."

Harris scheduled interviews on ""The View,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" and with radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday, who have all expressed open support for Harris or Democrats in general.

""I vote we put this woman into that Black job,"" she declared.

Co-host Ana Navarro, a Republican who has supported Democratic candidates since 2016 and hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention, asked Harris bluntly at the end of the interview if she would come back on the show ""when"" she's elected president.

""The current administration are very, very responsible,"" Demesio Guerrero, a Trump supporter at a GOP Hispanic outreach event in Clark County, Nevada, told Fox News Digital in response to a question about recently released ICE data showing tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sexual assault and murder convictions are living in the United States.

""They are like traitors of the United States. Because you know what, all the crimes, all the innocent Americans that are dying every day in many, many, many cities in the United States are the result of those criminals being loose.""

Blanca Fox, a Trump campaign volunteer originally from Guatemala, told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration should have warned the American public about the ICE numbers.

Lydia Dominguez, a Trump supporter from Clark County who spoke on a panel at the Latinos for Trump event, told Fox News Digital that ""there is a crisis occurring at the border.""

""Between the drugs, the human trafficking, and now the millions of illegal immigrants that we have crossing over that we have not vetted or that have actually been charged for murder in other countries,"" Dominguez said. ""So it's alarming what's happening at the border.""

""They say that that's only a very small group,"" RNC Hispanic communications director Jaime Florez told Fox News Digital about criminal illegal aliens in the United States. ""You know, try to explain those statistics to the parents of the girl that was killed in the University of Georgia. When 10 million people come into this country without being vetted in any way, it is impossible to think that no criminal is going to come among them.""

Former Texas congressional candidate Rolando Rodriguez told Fox News Digital that he grew up around the border and explained that today it is a ""disaster like never before in the history of this nation and probably in the history of the world.""

This week, a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys showed that Harris leads Trump among Hispanic voters in the key swing states of Nevada and Arizona, but also showed Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago.

""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

The Hispanic voters who spoke to Fox News Digital expressed a similar sentiment to what was highlighted in the polling and said they expect Trump will increase his numbers with Hispanic voters in 2024, in part because of the immigration crisis.

""President Reagan used to say Hispanics are Republicans. They just don't know it yet,"" Florez told Fox News Digital. ""We're finding out.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected hearing a Republican-backed challenge to an executive order signed by President Biden that works to broaden voting access and registration, just roughly one month before Election Day.

The Supreme Court reconvened Monday for its 2024-2025 term and rejected a bevvy of cases, including one backed by dozens of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania who claimed President Biden's 2021 executive order on voter access was unconstitutional and attempted to interfere with the election. The lawsuit also targeted an edict from Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro for enacting automatic voter registration across the state.

The justices did not comment when rejecting the appeal.

Shapiro's office took a victory lap following the Supreme Court's rejection of hearing the case, calling GOP efforts a ""bad faith attempt"" to disenfranchise voters.

""This petition was yet another bad faith attempt to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters - and the U.S. Supreme Court made the right decision to deny the Pennsylvania Freedom Caucus petition,"" Shapiro spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

GOP STATE LAWMAKERS APPEAL TO SCOTUS TO CHALLENGE BIDEN'S 'USURPATIONS' OF THEIR POWER TO RUN ELECTIONS

""Governor Shapiro has consistently fought to protect our democracy - including defeating Donald Trump and his allies in court dozens of times to defend Pennsylvanians' votes and protect access to the ballot box. Yesterday, election deniers went 0-2 at the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Bonder said.

Biden signed the executive order on Promoting Access to Voting in March 2021, which directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration, works to overhaul the government's Vote.gov website, and notes that the federal government has a ""duty to ensure that registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for all those eligible to do so.""

DOJ 'STONEWALLING' REQUESTS FOR DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF BIDEN'S 'FEDERAL ELECTION SCHEME'

Executive Order 14019 states that ""executive departments and agencies should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information.""

The executive order set off a firestorm of criticism among Republicans, most notably with 27 Republican Pennsylvania lawmakers filing a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, Fox News Digital previously reported.

The lawmakers argued that the executive order essentially serves as an executive get-out-the-vote effort targeting demographics that would benefit the Democratic Party. They argued the move was unconstitutional as Congress never enacted a law that grants such an action from the White House.

A federal judge rejected the lawsuit in March, citing it lacked legal standing, setting up a legal showdown in the U.S. Supreme Court.

""We think it's really important for President Biden to be held accountable,"" Erick Kaardal, an attorney for the lawmakers, told Fox News Digital in April.

""For him to violate such a big law when all the little people have to follow the laws, even little laws ... it's clear President Biden has issued an executive order without congressional enactments to get himself re-elected. It's ridiculous,"" Kaardal added.

BIDEN'S GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EXECUTIVE ORDER CHALLENGED, HEADING TO SUPREME COURT: 'TARGET WELFARE POPULATIONS'

In their petition filed to the Supreme Court in April, the Republican lawmakers asked the court to weigh in on the case. They argued that, for the 2024 election, they cannot ""do their part"" in suing to stop ""federal and state executive usurpations of Pennsylvania state law, pursuant to the Elections Clause and Electors Clause, unless the Court does its part and declares individual state legislator standing in this case.""

The lawmakers had called on the Supreme Court to bypass the federal appeals court, and determine if they have standing to bring the case ahead of the 2024 election.

Following the court's rejection of the case, Shapiro's office told Fox Digital that the governor is zeroed-in on ""protecting our democracy and ensuring our elections are free, fair, safe, and secure.""

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., is unveiling a new bill called the ""No Guns for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would explicitly ban illegal immigrants from buying firearms using government-issued IDs.

He also expressed support for former President Trump's controversial mass deportations plan, which would likely be the largest such move in U.S. history, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed criminal illegal aliens to enter our country and roam our streets. Meanwhile, radical liberals like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are offering driver's licenses to illegals - creating a recipe for disaster,"" Clyde told Fox News Digital.

""As we await President Trump's historic mass deportation effort, we must ensure illegal aliens with government-issued IDs cannot obtain firearms and wreak havoc on our communities.""

It's the latest move in a wider push by House Republicans to direct attention to crime perpetuated in the U.S. by illegal immigrants after several high-profile incidents in the last few years, including the killings of Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

FOCUS GROUP REACTS TO TRUMP CLAIM THAT MIGRANTS ARE 'EATING THE DOGS' IN OHIO TOWN

The three high-profile killings did not involve a gun, but Clyde argued that progressive policies allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses could open the door to more crime.

Clyde, a gun store owner, has had his own firearms license for over 30 years, according to his office.

As of now, 19 states plus Washington, D.C., offer driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also recently developed a pilot program to distribute federal IDs called ""Secure Docket Cards"" to people who cross the border illegally and are awaiting immigration proceedings. It's not immediately clear if these IDs can be used to purchase guns, however.

The rate of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is lower than that of U.S. citizens, according to a study by the National Institute of Justice.

But Republicans argue that the act of entering the U.S. illegally is a crime in itself, and that instances of violent crime by such groups could be prevented just by having tougher border and immigration laws.

Officials in Oregon announced Monday that they have identified an additional 302 people on the state's voter rolls who didn't provide proof of citizenship when they were registered to vote.

The announcement comes just two weeks after officials in the Beaver state said 1,259 possible noncitizens have been registered to vote since 2021, bringing the total number of mistaken registrations to 1,561.

The mistakes occurred in part because Oregon passed a law in 2019 allowing some residents who aren't citizens to obtain driver's licenses. And the state's so-called ""Motor Voter"" law, which took effect in 2016, automatically registers most people to vote when they seek a new license or ID.

OREGON MISTAKENLY REGISTERED NEARLY 1,260 POSSIBLE NONCITIZENS TO VOTE, DMV ADMITS

The improper voter registrations stem from clerical errors at the state DMV.

On Monday, the DMV released an ""After Action Report,"" which identified errors in its processes that led to the mistakes, with Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade then directing county elections officials to inactivate all 302 voter registrations.

Griffin-Valade and Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, both Democrats, called for an independent, external audit of the motor voter system in a joint statement.

""Thanks to the swift action of elections officials, I have full confidence that these new errors will not impact the 2024 election,"" Griffin-Valade said. ""The DMV's After Action Report raises serious concerns about this important part of our voter registration system. The first step in restoring the public's trust in Motor Voter is a transparent review by a neutral third party operating under strict government auditing standards.""

DMV Administrator Amy Joyce said the agency believed two weeks ago that it was confident it understood and had reviewed all records at risk of error.

""We have since learned this confidence was misplaced based on new information outlined in this announcement and after-action report and for this, we are sorry,"" Joyce said in a statement. ""DMV will follow the Governor's directed actions and remains committed to continuous learning, corrective action, transparency and accountability.""

Griffin-Valade has ordered her office's elections division to immediately hire a new Motor Voter oversight position, according to the statement. And she has instructed the division to establish a documented process for performing regular data checks with the DMV and update the administrative rules governing the Motor Voter system.

She said the Oregon Elections Division will work with the 36 county election officers to determine if any of the erroneously registered voters have previously cast a ballot. Every registered voter in Oregon is sent a ballot in the mail and the state had an 81.97% voter turnout rate in 2020. President Biden beat former President Trump comfortably in the 2020 election, winning the state by more than 380,000 votes.

RNC BLASTS WALZ ADMIN'S NONANSWER ON HOW NONCITIZENS MADE IT ONTO MINNESOTA VOTER ROLLS: 'NO HYPOTHETICAL'

Of the 302 additional cases, 178 were due to people from the U.S. territory of American Samoa being misclassified as U.S. citizens, the DMV report said.

However, under federal law, people from American Samoa are U.S. nationals, not citizens, and don't have the same right to vote. Another 123 records stemmed from the previously identified clerical error, but weren't included in prior reviews due to a newly identified software issue. And one case was caught by the DMV's new quality controls.

Griffin-Valade's office says they are doing everything they can to prevent the 302 mistakenly registered voters from receiving a ballot, but cannot guarantee that all 302 ballots will be removed before they are mailed. Her office is putting in place a process that will ensure those ballots are not opened or counted.

Of the 1,259 possible noncitizens identified last month, 10 mistakenly enrolled individuals went on to cast a ballot, according to Oregon's secretary of state, although at least one became a citizen before voting.

A DMV audit found staff may have accidentally selected ""U.S. passport"" when presented with a foreign passport, or ""U.S. birth certificate"" when given a foreign document, triggering voter enrollment.

The DMV said its drop-down menu has now been rearranged so ""U.S. passport"" is no longer the first, default option. Staff must also enter the state and county for all U.S. birth certificates and respond to a prompt when passport information is entered confirming that the documentation is accurate.

About half of all states, as well as Washington, D.C., have implemented automatic voter registration, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But there have been numerous allegations of improper enrollment in states without automatic registration too.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in August that officials have purged 1.1 million ineligible names from the voter rolls since the 2020 presidential election.

Ohio's secretary of state referred 138 noncitizens believed to have voted in previous elections to the state's attorney general for possible criminal charges.

And a conservative watchdog group is suing Arizona's Maricopa County for allegedly failing to remove more than 35,000 people who did not provide proof of citizenship."

""60 Minutes"" recently disclosed that former President Trump canceled an interview with the program after demanding an apology for how it conducted a sit-down with him in 2020. He also allegedly complained that the CBS News show would ""fact-check"" him.

CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley revealed the information at the opening of the show's Monday night episode, which featured an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, explaining why a conversation with her opponent was absent.

""Then, a week ago, Trump backed out. The campaign offered shifting explanations. First, it complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story. Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020,"" Pelley said.

CBS NEWS CASTS LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

The reporter began by noting that it has been ""tradition for more than half a century"" that each major presidential candidate do an interview with the show the month prior to election day. He detailed how Trump's team had initially agreed to the interview but backed out last week.

""But, unfortunately, last week, Trump canceled. The Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. They also asked us whether we would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was grazed in an assassination attempt. We agreed,"" Pelley said.

He added that Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung initially negotiated the sit-down and told ""60 Minutes,"" ""The president said, 'Yes.'"" However, days later, the campaign declined the invitation.

In addition to explaining that Trump didn't want to be fact-checked, the campaign slammed veteran ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl for how she conducted her interview with Trump ahead of the 2020 election, demanding an apology for how she dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal during their conversation.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal."" ""He's not,"" Stahl replied. ""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually verified the laptop in 2022.

CBS TARRED AND FEATHERED FOR ADMITTING EXISTENCE OF HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP TWO YEARS AFTER NEW YORK POST REPORT

The network released a statement on X last week saying that Trump punted on the interview after agreeing to it. At the time, Cheung replied, calling it ""Fake News.""

""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented,"" he posted on X.

Cheung reiterated the statement when asked for comment by Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

He said, ""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on editing the President's answers with jump cuts, which is unprecedented... There was nothing scheduled or agreed upon. We had already long promised an exclusive on filming at Butler to another national outlet, which turned out to be Fox News. Also, President Trump wasn't even scheduled to be at Mar-a-Lago last Thursday, as we previously announced a campaign visit to Michigan."""
108,5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
109,'No guns for illegal aliens' bill rolled out by House GOP lawmaker,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/no-guns-illegal-aliens-bill-rolled-out-house-gop-lawmaker,2024-10-08T14:09:10Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A House lawmaker is raising concerns about the possibility of people who are in the country illegally being able to purchase firearms through the same process a U.S. citizen would use.

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., is unveiling a new bill called the ""No Guns for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would explicitly ban illegal immigrants from buying firearms using government-issued IDs.

He also expressed support for former President Trump's controversial mass deportations plan, which would likely be the largest such move in U.S. history, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BUSES MIGRANTS TO US BORDER AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BECOMES TOP ELECTION ISSUE

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed criminal illegal aliens to enter our country and roam our streets. Meanwhile, radical liberals like Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are offering driver's licenses to illegals -- creating a recipe for disaster,"" Clyde told Fox News Digital.

""As we await President Trump's historic mass deportation effort, we must ensure illegal aliens with government-issued IDs cannot obtain firearms and wreak havoc on our communities.""

It's the latest move in a wider push by House Republicans to direct attention to crime perpetuated in the U.S. by illegal immigrants after several high-profile incidents in the last few years, including the killings of Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

FOCUS GROUP REACTS TO TRUMP CLAIM THAT MIGRANTS ARE 'EATING THE DOGS' IN OHIO TOWN

The three high-profile killings did not involve a gun, but Clyde argued that progressive policies allowing illegal immigrants to obtain drivers' licenses could open the door to more crime.

Clyde, a gun store owner, has had his own firearms license for over 30 years, according to his office.

As of now, 19 states plus Washington, D.C., offer driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also recently developed a pilot program to distribute federal IDs called ""Secure Docket Cards"" to people who cross the border illegally and are awaiting immigration proceedings. It's not immediately clear if these IDs can be used to purchase guns, however.

The rate of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is lower than that of U.S. citizens, according to a study by the National Institute of Justice.

But Republicans argue that the act of entering the U.S. illegally is a crime in itself, and that instances of violent crime by such groups could be prevented just by having tougher border and immigration laws.

Ron DeSantis discusses Vice President Kamala Harris accusing him of 'political gamesmanship' on 'Hannity.'

Gov. Ron DeSantis hit back at Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday during an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity,"" as the Florida governor prepares for another hurricane, Hurricane Milton, to hit the state.

""For Kamala Harris to try to say my sole focus on the people of Florida is somehow selfish is delusional,"" DeSantis said. ""She has no role in this, in fact, she's been vice president for three and a half years, I've dealt with a number of storms under this administration, she's never contributed anything to any of these efforts.""

NBC News, and later ABC News, reported on Monday that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

Asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity if she has ever called before while preparing for hurricanes, DeSantis said, ""no.""

""She has no role in this process. I'm in contact with the President of the United States. I'm in contact with the FEMA director, I'm obviously managing all of our state agencies, we're supporting all our local government,"" he added.

When Harris was asked about DeSantis reportedly dodging her phone calls on Monday, the vice president accused him of playing politics.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris said to reporters on Monday. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

DeSantis said he worked well with both the Trump and the Biden administrations when it came to dealing with hurricane preparation and response efforts.

""She's the first one who's trying to politicize the storm, and she's doing that just because of her campaign,"" DeSantis said. ""I don't have time for political games. I've got people whose lives are on the line, I've got people whose homes and possessions are on the line, and we are focused 100% on that mission.""

Regarding the White House response, spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital, ""A wide range of leaders in both parties and from every affected state have praised the bipartisan response to Hurricane Helene. The Republican governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, has called the response 'superb.' Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said, 'They're doing a great job.' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said, 'We are seeing incredible help from the Federal government to the state.' The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he 'appreciated' President's Biden's offer to 'call him directly' with any 'other things we need.'""

Bates then listed other Republican officials, including Republican governor of Virginia and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who offered praise for Biden.

111,Fox News Power Rankings: The biggest surprises come after October,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-biggest-surprises-come-after-october,2024-10-08T13:04:54Z,"Fox News Poll Republican partner Daron Shaw on how Trump and Harris are polling with significant voter groups and in swing states ahead of the general election.

A Democratic win in Indiana. A Republican victory in New Mexico. And an election where Missouri was decided by less than 4,000 votes.

They've all happened in the last twenty years.

These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008, 2004, and 2008 again). At the time, they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.

Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close, one unexpected flip can decide who wins the White House.

Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week's forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump's 219.

Her advantage is no larger than it was in September, and as this column has mentioned, battleground states are usually - and mostly - won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this forecast are worth 78 votes, enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.

National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at 48%-48% with likely voters, while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48%, well within the polls' margins of sampling error.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUES

Neither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.

Battleground state polls have been sparse. (Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in Georgia and North Carolina, and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This will affect the accuracy of polling in these areas.)

Overall, this race is still anyone's game.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him, while Walz stumbled out of the gate.

A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always, wait for results from multiple polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.

That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)

Of course, it's the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And events in two categories have already resurfaced.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump's support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in 2020, and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark. Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.

Two states that could surprise in November

There are nine ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map. The two that would have the biggest impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.

Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential election, bringing his margin up to about 372,000 votes.

That's a win of 3.4 points, or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North Carolina, a toss-up in the rankings, which he won by 1.3 points.)

Republicans have strong advantages. The state's White working-class and senior voters lean towards Trump, while its large Hispanic population, particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, has shifted right in recent years.

The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration advantage, and most tellingly, the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.

Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race, where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has personally spent more than $8 million, means the presidential election is closer than people think. Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.

It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after the battlegrounds to go blue.

Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.

A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking, especially since Biden won this state by more than 10 points in 2020.

The state has a higher proportion of Black, suburban, and college-educated voters than the rest of the country, and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about Virginia after the June presidential debate, the race has changed, and neither party is making big investments in the state today.

Some polls show a race that isn't over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump's 42%.

Still, it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia remains a Likely D race.

Four weeks until election night

More than 1.5 million voters have cast their ballot as the countdown to election night continues. Early voting has now begun in:"

Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a slight edge over former President Donald Trump in a new poll released Tuesday that looked into which candidate voters view as the candidate representing change. Trump, however, maintained his lead among male voters and has kept the trust of most voters on economic issues.

The latest New York Times/Sienna College national poll found that if the election were held today, 49% of respondents would vote for Harris while 46% would vote for Trump. It marks the first time Harris has led Trump in the Times/Sienna poll since President Biden dropped out in July.

Harris took a slim lead among respondents who saw the vice president, not Trump, as a break from the status quo, garnering 46% compared with 44% for the former president.

Harris' lead in this category was greater when broken down into non-White and younger voters, garnering 61% and 58%, respectively, compared to 29% of non-White and 34% of younger voters favoring Trump, according to the poll.

Despite the slight change for Harris, the poll found Trump still maintained the majority of voter trust on what they consider their most important issues, such as the economy, with 48% compared to 46% for Harris.

Trump is also leading Harris with male voters by 11 points, a group which also favored Trump over Biden in the 2020 election, according to the poll.

While national polls are often a good indicator of the general mood among Americans, they don't always predict who will win elections, which often come down to important battleground states.

In the latest Fox News survey of registered voters in North Carolina, viewed as one such battleground state, Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over Trump, 50% to 48%. A month earlier, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

The ABC morning program commented on Harris' recent appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast Sunday night and the start of what some are referring to as a ""media blitz"" by Harris, who started making more stops on podcasts, radio shows and other programs. On Tuesday, she will do interviews with ""The View,"" Howard Stern and Stephen Colbert.

The panel praised Harris' media tour for reaching out to voters, with Goldberg pointing out that she is still the vice president alongside the ""acting president.""

""I think people should just know it is not easy to do what she's doing. Because she's still also the vice president, so she's still got other things she's supposed to be doing, as does our acting president Joe Biden,"" Goldberg said, in an apparent Freudian slip.

'THE VIEW' CO-HOST JOY BEHAR BEGS REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY: 'JUST DO IT THIS ONE TIME'

The term ""acting president"" historically refers to people who temporarily hold the position while the actual president is incapacitated, such as the vice president assuming the powers of the office while the president is having a medical procedure done. Biden stepped aside from seeking the 2024 Democratic nomination amid growing party concerns about his mental acuity and ability to defeat Donald Trump.

Other women on the panel also complimented Harris' upcoming media appearances, particularly her attention to podcasts.

""I've been saying for a while she should be doing these podcasts because one thing people are doing with their podcasts is everything else in their life. You can listen to a podcast and conquer life. So the amount in these audiences she's reaching is fascinating, and she is hitting it all,"" Sara Haines said.

Alyssa Farah Griffin added, ""I think it's incredibly smart. I would have done it two months ago, but I'm glad she did it.""

The Peach State could be critical to deciding the winner of the 2024 presidential race between Harris and former President Donald Trump.

The firm was hired to investigate the alleged gang takeover of the apartment building, the outlet said, and interviewed witnesses and reviewed video footage from the complex prior to issuing its report.

Former President Trump and Republicans across the swing state of Wisconsin are ramping up campaign efforts everywhere, including deep blue areas, to close the margins.

""In a state this tight, we have to get votes in every single corner of the state,"" Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Andrew Iverson told Fox News Digital.

""Closing the margins just a little bit makes a huge difference,"" he said.

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

This is paired with ""running up the score in red counties.""

The reason such an approach is necessary, he said, is ""this election will likely come down to 20,000-30,000 votes.""

In 2016, Trump defeated Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by one point and less than 30,000 votes. When President Biden beat Trump in the state during the next election in 2020, it was similarly by about 20,000 votes.

Now, Wisconsin is once again expected to be a deciding factor in the presidential election.

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

""I would highlight that the Republican Party of Wisconsin and the Republican National Committee (RNC) - we have over 100 staff on the ground in Wisconsin, and we have 40 field offices,"" Iverson explained.

""So we have a great presence across the entire state.""

According to him, the path to victory for Republicans relies on pulling ""votes in every single corner of the state.""

He pointed to Trump's decision to hold a rally in Dane County, home to the state capital of Madison, Wisconsin. ""Republicans are going where we traditionally may not always go,"" he said.

SOROS-LINKED DARK MONEY GROUP PROPS UP NEBRASKA INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE IN KEY SENATE RACE

Iverson described Dane as ""the most liberal county in the state of Wisconsin,"" and said Trump's trip there is ""because he has to get votes in every single county and turn out Republicans in every part of the state.""

Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, told reporters earlier this month at a press conference in Milwaukee, ""Donald Trump called me and asked me, how do I carry Wisconsin?""

The longest-serving Wisconsin governor, who was in office from 1987 to 2001, said he told Trump to follow his lead, ""You got to go into southwestern Wisconsin.""

""I said to the president, you've got to come into Dane County. There hasn't been a presidential candidate in Dane County since 1996, when Bob Dole ran for president. Republicans stay away. I said, we have to go.""

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE, WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Trump's visit to the blue stronghold that same day drew massive crowds, despite the county's reputation. Thompson remarked that there was a ""huge crowd all the way from the airport to the factory,"" where the event was held.

This attention to heavily Democratic-voting areas of the state is a departure from previous Republicans' strategy, as the former governor noted.

Iverson told Fox News Digital that while the election cycle is quite polarized and many people are decided on their candidate, ""there's a rather decent segment of voters who are still undecided, and they'll be making up their decision until the moment they vote.""

""That's why it's so important that we are out there talking to as many voters as possible, because each conversation that we could have could be the last conversation they have with voters before they go and vote,"" he said.

Musk was at Acrisure Stadium waving the ""Terrible Towel"" in support of the Steelers. He had been in Butler, Pennsylvania, as former President Donald Trump returned to the town where he survived an assassination attempt over the summer. Musk joined Trump on stage at one point.

Christopher Steele, the author of the 2016 Steele dossier that featured discredited claims about then-candidate Donald Trump, claims he has uncovered new information about the former president during an interview with The Washington Post.

Steele became a key political figure after the dossier made unsubstantiated allegations that Trump committed sex acts with prostitutes in Moscow and helped underscore years of accusations of illicit Russia collusion. The dossier, which was funded through a law firm hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign at the time, was ultimately revealed to be largely uncorroborated and salacious rumors.

When asked if he would still go ahead and release explosive claims about Trump if he wrote the report today, Steele answered in the affirmative.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS AND FORMER ROBERT MUELLER LAWYERS DISCUSS RUSSIA COLLUSION CLAIMS: 'IT WASN'T A HOAX'

""Call me a stick in the mud,"" he told The Post, ""but probably, yes.""

""We know it happens. Anyone who knows Russia and Russian counterintelligence knows about honey traps and about the filming of things in hotel rooms and hookers, and all the rest of it is just part of -- part of the scene in Russia,"" Steele said. ""And so the actual thing itself is entirely credible. The truth of it would have to be built up through ... careful investigation, which is difficult now. It was slightly easier back then. And, as I say, we didn't just take one source's word for it. We interviewed other people that we felt might have knowledge of it.""

Steele chose to stand behind his dossier after its multiple unproven claims came to dominate the news cycle. Some allies of Steele, like former White House National Security Council official Mark Medish, advised Steele to defend only certain parts of his report, instead of all claims.

POLITICO WRITER KNOCKS WAPO FOR SCRUBBING STEELE DOSSIER ERRORS: 'IS THIS HOW JOURNALISM DIES... IN DARKNESS?'

""His instinct is to do the latter,"" Medish said in an interview. ""I chalk it up to him being a fighter.""

""Any new information by this foreign agent who peddled the debunked Steele dossier should be wholly dismissed, and any media outlet that entertains anything he has to say is just the continuation of election interference intended to meddle in the campaign,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told The Post when reached for comment.

Steele, who is releasing a book about Trump and American democracy, said that he has not given up on the existence of the alleged sex tape.

""I think it's just not really been properly bottomed out,"" Steele told The Post. ""Excuse the pun.""

Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight 2024 presidential race, admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President Trump could win the election.

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

""This is kind of shocking to me. Like, don't you live with people? Are you not aware that there's going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said, referring to backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

""Anybody who thinks women are going to stay home, that women are going to stay home -- Do you not know any women? Do you not live with a woman?"" Moore continued.

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

BLUE PHILLY WORKING-CLASS VOTERS START LEANING TOWARD TRUMP AHEAD OF THE ELECTION: 'PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOVE HIM'

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""

Democratic strategist Aisha Mills insisted Monday that former President Donald Trump ""would absolutely try to exterminate people"" if elected, likening the GOP nominee to Adolf Hitler.

In an interview on ""CNN News Central,"" Mills was asked to respond to a comment made earlier in the day by Trump, who remarked that the U.S. has ""a lot of bad genes in our country right now"" during a discussion about crime perpetrated by illegal immigrants.

Mills began by claiming that Trump ""revered the Nazis... revered Hitler.""

""Donald Trump has had a very sinister philosophy, wanting to be a dictator, absolutely dividing people up based on who they are, based on factors about them that have to do with their race, and their gender, etc.,"" she continued.

""And when he uses language like this, I don't think that it's a Freudian slip.

""And I say this with all the sternness that you hear in my voice because it is serious. And Americans should recognize that.""

Republican strategist Lahnee Chen, who joined the CNN segment, pushed back against Mills' assertion, calling it ""a little over-torqued, quite frankly.""

DONALD TRUMP JR. TELLS CNN THE 'MEDIA HAS RADICALIZED' PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ASSASSINATE HIS FATHER

Democrats and left-leaning pundits have repeatedly compared Trump to the Nazi leader. MSNBC host Joy Reid said earlier this year that, like Hitler, the former president was ""also viewed as a clown, a goon who could be kept in line."" MSNBC political analyst Claire McCaskill suggested during a media appearance in 2023 that Trump was ""more dangerous"" than Hitler and Mussolini. More recently, Hillary Clinton marked the 80th anniversary of the D-Day operation with a social media post that appeared to cast Trump as a threat to democracy on par with the Nazi dictator.

Mills' comment comes after Trump blamed the ""rhetoric"" from Democrats for causing him to be ""shot at"" in two separate assassination attempts, telling Fox News Digital last month that the suspected gunman in the second attempt on his life ""acted"" on ""highly inflammatory language"" from the left.

His son Donald Trump Jr. echoed the sentiment in a tense interview on CNN last week, blaming the media for being partly responsible for the assassination attempts against his father by pushing false narratives that radicalize his critics.

""The media did that, they created so much of that environment,"" Trump Jr. said. ""The media has radicalized the people that are trying to kill my father. I've had to deal with that twice now in the last two months,"" he continued. ""When someone allows someone to have a platform to call someone 'literally Hitler,' every day for nine years, it creates it. Whether you want to believe it or not, that's a fact."""

Former President Trump continued to hit the Biden-Harris administration for its response to Hurricane Helene amid criticism that he's attempting to politicize the disaster.

Trump spoke with Fox News host Laura Ingraham Saturday at his Butler, Pa., rally, which marked a return to the place where would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to end the GOP presidential nominee's life in July.

Ingraham asked the former president how he would have responded to the devastation wrought by Helene.

""I'd have a tremendous team of people here. They don't have any people here, the people who, look, I was in North Carolina yesterday. I was in Georgia -- and Georgia's different. You have a good governor. He's doing a very good job. But North Carolina is a disaster. And it was also hit very hard. But they don't have the people and they're complaining there's no people around to help,"" Trump said.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell hit back at some claims that agency personnel haven't been seen on the ground in the aftermath of the storm, telling ""Special Report"" on Monday such insinuations are ""false.""

""We have been on the ground since before Hurricane Helene in Florida and before it crossed over [to] North Carolina. And what I would say is just because somebody doesn't see a person in a shirt doesn't mean that we're not in the area. We have a team located with the state side-by-side to help them understand their needs and move resources where they're needed,"" Criswell said.

""We've moved food and water, and much of what you're seeing delivered by the amazing National Guardsmen across North Carolina are the supplies that we've brought in. The entire federal family is there to support this response. We've been there. We will continue to be there as long as it's needed to make sure we're meeting everybody's needs.""

The White House announced over the weekend that President Biden ordered 500 active-duty troops to western North Carolina to assist in relief efforts, bringing the total number of troops to 1,500.

More than 6,100 National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 federal personnel have been mobilized to help residents and affected counties.

TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M

The White House took aim at Trump and others for allegedly spreading false information about how disaster relief funds were being used, specifically a claim that FEMA money was used on migrants in the United States.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" a memo from the White House read in part.

""You know, anything I do, they'll say, oh, it's political. If I do anything good, no matter what I do, they'll say, oh, he did it for politics. I mean, they could have gotten there way before me,"" Trump said on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

Trump, Biden and Kamala Harris have all visited states impacted by Helene.

Ingraham asked the GOP nominee how he's working to ensure voters can cast their ballots amid the devastation.

""Republican areas got hit very hard. You know that. They got hit very, very hard. I believe - and many people are dead. You know, many people are dead. They don't even know what it's going to be in terms of the number. You know, they have hundreds are missing and I can't really speak to it. I can only say that I believe they're going to go out and vote, if they have to, crawl to a voting booth,"" Trump said.

He added Republican National Committee co-chair and daughter-in-law Lara Trump is working to address the issue.

Tim Kennedy, former UFC star and Save Our Allies founder, scolded FEMA for being ""woefully absent"" in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene as his group and other private organizations continue to play a critical role in the recovery effort.

In an appearance on ""America's Newsroom"" Monday, Kennedy described the scene on the ground in hurricane-ravaged North Carolina, revealing that he pleaded with FEMA to hand over control of the recovery efforts to the U.S. military after seeing first hand the alleged lack of preparedness from the state and federal government.

FEMA ACCUSED OF PLAYING THE VICTIM AFTER INSISTING CRITICISM OF HELENE HANDLING IS 'DANGEROUS'

""What was clearly absent was the state and federal response. The men and women that showed up from FEMA, that is still woefully absent, there was no command and control. We were begging and pleading for the state to hand over command to the United States military... I wanted real leaders to understand a warlike scenario, this is what it is like to take control. It was absolutely broken,"" Kennedy, a former Green Beret, said.

""The men and women on the ground were doing the best they can. But FEMA has every priority wrong,"" he continued. ""They didn't know what to do or where to do it or how to access these mountains. They were turning people away trying to deliver funds. They're telling helicopters to land, the president's coming in and creating a no-fly zone while we're doing airborne evacuations. None of it made sense...for FEMA to come and start impeding the efforts of organizations like ours trying to get into deliver goods. It is unconscionable.""

FEMA has come under fire for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. As of last Friday, the death toll in southeastern states hit the hardest by the storm has risen past 224, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

Former President Trump, Republican elected officials, Elon Musk and volunteers have spoken out against the government's response to the hurricane, as crews continue searching for missing people and bodies across the affected region.

NORTH CAROLINA SENS. TILLIS, BUDD CALL FOR MILITARY LEADER TO OVERSEE HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson slammed the agency's relief efforts as an ""abject failure"" while Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, both of North Carolina, urged the Biden administration to appoint a military leader to lead the recovery effort, sounding the alarm about the inadequate local response to the catastrophic flooding.

FEMA defended its response to Helene in a statement to FOX Business, stating that ""FEMA is continuing to work with our federal family and state and local partners in the impacted areas to effectively bring in life-saving resources to the people and communities who need it most.

""As of Oct. 3. FEMA has deployed more than 11.5 million Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), over 12.6 million liters of water, more than 400,000 tarps and 150 generators to areas impacted by Helene,"" FEMA's Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg said.

The agency also said it created a rumor response page to combat misinformation or online narratives about their handling of the hurricane.

After repeated calls for military intervention, 1,000 active-duty soldiers with the 101st and 82nd airborne divisions were dispatched to North Carolina Sunday to support the ongoing search-and rescue efforts.

""Nobody does it better than the men and women in the American military,"" Kennedy said.

Kennedy also credited nonprofit organizations like Save Our Allies, Samaritans Purse and others for stepping up to fill the void of an inadequate government response.

""While nobody could get through roads ...we are taking four-wheelers and getting in there...,"" he said.

""We're doing health and welfare checks and we're flying into deliver stuff...we have made multiple runs into Charlotte to pick up more body bags because the number just keeps rising and rising and rising. But once you get to that door, you don't know if somebody will answer the door or hug you and just be so grateful, which happened time and time again, or you start smelling what clearly is going to be a recovery operation instead of a rescue operation,"" he told host Dana Perino.

""I've never been more proud of the response from private citizens.""

Kennedy praised Helene victims in North Carolina for their resilience, revealing that many people have turned down items or assistance for fear of taking it from someone who may need it more than they do.

""It just breaks your heart,"" he said. ""These people are so tough they don't want to take it from somebody that might need it even though it's clear that they desperately need it."""

More than 425,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions are currently out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, according to data provided to lawmakers late last month. That includes more than 13,000 people convicted of homicide and nearly 16,000 convicted of sexual assault, according to ICE.

""That is pretty tragic,"" Bob from Tempe said when asked about the data. ""The whole immigration needs to be reformed, and they need to get serious about it.""

Mary and Bob both thought Harris would do a better job of addressing immigration. Mary said Harris and Biden had a ""strong immigration bill before the Senate"" this past spring before Trump rallied his allies to block the legislation.

""That was infuriating,"" she said. ""And they all marched in step. So I know that if Kamala gets in, she will get it signed.""

But Nick from Sun City West said Harris' immigration policy has been ""dismal at best.""

Trump narrowly leads Harris in the presidential contest in Arizona, according to a recent Fox News poll. Biden won the state in 2020 by less than half a percentage point, making him the first Democrat to capture the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.

In the Fox News poll, 56% of Arizona voters surveyed said they trust Trump to do a better job on the border, compared to 41% who preferred Harris.

Four more states began their early voting processes on Tuesday: Indiana, New Mexico, Wyoming and the major swing state of Ohio.

Here is everything you need to know about casting a ballot in each of the states.

Ohio is home to one of the most competitive Senate races on the map.

Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown has won the Midwestern state three times, but with Trump pushing White working-class voters toward the GOP and record spending from both parties, this is set to be a tight race. Brown faces Republican businessman Bernie Moreno.

Republicans have made inroads in the northeastern and heavily industrial areas bordering Pennsylvania. Trumbull County flipped to the GOP in 2016, and Trump increased his margin to 10 points in 2020; Mahoning County flipped in 2020 by almost two points. These counties played a key role in Trump's statewide wins.

Democrats are performing better than ever in the ""three C's"": Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. These areas have the highest percentages of college-educated voters. President Biden won the counties home to these cities by double-digit margins in 2020, with roughly 30-point wins in Franklin (Columbus) and Cuyahoga (Cleveland).

Unlike in other competitive states, Republicans still hold up in Ohio's suburban and exurban areas, particularly those surrounding Cincinnati.

Ohio's Senate race is a toss-up and the presidential race is ranked Likely R on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Meanwhile, New Mexico is also in the ""likely"" column, both at the presidential and senate level. The state delivered Biden an 11-point win in 2020, but Latino or Hispanic voters made up 35% of the state's electorate in the 2020 election, and those voters' support for the Democrat ticket has wavered in recent polls.

Republicans would need to run up their margins with these voters all across the state and keep Harris at bay in places like Doña Ana County, home to Albuquerque and which last voted for Biden by 18 points, to pull off a victory.

Voting also begins today in four House districts ranked Lean or Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

127,"Kamala Harris set for extremely friendly interview blitz with 'The View,' Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-set-extremely-friendly-interview-blitz-the-view-stephen-colbert-howard-stern,2024-10-08T09:14:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris will sit for a trio of interviews Tuesday, but don't expect a thorough grilling at any of them from some of the media's most fervent Democratic Party supporters.

Harris will make appearances with ABC's ""The View,"" radio star Howard Stern and CBS late-night comic Stephen Colbert, all hosts of extremely friendly venues for the Democratic candidate who have repeatedly railed against her opponent.

The co-hosts of ""The View,"" a talk-show under ABC's news division, have repeatedly expressed support for Harris and devote segments on an almost daily basis to attacking former President Trump as a threat to democracy.

The co-hosts quickly got behind the vice president in September in their season premiere after President Biden dropped out of the race and praised her ""flawless"" campaign.

ABC'S 'THE VIEW' WAS 100% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: STUDY

Harris did an about-face on multiple far-left policies she openly supported when she ran for president in 2020, including on fracking, the Green New Deal, and on getting rid of private health insurance. Liberal co-host Sunny Hostin argued in early September that the vice president had always been ""moderate.""

""People evolve and grow,"" Whoopi Goldberg said, dismissing Harris' flip-flops during the discussion. ""The difference, perhaps now, is that someone has actually admitted it.""

Co-host Joy Behar even recently demanded Republicans vote Democrat to ""save the country.""

The show's two Republican hosts, former Trump aide Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro, join the liberal hosts in criticizing the former president as an existential threat to the nation. Navarro even hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention in August.

""For me to have the chance to stand on that stage and help my girl, Kamala, make history, and become the Democratic nominee, it's just such a mind-blowing moment,"" Navarro said.

Griffin has not emphatically endorsed the vice president, but plans to headline an anti-Trump event in Pennsylvania alongside other anti-Trump Republicans such as Liz Cheney, who has endorsed Harris.

Navarro touted the Harris interview on ""The View"" and said her Tuesday media blitz was evidence the vice president was facing tough questions. CNN's Brian Stelter also suggested on Monday that the co-hosts of ""The View"" would have ""sharp"" questions for Harris on Tuesday.

Late-night comedy has become a hotbed for Democratic Party support in recent years, but Colbert has taken it to another level with his fawning monologues and interviews in recent years.

Colbert hosted a fundraiser alongside Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and President Biden in March, prior to Biden dropping out of the race. The star-studded Democratic fundraiser brought in over $25 million for Biden's campaign. In 2020, he popped champagne on the air over Biden and Harris winning the election.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Colbert's political and media guests have almost solely consisted of Democrats and liberal media figures. Colbert has hosted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, CNN's Abby Phillip, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, MSNBC's Alex Wagner, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, CNN's Anderson Cooper, Bill Gates, MSNBC's Chris Hayes, and more.

Stern, who had the rare chance to sit down with Biden before he dropped out, has said he ""hates"" anyone who supports Donald Trump.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" Stern said during one of his shows in September.

The blitz this week follows a ""60 Minutes"" appearance and an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast. Media analysts said Harris' approach of doing more softball interviews made sense given some of her shortcomings.

""Harris tends not to communicate effectively, whether it's her long-winded, non-answer answers or her demeanor, so for her it does make more sense to appear in friendly venues,"" said communications expert Tobe Berkovitz, a Professor Emeritus at Boston University.

Even Harris' other interviews before Tuesday have skewed toward being friendly, such as with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle. Lesley Lopez, a public affairs professional and assistant professor at George Washington University, dismissed the idea that Harris was erring by avoiding difficult interviews.

""One man's so-called bubble campaign is another's strategic earned media plan. I think her campaign is being really targeted in the final days of an election where the margins are slim,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a Fox News host, said the trio of friendly interviews is a ""great idea"" but questioned the timing as Hurricane Milton has strengthened into a Category 5 monster storm heading towards Florida.

""I would have her, if I was on her team, in FEMA headquarters in the mornings, then you can go out and do a campaign stop, and then back to FEMA headquarters,"" McEnany said Monday on ""Outnumbered."""
128,Trump vs. Harris: The 'October surprise' is already here,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-vs-harris-october-surprise-already-here,2024-10-08T09:13:18Z,"The infamous ""October surprise"" - the black swan event that could bend the arc of the 2024 presidential election -- has arrived.

Hurricane Helene, which clobbered the Southeast recently, is not the surprise; after all, October is hurricane season, and we expect big storms. Rather, it is the disgraceful aftermath - the shockingly poor and tone-deaf response from Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House, the administration lying about FEMA spending hundreds of millions of dollars on illegal immigrants and then warning that emergency funds for hurricane victims may run short. The frantic warnings from liberal news organizations that complaints about the government's relief efforts are ""misinformation"" and speculation that the tardy recovery effort might prevent Trump voters from participating in the upcoming election.

For Harris' campaign, it was the perfect storm. And, it could get even worse as monster Hurricane Milton barrels into Florida, creating even more challenges for the incapable White House.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

As early rescue efforts began, Homeland Security head Alejandro Mayorkas announced the federal government was close to running out of funds to help hurricane relief efforts. He said FEMA was ""meeting immediate needs"" but that ""FEMA does not have the funds, to make it through the season."" That, despite President Biden recently signing a stopgap funding bill that included an extra $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. And, despite Mayorkas three months ago assuring the nation that FEMA was ""tremendously prepared"" for hurricane season. Now that Milton threatens even more damage, where will Mayorkas find the funds necessary for the recovery of yet another blockbuster storm?

Soon after, Mayorkas issued that ominous warning about federal fund running low, as bodies were still being discovered in the western towns of North Carolina and thousands were without power or water, Harris posted this on X: ""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation...""

Talk about tone deaf!

The idea...the idea, as an irate Joe Biden might say, that suffering Americans might take second chair to war victims in the Middle East is repugnant and ignited a firestorm on social media. Yes, the federal government budget is vast - too vast- and agencies that send aid overseas are separate from those that help with emergencies at home. But the impression given those trying to dig out from Helene is that their needs were not Kamala's priority.

That impression was reinforced by Harris and President Biden taking five days to finally visit the storm-damaged Southeast. That's the same number of days it took President George W. Bush to travel to Texas in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Voters read Bush's delay as a sign of indifference; his popularity never recovered.

When Kamala Harris finally arrived at the scene, she announced that FEMA would be giving out $750 checks for immediate aid. Families whose homes and lives had been swallowed by a tsunami of mud were incredulous; $750 does not go very far. FEMA was further mocked for putting out a statement encouraging people, who had no power or cell service, to apply for assistance online or by phone.

Critics were outraged by the paltry sum. Donald Trump Jr. posted on X: ""$750 for Americans in desperate need... $250 BILLION spent in Ukraine with a population of +\- 38 million equals a bit more than $6500 per person in F$&?ing UKRAINE!!! For what? Enough of this madness!""

To be fair, Harris also announced that the feds would in the future provide ""tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair"" and other needs. In the future.

Our government is not only spending billions on the people of Lebanon and the war in Ukraine; it is also supporting the millions of migrants that Border Czar Harris allowed to enter our country illegally. The Biden-Harris White House and sanctuary cities rolled out the welcome mat, encouraging illegal immigration with free housing, free food, cell phones and other goodies. FEMA has helped fund that effort, leading critics to charge that the Biden-Harris White House is putting people in the country illegally ahead of our own citizens.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre has adamantly denied that FEMA money has been spent on illegal immigrants. But there is video of her saying on September 16, 2022, that funding was available ""through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program.... to support humanitarian relief for migrants."" In fact, the agency's Shelter and Services Program (SSP) spent $650 million in fiscal 2023 to assist migrants.

Unhappily, it is not just money that has been in short supply. Help has come too slowly, and some blame the federal government. Reports have circulated of hundreds of GIs arriving in North Carolina but remaining idle awaiting FEMA orders. Some, including Elon Musk's team, have complained that FEMA officials have barred them from delivering critical goods to stranded towns without water or food. The tiny town of Bat Cave, which was almost entirely demolished, was told by FEMA they were on their own because rescue workers could not drive around a ""road closed"" sign, though many helpers managed to do so.

As complaints have rolled in, panicky members of the legacy media have rushed to defend the White House, accusing critics of spreading ""misinformation."" Amazingly, they are even blaming ""misinformation"" for impeding the relief work!

None of this is surprising. The Biden-Harris White House contains few individuals with private sector managerial experience; stories about $8 billion spent to build one charging station or Harris being allocated $42.5 billion to deliver broadband to rural communities but not managing to break ground on a single project, are instructive. The Biden-Harris White House is, at its core, incompetent.

As Milton crashes ashore in Florida, will the Biden-Harris response improve? Or will this be, for Harris campaign, another perfect storm?"
129,Morning Glory: Trump stands with Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-trump-stands-israel,2024-10-08T09:13:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump agreed to an interview on the first anniversary of the horrific massacre and mass kidnapping in Israel on October 7, 2023. The focus was primarily on Israel of course, but also on the explosion of antisemitism in the United States.

HH: Now Mr. President, when we spoke in April, you said to me that Israel needed to win and win quickly. They are winning, but they're still fighting, and they're now fighting in Lebanon. Do you think Biden and Harris have been holding back Israel from winning?

DT: I do. I think everything they do is the opposite. In particular, him. Now she's a dumber person than him, but he has the worst foreign policy of anybody in history, probably. You know what you do with him? I realized it the other day. You could be one of the greatest foreign policy presidents. All you do is listen to what he says and do the opposite. If you've done the opposite for 30 years with this poor guy, this poor, pathetic guy, if you've done the opposite for 30 years, you would have been successful. But he's never gotten it right. And you know, I don't have to go back into the old secretaries of state and all the people that talk about it.

HH: If Israel hits [Iran's] nuclear sites, will you applaud?

DT: Yeah. I dealt with Kim Jong-un. And he has nuclear weapons. And you tend to speak a little bit differently when they have nuclear weapons.

HH: Yes.

DT: Does that make sense to you?

HH: Yes, it does. Well, Nixon met with Mao, who was the greatest murderer of the 20th Century, because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.

DT: Right.

HH: I noticed you didn't meet with Khamenei, and he did not have nukes. Can they be allowed to have nukes?

DT: No, they can't have nukes. No, they can't have nukes. Nukes, if you would see the power of these weapons that I renovated and rebuilt at great cost, I rebuilt the whole military. And then, you know, they gave $85 billion of it away to the Taliban and to Afghanistan. Can you imagine? They gave $85 billion dollars away. They gave everything. This is the worst group of people, these are the worst negotiators in history.

Exchange three:

HH: Let me turn to antisemitism in the United States. Your daughter is Jewish. Some of your grandchildren are Jewish. Your son-in-law is Jewish. Jewish students are not safe on many American campuses. Your alma mater, my alma mater, Biden and Harris have ignored this. I mean, they really have ignored it. If you're president, will you send the DOJ to those campuses, the office of Civil Rights from the Department of Education to enforce the law?

DT: 100%. I mean, the law is being broken. 100%. You wouldn't think you'd even have this. Did you ever think two years ago, three years ago, that you'd ever have this discussion?

HH: No, I didn't.

DT: I'm unbelievable what's happening. And when you see these riots, and you see a lot of people, too. But you know, a lot of the people in that, a lot of those people are Jewish people. You know that. They're Jewish kids.

HH: Oh, yeah. There are some outliers, but most Jewish students are afraid to be overt on places like Harvard and Penn.

DT: Yeah, but then you have other Jewish students that are afraid. Yeah, that's true, and they should be afraid. I never thought I would see this in my life with the campus riots and what they're saying and what they're doing. And they have to put them down quickly. They really have to put them down quickly.

Some pro-Israel Americans would prefer that zero attention be given to the outliers, but as the excellent Commentary Magazine podcast occasionally mentions the insidiousness of Jewish Americans attacking Israel and defending, implicitly or even explicitly, Hamas, then it should not be shocking when the former president notices it too.

I highlight these three exchanges because the result in November's election will reverberate around the world but most especially in Israel.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

It seems clear to me that a President Kamala Harris will be the least supportive American president of the Jewish State in Israel's 76-year history.

By contrast, the argument is solid that Trump in his first term was at least the equal of any previous president when it comes to a record of support for Israel in peacetime. (Richard Nixon ordering the Pentagon to ""send everything that can fly"" to Israel in an arms resupply during the 1973 Yom Kippur War is the sole example of when an American president stepped up at a moment of existential peril to Israel and does everything to help it short of sending American forces. Trump did not face such a choice in his first term, but might very well in a second if Iran crosses the nuclear threshold.)

The choice should be clear for any American who supports Israel and for whom the continued existence and vibrancy of the Jewish State and the Middle East writ large is a priority: They should vote for Trump.

Eddie Gallagher knows how it feels to have a target on your back, both on and off the battlefield.

The decorated Navy SEAL, now retired, served his country for more than two decades in combat zones overseas, fighting terrorists who were determined to kill him and harm America. Then, after returning home from his eighth and final deployment in 2017, Gallagher was accused of war crimes, put in the crosshairs of both prosecutors and the media and imprisoned for nearly eight months before his name was cleared.

Now, as co-founder of the Pipe Hitter Foundation, a nonprofit that gives financial and legal support to ""veterans, police officers and their families,"" Gallagher is raising money to help others fighting similar battles.

Pipe Hitter has gone to bat for other controversial figures like Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller, whose 17-year career ended in court-martial in 2021 after he went viral for questioning senior military leadership amid the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Another is Cmdr. Erik Ramey, a Navy physician who was serving as the senior medical officer at Basic Training Command (BUDs) when Seaman Kyle Mullen died after completing ""Hell Week"" training in California.

NAVY SEAL EDWARD GALLAGHER FOUND NOT GUILTY ON MURDER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES

""What we do is we support active-duty military, law enforcement and first responders. If they're being unjustly accused for doing their job, we step in,"" Gallagher told Fox News Digital. ""We provide emergency relief aid to their families while they're going through that stressful time.""

On Oct. 12, the Pipe Hitter Foundation will host its first fundraiser, an event called ""Operator For a Day"" at Stronghold SOF Solutions in Defuniak Springs, Florida. Gallagher is teaming up with former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik and other highly trained military special operators to give civilians hands-on firearms training, show how to fight from vehicles and put on a special operator close-quarter combat live demonstration.

""What we're going to do is have all retired special operators coming in to help instruct, and we're going to be doing some basic pistol, rifle carving course, some vehicle stuff. We're really going to make it a lot of fun,"" Gallagher said. ""For the people that do come, it's just going to give them a taste of what some of these individuals that they are supporting go through on a daily basis.""

The retired SEAL said he hopes the event will give attendees more appreciation for what Navy SEALS and Green Berets go through when they risk their lives for their country.

Tickets are $3,000 per individual with ammo provided, though there are group discounts. While that is by no means cheap, Gallagher says the money will serve those who first served the American people.

NAVY SEAL FOUND NOT GUILTY OF MURDER, RANK RESTORED BY TRUMP: WHERE IS HE NOW?

""The big thing which I like that we do is we help mentor those people through that process. We're able to share our experiences of what we went through, and that does a lot for them, because when you're put in a situation like that, there's very few people who know exactly what that feels like and the amount of pressure that's put upon you and your family when the government is targeting you,"" Gallagher said.

It's personal for Gallagher. In 2017, he was found not guilty of murdering an Islamic State fighter but was convicted of posing with the dead prisoner's corpse. The Navy reduced his rank from chief petty officer to petty officer first class and considered revoking his SEAL trident insignia.

Former President Trump took notice of Gallagher's story after it garnered national media attention and intervened on his behalf to restore his previous rank in 2019. He also stopped the Navy from seeking further disciplinary action against him and fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer for his handling of the case.

After his acquittal, Gallagher sued his former attorneys for allegedly delaying his case to run up his legal bills. He also accused the prosecutors of acting illegally and unethically.

The prosecutors from the case were awarded a Navy Achievement medal just eight days after Gallagher was acquitted on most of the charges. Trump had the medals promptly rescinded and described the attorneys' actions as ""incompetent.""

EX-NAVY SEAL EDDIE GALLAGHER, ACQUITTED IN WAR CRIMES CASE, SPEAKS OUT: NEW BOOK 'GETS THE TRUTH OUT THERE'

Gallagher retired in 2020 to found the Pipe Hitter Foundation alongside his wife, Andrea. The 501(c)(3) organization has since aided a number of military and law enforcement personnel accused of wrongdoing, those like Ben Darby, an Alabama police officer accused of murder after he shot and killed a man threatening suicide.

Darby shot and killed Jeff Parker on April 3, 2018, after Parker called 911 and threatened suicide. The incident was caught on video and a review board deemed Darby's actions were justified. However, the Madison County district attorney pursued murder charges against the officer and Darby was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

The Pipe Hitter Foundation assisted Darby as he appealed his case. After serving about 20 months in prison, an appeals court overturned the conviction and Darby was released. The officer later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and a judge sentenced him to three years of probation in 2023, AL.com reported.

""He was able to go back to his family,"" Gallagher said of Darby. ""You know, the frights are never over there either. He has to overcome all of the fake news and just the way he was demonized in the media.""

TRUMP DECLARES NAVY WILL NOT TAKE AWAY EDDIE GALLAGHER'S SEAL TRIDENT AS ATTORNEY BLASTS ADMIRAL

Pipe Hitter recently became involved in Ramey's case as the Navy physician now faces an inquiry related to Mullen's death.

A Navy autopsy said Mullen was suffering from acute pneumonia and had an enlarged heart. An investigation released last year found there were widespread failures in medical care, poor oversight and the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the BUDs training program, the Associated Press reported. Ramey and the commander of Naval Special Warfare Training Command, Capt. Brad Geary, were among those officers identified as responsible after the BUDs student died.

The Pipe Hitter Foundation says the Bureau of Naval Medicine had already investigated and determined that Ramey met the standard of care and exonerated him.

""They're trying to hang those two out to dry,"" Gallagher said. ""When we saw this happening, we knew exactly what it was. And so we're supporting Dr. Ramey and hopefully pressuring the Navy to do the right thing and drop these charges against him because he is in jeopardy of losing his medical license.""

These cases are hard, but Gallagher argues that everyone is innocent until proven guilty and no one deserves to be vilified before they have their day in court, especially those who volunteer to serve the country. If service members are demonized, Gallagher said, fewer people will want to serve.

""I think it's a bigger problem than people know about,"" he said. ""I met people when I was locked up. I met young kids that did not deserve to be in there. They made a mistake in life, you know, and the overpunishment in the military is ridiculous. You had these kids serving five to six years for showing up late to a formation or failing a drug test.""

He noted that if some of those teens had gone to college instead of volunteering for military service, they would be free.

""The military has a nasty epidemic of overpunishing people to keep their prosecution rates up. So, it's a major problem. I think the UCMJ, which is the Uniform Code of Military Justice, is an outdated and archaic system, and it's very corrupt the way it's run.""

Gallagher said military justice reform is one of the pillars of the Pipe Hitter Foundation's mission. His hope is that their work, supported by Saturday's fundraiser, will encourage young men and women to volunteer to serve.

""We have a huge recruiting crisis going on. And I think it's due to the fact that these young men and women, who are coming up out of high school or in college, are seeing the way people in the military were treated, especially over the whole COVID vaccine mandate and all the individuals they kicked out illegally and then invited back years later without an apology.

""Young men and women are paying attention. So, if they can see that there are groups out there who support these people that are getting falsely accused or are grossly mistreated, hopefully that will give them some hope to stand up, raise your right hand and want to serve the country.""

131,Eye of the Storm: Back-to-back hurricanes threaten to upend Harris-Trump presidential showdown,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/eye-storm-hurricanes-theaten-upend-harris-trump-presidential-showdown,2024-10-08T08:10:52Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

As the death toll rises and roughly a quarter of a million people remain without power or running water a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, another powerful storm is bearing down on the region.

Hurricane Milton, now an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, is on course to slam into Florida Wednesday evening.

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to Hurricane Helene for well over a week. Harris, on Monday, fired back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTON

The former president has repeatedly charged that Biden and Harris have been incompetant in their handling of rescue and recovery efforts.

""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,"" Trump claimed last week.

On Monday, he argued in a social media post that the administration's storm response was ""the WORST rescue operation in the history of the U.S.""

And Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, charged Monday in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview that the administration's efforts were ""incompetence of the highest order.""

The Trump campaign, in announcing Vance would hold a town hall Thursday in Greensboro, North Carolina, argued that Harris ""completely left North Carolina behind in the wake of devastation post-Hurricane Helene.""

And in a blatant pitch for votes, the former president claimed that ""NORTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY ABANDONED BY KAMALA!!! DROP HER LIKE SHE DROPPED YOU - VOTE FOR PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. MAGA2024!""

Trump's repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims as he's targeted Biden and Harris - among them that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia had been unable to reach Biden when Helene first tore through the Peach State. Kemp later confirmed that he had already been in contact with the president.

Despite the untruths from the former president, he did beat Biden and Harris to the scene, surveying the storm-damaged region two days before they did last week.

The optics put the president and vice president on defense, and they've been forced to repeatedly correct the record.

The White House has publicized FEMA's [Federal Emergency Management Agency] efforts in assisting the hard-hit states. Biden made back-to-back trips to the southeast last Wednesday and Thursday, as he stopped in the four hardest hit states, and Harris also made two trips to survey damage.

Huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region last week, Biden emphasized that ""in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here -- there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans -- our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.""

Trump - along with his allies - has repeatedly aimed to tie the storm response to the combustible issue of border security, as he claimed that FEMA funds for the rescue and relief efforts in North Carolina were being diverted to support undocumented migrants.

The Harris campaign, firing back, said that Trump and Vance and their allies have been ""pushing debunked lies about Hurricane Helene response.""

A top North Carolina Republican - Sen. Thom Tillis - asked about the charges, said on the Sunday talk shows that ""I believe that we have to stay focused on rescue operations, recovery operations, clearing operations, and we don't need any of these distractions on the ground.""

Harris, on Monday, called Trump's actions ""extraordinarily irresponsible.""

""It's about him. It's not about you. And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now, and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go,"" Harris emphasized.

But longtime Republican strategist David Kochel noted that Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his initial quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care, they're not doing anything, and I think they're reacting to it.""

Now, with Hurricane Milton bearing down on Florida, the Biden administration highlighted their efforts in a release headlined ""Federal Assistance for Hurricane Helene Exceeds $210 Million, FEMA Prepares for Dual Response with Hurricane Milton Strengthening as it Moves Toward Gulf Coast of Florida.""

As Biden declared a state of emergency in Florida on Monday, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said during a news conference that 5,000 National Guardsmen had been mobilized in his state, with another 3,000 on the way.

""We have gotten what we need from the feds,"" DeSantis said. ""The president has approved what we asked for....I'm thankful for that.. Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved.""

This is far from the first time that a tropical storm has impacted a presidential race.

Then-President George H.W. Bush took a political hit over FEMA's disorganized efforts to provide relief in Florida from Hurricane Andrew, which pounded the then-key battleground state weeks before Election Day.

Fast-forward a decade and his son - then-President George W. Bush - likely enjoyed a political bounce in Florida during his 2004 re-election thanks to his aggressive response to Hurricane Charley, which hit in August of that year.

Bush was narrowly re-elected, thanks in large part to carrying the Sunshine State, but his administration's image in handling storms took a major hit the next year, over the botched response in Louisiana to Hurricane Katrina.

As he ran for re-election in 2012, then-President Barack Obama's aggressive response in dealing with Superstorm Sandy -which slammed into the Eastern Seaboard days before the election - likely boosted him to victory.

Trump, in his first year in office, faced criticism as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island.

But the incident - which took place three years before his re-election effort - was vastly overshadowed by his response to the COVID crisis, the worst pandemic to hit the globe in a century."
132,'Social cost of greenhouse gases': House GOP targets progressive Biden policy for rising energy prices,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/social-cost-greenhouse-gases-house-gop-targets-progressive-biden-policy-rising-energy-prices,2024-10-08T08:10:43Z,"FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans are moving to roll back a progressive Obama-era regulatory metric for greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that it's sandbagging the U.S. energy sector by using ""nonscientific"" standards.

""North Carolinians are struggling to fill up their tanks and pay their electricity bills. The last thing they are worried about is the 'social cost' of energy,"" Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital.

""We need to be unleashing American energy to lower prices, not crippling production with burdensome, costly regulations.""

Hudson, who also chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, is leading 12 fellow GOP lawmakers in introducing a bill to stop federal agencies using the ""social cost of carbon"" when creating new regulations for the U.S. energy sector.

HOUSE PASSES BILL BLOCKING BIDEN ADMIN ATTEMPT TO REQUIRE TWO-THIRDS OF NEW CARS TO BE ELECTRIC WITHIN YEARS

Models calculating the ""social cost"" of greenhouse gases use several factors, including population health, sea level changes, economic impacts and other human-felt costs.

Because of the vastly different indicators, ""social cost"" emissions projections can vary widely, according to the Brookings Institute.

It was first used as a federal regulatory tool under the Obama administration but was rolled back by former President Trump.

President Biden made it part of his clean energy plan when he took office, directing a task force to study where federal agencies should consider the ""social cost of greenhouse gases"" as part of an executive order titled ""Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.""

BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON

Democrats have held it up as a necessary tool that presents a more holistic picture for the long-term harms of carbon pollution.

Republicans, however, have criticized the metric as a nonscientific tool that's responsible for burdensome regulations.

Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., a co-sponsor of the bill, said the ""social cost"" metric and the Biden administration's green energy push overall was pushing gas prices up.

EXPERTS RIP 'TRIPLE CROWN OF BAD REGS' AS BIDEN ADMIN POSTS GAS STOVE RULE IT DENIED WAS A BAN

""It's just a fact that government interference in the energy industry has directly contributed to these rising costs. No more manipulated studies and biased research - the American people deserve transparent and honest information,"" Hern told Fox News Digital.

Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, another co-sponsor of the bill, said, ""The Biden-Harris White House has proven their willingness to hide behind biased and flawed research to advance their war against American energy producers.""

""The White House should unleash clean, affordable American energy to bring costs down for the American people,"" he said.

The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
133,"Kamala 2.0's challenge? Making more news, and not just with ultra-friendly hosts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-2-0s-challenge-making-more-news-not-just-ultra-friendly-hosts,2024-10-08T07:11:26Z,"For well over a month, Kamala Harris rode a wave of the most positive press any presidential candidate has gotten in two decades, and her own skills, to turn what had been a lost cause for the Democrats into an extremely tight race.

But does she have a second act?

Kamala 2.0, under constant attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans, doesn't have much new to say. She is conducting a play-it-safe campaign, like a basketball team sitting on a lead and running out the clock.

But Harris doesn't have a lead in the three ""blue wall"" midwestern states she needs to win, and the loss of any one of them could hand Trump the presidency once again.

VANCE-WALZ VP DEBATE ENDED IN A 'DRAW': DEMOCRAT REP. DEBBIE DINGELL

For all the focus on Pennsylvania, Harris leads by 0.7 percent in Michigan - a statistical tie, based on the Real Clear Politics average.

On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell told me her state could go either way.

""The vice president has a problem with union workers,"" Dingell said. ""Many of the men, as well as, quite frankly, African-American young men who have said to me, I was with a group with them last week. 'You know what, Donald Trump talks to us. Democrats take us for granted.'""

The lawmaker recalls how ""everybody got mad at me"" when she predicted in 2016 that Trump would win Michigan - which he did, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

A major problem for Harris is that she doesn't seem to know how to make news. With less than 30 days to go, with many voters understandably believing they don't know her, or enough about her policies, since she took over for Joe Biden, the VP is stitching together parts of her stump speech and recycling the same anecdotes virtually verbatim.

A presidential candidate has to deliver a few new lines, a new proposal, something to break into the news cycle, which is currently being dominated by Trump.

So what's on this week's agenda? Kamala will sit down with Howard Stern (who is totally against his old pal Donald); ""The View,"" where the ladies despise Trump, and Stephen Colbert, who hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden in 2020 and this year.

For good measure, she's also spoken to Alex Cooper, whose podcast, ""Call Your Daddy,"" is about sex.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

I'll go out on a limb here and say these sessions are designed to be friendly - not unlike the conversation with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who kept agreeing with Harris and had just pronounced Trump a danger to democracy.

In fairness, Harris also sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview, an invitation declined by Trump.

Look, there's nothing wrong with candidates showing their softer side with unorthodox outlets in our fragmented media universe. We've come a long way since critics scoffed at candidate Bill Clinton answering the ""boxers or briefs"" question on MTV, calling it unpresidential.

On ""Call Your Daddy,"" Harris was actually quite thoughtful in responding to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that her kids keep her humble and the VP doesn't have anyone to keep her humble.

Rather than jab at the Arkansas governor, which would have produced a cheap headline, she ruminated that families come in all shapes, bound by blood or love, that she is deeply involved with her stepchildren, and this isn't the 1950s anymore. They also discussed, uh, tampons.

Still, the party is getting nervous. ""Democratic operatives, including some of Kamala Harris' own staffers,"" says Politico, ""are growing increasingly concerned about her relatively light campaign schedule, which has her holding fewer events than Donald Trump and avoiding unscripted interactions with voters and the press almost entirely.""

Since the convention, the veep has spent more than a third of days on meeting and briefings, with no public events.

With early voting under way in more than half the states, Politico describes this ""a do-no-harm, risk-averse approach to the race.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who fervently doesn't want Trump to win, nonetheless is whacks Harris pretty hard:

""She hasn't fleshed out her political intent -- what she stands for, what she won't abide, what she means to establish, what she won't let happen.

What is her essential mission? Is it national 'repair,' is it to 'stabilize' an uncertain country, is it 'relaunch'?..

""She so far hasn't conveyed a sense of intellectual grasp. Her campaign has placed too many chips on the idea of the mood, the vibe, the picture.""

And vibes can only take you so far.

But the VP has certain duties, and spent two days visiting hurricane victims and relief workers in North Carolina and Georgia-which also happens to be good politics. She also met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy.

Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend. Why bother? Her campaign has already had $400 million roll in. She's already outspending Trump 2-½ to 1 on ads. She doesn't need any more money. What's more, Harris doesn't make news at these fundraisers, which in any event are off camera. A ground game is great, but it has to be married to a winning message.

Here's one more: Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama White House official, says on Message Box, his Substack column, that ""the media -- and Politico Playbook in particular -- are fuming over the Harris-Walz media strategy.""

Kamala ""must be on offense at all times -- say new things, be edgy enough to get attention, and dictate the terms, or the campaign could ""take on water...In this media world, there is a never-ending, insatiable appetite for content. Either serve lunch or become the menu...

""Dominating attention is Trump's political superpower...Even when he doesn't have a big moment, Trump speaks so outrageously that it shifts attention to his issues of choice.""

Now it's easy to snipe from the sidelines. For Harris to be neck and neck in the core battleground states means she's obviously done many things right. She had to overhaul the Biden operation and vet a running mate while the campaign was in full swing, like changing the tires on a speeding hot rod. She could still win.

One positive sign: The Harris camp took off the bubble wrap and allowed Tim Walz to appear on ""Fox News Sunday."" This was an attempt at damage control, since he lost the debate so badly to JD Vance.

While Shannon Bream repeatedly pressed the governor on late-term abortions, his Minnesota record and his history of falsehoods and exaggerations, Walz was far more forceful than he'd been in the CBS debate.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz raised some eyebrows about what he plans to do on Nov. 6 during his late-night debut on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live.""

On Monday, Walz and liberal host Jimmy Kimmel took turns knocking his GOP rival Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, over his refusal to say that former President Trump lost the 2020 election during last week's vice presidential debate.

Walz called it ""very surreal"" to listen to, but pivoted to his own optimism that the country will ""turn the page"" on Election Day.

""For me, and being an eternal optimist, I always say that. I supervised a high school lunchroom - you're an optimist or you're dead,"" Walz said. ""This idea that look, we get to turn the page on that, and I plan on waking up on November 6 with Madam President.""

While the liberal audience roared with cheers, Kimmel jokingly asked for a clarification.

""I want to be clear, you won't be waking up together,"" Kimmel responded with a grin.

""No,"" Walz laughed.

""Unless you guys have gotten closer than we thought,"" Kimmel quipped.

""I have a problem about not being specific with my language. So thank you for that, specifically right,"" Walz chuckled.

MEDIA CRITICS PAN WALZ'S 'UNSTEADY' DEBATE PERFORMANCE: 'CLEAR LACK OF PREPARATION AND EXECUTION'

Walz previously went viral when he mistakenly claimed that he had ""become friends with school shooters"" during the vice presidential debate.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

WALZ STUNS THE INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

The poorly timed mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports. Walz meant he had become friendly with parents who lost children to school shootings.

He also made headlines when he referred to himself as a ""knucklehead"" after he was pressed about his falsehood about being in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

During an interview on ""60 Minutes,"" Walz was asked whether he could be trusted as other past statements have faced intense scrutiny.

""Is that kind of misrepresentation- isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?"" CBS News' Bill Whitaker asked.

""I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong ... than a pathological liar like Donald Trump,"" Walz said.

So on Saturday, Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pa., where roughly three months ago, he was almost assassinated by a loser who couldn't make his high school rifle club but somehow mastered slanted roof technology. It was huge. So huge, the rest of the media had to cover it. First, Trump returns to the scene of his near death, and then opens with this.

MUSK ENERGIZES TRUMP SUPPORTERS AT BUTLER RALLY, 3 MONTHS AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON FORMER PRESIDENT

Yes, Trump's got charts while Biden's got sharts. Elon Musk showed up jumping around like a human embodiment of the First Amendment. All it needed was Hulk Hogan tearing his shirt off or Kid Rock putting a shirt on. The crowd was even bigger this time around, and it's solemn. It was funny and, dare I say it, joyous. Now compare that to the existential prophecies of a future Trump presidency. A ""threat to democracy, dictatorship, chaos."" Was there anything in Butler resembling that?

Tens of thousands of people from all over standing together to hear speeches that painted America as a place worth protecting, where safety matters, where borders matter, where American jobs matter, where our leaders would actually put our country first. All things that a Harris presidency would make disappear faster than an erection on Bikini Day at The View. That sentence started out so well.

Tens of thousands of people, the people that the legacy media demonizes all day long, people who happen to be in the ultimate swing state, by the way. Who do you think, though, our media is going to blame if Trump wins this thing? Just listen to these chuckleheads continue to push violent retribution if Trump wins.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: This is an increasingly desperate person who's preparing for civil war.

MSNBC GUEST: People right now in the Republican Party are, in fact, actively rooting for and inciting a split, you know, a division in the country.

MICHAEL COHEN: What he says he intends to do. And when he turns around and says he intends to use Seal Team Six or the military within which to round up his critics or his opponents, he intends to do it.

MSNBC GUEST: He's putting in place what he needs to disrupt the process and to create enough tension and confusion that you'll have people on the streets protecting and defending him.

So, you get the sense there's going to be chaos if Trump wins. That's the sense they want you to have. It's less an election and more of an extortion. And sadly, they may be right. There will be chaos if Trump wins because it will come from them. What they're saying is if you win, there will be blood, your blood. It's the mafia saying, nice country you got here. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it. At least the thugs from Goodfellas had style. Democrat fellas look like this. Think about it. Has Kamala Harris articulated a single original policy point?

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Sure, she mentioned not taxing tips, which she lifted from Trump like a Cartier watch during a smash-and-grab. She doesn't bother with policy because she doesn't have to. Because as the woman who babbles on about not going back from her own administration, it's always followed by 'or else.' Or else disaster, chaos, chaos they seem to be guaranteeing. We've seen their chaos in Chicago, New York, San Fran and Minneapolis. Well, Tim Walz, he missed that one. He was busy fighting ISIS in Iraq with exploding tampons.

Now, some of us might be a bit scared, but that's what they want. But you can't let them blackmail or threaten you into a Democrat win because, clearly, this is their last sure sign of desperation. From a side that doesn't have policy or history or even common sense on their side, only threats. But the good news, like Gerald Nadler's deodorant, it's not working. Tens of thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder in a field that had the blood of Trump and three others in it showed him that. Trump came back like he promised.

He didn't let them set the limits. They took their best shot, literally, then he boldly returned to the scene of the crime. Like Brian Stelter, returning to steal from the CNN fridge. Trump showed up saying, 'Forget it.' The threats won't stop us. So it wasn't just about Butler, but the election itself. By gathering all those people in the same field where a weaponized nutcase tried to end Trump's run for president, Trump and thousands of others showed that this election can actually be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left, vowing chaos if they don't get their way.

It's funny, the guy they're telling us will end elections and democracy is actually the one doing the most to preserve it. And tens of thousands joined him.

""You have to earn it and that's what I intend to do,"" she added.

The Democratic Party has been accused by critics of anointing Harris as the party's nominee after Biden abruptly ended his re-election bid following his first debate against former President Trump.

Many Republicans and groups like Black Lives Matter accused the Democratic Party of installing Harris as its nominee and sidestepping the voting process. The Democratic Party coalesced around her, winning enough delegate support to secure the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August.

Vice President Kamala Harris took aim at Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida on Monday for reportedly not taking her calls regarding federal storm relief efforts as a second powerful hurricane bears down on Florida.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations...is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris charged on Monday. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

The vice president's comments came a couple of hours after reports from NBC and later ABC News that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

Asked about ther reports at a hurricane news conference, DeSantis said he wasn't aware Harris was trying to reach him.

""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""

CLICK HERE FOR UP-TO-DATE FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE STORMS

Asked again about the report, the governor reiterated ""I didn't know that she had called.""

The dispute comes as Hurricane Milton, now an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, is on course to slam into Florida Wednesday evening.

Milton is bearing down on Florida as the death toll rises and roughly a quarter of a million people remain without power or running water a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through Florida, Georgia, South and North Carolina, Tennessee, and parts of Virginia.

President Biden made stops last week in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida to survey storm damage from Hurricane Helene. While Biden was in Florida, DeSantis was holding a separate press event across the state in another area damaged from the storm.

""We were in Florida, we invited the governor of Florida to come, it was his decision not to attend,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday. ""The president has reached out around Hurricane Helene. He reached out. It is up to the governor, it is really up to the governor.""

The White House said hours later that the president held separate calls with DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor ""to get a firsthand report on recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene, and to discuss preparations for Hurricane Milton.""

According to the White House, Biden urged the governor and the mayor to ""call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.""

Asked about the federal response, DeSantis said during his news conference that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds....the president has approved what we asked for....I'm thankful for that.""

""Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved,"" DeSantis highlighted.

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Harris and former President Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump, for a week and a half, has been repeatedly attacking Biden and Harris over the federal response to Hurricane Helene. Harris, on Monday, clapped back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses possible concern among Democrats about Vice President Kamala Harris' lack of media interviews on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

JESSE WATTERS: It's getting spooky. Democrats haunted by the echoes of Hillary Clinton. That's from Politico. Kamala went from being the next Obama to being Hillary. They're worried she's running the same ""Play it safe"" campaign.

Up to this point, she's had about the same number of events as Hillary. And 'Crooked' had pneumonia. Since the DNC, Kamala has spent half of her time in D.C., a third of it without any public appearances. Trump is everywhere. Anxious Dems wonder why Harris isn't. Kamala has been a ghost, and even Vegas is spooked.

Trump's up by seven points in the betting markets. Look at that. And CNN is gearing up for a horror show.

Obama world doesn't find it funny. Remember, Kamala was his idea. David Axelrod says Harris needs to step it up. It's only the most difficult oral exam on the planet for the most difficult job.

141,CNN's Brian Stelter claims 'The View' will have 'sharp' questions for Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-brian-stelter-claims-the-view-have-sharp-questions-kamala-harris,2024-10-08T01:09:54Z,"CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter claimed Monday that the left-wing daytime talk show ""The View"" will have tough questions for Vice President Kamala Harris this week.

Stelter, who recently returned to the network after being ousted two years ago, spoke about both former President Trump and Harris' media strategies on Monday as election day nears. Harris in particular has been criticized for avoiding interviews after she took up the nomination from President Biden, but now appears to be on what CNN referred to as a ""media blitz.""'

""Well, she's on '60 Minutes' tonight. That's the most watched news magazine in the United States. Donald Trump initially agreed to be on '60 Minutes,' then he backed out. I feel like he's getting off pretty easy,"" Stelter said. ""Imagine if Harris had agreed to be on '60 Minutes' and then backed out. I think she would have been vigorously criticized. So, Trump choosing not to do '60 Minutes,' Harris is on there. That will certainly be an example of tough questioning of the vice president.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREED TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Stelter went on to note that Harris will be on ABC's ""The View"" on Tuesday, claiming he had been assured the co-hosts will have difficult questions for the Democratic candidate. ""I was talking to producers of 'The View' last night. They have some sharp questions for her as well,"" he reported.

SUNNY HOSTIN VENTS ABOUT CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD FAILING TO ENDORSE BIDEN ON 'THE VIEW': 'IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE'

""And let's remember, sometimes it's these non-traditional formats that actually reveal a lot about candidates. Remember when Kamala Harris was sitting down with Oprah Winfrey a couple of weeks ago, and that's when Harris said, 'If somebody breaks into my house, they are getting shot.' That was a very revealing soundbite, even though it was a friendly interview for Harris,"" he said.

Stelter's claim that ""The View"" will have sharp questions for Harris seems to contradict the show's political record, as the co-hosts have been openly anti-Trump and even slam those who fail to pledge to vote for the Democratic nominee.

On Friday, co-host Joy Behar implored Republican voters to put aside their party affiliation and vote for the Democratic Party just once to get rid of Trump, saying, ""Just do it this one time. Do it this one time. Vote for the Democrat to save the country.""

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin is set to join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania this week to warn of the dangers of re-electing Trump.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

Co-hosts of ""The View"" have blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for refusing to pledge his support first to Biden and then his successor for the nomination, Harris.

""You cannot throw away your vote!"" co-host Sunny Hostin told Christie when Biden was still in the race in mid-July.

After facing continued pushback from co-hosts, Christie eventually responded, ""I'm sorry that I care for what people stand for. I apologize. I'm not gonna pre-commit to it! Let them perform and earn my vote! People should have their vote earned!""

In September, after Harris became the nominee, Christie stood by his position that he was still undecided.

On Monday, Stelter spoke further about Harris and Trump's parallel media strategies to court young women and men, respectively.

""That's why I thought 'Call Her Daddy' was really interesting as well. The interview actually revealed a lot about the candidate, and ultimately, that's what the Harris campaign is trying to do, in the same way that the Trump campaign is going on influencer podcasts, really trying to appeal to young men, doing YouTube shows and things like that,"" he said.

""Harris is trying to do these non-traditional formats like Stephen Colbert tomorrow night or Howard Stern tomorrow afternoon, but I just I think it's notable that sometimes we hear a lot and there are actually a lot of newsworthy comments in these interviews,"" he added.

142,Reporter's Notebook: All about the politics of disaster relief,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-disaster-relief,2024-10-07T23:16:37Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

Republicans are excoriating the Biden/Harris administration for how it responded to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Tennessee and other parts of the South. This is now about to be a double whammy as Hurricane Milton bears down on Florida.

It unfolds amid a tight presidential election. So the disaster response is now infused with politics in swing states like North Carolina and Georgia. There is also a competitive but not top-tier Senate race in Florida.

Storms can disrupt the typical electorate. The usual people who vote might not make it to the polls. It's hard to care about voting if you're low on food, lack electricity and can't even make it out of the holler in western North Carolina because Helene wrecked the road.

'IMMEDIATELY RECONVENE': SCOTT URGES SCHUMER TO RECALL SENATE AMID HELENE'S DEVASTATION

Pray tell, where should you vote in Tampa or Sarasota if your basement is swamped by Milton - after getting drenched when Helene spun through a few weeks ago? You were going to vote at the school down the street. But now it lacks power. You're now living at your sister's house inland. But you're not registered to vote there ...

You see what we're getting at.

Republicans are hammering the Biden/Harris administration for its response to the storm.

""It's like the DMV at industrial scale,"" said Republican vice presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, on Fox. ""It is incompetence of the highest order.""

""At the federal level, this has been a massive failure,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. ""When you talk to the people who are directly affected, they will tell you that this has been an abject failure. FEMA has lost sight of its core mission. The administration has not shown that they were prepared for this eventuality in this terrible disaster.""

""Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we've ever seen. Probably worse than Katrina. And that's hard to beat, right?"" asked former President Trump.

Storm responses are challenging. Hurricane Andrew was a powerful Category 5 storm that swept through Florida in August 1992. Former President George H.W. Bush's tepid response to Andrew slashed his support in Florida. ""Bush 41"" wound up narrowly winning Florida, besting former President Clinton by less than 2%. Bush won Florida by 22 points four years earlier. Moreover, the response to Hurricane Andrew raised questions about the competence of the administration weeks before the election. It's believed that cost Bush a few points nationwide.

When Clinton took office, he immediately beefed up FEMA to prepare and respond to other natural disasters.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

So, part of this tactic is the natural extension of Republicans to undercut the Biden/Harris administration at nearly every turn. This is another component of the GOP narrative that the administration can't handle the economy. Can't handle foreign policy. Can't handle the border.

Did someone say the border?

""We give $20 billion a year to FEMA. And unfortunately, they have drained everything dry,"" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., on Fox Business. ""We spent $200 billion in Ukraine. We spent $220-$500 a month on our illegal aliens.""

This is where things get tricky.

FEMA is under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS runs a program that sends money to cities besieged by the illegal migrant crisis. Some of the money goes for food and shelter for those in the country illegally. But it also helps those towns cope by addressing strains on their medical systems and other services.

Money for disaster recovery and migrant assistance constitute two separate line items in the DHS budget. Congress approved money for both these programs. In fact, some Republicans would prefer to spend more to help their communities grapple with an infusion of illegal immigration.

SPEAKER JOHNSON ADDRESSES CLAIMS FEMA DIVERTED FUNDS TO IMMIGRATION EFFORTS: 'AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED'

About $640 million currently goes to assist these towns beset by an influx of illegal migrants. But some lawmakers would like that to spike to as much as $3 billion next year.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced legislation to halt the migrant assistance program. And Johnson blurred the line between FEMA disaster aid and migrants and the border.

""FEMA should be involved and the Federal Emergency Management Association. Their mission is to help people in times like this of natural disaster. Not to be engaged in using any pool of funding from any account for resettling illegal aliens who have come across the border,"" said Johnson on Fox.

Other Republicans believe this may be an opportunity to recalibrate spending overall. Keep in mind that many Republicans look askance at foreign aid to Ukraine.

""As an elected official, it's our responsibility to put Americans first. Whether you're in Florida, in my district or you're anywhere in the union, I think that it's important for us to prioritize Americans and restore hope and let them know they're not forgotten,"" said Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., on Fox.

But some Republicans compared issues with FEMA's response to how the administration addresses other subjects.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

""This administration seems to have no problem finding money when they want to spend it on their priorities. When they need hundreds of billions of dollars to pay off student loans for graduate students and gender studies programs, they somehow find it. When it's trying to get helicopters to deliver food and water and cellular service and lifesaving medicine into these mountain valleys, they somehow can't seem to find the money,"" declared Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on NBC.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell castigated Republicans for suggesting FEMA was focused on other issues rather than the storms.

""It's frankly ridiculous and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,"" said Criswell on ABC.

Before leaving Washington, Congress green-lighted $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as part of the interim spending plan to avoid a government shutdown. But Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas muddled matters when he said FEMA had enough funds to respond to Helene for ""immediate needs"" but not enough to get through ""the season.""

The ""season"" to which Mayorkas refers is the annual hurricane ""season."" It stretches through Nov. 30. Note that Mayorkas made this remark when there was the potential for another storm, but Milton hadn't yet formed in the Gulf of Mexico.

Some Republicans pounced on Mayorkas. But after considering the severity of Helene, it will likely draw down the DRF for ""immediate needs."" The key phrase here is ""immediate needs."" Milton will probably do the same. That's why Congress must likely tackle disaster relief in at least two tranches when it returns to session in November. Lawmakers will need to refill the DRF. And the price tags will start to roll in for Helene and Milton. That's to say nothing of outstanding disasters like Hurricane Beryl in Texas, tornadoes in Iowa, a typhoon on Guam and wildfires in Hawaii.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

However, Johnson is unwilling to summon lawmakers back to Washington to grapple with disasters.

""You don't just send estimates to the federal government. You send specific needs and requests based upon the actual damages. And that takes some time, especially with storms of this magnitude. So Congress will do its job,"" said Johnson on Fox.

So, lawmakers must first reload the DRF for future immediate needs, then mete out bigger chunks of change for Americans to cope with the impacts of Helene and Milton. The government funding deadline is Dec. 20. It's possible that the latter chunk of funding is folded into spending measures around Christmas.

But as for the politics? The election is fast approaching. The storms could impact voting this fall. And while Helene and Milton will certainly leave a mark meteorologically, they will probably leave a mark electorally, too."
143,CNN legal analyst skewers Hillary Clinton's comments on Jack Smith's case against Trump: 'Got her facts wrong',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-legal-analyst-skewers-hillary-clintons-comments-jack-smiths-case-against-trump-got-her-facts-wrong,2024-10-07T23:07:41Z,"CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig called out former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her commentary about Trump's ongoing legal battles, suggesting she mixed up two of the key judges.

CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig called out former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Monday for claiming that there is ""nothing out of the ordinary"" in how the legal system is treating former President Trump.

On Thursday, Honig wrote a column for New York Magazine where he scorched Special Counsel Jack Smith's ""procedurally irregular"" 165-page federal court filing regarding Trump's immunity from prosecution.

""The larger, if less obvious, headline is that Smith has essentially abandoned any pretense; he'll bend any rule, switch up on any practice -- so long as he gets to chip away at Trump's electoral prospects. At this point, there's simply no defending Smith's conduct on any sort of principled or institutional basis,"" Honig wrote.

He also wrote, ""Anyone who objected to James Comey's outrageous announcements about the Hillary Clinton email investigation on the eve of the 2016 election should feel the same about Smith's conduct now,"" and rhetorically asked what distinction there could be between these two cases.

5 KEY DETAILS IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S TRUMP ELECTION CASE FILING

Clinton rejected the comparison, however, arguing there is ""nothing out of the ordinary"" in this case.

""I think the situation is completely different, and this is in the context of an ongoing criminal procedure that the special counsel has brought against Donald Trump many, many months before the run-up to the election,"" Clinton said in an interview. ""It was, frankly, motivated by the orders of the judge in this trial, who has, it appears to me, been extremely favorable toward Trump, so I think that there is nothing out of the ordinary.""

The CNN legal analyst, when asked for his response, argued Clinton has ""got her facts wrong,"" including possibly confusing Judge Aileen Cannon and Judge Tanya Chutkan.

""Well, all respect to Secretary Clinton, she's the one who suffered the consequences for James Comey's, I believe, outrageous conduct in 2016; DOJ found later that it was outrageous. The problem, though, with Secretary Clinton's analysis of the Jack Smith case is, respectfully, she's got her facts wrong,"" Honig said.

""First of all, she's confusing the judges here. I think she's thinking of Judge Cannon, who, yes, has ruled almost entirely for Donald Trump. But that's the judge in the other case. The judge here is Judge Chutkan. I get it, similar names -- Judge Chutkan has ruled almost entirely against Donald Trump,"" he said.

HILLARY CLINTON DEFENDS 'DEPLORABLES' COMMENT: 'TOO KIND A WORD' FOR SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS

Honig went on to chastise Clinton for arguing that there was ""nothing out of the ordinary"" with this case.

""More to the point, the last thing we just heard Secretary Clinton say was -- quote -- 'There is nothing out of the ordinary.' But as I described before, the way they flipped this procedure is the opposite of the ordinary,"" he said.

""They reversed the actual way that motions are done. You can talk to a hundred former federal prosecutors who've collectively handled 100,000 cases. They will all tell you they never filed their motions first. And I think it begs the question, what was the rush here? Why did Jack Smith have to ask for this, to quote Judge Chutkan, procedurally irregular approach?"" Honig said. ""So, I respectfully disagree with the secretary there.""

Former Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney officially endorsed Vice President Harris for the Oval Office, breaking from the GOP to hit the campaign trail with the Democrat ticket in the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week.

Fox News Digital traveled to Casper, Wyoming, over the weekend to speak to voters about their thoughts on the upcoming election and Cheney snubbing the Republican presidential ticket in favor of endorsing Harris this cycle. Voters in the Cowboy State overwhelmingly admonished Cheney for the endorsement, with some slamming her as a ""traitor"" and ""turncoat.""

""I'm not impressed with that at all,"" Clark Johnson told Fox News Digital when asked about his thoughts on Cheney campaigning with Harris last week in Wisconsin.

""I think it's ridiculous. I think she's a traitor to the country,"" another Wyomingite, Gunner Berg, said of the campaign event.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY

Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is a vocal critic of former President Trump, putting her at odds with the Republican Party and her former constituents, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in his 2016 and 2020 elections. Wyoming is again expected to vote red this election.

The vast majority of voters who spoke to Fox Digital from Casper said they are no fan of Cheney's and that she would unlikely hold another elected office in Wyoming due to her politics.

""I'm definitely not a fan, and it definitely kind of turned some tables there,"" Dillon Sigman said, adding that he does not believe Cheney could again successfully run for office in Wyoming.

""I think Liz Cheney, who originally was a Wyoming person that moved to Connecticut and then returned to Wyoming wearing cowboy blue jeans and a cowboy rodeo belt buckle and seated herself, completely flipped and became a turncoat. Liz has gone totally Democratic and appears to be down the road of the DEI inclusion and all the other dysfunctional things that are going on in her government,"" said a Wyoming resident who identified himself as ""Ralph.""

""I support her decision to campaign for whoever she chooses. However, I do not think that she is a voice for the Wyoming people. The majority of people I know do not back Kamala Harris or that campaign,"" Alicia Kellch told Fox Digital.

NIKKI HALEY DEFENDS TRUMP SUPPORT AFTER BEING CALLED OUT BY LIZ CHENEY: 'THIS IS ABOUT AMERICA'

Kellch said it is unlikely Cheney would be re-elected in Wyoming if she were to pursue such an avenue, adding that she believes many people who initially voted for Cheney feel ""sold out once they got her in office and realized what her true intentions were.""

Chuck Kucera added in an interview that Cheney is a ""backstabber,"" quipping that a Harris campaign event is ""probably a good place for her.""

John Shelton said Cheney could ""never"" run for office again in Wyoming and that he wouldn't vote for her even ""if she's the last one to be voted for.""

One Wyoming resident told Fox Digital that Cheney teaming up with Harris didn't ""bother"" him and didn't view it as an issue, while noting that ""most folks in Wyoming don't agree with"" Cheney endorsing Harris.

JAN 6 COMMITTEE ALLEGEDLY SUPPRESSED TESTIMONY SHOWING TRUMP ADMIN PUSHED FOR NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE: REPORT

Two Wyoming residents told Fox News Digital they support Cheney teaming with Harris, with Jennifer Dillinger saying it was ""absolutely amazing.""

""It's amazing how somebody who is extremely conservative, has been Republican her entire life but will support the Constitution and the country and not be specific for the party,"" Dillinger said, adding that it's unlikely Cheney would make a successful return to Wyoming politics as the state is ""too conservative.""

TRUMP CALLS LIZ CHENEY A 'LOW IQ WAR HAWK' AFTER APPEARANCE IN SUPPORT OF HARRIS

Another woman, Randi Chepke, said she's ""thrilled that Liz Cheney is supporting Kamala Harris,"" arguing that Cheney is ""putting our country above her party.""

Chepke added that Cheney's endorsement of Harris will ""absolutely"" encourage some Republican voters to cast ballots for Harris next month.

""I think that she is a die-hard conservative and that she is stating her case about why she thinks it's important to put democracy first. And, you know, frankly, democracy is much more important than the cost of a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas at this point in our lives,"" Chepke said.

Cheney joined Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, which bills itself as the birthplace of the GOP, on Thursday, and formally endorsed Harris for president.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

LIZ CHENEY CALLS SPEAKER JOHNSON 'DANGEROUS' FOR HELPING TRUMP 'UNDERMINE OUR REPUBLIC'

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

Cheney was the third-most powerful Republican in Congress from 2019 to 2021 but saw her rising star fade in the party as she launched repeated attacks against Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.

""What is important is to recognize we just had a violent mob assault the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to prevent us from carrying out our constitutional duty,"" Cheney said on Jan. 6 after Trump supporters stormed into the Capitol.

""There is no question that the president formed the mob. The president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. This is what America is not.""

HOUSE JAN 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

Cheney went on to vote to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection, sat on the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack to investigate the protest and has continued leveling attacks on Trump this year.

""I ask you to stand in truth. To reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump,"" Cheney told the Harris supporters in Wisconsin last week.

Trump has meanwhile slammed Cheney as ""a low IQ War Hawk"" who suffers ""gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

145,Trump sounds alarm on illegal immigrant murderers: 'A lot of bad genes in our country',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-sounds-alarm-illegal-immigrant-murderers-bad-genes-in-country,2024-10-07T22:26:45Z,"Former President Trump discusses new details on the assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. in an exclusive interview with The Ingraham Angle airing Monday at 7 p.m. ET.

Former President Trump on Monday described illegal immigrant murderers as having ""bad genes"" and warned that there are ""a lot of bad genes in our country"" as illegal immigrant crime remains a top issue for voters ahead of the November election.

""How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers, many of them murdered far more than one person, and they're now happily living in the United States,"" the 2024 Republican presidential nominee told radio host Hugh Hewitt.

Trump appeared to be referring to the more than 13,000 illegal immigrants in the U.S. who are on Immigration and Customs Enforcement's non-detained docket with a conviction for homicide. The data was revealed in a letter to lawmakers last month. Some of those, although it is unclear how many, will be in federal or state prisons, and some came into the U.S. in prior administrations. The data says that, among those not in detention, there are 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges.

NEW POLL REVEALS TRUMP HAS SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

The data revelation has again fired up the issue of illegal immigrant crime, which has been a top concern for many voters amid a massive border security crisis in which record numbers were seen at the border and a number of high-profile crimes committed allegedly by illegal immigrants.

""You know, now a murderer, I believe this, it's in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,"" he said.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS

Trump appeared to be referring only to murderers, but some media outlets quickly pounced on Trump's words and accused him of referring to immigrants more broadly. An NBC News headline described it as the ""latest disparagement of migrants"" from the former president.

The Washington Post, Politico and other mainstream media outlets also echoed this same narrative. Mediaite described Trump's comment as ""chilling"" and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""That type of language is hateful, it's disgusting, it's inappropriate. It has no place in our country.""

Trump has promised to take a tougher line on illegal immigration as well as some forms of legal immigration. He has promised to launch a massive deportation campaign if elected. He has also promised to finish the border wall that he started in his first administration and end Biden-era parole programs that have brought hundreds of thousands of migrants into the U.S.

Polls generally show that Trump is leading his Democrat opponent, Vice President Harris, on the issues of immigration and border security. Republicans have said that the Biden administration encouraged and fueled the border crisis by rolling back Trump-era policies and expanding catch-and-release.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Harris has sought to position herself as the candidate better suited to handle border security, pointing to her past as a prosecutor who went after transnational criminal organizations. She has also backed a bipartisan border security bill unveiled this year that would surge funding for the border and also limit some asylum entries.

Harris and the Biden administration have accused Trump of opposing that bill for political purposes, but conservatives have said the bill would only codify high levels of illegal immigration.

Meanwhile, border encounters are down sharply at the border, with a drop of more than 50% since the summer. The administration puts that down in part to an executive order signed by President Biden that limits asylum entries into the U.S. Harris recently supported a move to toughen up that order further."

Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann called for Tesla mogul Elon Musk to be deported, suggesting President Biden should use presidential immunity to get the multi-billionaire business magnate ""the F out of our country.""

Olbermann, a staunch critic of former President Trump, is irked that Musk has criticized FEMA and supported the Republican presidential nominee on X, where he boasts over 200 million followers.

""It is now time to cancel all of Elon Musk's government contracts. Tesla, SpaceX, whatever other crap he's selling us,"" Olbermann said on a video posted to social media intended to promote his podcast.

ELON MUSK CALLS 2024 A 'MUST-WIN SITUATION' FOR FREE SPEECH, TOUTS TRUMP'S CHARACTER AFTER BEING 'UNDER FIRE'

While Olbermann doesn't want the government to work with Musk, the former MSNBC host posted the video to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that is owned by Musk.

Olbermann accused Musk of spreading ""potentially fatal disinformation and misinformation about FEMA's recovery efforts and the impact in the effected states,"" as the Biden-Harris administration has been criticized after sending mixed messages on whether FEMA resources were used to support migrants.

""He is also now working in an in-kind donation turning Twitter X into a Trump advertising campaign. It's time to cancel all the contracts and re-assess his immigration status, and hopefully deport him the hell out of the country,"" Olbermann said.

""If we can't do that by conventional means, President Biden, you have presidential immunity,"" Olbermann continued. ""Get Elon Musk the F out of our country and do it now.""

Olbermann's rant comes on the heels of Musk joining Trump on stage at a campaign rally during his first return to Butler, Pennsylvania since facing an assassination attempt at the hands of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks at the site just 12 weeks prior.

""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" Musk said.

""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot,"" he continued. ""America is the home of the brave, and there's no truer test than courage under fire, so who do you want representing America?""

The crowd erupted, waving signs that read ""Never Surrender"" and ""Fight, Fight, Fight"" behind the stage.

Musk, who has outspokenly defended free speech, warned that next month's Nov. 5 face-off between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will be the ""most important election of our lifetime,"" with basic freedoms that are the bedrock of democracy at stake.

""This is a must-win situation,"" Musk told the crowd of 60,000.

Olbermann, the far-left firebrand known for his stormy exits from MSNBC and ESPN, has been among the most outspoken critics of Trump, even moving out of his luxury New York City apartment building because it was owned by him.

He once claimed that Trump and his family had done more damage to the U.S. than 9/11 mastermind Usama bin Laden. Olbermann also once tweeted at then-first daughter Ivanka Trump and called her father a ""neo-Nazi"" and a ""racist."" Olbermann frequently used profanity to criticize Trump.

Olbermann famously walked away from ESPN ahead of the 2020 election so he could speak out against Trump on YouTube and social media.

Aside from supporting Trump, Olbermann took issue with Musk, writing, ""Yup,"" to caption a video of White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisting last week that FEMA resources were not used on migrants despite a 2022 video of her saying otherwise. This has been a hot topic as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday that FEMA, which he oversees, may not have enough funds to get through the hurricane season.

The White House has said FEMA funds spent on the migrant crisis came from a different funding stream, and those expenditures did not impact the part of FEMA's budget reserved for disaster relief.

According to every analyst, the race is going to be extremely close. And over the weekend, President Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania - where he survived an assassination attempt in July. The event - one of the most powerful he has ever done - created a unique opportunity to assess the status of the race, and President Trump's place in American history. Here are some observations:

First, the Musk Factor. His appearance for Trump and his urgent appeal to voters is monumental. He speaks for a new bloc of highly educated voters who were not traditionally Republicans yet who recognize that President Trump must win in order to preserve our constitutional freedoms. For months now, an array of former Democrats - including Robert Kennedy, Jr., former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and RFK's former running mate Nicole Shanahan - have been warning us that the people supporting Vice President Kamala Harris have built a political machine so powerful that it threatens our whole political system.

TRUMP REVEALS NEW DETAILS OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: 'IT WAS THE CRAZIEST DAY'

Consider what Harris's supporters have done in recent years:

Elon Musk understands that if these people win again - if they can take a non-qualified puppet like Harris and put her in the White House - then none of us is safe.

Second, J.D. Vance continues to out-perform and impress. This should not be surprising to anyone who has followed him over the past few years (including his frequent appearances on ""The Ingraham Angle""). His rise has been one of the greatest developments of this year.

DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP'S DEFIANT SUPPORTERS FLOCK TO BUTLER RALLY WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE

When the year began, many in Washington hoped that if they could beat President Trump one more time, then the America First movement he leads would be broken. They were openly rooting for people like former Rep. Liz Cheney to resume her seat in the GOP. They expected that after these elections, the Republican Party would go back to its role of serving as the establishment's junior partner. But now - after his crushing the vice-presidential debate - the establishment is learning that the 40-year-old Vance is a compelling politician who will likely be a national figure for the next 30 years.

Yet Vance is not an anomaly. Under President Trump's leadership, the GOP has developed a deep bench of talented leaders - such as Sens. Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Govs. Ron DeSantis, and Glenn Youngkin - who are ready to put their own stamp on this agenda. This crop of leaders will continue to grow the GOP into a multi-ethnic, multi-racial force for working-class people.

TRUMP HOLDS CAMPAIGN RALLY IN BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, MONTHS AFTER JULY ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Third, is Trump himself. The sheer size of the crowd in Butler spoke volumes. The atmosphere was electric. This time, the security was tight, sharpshooters on every visible roof.

President Trump's success has rested on his ability to convince tens of millions of voters that he fights for their interests. Love, gratitude, defiance and patriotism were on full display on the Butler fairgrounds. They are not a threat to democracy - they are simply smart enough to understand how the Washington D.C. Cabal has torn apart America.

Patrick Henry would recognize this type of patriot, as would Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. Most importantly, they are not mindless drones who do what they are told - if you're looking for mindless drones, check out the Network Hacks who take whatever position the Democrats' donors tell them to take. These are good, decent patriots who are trying to save a country they love.

Finally, I saw President Trump. For anyone who has covered politics over the last 30 years, it is obvious that President Trump is really the only person we have covered who truly deserves a place in the history books. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were talented and clever politicians, but they were never willing to say or do anything that really challenged the rich and powerful. The only other GOP administrations, besides Trump, since 1988 - the two Bush administrations - will not be remembered as transformative.

But President Trump has changed America. He has beaten the establishment so badly on economic issues that they have mostly given up trying to talk about them. His foreign policy was so much more successful than theirs that they don't want Harris talking about those issues either.

He has been vilified, impeached, indicted by the most powerful people in the world - he has faced unlimited opposition funding from some of the richest people in the world - and he just keeps fighting.

He is in a stronger position today than he was at this same point in both 2016 and 2020. By promoting Vance and other young Republicans, he has built a movement that will survive him whatever happens in November. And he has shown incredible physical courage by pressing forward in a situation where we have troubling evidence of sheer incompetence on behalf of the Secret Service.

Fifty years from now, one hundred years from now - two hundred years from now - no one will care about Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Tim Walz. They will be regarded as mouthpieces for a failed establishment. But historians will still be trying to understand President Trump and his movement.

What I hope they will see is what I saw in Butler: Even after two impeachments, endless lawfare, and an assassin's bullet, Trump was a man who refused to give up in his battle for the forgotten working people of America."

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre got into a heated exchange with Fox News Channel's Peter Doocy over the White House sending aid to Lebanon during the hurricane season, which has had devastating effects on North Carolina.

Harris pledged Saturday to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon while Israel attacks Hezbollah infrastructure and targets in the country. Harris argued the country was ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation."" Doocy asked Jean-Pierre why the Biden administration was soliciting congressional input before sending disaster loan funds to North Carolina, but not to send the slush funds to a foreign country.

""On this issue of funding, the administration has money to send to Lebanon without Congress coming back. But Congress does have to come back to approve money to send to people in North Carolina. Do I have that right?"" Doocy said.

""The president and the vice president has had a robust whole-of-government response to this... More than $200 million, ...for the disaster help,"" Jean-Pierre responded, adding that ""people want to do disinformation, misinformation, which is dangerous.""

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Doocy asked whether the president's letter to Congress soliciting their help was misinformation.

""No. The way you're asking me the question is misinformation. There is money that we are allocating to the impacted areas, and there's money there to help people who truly need it. There are survivors who need the funding, who need the funding. And it's there,"" she said.

""You can't call a question you don't like misinformation,"" Doocy said.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

""No, what you're asking me is why Congress needs to come back and do their job. That's what you're asking me. Congress needs to come back and do their job and provide extra assistance, extra funding for the disaster relief fund. That's what Congress needs to do,"" she responded. ""You may not want that, but that's okay. That's what this president wants, and that's what the vice president wants.""

Jean-Pierre then stormed out of the briefing room.

The administration has been accused of mismanaging funds after Homeland Security's Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

Critics on social media were quick to slam Harris for touting the foreign aid to Lebanon, arguing that many North Carolina residents are struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene.

""Kamala is touting giving money to the people of Lebanon-while stiff-arming the humanitarian crisis in North Carolina,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on X. ""This is Kamala's Katrina.""

""Could this be any more tone deaf? We have Americans suffering and in danger right now after the hurricane and this is what Kamala has to announce. America First!"" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., said on X.

The controversial tweet comes as the Biden administration has continued to face backlash for its handling of Helene, with former President Trump calling the federal response to the disaster the ""most incompetently managed 'storm,' at the federal level, ever seen before."""

Republican candidate Hung Cao, running for the Virginia Senate seat currently held by Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine, is confident he can turn Virginia red from purple.

He's also doubling down on his controversial comments made during last week's debate about U.S. military personnel ""who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds"" in a bid against progressive social training in the military.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran endorsed by former President Trump, told Fox News Digital in an interview, ""It's about warriors that are just going to do anything to win, and those are the people we need.""

VIRGINIA SENATE DEBATE: CLINTON'S EX-RUNNING MATE KAINE AND GOP CHALLENGER CAO SPAR ON IMMIGRATION AND DEI IN THE MILITARY

""And that's what I mean by rip out your own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. That's a true warrior, whether it's a alpha male or alpha female, but not some cross-dressing ... drag queen,"" he said. ""That's not what we need in the military. We need strong men and women that are willing to put their lives online to fight for this country.""

During last week's debate against Kaine, Cao criticized the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than 30% of Americans aged 17 to 24 were eligible to serve in the military, and this number has declined even more since then.

""There's only so many hours in the day, and there's so much money. And when you're spending all your money and time to look at all these woke issues, you're taking away from time to train for war,"" Cao said.

VIRGINIA FAA CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY SPIED FOR IRAN, SHARED PRIVATE INFO ON US AIRPORTS, ENERGY INDUSTRY: DOJ

When it comes to flipping Virginia's Senate seat, Cao is confident he can achieve it despite the Cook Political Report designating the seat as solid blue.

Cao argued that the Cook report is wrong, noting how he reduced Biden's 19% margin in Northern Virginia to 6% in 2022. He highlighted that despite Trump losing Virginia by 10 points in 2010, Republicans won all statewide races in 2021 and gained a seat in 2022. In 2023, more Republicans voted than Democrats despite Democrat gerrymandering efforts.

""And so, you know, having moved north Virginia the way I did, and if the south comes out, we're going to win this race,"" he said.

Trump has endorsed Cao, and political scientists say his path to victory is narrow, given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters, according to the Associated Press.

Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.

151,"Kamala Harris courts disillusioned Arab Americans over Jewish groups, records show",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-courts-disillusioned-arab-americans-over-jewish-groups,2024-10-07T19:30:40Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the devastation from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel one year later. The 'Outnumbered' panel also discusses the tragedy as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.

Vice President Kamala Harris appears to prioritize winning back Arab American and Muslim voters who were dejected by President Joe Biden's handling of war in the Middle East over courting the Jewish voter.

That's according to an internal review of her calendar meetups with both groups since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

Harris met with Arab American advocates ahead of a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on Friday. That followed a meeting with activists with the Pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement, which has declined to endorse her, in Michigan in July.

Her public schedule hasn't included meetings with Jewish groups since meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately in July, after she declined to preside over his joint address to Congress.

In August, her campaign nominated Ilan Goldenberg as its liaison to the Jewish community, and on Aug. 15, Harris sent campaign officials to meet with Jewish leaders in Michigan. In September, she called the parents of the late Hersch Goldberg-Polin, the American hostage slain by Hamas. Fox News Digital could not find a record of any other face-to-face Jewish outreach by Harris.

Wa'el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, told CNN that Harris had told the Arab group on Friday ""that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.""

The Arab Americans told her she needed ""to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don't agree with.""

HARRIS REFUSES TO CALL NETANYAHU A 'CLOSE ALLY' ONE YEAR AFTER OCTOBER 7

Michigan, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, is a crucial battleground state this election. It has the second-highest population of Arab American residents, who make up around 3% of its population.

On the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, former President Donald Trump will speak to Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President's Residence in honor of those killed a year ago.

One year on from the outbreak of war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel is now entrenched in war on other fronts too. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recently launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, and last week missiles rained down on Tel Aviv -- though most were intercepted -- from Iran.

Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic -- in 2020, Biden won 69% of their vote. Trump won 30%.

Harris' focus on Arab American outreach could in part be due to shifting polling within the community and an aggressive outreach from the Trump campaign to capitalize on that.

Arab Americans also historically favor Democrats -- but new polling suggests that could change. Of likely voters in the community, Arab Americans favor Trump over Harris 46% to 42%, according to new polling by the Arab American Institute.

Trump has been airing ads aimed at Arab Americans in Michigan, and his former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell and his daughter Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman, have been leading his outreach to the community.

HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY 'SWAY' OVER NETANYAHU

""His outreach now is much better, much different than it was in 2016 and 2020,"" Adel Ayoub, leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Fox News Digital of Trump.

Biden won 60% of the Arab American vote in 2020, but support from that community has cratered since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023.

The National Uncommitted movement launched a campaign calling on voters to cast uncommitted ballots in swing state primaries to send a message to Democrats, and more than a million did so.

Harris spoke with leaders of the Uncommitted Movement in August. That same month, her campaign manager met with Arab and Muslim leaders.

Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for loosening sanctions on Iran, thus emboldening Iran's proxies to carry out the attack last year.

Trump has repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and that if he loses the Nov. 5 election, ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that."""

Sen. JD Vance blasted the Biden-Harris administration on Monday for not doing enough to bring home the hostages that Hamas took from Israel during the deadly Oct. 7 attack one year ago.

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""I'm going to get a little political here. It is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who haven't done a thing,"" Vance said. ""Vice President Harris, our message is, 'Bring them home.' Use your authority to help bring them home. We can do it. We just need real leadership.""

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS SET UP ENCAMPMENT OUTSIDE JEWISH DEM REP'S HOME ON EVE OF OCT 7 HAMAS ATTACK ANNIVERSARY

The attack sparked a war in Gaza, where Israel has moved to eliminate Hamas and return those taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Harris came under fire Sunday for a lengthy ""word salad"" answer in which she appeared unable to fully commit to Israel during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

Meanwhile, Vance gave full-throated support for Israel, saying that former President Trump will make sure Israel has the right to protect itself and that the hostages are returned home.

""I speak for Donald Trump and saying that when he is president, America will protect our American Jewish brothers and sisters. We will stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals. And we are going to bring home American hostages wherever they're held and whoever is holding them,"" he said.

Vice President Kamala Harris plans to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations as part of her economic plan if elected in November, she said in a new interview.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold.

""My plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy,"" Harris told ""60 Minutes"" in a clip released on Monday.

""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker reminded Harris that the question was ""how are you going to pay for it?""

Harris quickly said that wealthy Americans would foot the bill.

""I'm going to make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes,"" Harris said.

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations,"" Harris continued. ""I plan on making that fair.""

Whitaker shot back, ""But we're dealing with the real world here,"" and asked how that plan would get through Congress.

""You know, when you talk, quietly, with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I am talking about,"" Harris said.

""Cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about,"" Harris added. ""Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses.""

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Harris' opponent, former President Trump, was invited to appear on ""60 Minutes"" as well for its election interview special, but he declined.

Last month, Harris unveiled new small-business tax proposals last week aimed at reducing the cost burden related to starting a new business. Among the proposals was a substantial increase in the standard tax deduction for small-business startup costs, from $5,000 to $50,000. ""It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business,"" the vice president said during a stump speech announcing the new proposal. ""We're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground.""

Harris has simultaneously expressed support for raising marginal tax rates for both corporations and individuals, which conservative economists argued would work to diminish the benefit received by the tenfold increase in the startup deduction.

In addition to Harris' new tax proposals for small businesses, she also laid out her plan this week for taxing capital gains. She wants to increase it to 33%, whereas Biden reportedly wants the current rate, which is at 23.8%, to be nearly doubled, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Harris has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

The path to victory lies in two key blocs - early voters, and those who lean Republican but are largely apathetic to the process overall - McKoon indicated in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""We feel good about things here in Georgia,"" the former state senator said. ""We've got a lot of work to do over the next month or so, but we feel like we're in position to win.""

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

He pointed to some recent surveys that show former President Trump with a slight edge over Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as early figures on absentee voting.

Early and absentee voters were key to President Biden's victory nationwide in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic largely forced Americans to stay home.

In Georgia, parts of which were ravaged by Hurricane Helene just over a week ago, early and absentee voters may prove just as critical this year. Biden beat Trump in the Peach State by roughly 12,000 votes in 2020.

""One very important lesson is the importance of early voting. We have three weeks of in-person early voting here in Georgia. Republicans traditionally have not done a whole lot to target our voters to get them out early - to make a plan and go ahead and bank those votes,"" McKoon said.

""As a result, we had to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to move the vast majority of our voters to the polls on Election Day.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Motivating many of those likely voters to turn out early, McKoon explained, frees up state party resources ""to focus on low-propensity voters who are likely to vote for President Trump, if we just get them to the polls.""

""But of course, those voters need to be touched multiple times. And so, early voting plays a huge role in our overall strategy,"" McKoon said.

When asked how low-propensity voters could be reached, the Republican official explained it's more a matter of outreach than identification.

""Of course, all of that requires resources. That requires money - put mail in the mailbox, ads on television, telephone calls to their home, knocking on their door. We're trying to do all of those things,"" McKoon said.

Another factor of the Trump campaign's nationwide outreach - and in Georgia, in particular - is convincing Black male voters to vote Republican.

Trump allies have said that securing roughly 20% of support from Black men across the U.S. could be critical to swaying the election in his favor.

A recent Howard University public opinion poll found that roughly one in five Black men under age 50 who are living in battleground states support Trump.

""You see the work that's being done, you know, Black Voices for Trump, a lot of the other movements, grassroots movements, around the state. Direct voter contact, again, is really king in this area. But no one's better at that than President Trump himself,"" McKoon said.

""That's really about economic anxiety and the feeling that this administration, with its open borders policies, are making it even more difficult for Black voters to get ahead in this country.""

Georgia's early voting period runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1."

""Joe Biden does keep popping up,"" Dovere told CNN host Kasie Hunt, referencing recent exchanges with reporters, specifically after former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney endorsed Harris and when he made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room on Friday.

""On Friday, when Joe Biden felt like he had had a good week at the White House and wanted to go to the briefing room to talk about it, they did not coordinate that with the Harris campaign.

I can tell you that a lot of people on the Harris campaign did not find that helpful,"" Dovere said.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

""Biden in the next couple of days is heading to Angola and Germany. It's not like a really pressing foreign trip. A lot of people in the Harris campaign wish that he would maybe go away for longer at this point,"" he added.

He said that Harris was in a tricky situation as the incumbent vice president.

""Harris has to embody and embrace that change and speak to that change, while also being a quasi incumbent and having Donald Trump and JD Vance attack her as if she has been the one signing the executive orders,"" he said.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Dovere reported on Sunday that Biden's closest advisers, citing people who have spoken with them in recent days, still believe the president ""would be in the same spot or better right now had he stayed in the race.""

A veteran Democratic consultant laughed when CNN mentioned the advisers' feelings and told the outlet, ""that's literally insane.""

During Biden's surprise press appearance on Friday, he made a point to emphasize that he and Harris are in constant contact.

""We're singing from the same song sheet. She helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" Biden told reporters.

Several high-profile volunteers with the group Women for Trump flew to Georgia to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Helene in the group's first mission before they crisscross the country to support communities in need.

RNC co-chair Lara Trump, former DNC vice chair and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Georgia GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick, and former ESPN anchor Sage Steele launched their ""Save America"" tour on Thursday in Austell, Georgia.

TRUMP SLAMS THE BIDEN ADMIN'S RESPONSE TO HURRICANE HELENE

The group traveled to Austell via commercial air. Their travel was paid for by the Trump campaign, the group said.

The group donated thousands of dollars of supplies to Sweetwater Mission - a social services organization in Austell that helps to prevent hunger and homelessness - with the assistance of Goya Cares.

""They put us on the map. We got a call from a woman in New Mexico wanting to donate to us. And we said, 'How did you know about us?' This woman was watching the rally with President Trump and the chyron on the screen read that Lara Trump was going to be visiting Sweetwater Mission with Goya Foods,"" Sweetwater Mission executive director Pat Soden said to Lara Trump.

""You've put us on the map, and I can't thank you enough.""

Lara Trump said, in turn, Women for Trump is ""incredibly grateful for Goya Cares,"" because they have ""allowed us to donate thousands of pounds of non-perishable food for the people of this community.""

""We're here in the wake of Hurricane Helene and honored to be able to give back,"" Lara Trump said. ""We've also been able to secure water, blankets, diapers, and items to meet the immediate needs of those impacted by Hurricane Helene.""

But Lara Trump said this is ""just the beginning.""

BIDEN, HARRIS INSPECT DAMAGE IN HURRICANE-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP VISIT

""We're kicking off our Women for Trump tour in Georgia, and we'll be headed all over the country supporting communities across this great country,"" Trump said.

Reflecting on the visit, Gabbard told Fox News Digital that it was a ""privilege to shine a light on the incredibly inspiring impact local Georgia nonprofits like Sweetwater Mission are having on those who need help the most.""

""I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to join Lara Trump, Sage Steele, Danica Patrick and many volunteers to pitch in and thank the hardworking staff and volunteers, especially during a time of great hardship and desperate need in the wake of Hurricane Helene,"" Gabbard said.

Hurricane Helene killed at least 232 people as the storm tore through the southeast. Hundreds more are still unaccounted for from the deadliest mainland U.S. hurricane since Katrina.

Women for Trump are expected to travel across the country, with each visit focused on philanthropic efforts to support communities in need."

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support. Three percent of voters remain undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 55% of those Hispanic voters said they voted for President Biden, while a third said they voted for Trump.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The vice president's lead over the former president is slightly smaller in neighboring Nevada, at 56%-40%. According to the survey, Independent American Party's Joel Skousen is just over 1%, Libertarian Chase Oliver is under 1%, and 2% are undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 56% said they voted for Biden, while 33% said they voted for Trump.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

The latest surveys in Arizona and Nevada - as well as the other five swing states - indicate margin-of-error races between Harris and Trump.

The Suffolk University/USA Today surveys were conducted Sept. 27-Oct. 2, through live interviews of 500 self-identified Hispanic voters in the states of Arizona and Nevada. The overall sampling error for results from each state is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points."

Watch the full ""Ingraham Angle"" interview with former President Trump, Monday night at 7:00pm ET on Fox News Channel.

President Trump revealed new details about his first assassination attempt during his second rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, including how his son Barron found out about the attack during an exclusive interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham.

""Barron was playing tennis with his friends, and somebody walked over and ran over and said, 'Your father's been shot. He's been shot,'"" Trump told ""The Ingraham Angle."" ""Barron really likes his father a lot... and he came in [saying], 'Mom, mom, Mom, what happened?'""

""Then they saw me get up, and then they saw the fist bump... it's very interesting,"" he continued. ""When I got up, people thought maybe he's dead.""

Trump rallied tens of thousands of supporters at the same site in Butler where he was shot in the ear by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks on July 13.

During the first attempt on his life, Trump was rushed off-stage by the Secret Service and taken to a local hospital, where he said it was shut down upon his arrival.

""The hospital was great, and I didn't realize this -- when a president goes to an area, they close the hospital in its entirety, it's ready for exactly this,"" he said. ""I didn't know they did. I got there, doctors and nurses were outside, and no people. They literally close it, almost like they expect this.""

""It's... genius, but who would ever think that? And I was so impressed,"" he continued.

After Trump was shot in the ear and Secret Service agents swarmed him, shoving him to the ground as shots were fired, he quickly got up as they escorted him off the stage and held his fist in the air while mouthing the words, ""fight, fight, fight.""

""I convinced them I thought I was only hit in the ear. It's very interesting,"" he recalled. ""But they got me up and I watched and it was dead silent, even though I was standing up and in vision because people didn't know I was alive or not, and then when I did the fist pump, everybody realized and they're screaming, 'USA, USA.' It was the craziest day. It was a crazy time.""

Trump also held a moment of silence for Corey Comperatore at 6:11 p.m., the exact time that Crooks began firing at the former president on July 13. Comperatore, a rally attendee, father, husband and firefighter, was fatally wounded while protecting his family.

Speaking at the beginning of his speech in Butler, Trump acknowledged Comperatore's death and thanked his relatives - including his widow and their daughters - for attending.

Elon Musk also made a grand appearance and delivered remarks, urging supporters to vote as the election nears.

""Just be a pest to everyone,"" he said to the audience. ""You know, people on the street everywhere: Vote, vote, vote!""

""Fight, fight, fight, vote, vote, vote,"" Musk added. At one point, the X owner jumped excitedly.

160,'We haven't done that much': Former Estonia head says US fears of escalation with Putin are unwarranted,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/we-havent-done-much-former-estonia-head-says-us-fears-escalation-putin-unwarranted,2024-10-07T13:51:59Z,"Fox News Digital interview with former Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid about the war in Ukraine

As U.S. support for aiding Ukraine continues to fracture Americans, Kersti Kaljulaid, the former president of Estonia, wants to remind Americans what's at stake.

Estonia, a country in Northern Europe bordered by the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland, is slightly larger than Denmark and has a coastline with 1,521 islands.

Kaljulaid described what's happening across the world as a ""tectonic shift,"" during a recent interview with Fox News Digital at her nation's embassy in Washington, D.C. ""There is the freedom-loving world. And then there are the others - the new Axis of Evil - China, Iran, North Korea, Russia. China is leading that coalition.""

""Ukraine, with its brave action, has offered us the opportunity to score the first victory in this battle, and I think we should not miss it,"" she said.

And the cost of securing the so-called ""freedom-loving world"" is relatively little, she argues.

""It's very important to understand that Ukrainians are dying, but we, the West, have not spent anything close to what normally needs to be spent to win war. We are spending at the rate of 0.1% of GDP. And frankly speaking, if we could spend 0.5, then Ukraine will win, and it would be first time in history where a major conflict can be actually be won with so little resources.""

Her visit came just after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the U.S., causing a stir among Republicans after he visited Pennsylvania - swing state - with only Democratic lawmakers and called Sen. JD Vance ""too radical.""

UKRAINIAN STRONGHOLD VUHLEDAR FALLS TO RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE

He was here to beg for the U.S.'s blessing to use the long-range missiles it provides to strike deep inside Russian territory. So far, his pleas have gone unanswered. The Biden administration fears provoking nuclear-armed Russia and furthering U.S. involvement in the war.

""I think the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast has demonstrated to us that the Russian threats [of escalation], they carry no value,"" Kaljulaid said.

In August, Ukrainian troops made a risky move, invading Kursk Oblast and taking over the Russian territory, using their best tanks in the offensive, which left several key villages and towns along the southern and eastern front lines for Russia's taking.

Kaljulaid said she supports Zelenskyy's request to lift restrictions on the ATACMs, pointing out that Ukraine already uses these weapons to strike in Crimea, which Russia views as its territory.

LITHUANIAN FM WARNS RUSSIA CAN DO 'SO MUCH DAMAGE TO ITS NEIGHBORS'

""You could say, I mean, paradoxically, there is nothing new.""

""Putin is not playing the old Cold War game where one side escalated, then the other side did, and then everybody sat down and negotiated the levels down again. I mean, Putin's regime is a terrorist regime.""

She went on: ""It doesn't abide by any rules. All the bridges are burned. So when they decide it's worth escalating, they will decide anyway, but we should do the right thing and not worry about escalation.""

A University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll conducted in July and August found 48% of Americans say the U.S. should support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's incursion ""as long as it takes."" Thirty-nine percent said support should last 1-2 years and another 11% thought it should last 2-5 years.

The U.S. has spent around $175 billion aiding the war in Ukraine, $106 billion of which went directly to the government of Ukraine. The rest funded U.S. activities associated with the war and other affected nations in the region.

""This is about a third of the money which is considered waste in the COVID pandemic spending [in the U.S.]""

""If we compare it to our economic might of the free world, then we haven't done that much,"" said Kaljulaid.

""Europeans are doing even more. And this is a common error as well, to think that Europe is not doing its part. Europe's doing even more than us right now, and I would really like to have a healthy competition. Who does more?""

The U.S. has given more money to Ukraine since the outbreak of war, followed by Germany, the U.K., Japan, and Canada. As a percentage of their GDP, Denmark, Estonia and Lithuania topped the ranking, with 1.8, 1.7, and 1.4%, respectively.

Kaljulaid declined to say whether relations would become more difficult under a second Trump presidency - Trump has spoken out against aiding Ukraine and claimed he could negotiate peace with Zelenskyy and Putin.

In fact, she had an optimistic outlook that Trump could come to support Eastern Europe if elected to a second term, just as she said he did in his first term.

""Eastern Europe had quite a big presence. Trump visited Poland, [former Vice President] Mike Pence visited Talinn [Estonia's capital].""

She noted Trump's work on the Three Seas Initiative and actions to end Syria's chemical weapons attacks on its civilians.

""That was not a simple thing. It was a quite courageous thing, and it was exactly what you expect from Republican foreign policy of the United States - to defend the free world."""

Vice President Kamala Harris was roasted on social media for a comment on Israel and how she ""can't make any sense at all"" in a new viral clip.

Harris gave a rare sit-down interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, where Bill Whitaker asked whether the U.S. has any ""sway"" over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war against Hamas continues. Monday marks one year since the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks,"" Harris responded.

She continued, ""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a cease-fire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

The lengthy ""word salad"" and her inability to commit to Israel as an ally shocked and frustrated several X users after the clip premiered.

""Kamala is asked about Israel, can't make any sense at all. Kamala is like a running team that's behind that can't throw the ball. After hiding her for months, they are now panicking and doing interviews everywhere. But that's going to get her behind more,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis, a supporter of former President Trump, wrote.

Former ESPN anchor Sage Steele asked, ""Someone please interpret what she just said here...""

""People talk this way when they have absolutely nothing substantive to say because they know next to nothing about the subject at hand,"" Federalist senior editor John Daniel Davidson said.

""Shocking,"" Fox News host Mark Levin exclaimed.

Comedian Tim Young commented, ""60 minutes asked Kamala if Netanyahu even listens to us after we give Israel weapons and money. Kamala replies with a pile of word salad. It would be easier if she just said that no world leader respects or listens to her even after we hand out money.""

""This is the real Kamala. And she's no friend of Israel,"" California Rep. Darrell Issa wrote.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik wrote, ""Israel is taking out Iranian-backed terrorists across the Middle East, making the world safer for Israel and the United States yet Kamala Harris refuses to say that Prime Minister Netanyahu is a strong ally to America. Kamala Harris is unfit to be the President of the United States.""

During the interview, Harris dodged repeated questions from Whitaker over her support for Israel.

Whitaker asked, ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

""I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes,"" Harris responded.

Harris was also criticized last month for providing scant details about whether she would change her policies on Israel as president.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday about growing trends among poorer wards and districts in the Pennsylvania city to shift towards the Republican Party despite years of being solidly blue.

One example the report cited included 27-year-old Gabriel Lopez who registered as a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton for his first election in 2016. Since then, he changed his registration to Republican and voiced his support for Trump.

""Democrats keep saying [Trump] is going to bring down the economy, but he was already president for four years, and taxes were lower,"" Lopez said. ""We're tired of the same politics. We got a different type of guy, and the people actually love him.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

The article added, ""Lopez embodies one of Democrats' biggest problems in Pennsylvania: working-class voters in Philadelphia, a once reliable voting bloc for the party, have drifted right in recent years. And they've been disproportionately affected by rising prices over the last several years, an issue many blame Democrats for.""

Although Philadelphia, which holds 20% of the state's Democratic voters, may be crucial for Vice President Kamala Harris to win the state, the Inquirer reported the city lost the most Democratic voters out of any city in the 2020 election.

The trend was most pronounced in poorer, less-educated areas with majority-Latino neighborhoods showing the most movement, likely concerned about the economy.

Retired truck driver and registered Democrat Jim Kohn listed that as his top issue.

""When Trump was president, everything was cheaper,"" Kohn said. ""Now, everything is so sky-high.""

Other Democrats in the area remained optimistic about Harris' chances, though some understood the growing support for Trump.

""Many of us have people in our families who have gone to jail, or gone to schools that have failed us. We're not trustful of the government,"" Álvarez Febo, a Democrat who plans to vote for Harris, said. ""Then you have someone like Trump, who is a liar, and for some people, it's like, 'you know something? He's an honest representation of what we feel.'""

""They're saying Kamala is going to save our democracy,"" Febo added. ""That means very little for people who can't keep the lights on.""

Some Republicans, by contrast, were very optimistic about a potential political shift in the city.

""When I first started in politics in 1978, the managerial class was Republican -- no one votes the way their bosses vote,"" 45th Ward GOP Leader Charlie O'Connor said. ""Now, most people in the managerial class vote Democratic and no one is voting the way their boss is. So it's been a flip. Most of the bosses are Democrats and the Democratic Party has become the party of the upper middle class.""

Pennsylvania is considered one of the most competitive states for this presidential election. A Fox News survey found Harris and Trump tied at 49% among likely voters in the state. Trump previously won Pennsylvania in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton but lost the state in 2020 to President Biden."

""Saturday Night Live"" creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels admitted he has not reached out and will not reach out to the presidential candidates for a potential cameo ahead of the election.

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter Tuesday, Michaels explained it would be unlikely for former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris to appear for the show's milestone 50th anniversary season, citing the need for ""equal time"" to both of them.

""You can't bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,"" Michaels said. ""You can't have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.""

However, he did not rule out a potential appearance from either of them after the election, when they would no longer be presidential candidates.

""Everybody knows what we do, and I think we're going to do it again. It's what we're supposed to be doing,"" Michaels said. ""So, what's interesting is if you say to the people that we just did that to, 'Do you want to come on because we have a way to do it with you in it?' They almost always say yes.""

The Federal Communications Commission's ""equal-time rule"" was established in 1934 and required radio and television broadcast stations to provide the same amount of time for competing political candidates. There are exceptions to the rule such as newscasts, documentaries and political debates.

Despite the equal-time rule, ""Saturday Night Live"" has allowed political candidates onto its show without providing equal time to their opponents in the past. Then-Senator Obama appeared in the cold opening of a November 2007 episode several months after announcing his candidacy that year.

Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin also appeared in an episode in October 2008, one month before the 2008 presidential election.

Trump himself hosted an episode in November 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign.

The Supreme Court begins its new term today amid lingering internal strife over several recent rulings, with details of its thorny internal deliberations selectively leaked to certain media outlets.

All of this as the nine justices have come under increasing public scrutiny and criticism over perceived blatant partisanship on hot-button issues, ethics controversies and its own wilting reputation as a body remaining above politics.

""The Supreme Court, in a sense, is on the ballot this election, or at least the future of the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Dupree, an appellate attorney and former top Justice Department official. ""So any time the court wades into political waters, it's going to be upsetting people, people who are on the side that loses. And they'll say the court shouldn't have got involved in the political fray. The court recognizes that it's not something that it wants to do, but in some cases, it has no choice.""

JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON SAYS SHE WOULD SUPPORT AN 'ENFORCEABLE CODE' OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT

Here are five questions confronting the Supreme Court:

Directly or indirectly, the nine members of the Supreme Court could again play an outsized role in determining who will be the next president.

There is no indication yet of another Bush v. Gore, the case in which the justices in 2000 ended ongoing litigation over the Florida election results, essentially handing the presidency to George W. Bush.

But the high court four years ago summarily refused to consider a series of lawsuits from Trump and other Republicans in five states President Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Former President Trump has again promised court challenges if he loses, and in a recent social media post, he said this election ""will be under the closest professional scrutiny"" and ""people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

Trump has proceeded with his campaign without the imminent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over his head. His criminal sentencing in the New York business fraud conviction has been postponed until November at least.

And his two separate federal cases involving document mishandling and 2020 election interference have been deferred indefinitely. Those prosecutions could disappear entirely if Trump is elected and dismisses the Justice Department's special counsel.

All this after the Supreme Court in July ruled former presidents enjoy a substantial amount of immunity for ""official acts"" committed in office. Trump has used that ruling to demand both of his federal cases be dismissed.

Two justices took the unusual step of commenting publicly on its effect.

""You gave us a very hard question,"" Justice Neil Grouch exclusively told Fox News' ""America Reports"" co-anchor Sandra Smith. ""It's the first time in American history that one presidential administration was seeking to bring criminal charges against a predecessor. We had to go back and look at what sources were available to us.""

The Trump appointee said the Supreme Court ruled in Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) that civil claims cannot be brought against a president ""presumptively, in his official capacity, after he leaves office. Why? Because that would chill him from exercising the powers and duties of a president while he is president,"" Gorsuch said. ""He would be overwhelmed. His political enemies would simply bring suits against him forevermore.""

But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was on the losing side of the 6-3 opinion, has taken another approach.

""I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,"" she told CBS News while promoting her new book, ""Lovely One: A Memoir.""

The Supreme Court has already gotten involved in several pre-election challenges: allowing some redistricting maps for congressional seats to go into effect and blocking others.

And the justices last month allowed Arizona to temporarily enforce its law requiring proof of citizenship on state voter registration forms.

'STOP PRETENDING': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WANTS DEMS BEHIND SCOTUS ETHICS RULES TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEDICINE

Five days before President Biden withdrew as a candidate for re-election, he made the Supreme Court a major political issue.

Word leaked from the White House on July 16 that Biden was seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for the justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns they were not being held accountable.

The proposal was made public days later, including a congressional law limiting justices to 18-year terms despite the Constitution's guarantee of life tenure for all federal judges.

Biden framed it as an effort to address ""recent extreme opinions the Supreme Court has handed down [that] have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections.""

Public calls for changes came after revelations of previously undisclosed free trips and gifts by the justices and lucrative book deals. Recent public polls support greater ethics reform.

Other federal judges are bound by an enforceable code of conduct, but the high court had long resisted being included.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts' leadership, he and his colleagues adopted a revised code last year, but it still lacks any enforcement mechanism, which critics say makes it feckless and ineffective.

Fox News previously reported that the court had been privately meeting for months on how to structure a new ethics code, one that would address public concerns over its behavior without abdicating what Roberts in particular had said was the court's independence on such matters from congressional oversight.

So, the justices have near-total discretion to decide whether to abide by the new code.

But growing and very public calls for more have come from some justices in recent days.

""A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges,"" said Jackson, ""and so I guess the question is: Is the Supreme Court any different? I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different.""

""I am considering supporting it as a general matter,"" she said. ""I'm not going to get into commenting on particular policy proposals, but from my perspective, I don't have any problem with an enforceable code.""

And Justice Elena Kagan, perhaps the most vocal advocate for an enforcement provision, said this month, ""It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we're doing exactly that. So, it seems like a salutary thing for the court.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recently told the chief justice that the unilateral ethics code adopted by the justices falls short and needs an enforcement trigger.

In a closed-door meeting with federal judges attending a semiannual policymaking conference at the high court, Durbin was seated next to Roberts and made clear that failure by the justices to strengthen their judicial code of conduct could prompt congressional intervention.

Sources say Roberts made no commitments but thanked Durbin for the ongoing dialogue on the issue.

But Justice Neil Gorsuch urged caution, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream last month that he did not want to get into ""what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.""

He added about the role of an independent judiciary, ""It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you, when the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.""

TOP DEM PLOTS TYING SCOTUS FUNDING TO 'ENFORCEABLE' ETHICS CODE AMID THOMAS, ALITO CONTROVERSIES

Following the contentious conclusion of the court's term in July, much was written about the ""Barrett Factor"" and the supposedly evolving jurisprudence of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

She has become something of a recent lightning rod on the right and left over her occasional willingness to depart from her fellow conservatives, especially in cases involving the man who appointed her in 2020.

The 52-year-old Barrett took issue with some conclusions in the former president's historic immunity ruling and criticized parts of the majority ruling keeping him on the ballot in Colorado.

And breaking with conservatives, she separately authored pointed dissents on an obstruction case dealing with a 2021 U.S. Capitol riot suspect as well as an environmental case on federal rules to manage downwind air pollution.

Many court watchers on the left characterized her ""burgeoning"" legal reasoning as an ""independent streak,"" increasingly ready to ""skewer"" her right-leaning colleagues and a ""principled voice in the middle"" with a strong set of principles that present a ""different world view"" from other conservative justices.

But other legal observers say it is too early to dub Barrett the new deciding vote on hot-button cases who would resist walking lockstep with any ideological bloc.

""I don't think she's really trying to become the 'swing' justice or auditioning for that role. She's calling these cases as she sees them, and she's, generally speaking, a conservative justice,"" said Dupree. ""But what we've seen over the last term is Justice Barrett really coming into her own. She has the confidence to write separately and in some cases to break from the other conservatives when she sees the law a little differently. I suspect that will continue.""

And it remains clear Barrett's conservative credentials in most cases are solid: She has ruled to strike down Roe v. Wade, expand gun rights and scale back affirmative action in higher education.

SCOTUS GIVES PARTIAL VICTORY TO GOP TRYING TO ENFORCE PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE IN ARIZONA

We recently highlighted potential Supreme Court nominees in another Biden or Trump administration, based on what sources in both camps exclusively told Fox News.

Now the dynamic has shifted, with Vice President Harris heading the Democrat ticket.

Campaign sources say the whirlwind of taking over the nomination from her boss in recent weeks has left Harris, her legal advisers and campaign team little time to focus on the what-ifs of choosing justices or broader legal policy.

But it is a topic of particular interest to the former prosecutor, state attorney general and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Administration sources say that since taking office, she has been part of the inner circle cultivating an informal White House list of high court possibles. And Harris was deeply involved in spearheading Jackson's selection and confirmation in 2022, Biden's only Supreme Court nominee.

As a senator, her 2018 questioning at the confirmation hearings for now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh were especially contentious, and she later called for his impeachment after unproven allegations of past sexual misconduct.

Harris herself was under serious consideration for a Supreme Court seat during the Obama years, but sources say her percolating ambitions at the time were directed to elected office.

As for Trump, sources close to him tell Fox News he is expected to soon release his own preemptive list of candidates, as the Republican nominee did in 2016. That evolving list of two dozen or so names became a centerpiece of his successful campaign and later presidency.

This time, the former president will rely on those he has already named to the federal bench for the top names he would choose from to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

The Constitution's framers viewed the judiciary as the ""least dangerous branch,"" but to hear some politicians and pundits on both the left and right, the Supreme Court is prepared to lead the country into imminent ruin.

Such attacks on the justices are nothing new, but the tenor of the criticism, especially in a presidential year, coupled with self-inflicted missteps on ethics and docket discretion, have combined to put its nine members on the defensive.

And the public seems to have noticed.

A Gallup poll this summer found 43% approve of how the Supreme Court handles its job, with 52% disapproval. That is a drop of 15 points since 2020 (58%-38%). In 2000, 62% approved of the institution.

Especially concerning the court are continued leaks to the media of its internal, mostly secretive, operations.

A draft opinion of the 2022 ""Dobbs"" abortion case, published two months before the final ruling that struck down nationwide access to the procedure, sent shock waves in Washington in a massive breach of protocol.

That was followed by selective leaks in the past year over how the court decided hot-button issues like affirmative action and election redistricting.

And in recent weeks, the New York Times received leaked internal memos from the chief justice over his leading role in the Trump immunity opinion.

Court sources say the leakers, who have never been publicly identified, have further eroded institutional camaraderie and trust among the justices, long seen as essential to doing their jobs. It has led to outside partisan finger-pointing.

Roberts, who will gavel in his 20th term next week as chief justice, has not publicly responded to the latest controversies or calls for ethics reform, declining repeated invitations from the Senate to testify.

It reflects his ""less is best"" approach to explaining and promoting his own court's resolution of thorny legal and political issues.

In September 2022, after the abortion ruling was issued, he said, ""Simply because people disagree with opinions is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court. I think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,"" he said.

And he has carefully glided over his role to force internal change and to defend his court's reputation all while being unable to stop the continuing leaks over their deliberations.

""It seems like at times they're [leakers] motivated to be able to potentially lead to mistrust in the [judicial] branch, attacks on what the branch is doing,"" said Jennifer Mascott, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Judge Kavanaugh and now a Catholic University law professor.

Added Dupree, ""You can't have a court deliberate and perform its constitutionally assigned function if it can't be ensured of the sanctity of its deliberations, if it thinks that anything that one justice says to another colleague or any memo that they write internally is going to appear on the front page of the newspapers the next day. That's a very, very worrisome trend. It may be the new normal.""

After a three-month recess, the justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket and discuss appeals that have been filed over the summer.

Sources say the chief justice, who leads the closed-door meeting, had sent a memo to his colleagues indicating some of the controversies surrounding the court, like the leaks and ethics reform, would be privately and candidly discussed.

The Supreme Court in its new term will confront issues like gun rights and transgender care for minors, with pending appeals over the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom, immigration and abortion access.

It is a unique, fast-moving time of change and challenge at an institution used to being slow and deliberate.

""I did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership, you should be careful not to tug on them too much,"" said Roberts in 2016. ""You will find out they aren't connected to anything."""

Now, Israel must secure peace",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-iran-losing-war-now-israel-must-secure-peace,2024-10-07T09:22:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One year ago, Iran took a gamble and started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostages

A year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.

For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won't back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He's that worried.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

You can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first is restoring Israel's security and carrying out the military destruction of Iran's terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.

Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.

Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

Iran couldn't stand it.

Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""

""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.

""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.

The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.

Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.

You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.

Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.

To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.

Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel's multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.

This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.

Officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.

And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.

Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn't ready.

Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.

Israel's systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah's leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.

A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran's power may be required.

Despite Israel's military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran's missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn't, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can't go on forever (although China would like it).

The path ahead depends on restoring Israel's security and taking out Iran's capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It's not easy - the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

And it's important for Americans to stay committed to Israel's security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by the shock unleashing of antisemitism. Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above. We Americans have to do better than this.

Don't forget that in the words of the Justice Department's Indictment of Hamas, the government of Iran's regional and global campaign of terrorism aims to ""weaken and ultimately destroy both the United States and Israel.""

America's best interest remains to support Israel - and take all military steps necessary to get back to the regional diplomacy that will shut down Iran for good."

The country's two most populous states, California and Texas, begin early voting on Monday along with Montana, Georgia, Nebraska, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

Here is everything you need to know about the voter registration and early voting plans for each state.

Georgia has voted Republican in all but two elections in the last four decades. The first was former President Clinton's landslide win in 1992, and the second was 2020, when President Biden brought the state back to the Democrats by 11,779 votes.

A win for either candidate here would make their path to victory easier. The Peach State has 16 electoral votes on offer, and with recent polls showing a tight race, it's ranked Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Democrats do well in metro Atlanta, home to more than half the state's population, and particularly its densest counties, Fulton and DeKalb. There is a higher concentration of Black and college voters there. The surrounding suburban areas also help Democrats run up the vote.

Republicans win big with rural voters, who can be found just about everywhere else. The GOP won all but 30 counties in the last election, with many of the largest victories in the sparse northwest and southeast regions.

Over in the northwest of the country, Montana is a Republican stronghold at the presidential level, but it also hosts one of the most competitive Senate races in the country this cycle. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester faces Republican Tim Sheehy in a race where Trump's popularity and Sheehy's discipline gives the GOP an edge. It's Lean R on the rankings.

Finally, absentee in-person voting begins today in Nebraska, where absentee voting is already underway. The state is home to three competitive races.

Voting also begins today in nine House districts ranked Lean or Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class. The old Democrat Party wanted a strong economy for everybody. This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C. We need decent, honest people back to D.C. and Ruben Gallego was not honest before he got into politics.""

(ABC)

In the wake of Hurricane Helene's destruction in the southeastern U.S., the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it was ""just plain false"" that the agency was short on disaster relief funds because the money was spent on illegal immigrants.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was interviewed by ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week.""

""Let's let's talk about some of the misinformation that is out there, including these claims from former President Trump that FEMA is about $1 billion short because money has been going to undocumented immigrants,"" Stephanopoulos said.

""You know, it's frankly ridiculous and just plain false,"" Criswell said. ""This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people. You know, it's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do. We have had the complete support of the state.""

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'FAILED TO ACT' IN HURRICANE HELENE AFTERMATH: REP CORY MILLS

She continued by saying FEMA has had local officials help push back on the ""dangerous"" narrative that has created fear among those whose lives were devastated by the damage done by Helene in places like western North Carolina and Georgia.

""You know, people need resources, and we need them to get into the system, and it's just a shame that people are sitting home on their comfortable couches while we have thousands of people here on the ground that have left their own families to be able to help those in need,"" Criswell said.

Stephanopoulos then asked Criswell about the misinformation spreading online and going viral, with one social media user suggesting a militia should go against FEMA.

""It has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there. But it's also demoralizing to all of the first responders that have been out there in their communities helping people, FEMA staff, volunteers, the private sector that are working side by side with local officials to go out and help people,"" she said. ""I need to make sure I can get the resources to where they are needed. And when you have this dangerous rhetoric like you're hearing, it creates fear in our own employees. We need to make sure we're getting help to the people who need it.""

LAWMAKERS OUTRAGED OVER FEMA FUNDING CONCERNS

Fox News Digital reached out to FEMA to get clarification on what misinformation was being spread, and a spokesperson said disaster relief funds and immigration come from ""two different pots of money.""

The spokesperson explained that the disaster money for the Disaster Relief Fund comes from Congress, adding that no money has been used for anything else other than disaster relief operations.

Criswell, the spokesperson said, was talking about misinformation and how much that misinformation hurts the operation. Those who need assistance, the spokesperson explained, believe the rumors.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

FEMA said the agency is not short on money for disaster relief despite what has been said.

Along with funding, the Biden administration is also pouring resources into hard-hit areas.

On Sunday, President Biden ordered 500 additional active-duty troops to support on-the-ground efforts. There are now 1,500 troops mobilized to assist National Guard and federal personnel.

The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that FEMA had the funds needed for ""immediate response and recovery"" despite Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warning about the potential lack of money.

HURRICANE HELENE SURVIVOR SAYS WATER ROSE 4 FEET WITHIN MINUTES

""FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,"" spokesperson Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. ""As [Administrator Deanne Criswell] said, she has the full authority to spend against the President's budget, but we're not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it.""

The agency had recently lifted immediate needs funding, which allows the agency to focus on urgent efforts and pause nonurgent projects, but Rothenberg said the agency may still need to go back to that ""and we will be watching it closely.""

Mayorkas grabbed headlines on Wednesday when he said FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which lasts until November.

Congress recently made $20 billion in immediate funding available for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund as part of a bipartisan deal to avoid a government shutdown at the end of last month. But Congress is currently out until mid-November, after Election Day (Nov. 5).

Mayorkas' remarks about a potential lack of funding sparked criticism from Republicans and conservatives, who pointed to funding used by FEMA for grants to house and care for illegal immigrants who crossed the southern border.

Critics referenced the Shelter and Services Program, which spent $650 million in fiscal 2023 on grants to nonprofits and local organizations to assist migrants. But the Biden administration pushed back, noting that the funding is appropriated by Congress and completely separate from disaster relief funding.

The administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) argued Sunday that criticizing the agency's response to Hurricane Helene is ""dangerous.""

In an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" Deanne Criswell addressed public outcry over the federal government's response to Hurricane Helene, warning that the ""false"" narratives spread online about the agency's handling of the hurricane could hinder FEMA's recovery efforts.

""It has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there, but it's also demoralizing to all of the first responders... FEMA staff, volunteers,"" she told host George Stephanopoulos. ""I need to make sure I can get the resources to where they are needed, and when you have this dangerous rhetoric like you're hearing, it creates fear in our own employees.""

JOHNSON SLAMS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S 'ABJECT FAILURE' ASSISTING HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS

Her comments faced immediate backlash online, with critics slamming the top disaster relief official for playing the victim card in a crisis of this magnitude.

""In this time of crisis, the important thing to remember is protecting the feelings of FEMA workers,"" Grabien founder Tom Elliott wrote alongside a clip of Crisewell's ABC appearance.

""The comfort level of hurricane victims matters way more to me right now than the comfort level of FEMA employees,"" writer Kristen Weg commented.

""FEMA chief Deanne Criswell says criticizing her agency is 'dangerous.' The audacity,"" conservative journalist Ian Miles Cheong posted.

""In these times where people lost everything and roads are impassable with towns wiped off the map, remember the real victims: FEMA workers,"" NewsBusters Managing Editor Curtis Houk wrote.

""Amazing. Criticism elicits ""fear."" What a game bureaucrats play. Same with the FBI, IRS, HHS, DHS, etc. ""Don't criticize us. It's scary. We feel threatened,"" podcaster Chris Stigall weighed in.

The Biden administration has come under fire for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. As of last Friday, the death toll in southeastern states hit the hardest by the storm has risen past 224, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

Former President Trump accused the agency of obstructing relief efforts in Republican areas in a post on Truth Social last week after reports circulated about delayed assistance in some communities.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

Republican elected officials, Elon Musk and volunteers have also spoken out against the government's response to the hurricane, as crews continue searching for missing people and bodies across the affected region.

Musk accused FEMA of blocking shipments of Starlink satellite internet deliveries in hurricane-ravaged North Carolina, writing on X, ""FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble, but is actively blocking citizens who try to help!"" FEMA categorically denied the claims in a response to FOX Business.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson slammed the agency's relief efforts, calling the federal government's response an ""abject failure.""

Criswell flatly rejected the assertions from Trump and his allies as ""ridiculous and just plain false.""

""This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people. You know, it's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do,"" she told Stephanopoulos.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday that FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which lasts until November. The department issued a clarification, insisting that FEMA has the funds needed for ""immediate response and recovery"" in the wake of Helene.

MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell said on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling to resonate with White and Black male voters.

""She's got such a big problem with men,"" Mitchell said, adding that support for Trump among that demographic could be underestimated.

She proceeded to blame misogny as one of the reasons Harris wasn't being taken as seriously among both Republican and Democratic men.

Harris has taken heat for largely avoiding the press. Since becoming the Democratic nominee 72 days ago, she has yet to hold a single official press conference.

""The streams of funding are different, that is not an untrue statement, of course,"" Johnson, R-La., told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""But the problem is with the American people, see, and what they're frustrated by, is that FEMA should be involved.

That's what the Biden administration, Kamala Harris and Secretary Mayorkas have been engaged in.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre last week denied that FEMA resources were going to migrants, but cited FEMA funds for migrants in 2022.

""Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?"" a reporter asked during a Friday press conference.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

""I mean, it's just categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement,"" Jean-Pierre responded.

Critics have since compared her statement to comments made in 2022, where she cited FEMA resources were available to illegal immigrants.

""FEMA Regional Administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate - to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other federal agencies,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at a Sept. 16, 2022, press conference.

""Funding is also available through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter program to eligible local governments and not-for-profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants,"" she added.

FEMA has a pool of funds explicitly used for natural disasters, while Congress called on FEMA in 2022 to disseminate funds from Customs and Border Protection to assist American communities affected by the immigration crisis.

FEMA's website currently has a ""Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response"" page to address false claims surrounding recovery efforts, including a rebuke of the claim that FEMA diverted disaster response funds to ""border related issues.""

""This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA posted in response to the claim.

Hurricane Helene has left more than 220 people dead after flooding devastated towns and cities across Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee.

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas drew national attention last week when he indicated that FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which typically wraps up in November.

""When you see illegals in your local airport and you see them being transported around the country with planes, trains and automobiles to every community, everywhere, every state's a border state now, because of that.

Conservatives blasted Pennsylvania's Department of State this month for scheduling a system maintenance update to its voter registration website the same day former President Trump returned to Butler, where he survived an assassination attempt in July.

The operation would have taken the site offline for several hours during the same time frame the Trump campaign expected to register voters. The department, however, moved the window of time for maintenance to later in the night amid an early outcry.

""The PA State Department voter registration website will be unavailable on Saturday, October 5th, the day that President Trump will be triumphantly returning to the site of the assassination attempt in Butler County, PA. W/ all eyes on PA, the site will be down. Coincidence?"" GOP activist Scott Pressler posted to Instagram on Thursday.

Fox News Digital reviewed archived data from the Pennsylvania Voter Registration website and found that it issued a disclaimer to voters that the website would be unavailable on Oct. 5 beginning at 6 p.m.

""This website will undergo scheduled system maintenance and be unavailable Saturday, October 5 from 6 p.m. until 12 a.m. We thank you for your understanding.,"" the Pennsylvania Voter Registration website stated on Oct. 1, an archived page reviewed by Fox News Digital shows.

Trump announced on Sept. 25 that he would make a historic return to Butler on Oct. 5, months after he was shot in the side of the head by a would-be assassin on July 13. The Pennsylvania Voter Registration website announced its scheduled maintenance sometime between Sept. 30 to Oct. 1, archived data for the site reviewed by Fox Digital shows.

Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump and Pressler sounded the alarm on the scheduled maintenance earlier this month, questioning the timing and slamming the move as election ""interference.""

""Wow, they aren't even trying to hide their blatant interference - appreciate you flagging, @scottpresler - @gop legal is on it and formally requesting the 'system maintenance' is moved to a different time,"" Lara Trump posted to Facebook on Thursday, accompanied by a screenshot of an Instagram post from Pressler asking if the timing of the maintenance was just a ""coincidence.""

TRUMP'S RETURN TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, IS 'GUTSY,' SUPPORTERS SAY

Archived records of the website show that Pennsylvania officials updated the page on Oct. 3 - the same day Pressler and Lara Trump publicly posted about the timing of the maintenance - to reflect that the site would undergo maintenance at 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., instead of 6 p.m. until midnight.

Trump was scheduled to take the stage in Butler at 5 p.m. Saturday, meaning the site would have gone dark as he rallied his base and encouraged residents to register to vote.

Pressler joined Human Events' Jack Posobiec about the matter last week, taking a victory lap that the time was changed to later in the night, following the rally, but added he's still not ""100 percent happy"" with the timing of the schedule maintenance. Pressler noted that website updates are typically scheduled for the dead of night, when users are less likely to use the platform.

""It was clear that the Pennsylvania Department of State was engaging in election interference, trying to stop all of this national attention from translating into new voter registrations,"" Pressler said.

ARDENT TRUMP SUPPORTERS WEIGH IN ON SAFETY AT HISTORIC PENNSYLVANIA RALLY

Lara Trump also celebrated how the scheduled maintenance moved to later in the night, sharing on Facebook Thursday, ""And just like that, we got PA to move it. Great example of what happens when citizens demand fairness.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Pennsylvania Department of State on Sunday for comment on the matter, but did not immediately receive a reply.

The website is working as of Sunday morning, and no longer includes the disclaimer for a scheduled maintenance outage. Fox News Digital did not document the site shutting down for maintenance from Saturday evening into Sunday morning, though screenshots of the site posted to social media show the site's reported error page for maintenance.

A review of the Department of State's social media shows the website has previously shut down for scheduled maintenance at odd hours during the day, including on June 29 from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. the following day.

The historic rally in Butler drew thousands as Trump made a return to the same grounds where he was nearly killed, as well as short remarks from tech billionaire Elon Musk who stressed the importance of registering to vote.

""I think it's the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms... They want to take away your right to vote effectively,"" Musk told the crowd on Saturday.

Musk repeatedly encouraged the crowds to get everyone in their social circles and beyond to register and vote come Election Day.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

With the election just over four weeks away, polling shows Michigan could be decided by a razor-thin margin once again. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average as of Sunday, Harris currently holds a narrow 0.7 point edge in the state.

At the top of mind for voters in Michigan at both Trump and Harris rallies last week was immigration, with both sides agreeing that work needed to be done to secure the southern border. But while Trump supporters mostly pin the blame on the Biden administration, Harris supporters in Flint argued that it was Trump's effort to kill President Biden's bipartisan border legislation that was to blame for the current situation.

""She has worked on a bill that she said that if she's elected she's going to sign into law that directly puts more people on the front line that would actually be helping with the border, while Trump shot that down,"" a voter told Fox News Digital.

Meanwhile, some voters argued that all Trump brings to the table on the issue is ""rhetoric"" that divides people, while Harris has the experience to solve the problem.

""He knew my position since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don't want government in my personal business,"" she said in an exclusive ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview.

""I think it's very important and, as I said in the book, and it's very well explained in the chapter, 'What does my body, my choice mean?' because timing really matters and also the restrictions, so I encourage people to read it because we live in a world that everybody should have individual freedom,"" she continued.

Trump is promoting her upcoming ""Melania"" memoir, which disclosed a shocking truth to many of her husband's supporters regarding her stance on the controversial issue, calling abortion a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report from last Wednesday.

She reportedly wrote, ""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

MELANIA TRUMP'S PRO-CHOICE STAND ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

The revelation ignited a flurry of responses across the political spectrum, with pro-lifers slamming her for the view they argue fails to align with the Catholic faith, to which she subscribes.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group, called the view ""anti-feminist"" and the ""opposite of empowerment.""

Others, including Lila Rose and president of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, criticized the stance as well.

On the left, ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar accused Trump of lying about being pro-choice, calling her stance a ""big scam.""

Others have posed the question: why make the revelation just before the election?

""That was not written in the last week or the last month,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

""That book was written months before, and it was in print months before, so that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic.

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., on Sunday said that he will continue to ""support and follow"" Israel after seeing how the Jewish State has been able to humiliate Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.

Fetterman made the remarks on ""Fox News Sunday,"" telling anchor Shannon Bream that Israel knows best about how to take on Iran and the regime's proxies.

""Whatever they decide to do in response to Iran, I'm going to support that because Israel will have a better idea of the intelligence and the circumstances on the ground,"" Fetterman said. ""And that's why I'm going to support and follow that.""

The Democrat praised Israel for their effective responses against Hezbollah and Hamas that he said left the Iranian proxies ""cowering.""

""I also want to celebrate what Israel has been able to do,"" Fetterman said. ""They've demolished Hamas and now they have humiliated Hezbollah and they are now cowering. And Iran shot, you know, 200 missiles and [Israel] vaporized those. So, Iran now is left exposed and humiliated, and Israel has put them back on the ropes. And I am going to support what they continue to do.""

Iran bombarded Israel with 181 missiles last week in what the regime said was retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike in September and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.

Meanwhile, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have traded attacks with Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

Fetterman's comments come days after President Biden told reporters that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's missile attack against Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Biden said all the G7 leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

Over the last two months, I have spent more time in Pennsylvania than any other state for the obvious reason that the outcome there will very likely determine whether our next president will be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.

One increasingly clear phenomenon I have slowly seen, and it's backed up by some polling, is that Gen Z voters who are between the ages of 18 and 27 are far more open to supporting Trump than their Millennial elders, who are mainly in their 30s.

GROWING NUMBER OF GEN Z MEN SUPPORTING TRUMP REPRESENTS 'ONGOING CULTURE SHOCK' IN US POLITICS, VOTER SAYS

A recent poll from Harvard has Harris leading Trump 61 percent to 30 percent among Millennials, but an NBC News poll shows that with voters 18-29, that lead shrinks to 16 points at 50 to 34.

It tracks with what I have been seeing on the ground.

At a Trump rally in Harrisburg back in August, I met young, blue-collar Gen Zers who believed Trump would provide more opportunity, a JD Vance event in Hershey was overflowing with twenty somethings, and Saturday in Butler, I met dozens of first-time voters planning to pull the red lever.

It came into clear focus later on Saturday night at Jack Jolly's Holiday Bar in downtown Butler, a town which, unlike many of the hollowed out Ohio cities I've seen that are more rust than belt, is actually quite charming and seems to be thriving.

Jack Jolly's is one of those cocktail lounges where they infuse everything or put smoke in the glass, and the first people I met there were a trio in their late 30s; one married couple and their guy friend.

All were childhood buds from Butler who had moved away after college and recently returned to purchase homes in this lovely hillside hamlet. They were no fans of Trump, and they also weren't overly interested in politics.

GEN Z VOTER FLIPS FROM SANDERS TO TRUMP: HARD TO VOTE FOR THE PARTY PUTTING 'TAMPONS IN BOYS' BATHROOMS'

At one point, I asked them if the emerging well-to-do segment of the population and the longer-standing middle and lower classes mingled well. They looked at me quizzically and I said, ""I mean, your kids must go to school together, right?""

""Oh, we don't have kids,"" the single guy told me, though the woman is a teacher.

And they are a type of voter I have seen elsewhere, in San Francisco and Chicago -- good jobs, few responsibilities, and not terribly ill at ease with the state of their lives, the country, or the world.

About the time they took off, another trio took their place, this time, three dudes, younger, mid to late twenties. Two were Trump fans, and the other, a history teacher, supports Harris, but also said, ""I don't think Trump is a threat to democracy.""

What followed was a robust conversation about politics, America, and life. They were well-informed, avid social media users, and importantly, they all seemed to have a grasp on the best arguments of the other side.

Whatever is driving these young voters into the arms of the GOP, it will have profound implications not just on this election, but going forward for decades.

Earlier in the day, I had spoken to Johnny and Rocky at the Trump rally, who were also either Gen Z or close. They are buddies, but I was surprised when Johnny said, ""Rocky and I watched the VP debate together.""

When I was 27, we did a lot of things, but get together to watch a vice presidential debate was not among them. Then again, in the 1990s, we thought a bright future was inevitable. Unlike Gen X, Gen Z is very well aware that it isn't.

Part of the reason that I was slow to pick up on the reddening of Gen Z, especially, but not only, Gen Z men, is that I couldn't really explain it, and I still struggle to.

And unlike Millennials, who seem quietly resigned to a country and society that isn't going to get any better, there seems to be flickering hope among our youngest voters, as if they dare to dream.

Users on social media took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris after the Democratic nominee took to X to pledge millions of dollars in aid for Lebanon at the same time residents of North Carolina struggle to recover from Hurricane Helene.

""This has to be fake. Even Kamala Harris, the gold standard of stupid, isn't stupid enough to post this,"" actor James Woods said on X Saturday. ""Certainly not while North Carolinians are pulling the bodies of their neighbors from the wreckage. It's simply inconceivable.""

The post came in response to Harris pledging Saturday to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon, which, she argued, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

Users on social media were quick to slam Harris for the post, arguing that many North Carolina residents are struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene and that the money would be better spent on those relief efforts.

""Could this be any more tone deaf? We have Americans suffering and in danger right now after the hurricane and this is what Kamala has to announce. America First!"" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., said on X.

The PAC was officially formed earlier in the summer, with Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings from late last month showing the America PAC has already invested at least $2.4 million in more than a dozen key congressional races.

Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

Democratic strategist James Carville said Saturday that the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump was a ""long way from decided.""

Carville joined CNN's Michael Smerconish, who pressed the Democratic strategist on why Harris wasn't ahead if the economy was doing well, referencing Carville's famed phrase, ""it's the economy, stupid.""

""You know, she's slightly ahead, and it's not the election. These things tend to break one way or the other at the end. There are seven swing states. The least likely result is they break 4-3.

Former Trump campaign adviser David Urban also joined Carville and Smerconish and said that the race is going to be tight, specifically in Pennsylvania.

He cited the state's electorate and said that he's heard from a lot of voters who think Harris hasn't made her pitch in Pennsylvania yet.

""If she does lose, I think it's because she's kept in bubble wrap on a shelf someplace. They're playing defense, not offense. They're playing like they're 14 points up, not like they're neck-and-neck. And so I think it's going to be close just because the nature of the electorate,"" Urban said.

Carville agreed and said voters still don't know enough about the vice president.

""They know who she is and who Donald Trump is. They know what Donald Trump is. They still want to find out what Harris is,"" he said, before taking aim at criticisms of Harris' lack of media appearances.

Jim Gaffigan, who played Walz, and Bowen Yang, who played Vance, were shown having an intense moment of agreement, taking aim at the portions of the actual debate where both candidates said they agreed with one another.

Samberg told Rudolph not to worry because it wasn't like Gaffigan would say something ""crazy.""

Rudolph subsequently broke her wine glass in her hand as Samberg acknowledged a ""flub"" by her running mate.

A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that former President Trump is winning the Catholic and Protestant vote.

Conducted from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, the survey found that 52% of Catholics and 61% of Protestants support Trump for president, while 47% of Catholics and 37% of Protestants back Kamala Harris.

As more Americans become aware of how radical Harris is, it's clear to see why Trump has won this support from religious voters.

Harris may have been the surprise replacement for Joe Biden, but her position on issues is far from unknown. She claims to be a future-oriented, change candidate eager to ""turn the page and chart a new way forward.""

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

However, Harris is a professional politician with a radical policy record that she can't defend among the religious electorate.

Consider that in 2014, in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Attorney General Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court and was joined by 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Harris called on the court to force Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception for its employees. (The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, protecting the family-owned arts and crafts chain to operate its business in line with its religious beliefs and values.)

Also, as attorney general of California, Harris was a vocal advocate and ""proud"" co-sponsor of the Reproductive FACT Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2015. The law required medically licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to display signs advertising low-cost or free abortions available in California.

The law ""was very clear that it was targeting pro-life viewpoints,"" said Denise Harle, who served as senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. In a 2018 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with this view and struck down the law.

Writing for the majority in National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (initially named NIFLA vs. Kamala Harris), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion, ""the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.""

As a U.S. senator of California from 2017-2021, Harris introduced and was the lead sponsor of the Do No Harm Act, which would have ended religious exemptions for certain government mandates, such as rules requiring insurance coverage of specific medical procedures. As a legal expert at First Liberty wrote at the time, ""This country was founded on religious liberty. The Do No Harm Act strikes at the heart of that freedom.""

Additionally, the Do No Harm Act would have undermined the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 landmark law that protects the rights of people of faith to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience.

Further, Sen. Harris was also an original co-sponsor of the ""Equality Act,"" a bill that would have further unraveled the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and enabled the government to prosecute faith-based institutions for refusing to hire employees who openly oppose their religious teachings. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was clear in denouncing the proposed legislation and said the Equality Act would ""run roughshod over religious liberty.""

Additionally, Sen. Harris questioned three judicial nominees on their affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, suggesting that involvement with the Catholic fraternal organization disqualifies a nominee for potential bias.

When I served as President Trump's ambassador to the Holy See, I witnessed the importance of having a president who stands up for religious freedom. President Trump has a proven track record for promoting and protecting religious freedom at home and abroad. Kamala Harris has repeatedly advanced an anti-faith agenda."

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is facing heavy criticism after sending mixed messages on whether the Biden-Harris administration has been using FEMA resources to support migrants last week.

Jean-Pierre flatly denied that FEMA resources were going to migrants in a press conference last week, but she stated the opposite when asked about the issue in the fall of 2022.

""Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?"" a reporter asked during a Friday press conference.

""I mean, it's just categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement,"" Jean-Pierre responded, going on to cite a Washington Post fact-check article on the subject.

Social media critics then compared her statement to comments made in 2022, where she appeared to explicitly state that FEMA resources were available to illegal immigrants.

She made the statement during a Sept. 16, 2022, press conference when Jean-Pierre was asked about assisting cities in handling the busloads of migrants being sent across the country from Texas.

""FEMA Regional Administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate -- to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other federal agencies,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at the time.

Scrutiny on the Biden-Harris administration's use of FEMA funds comes amid catastrophic flooding in North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris announced a $100 million package to support the state.

Critics pointed out, however, that the package was much smaller than the $157 million in foreign humanitarian support Harris had announced for Lebanon the same day.

A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in next month's election because of both candidates' support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Harris has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself and would not withhold weapons from the country, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Trump said recently he is Israel's ""protector"" and reaffirmed his support for the Jewish state.

In battleground Georgia, where Trump narrowly lost in 2020 to President Joe Biden, the Peach State could help determine whether Harris or Trump wins the presidency.

The Muslim population in Georgia could also impact which candidate wins the state's 16 electoral votes. Muslim voters across the country are virtually tied between Harris and Trump, with Harris only securing a single-point advantage, according to a recent poll by the Arab American Institute.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

Kristen Truitt, a Muslim American voter in Atlanta, has voted for Democrats in prior elections but now says the party will not have his support over its position on Israel.

""Just to give unlimited funds and access to Israel, I think that is totally ridiculous,"" Truitt told Fox 5 Atlanta.

This comes just ahead of the one-year mark of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and took more than 250 hostages, which prompted retaliatory action from Israel's military.

The Hamas-run government's Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 41,000 people have been killed in the conflict, although it does not distinguish between civilian and terrorist deaths. More than 1,500 people have reportedly been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, with most of them being killed on Oct. 7 and its immediate aftermath.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

The growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia and across the country have said they will not vote for Harris or Trump due to both sides' vocal support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the conflict is now expanding to include Israel attacking Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon.

""What we're trying to say is we should really do away with the logic of voting for the 'lesser of two evils,'"" Kareem Rosshandler, Georgia co-chair of the ""Abandon Harris"" campaign, told Fox 5.

The ""Abandon Harris"" campaign group is urging Muslims to vote third-party to send a message to Republicans and Democrats that they need to earn the votes of the Muslim community.

""I think the main one is to say that the Muslim community in the United States won't be taken for granted,"" Rosshandler said.

Rosshandler said the group has already secured commitments from more than 10,000 Muslim voters to support third-party candidates. Some third-party candidates, including Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party's Jill Stein, have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza.

The loss of Muslim voters is expected to hurt Harris more than Trump, as the Republican candidate has previously struggled to secure Muslim votes.

""That would essentially have a greater adverse impact on the Harris-Waltz ticket than it would on Trump-Vance,"" Emory University assistant professor of law Alicia Hughes, who is also a voting expert, told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""Trump, historically, has not been able to count on those votes.""

Hughes also says that if Harris or Trump were more vocally critical of Israel, it may not help their election chances either.

A 100-foot wide ""Vote for Trump"" sign in upstate New York is stirring controversy after the City of Amsterdam claimed it's a big, glowing code violation.

Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino told Fox News Digital he installed the sign on top of the old Fownes glove factory to symbolize the return of American manufacturing and what he calls ""the triumph of the underdog against insurmountable adversity.""

""I think that's what President Trump did. He triumphed against massive adversity. He's still doing that with bullets flying by his head,"" Constantino said. ""And we triumph too. Nobody thought we could build a massive sticker company or a massive tech company in upstate New York.""

But his company now faces adversity in the form of legal action by the City of Amsterdam to prevent the ""displaying"" and ""illumination"" of the pro-Trump sign, which is visible from the New York State Thruway.

TRUMP'S RETURN TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, IS 'GUTSY,' SUPPORTERS SAY

According to court documents, the sign violates city code because it ""presents a dangerous distraction and impacts traffic flow,"" especially at night when it is illuminated. Local officials allege Sticker Mule was informed it would need a permit and several variances to install the sign in August, but the company never responded before the sign went up Oct. 1.

Constantino and his legal team contest the city's claims. The CEO believes Amsterdam's Democratic Party-endorsed independent mayor is anti-Trump and has vowed to fight a temporary injunction that requires the sign to be covered up. Amsterdam Mayor Michael Cinquanti did not respond to requests for comment.

Dressed in a black T-shirt that said ""Trump For Peace,"" Constantino describes Sticker Mule as ""the internet's fastest growing printing company"" with 1,200 employees in 39 countries. His online business began by making stickers but has since expanded to print T-shirts, buttons and magnets and even operates its own online store platform, Sticker Mule Stores. He is proud to report that Sticker Mule has created nearly 1,000 manufacturing jobs in the U.S. over the past few years.

""I like to move fast and do interesting things,"" Constantino told Fox News Digital. Success in business gave him the means to reinvest in his hometown of Amsterdam, and the Fownes factory was one of several buildings he bought and restored, filling them with machines and workers.

""Fownes was a glove manufacturer that left my hometown when I was 2 years old in 1984,"" he said, explaining that Amsterdam was ""decimated"" by job loss when the factory, with its iconic ""Fownes"" sign, closed its doors.

""This Fownes sign for years symbolized American manufacturing going to China,"" Constantino said. Now, the $150,000 ""Vote for Trump"" sign sits in its place, heralding a new era of American manufacturing jobs.

The impossible-to-miss sign attracted ""major interest,"" according to Constantino. To celebrate its installation, his political action committee, StickerPAC, plans to host a ""Trump Sign Lighting Party"" Oct. 7 at 6 p.m. A news release about the event says UFC superstars Henry Cejudo, Kelvin Gastelum and Tracy Cortez will join Constantino to speak and support the ""historic event.""

According to a representative for Constantino, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is also expected to speak at the event. Stefanik's office did not respond to a request for comment.

""The enthusiasm just went through the roof. We've got three UFC superstars that wanted to come see it. We've got people that want to come from all over the state of New York, people that want to fly in or drive in from all over the country, really, to see the sign get lit up,"" Constantino said.

'TIGHTEST RACE SINCE 2000': HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN HITS FINAL STRETCH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

But the festivities may be cut short by legal action from Amsterdam. On Oct. 3, the city code enforcer sent a notice of violation to Sticker Mule that gave the company two days to remove the ""Vote for Trump"" sign. The city also requested an injunction from the Supreme Court of the State of New York to prevent the sign from being displayed.

""The affidavit claims, without evidence, that the city will suffer irreparable harm because the sign is a dangerous distraction for drivers due to its novelty and the fear that people will stop to take pictures of it,"" said Sal Ferlazzo, general counsel for Sticker Mule. ""The court, based solely on the city's presentation and without any opportunity for me to respond, did initially grant a preliminary injunction and restraining order.""

A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 8 at 10 a.m. Until that time, the court ordered Sticker Mule to refrain from ""displaying any sign and/or illumination of any sign on the roof of 26 Elk Street.""

On the advice of legal counsel, Sticker Mule has temporarily covered up the pro-Trump sign to comply with the court order.

TRUMP-VANCE TICKET HAS DONE COMBINED 63 INTERVIEWS SINCE AUGUST COMPARED TO 24 FOR HARRIS-WALZ

""I think it's deeply disturbing,"" Constantino said of the city's action. ""I brought nearly a thousand jobs to my hometown, which was decimated when the Fownes company and other companies left. And I'm trying to do something positive, exciting for the community.""

He suggested Mayor Cinquanti has ""TDS"" -- Trump derangement syndrome -- and is fighting the sign for political reasons.

""They do know that they are in violation,"" Cinquanti told The Daily Gazette. ""They've been cited, and we'll just let that play out as we would with any code violation.""

The mayor, who according to the newspaper has previously called Trump his least favorite president in American history, insisted the city's objections to the sign are about safety, not politics.

""I don't care what the sign says, but distracting the attention of drivers on the freeway is something that needs to be looked at, and that's what we're doing,"" he told the outlet.

""Any sign that represents a hazard to the safety of drivers concerns me,"" he added. ""Anyone who violates city codes is an issue that we deal with, and we are in the process of dealing with it and trying to alleviate what I consider a hazard.""

Regardless of the city's objections, Constantino said Monday's event will continue as planned, ""featuring UFC Superstars, Free Fish Filets, Cybertrucks and a beautiful Trump sign.""

""The sign is a beautiful sign whether you're a Democrat or Republican. The sign is a big win for upstate New York, a big win for Amsterdam, New York. It's a beautiful and uplifting sign. And I think it's going to become a major tourist attraction, especially if Trump wins,"" Constantino said.

""It's going to be a unifying event. I'm inviting Democrats and Republicans alike to come watch me unveil the sign. We don't want all the division going on in this country anymore."""
188,Absentee voting kicks off in Maine,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/absentee-voting-kicks-off-maine,2024-10-06T09:15:23Z,"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier explains how disaster declarations in counties are causing closures of election offices on 'Special Report.'

Absentee voting in Maine is getting underway, with the state's four Electoral College votes up for grabs and a number of other national, statewide and local races on the ballot.

Maine is one of two states in the U.S. -- the other is Nebraska -- that does not use a winner-take-all system for all its electors. In the presidential race, two electors are given to the winner of the statewide popular vote, while one elector is awarded to Maine's District 1 and District 2, respectively.

Maine is one of several Democratic-leaning northeastern states. President Biden won here by about nine points in 2020, improving on Hillary Clinton's margin four years earlier. And it hasn't voted for a Republican at the statewide level since 1988. It is ranked Likely D on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Like Nebraska, it also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district. The winner of the statewide tally receives two votes, with another vote for the winner of the presidential tally in each of its two districts.

The small coastal 1st District is solid blue territory. The 2nd District, which is predominantly rural and represents almost all the land area of the state, leans conservative.

Trump won the 2nd District by 7.4 points in his last race, and it's ranked Likely R this cycle. The former president will look for a win here to get one step closer to the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the presidency.

The same district is also home to a competitive House race.

Maine's 2nd District: Incumbent Rep. Jared Golden is one of five Democrats running in districts Trump won in the last presidential election (Golden won by 6 points). The former Marine made headlines this year when he said he ""didn't know"" whether he would vote for Biden again and was one of the first Democrats to question Biden's mental fitness. This time, he's up against Maine State Representative and former NASCAR driver Austin Theriault, who says he wants ""more balance and less extremism"" in politics. This race is a Power Rankings toss-up.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Saturday that social media companies must moderate content on their platforms or else ""we lose total control.""

Clinton told CNN host Michael Smerconish that while there have been some steps taken at the state level to regulate social media, she wants to see more done by the federal government to moderate content.

""We can look at the state of California, the state of New York, I think some other states have also taken action,"" Clinton said.

""But we need national action, and sadly, our Congress has been dysfunctional when it comes to addressing these threats to our children,"" she added.

HILLARY CLINTON DEFENDS 'DEPLORABLES' COMMENT: 'TOO KIND A WORD' FOR SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS

Clinton said she believes the issue should be ""at the top of every legislative political agenda"" and called for the repealing of Section 230 of the Communications Act, which protects online platforms from being held liable for third-party content, such as user content on social media. This immunity applies to the content itself and the removal of content in certain circumstances.

""We should be, in my view, repealing something called Section 230, which gave, you know, platforms on the internet immunity because they were thought to be just pass-throughs, that they shouldn't be judged for the content that is posted,"" Clinton said.

""But we now know that that was an overly simple view, that if the platforms, whether it's Facebook or Twitter/X or Instagram or TikTok, whatever they are, if they don't moderate and monitor the content, we lose total control,"" she continued. ""And it's not just the social and psychological affects, it's real life.""

Clinton said the social media companies should have their immunity stripped so ""guardrails"" could be implemented.

She said that cellphones should be restricted in schools, an effort that has been approved by several states in the U.S., including Florida and California. Individual school districts in various states across the country have also adopted policies banning or limiting cellphone use during school hours.

""Take phones out of schools,"" she said. ""I'm so happy to see schools beginning to do that, where the kids turn their phone in when they walk in the door.""

""And guess what? Kids are paying better attention in class,"" Clinton added. ""They are talking to each other in the lunchroom, things that used to be part of your daily life when you were a child in school.""

Last month, Clinton suggested during an appearance on MSNBC that Americans accused of interfering in U.S. elections by spreading ""propaganda"" promoting former President Trump should be civilly or even criminally charged, as she cited the 2016 election in which she lost to Trump."
190,Here's what two undecided Wisconsin voters are holding out for in the 2024 election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heres-what-2-undecided-wisconsin-voters-holding-out-2024-election,2024-10-06T08:21:55Z,"WISCONSIN -- With only one month until the presidential election, very few voters are still uncertain about their choice, but in a battleground state like Wisconsin that has flipped in the past two elections, those undecided voters could make the difference.

Estimates of still-undecided voters in Wisconsin are in the low single digits, with the latest Marquette Law School poll reporting that just 4% identified themselves as such.

Fox News Digital spoke with two such voters, who laid out why they are still holding out and what they need to seal the deal.

TRUMP ATTORNEYS ARGUE JACK SMITH'S OBSTRUCTION CHARGES BE DISMISSED, CITING SUPREME COURT'S 'FISCHER' DECISION

""I got to make up my mind when I fill out the paper,"" said 86-year-old Edgar Schiekiera of Waukesha, Wisconsin.

""I'm going to throw a dart,"" he laughed.

Schiekiera is an immigrant from Germany who noted that he grew up during the Second World War. For him, former President Trump's comments on foreign policy have been troubling, enough so to make him hesitate to support Trump for a third time.

""I voted for Trump the first year. I voted for him the second year. I don't -- this time, I don't know,"" he said.

""I'm from Germany, and things that he's said about [the] NATO Alliance -- he wants quit it, and he doesn't know what to do,"" he said of what's making him unsure of Trump. ""A real danger lives overseas.""

Schiekiera was also concerned about what Trump has said with relation to conflicts around the world, particularly involving Ukraine and Iran. ""He can stop the war?"" he asked, in reference to Trump's own claims about the war between Ukraine and Russia. ""He cannot stop the war.""

However, he added that ""Biden or Kamala Harris -- she doesn't know what's going to happen,"" either. According to him, he isn't confident that either of the top candidates can effectively lead on the world stage in the current geopolitical climate.

There are other issues that Schiekiera is taking into consideration as well, such as abortion. ""I got my own ideas,"" he said.

He noted that Trump has appeared to change positions on ""issues nationally [and] worldwide.""

""Trump's gone one way, and then he [goes] to another way. He's undecided what he's going to do, really.""

In contrast, Keon Pierce of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, isn't considering Trump at all. But he is not sold on Vice President Kamala Harris either.

""I'm leaning Kamala, but I have to see. She's got to convince me a little more,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I'm waiting to see who has the best -- the best protection for different groups of people. You know, the best rights and best laws that can help all groups of people.""

Pierce explained that he wanted to be sure the president would ""help all people. Asian people, Indian people, Black people, everybody.""

When Fox News Digital noted that Harris is both Black and Indian, he responded, ""We had a Black president before, and it didn't necessarily translate to helping the people,"" in reference to former President Barack Obama.

TRUMP CAN WIN ON THESE THREE KEY ISSUES, MICHIGAN VOTERS TELL FOX

He said he was ""open to"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who will appear on the Wisconsin ballot after a court challenge to see her ousted was denied.

""It's possible that I wouldn't vote as well,"" he added.

As for the Milwaukee area, Pierce explained, ""It's bad here. It's really segregated here, and opportunities are limited.""

He said he needs to hear more about what will be done to bring more ""opportunities, jobs, education, [and] a better school system in the inner city.""

191,Kurdish official warns US: 'now is not the time' to pull forces out of Iraq',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kurdish-special-representative-talks-about-us-plan-withdraw-from-iraq,2024-10-06T08:21:49Z,"National security analyst Rebecca Grant joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the attack on the U.S. airbase in Iraq and why she believes Biden is nearing war with Iran as tensions escalate.

As the U.S. mulls over a plan to withdraw troops from Iraq, its Kurdish allies have a message: Don't forget us.

""This is not the time to reduce coalition forces in Iraq,"" Treefa Aziz, the Kurdistan Regional Government's special representative to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.

""Extremist groups like ISIS and armed militias continue to pose a serious threat to the people of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region.""

The U.S. announced plans to shrink the U.S. ""footprint"" in Iraq and end the current mission of coalition forces - including the Kurds - to fight ISIS, but declined to say how many of the 2,500 troops currently stationed there would remain.

""A decade ago, Kurdish Peshmerga forces worked alongside U.S. troops to defeat ISIS and continue to actively combat ISIS remnants to prevent a resurgence of terror today,"" Aziz said. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) ""has been a reliable security partner for the United States and remains ready to enhance cooperation.""

But now, if Baghdad is pushing the U.S. out of Iraq, the U.S. could feel it must honor that request or risk making another enemy in the Middle East. The KRG says it would be ""willing and able"" to host U.S. coalition forces in its territory.

The current mission is now set to end by September 2025, with a plan to keep the number of forces on the Iraqi side to back up the 900 U.S. troops in Syria until at least 2026.

News of a plan that could amount to a significant drawdown of U.S. forces called to mind 2019, when former President Donald Trump announced plans to pull out of Syria and the Kurds felt abandoned by a partner they had fought alongside for years - leaving them open to an attack by Turkish forces.

PENTAGON PLANS TO SHRINK US 'FOOTPRINT' IN IRAQ

Trump, at the time, left the Kurds with a warning to their longtime enemies: ""I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane . . . they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy.""

The U.S. relationship with the Kurds - an indigenous group of daring fighters whose quest for their own formal state has been unsuccessful - spans back decades.

When the Turks denied the U.S. passage into Iraq for the invasion in 2003, Iraqi Kurds helped the U.S. overthrow Saddam Hussein.

The Kurds have fought with U.S. coalition forces since they reentered Iraq in 2014 to fight ISIS, and the U.S. pledged arms support and humanitarian aid.

The group faces attacks from terror groups on all sides. And as Iran increasingly encroaches on the Iraqi government, Baghdad has the KRG in a choke-hold, officials say.

US, IRAQ TEAM UP TO KILL 15 ISIS OPERATIVES

""There is growing concern regarding efforts to weaken the federal system in Iraq. The constitutional framework, which is designed to ensure shared governance, is disregarded,"" one Kurdish official said.

""The continued suspension of oil exports from the Kurdistan region has placed significant economic strain. More than a year and half later, we have yet to see the resumption of these exports.""

The KRG has been trying to work with the Iraqis on a power-sharing agreement with no real results.

""Some of these actions appear to align with external influences rather than the broader national interest,"" the official said, referring to Iranian influence. ""With the assistance of our allies, we believe these issues can be resolvable through constructive dialogue and cooperation.""

The KRG is also asking the U.S. government to ""honor its commitment"" included in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to ""provide the KRG with a comprehensive air defense system.

The law required the Department of Defense to submit and implement a plan for providing the Iraqi security forces and Kurdistan Region with air defenses by July 2024.

""As a steadfast U.S. ally that is regularly targeted by extremist violence, the KRG requires assurances that it will be protected from all threats, both internal and external,"" said Aziz.

Gen. Michael Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, told the House Armed Services Committee in March that ISIS-K, which launched a horrific attack in Moscow earlier this year, ""retains the capability and the will to attack U.S. and Western interests abroad in as little as six months with little to no warning."""

A former federal prosecutor who led the last major takedown of a big city mayor on corruption charges says embattled Big Apple boss Eric Adams is following an aggressive defense tactic he may have learned from former President Donald Trump.

""It appears like the Adams defense team is taking lessons from the former president about how best to litigate against the government,"" Mark Chutkow, a former federal prosecutor who led the public corruption case against former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick a decade ago. ""In other words, your best defense is often an aggressive offense.""

Although Trump's New York trial took place in state court, prosecuted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office and not the U.S. Department of Justice, there was a strong perception that the charges were politically motivated. And critics have raised similar concerns about the investigation by special counsel Jack Smith.

Chutkow pointed to a pair of defense motions that he said were filed ""extremely fast"" -- the mayor's motion to dismiss the bribery charge against him and a motion asking the court to investigate a series of Justice Department leaks that the defense says has damaged Adams' public image and compromises his right to a fair trial.

CNN LEGAL ANALYST SAYS SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH BENT RULES TO GET 'CHEAP SHOT' IN ON TRUMP BEFORE ELECTION

""I do think that how quickly the defense has filed a motion to dismiss, and this motion related to the leaks, shows not only are they being very aggressive in their defense, but they're going to shape public opinion about the case, almost the way you would in a political campaign,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""They're looking at who gets to define the narrative.""

Adams, a moderate Democrat, has accused the Justice Department of going after him and people in his orbit in retaliation for his criticism of the Biden-Harris administration on border security.

""Like Trump, Adams' legal strategy is to deny and defend,"" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who runs a private practice in Los Angeles. ""That's helpful for a candidate in the middle of an election, but there's more than a public relations and political benefit. By attacking the prosecution and putting them on their heels, that forces the government into a defensive position and delays the proceedings.""

In a battle of attrition, delays benefit the defense, he said.

""Prosecutors have limited resources and rarely deal with defendants with access to the best and brightest lawyers, like Trump and Adams do,"" he said.

The argument that the U.S. Department of Justice is punishing the administration's political opponents has been raised before -- by Trump and his supporters. In addition to the cases against Trump, critics have questioned aggressive prosecutions of people involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

ERIC ADAMS LIKELY TO FACE MORE CHARGES AS EMBATTLED MAYOR ACCUSES BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN OF POLITICAL PROSECUTION

Congress even has a House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which held a hearing in late September to explore claims that the FBI was purging conservatives from its ranks.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams, whose office is prosecuting Adams, denied a political motive in connection with the case when he announced the indictment last week.

""We are not focused on the right or the left,"" he said during a news briefing last month. ""We are focused on right and wrong. That is our duty, and we will fulfill it.""

But the government's motive doesn't really matter if a crime has been committed, said Chutkow, the former federal prosecutor.

ERIC ADAMS DEFENSE HINGES ON SUPREME COURT RULING IN HEARTLAND TRUCKING CASE

""You either committed the crime or you didn't,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""It doesn't really matter why the government chose to prosecute you.""

But Adams' publicity campaign could be designed to influence the jury pool. It could take just one sympathic individual on the panel to break the case.

""[Prosecutors] would have to be somehow defending against their own actions,"" Chutkow said. ""Most judges control that pretty tightly in the courtroom, but it's more difficult to do that in the court of public opinion. That's what you've seen with the former president, where he or people supportive of him made a lot of statements in the press.""

The judge in Trump's case, Juan Merchan, struggled to control out-of-court comments despite a gag order, he added.

""It's difficult when you're dealing with a public official, because they have First Amendment rights,"" Chutkow said. ""The judge is always going to have to weigh the right of free speech over concerns of contaminating the jury pool.""

Wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" hat and a T-shirt reading ""Occupy Mars,"" Musk appeared on stage shortly after Trump made his own remarks. The rally was held at the same site where Trump was shot by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks on July 13.

Although Musk has become a vocal Trump supporter, the speech marked the first time that the tech entrepreneur stumped at a major presidential rally. Musk confirmed that he would be at the rally on social media this week.

""I want to say what an honor it is to be here and, you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire, right?"" Musk said at the beginning of his remarks. ""And we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs, and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.""

""Fight, fight, fight, vote, vote, vote,"" Musk added. At one point, the X owner jumped excitedly.

WALZ ROASTED AFTER DECLARING 'WE CAN'T AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS' AT RALLY

Trump's speech, which he opened with a roaring start by thanking the people of Pennsylvania and making a light joke about the attempt on his life in July with the line ""And as I was saying..."", was largely positive and uplifting, a departure from his normally acrid criticisms of his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. During the speech, the Republican candidate did make pointed remarks about his opponents who ""maybe even tried to kill me.""

""Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interests, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, of which there are a lot of them,"" Trump described.

""We have a lot of them. We have a lot of them over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me,"" the candidate continued. ""But I've never stopped fighting for you. And I never will.""

The Republican candidate then turned his attention to the immigration chart he had put up - the same one that was displayed when he was shot on July 13.

""I love that chart,"" Trump said. ""I love that graph. Isn't it a beautiful thing?""

""But also beautiful because look at the number, that's the day I left office,"" he continued. ""It was the lowest Border Patrol [apprehensions]...Today, it's out of control.""

Trump also held a moment for Corey Comperatore at 6:11 p.m., the exact time that Crooks began firing at the former president on July 13. Comperatore, a rally attendee and firefighter, was fatally wounded.

Speaking at the beginning of his speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump acknowledged Comperatore's death and thanked his relatives for attending.

196,DAVID MARCUS: Trump's defiant supporters flock to Butler rally with renewed confidence,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-trumps-defiant-supporters-flock-butler-rally-renewed-confidence,2024-10-05T21:30:01Z,"Thousands of supporters of former President Trump returned to Butler, Pa., Saturday, amid an increased presence of Secret Service and security details and checkpoints.

In the couple of weeks after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket, there was a decided doldrum I detected across the country from Trump supporters.

But Saturday, as Trump returned to the site of his July 13 near assassination and the tragic murder of Corey Comperatore, a new confidence was clear among his faithful.

Rob is a teacher who lives in Pennsylvania and was carrying a clipboard, registering voters who stood in the vast line to get in.

""I coach wrestling,"" Rob told me, ""and when they switched in Harris it was like a wrestler had his opponent pinned, and suddenly they swap in a new, fresh opponent. Even if that new opponent is weak, it's still deflating.""

TRUMP SUPPORTERS WEIGH IN ON SAFETY AT HISTORIC PENNSYLVANIA RALLY

But now, Rob, who had registered about a dozen new voters when I spoke to him early in the day, thinks Trump has turned a corner, and is poised to defeat Harris.

He wasn't alone.

On a park bench in the shade, I found Karen and George, both in their 60s, along with Johnny and Rocky, in their late 20s or so. The two pairs, all decked out in Trump gear, had only just met. But when I was talking to them, I honestly thought they were family members who had known each other forever.

""It's like a Grateful Dead vibe,"" Johnny told me, ""it's all about love.""

Karen agreed, at least about the love part, not sure about the Dead, and she is confident that Trump can unite our deeply divided country. ""He's already showed he can get people what they need. He was in North Carolina right away after the hurricane. Where were Harris and Biden?""

Karen, like many I spoke to, believes that Trump won the 2020 election, and expects similar shenanigans this time around. However, she is confident not just that Trump will win, but that Republican Dave McCormack will beat incumbent Bob Casey Jr., in the Keystone State's critical Senate battle.

Rocky agreed, ""Casey is just a career politician,"" he mused. ""One thing I wish Trump would talk more about is term limits, because these are the people destroying the country.""

I've been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts. It took an hour to park in a nearby field. My little Mitsubishi Lancer had never driven on grass before, but she did okay, and the atmosphere was incredibly festive notwithstanding the long, long waits.

Joe, a retired NYPD officer, had driven six hours from Staten Island with his 18-year-old nephew, Uriel.

I'll note I saw no evidence of anyone being bused in. This crowd was truly as organic as a vegan's lunch.

When I asked Joe how long he had supported Trump, he told me, ""All my life."" It was his way of saying The Donald was the politician he had been waiting for.

I've been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts.

""In Staten Island, people are excited about Trump,"" he told me, and his nephew, set to vote for the first time, agreed.

I asked Uriel, what would make an 18-year-old vote for Trump?

""He'll make it a better country,"" he said quietly, in his Yankees t-shirt. ""More opportunity?"" I pressed, ""Yes,"" he replied. It mirrored what young voters have been telling me across the Rust Belt, and beyond.

I spoke to several attendees who had been in the same place on that fateful July 13, but the one who stood out was another Joe.

""Everybody was so calm and orderly, that's what I remember,"" he said. ""But I felt so bad for the kids, I mean, they were really scared.""

Joe did admit to feeling some emotions coming back to the Butler Farm Show grounds, but he's a dude and declined to elaborate on them too much.

As for the election? Like everyone I spoke to, the confidence is growing. ""Look at this crowd,"" he said,"" how can he lose?""

I'll admit, it sounded a bit like hubris, especially given the events of the last eight years, but it absolutely reflects the attitude of Trump voters over the past month, who have moved from a sense of nervousness, to increasing belief that this election is now squarely moving in Trump's direction.

On Saturday in Butler, it felt like a reset. After all, the tragic shooting took place just two days before the Republican National Convention. Just a week later, Biden was out, Harris was in, and confusion was everywhere.

There is now a month to go until Election Day, and if the sprawling crowd at the second Butler rally is to be believed, Donald Trump, decidedly has his groove back."

Journalist and MSNBC contributor Paola Ramos, daughter of Jorge Ramos, blamed ""internalized racism"" for why Latinos are leaving the Democratic Party and supporting former President Trump.

Ramos appeared on PBS' ""Amanpour & Company"" this week to address the trend covered in her new book, ""Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means.""

Trump appears to be outperforming his 2020 support among Latinos who prefer the Republican over Vice President Kamala Harris on handling the economy and immigration.

The Democratic Party's advantage with these voters is shrinking, according to NBC News, whose poll last week found the Democrats' edge is at its lowest level in the past four presidential election cycles.

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

In discussions with Trump-supporting Latinos for her book, Ramos said she found that ""tribalism, traditionalism, and political trauma"" were the three driving forces behind this growing trend.

""Really understanding the sort of racial baggage that I believe a lot of Latinos, including myself, and a lot of us are carrying from Latin America. What it means to sort of been colonized for so many years, the weight of colonization, that, in of itself, I believe, creates a lot of internalized racism, a lot of colorism, that then manifests in American politics in so many ways,"" Ramos began.

""And that's then how you can explain the fact that even someone like Donald Trump feels so comfortable going to the Bronx, talking to a group of Black Latinos, and Latino Trump supporters, because he believes that he can sort of tap into a racial and ethnic grievance that is very familiar,"" she continued.

Ramos told USA Today that traditionalism and trauma also play into the trend.

""There's traditionalism which is just breaking down what centuries of colonization have done to us and has led us to be so fixated on certain gender norms and sexual norms and then also leads us to this slippery slope of admiring things like Christian nationalism and then the trauma of this sort of admiration and a lot of Latinos flirting with the strongman rule and where that comes from,"" she said.

Last week, MSNBC guest Maria Hinojosa claimed Latinos ""want to be White"" while discussing the political shift toward Trump among Hispanics.

""And what I said to you when we asked a question was, Latinos want to be White. They want to be with the cool kids,"" she said.

Hinojosa went on to say that those voters could cost Harris the election.

""But those numbers? They could cost Kamala Harris the election. Everything that I've been saying that Latinos could push her over the top, these are the numbers that could also take her down,"" she said.

Vice President Kamala Harris currently has a 12-point lead among registered Hispanic voters, according to the latest Fox News poll.

Police were ubiquitous among the crowd estimated by a Butler County Sheriff's officer to number up to 60,000 people, snipers could be seen perched on rooftops ahead of the rally, and the Secret Service acknowledged heightened security. The event marked Trump's return to the Pennsylvania venue where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July. The former president's remarks are scheduled for 5 p.m. EST.

TRUMP'S RETURN TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION, IS 'GUTSY,' SUPPORTERS SAY

Friends who traveled over three hours to see Trump said that their families had concerns about them coming to the rally, but expressed how they felt safe with the bolstered security.

""Our families weren't too crazy about us coming today,"" Jody Cavalieri said. ""But we see the snipers, the police everywhere, and the camaraderie, and it's great.""

""People coming from all around the country, it's an amazing feeling,"" Dena Diebold said.

The Secret Service have upped security since the first Butler rally in July -- which included the roof of a nearby warehouse where investigators say that 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired from on July 13.

Crooks unleashed eight rounds of bullets, grazing Trump's ear, killing a 50-year-old firefighter and father of two daughters, Corey Comperatore, and wounding two others.

U.S. Secret Service (USSS) spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to Fox News Digital that Trump was receiving ""heightened"" security during the second Butler rally.

""Since the attempted assassination of former President Trump on July 13, the U.S. Secret Service has made comprehensive changes and enhancements to our communications capabilities, resourcing and protective operations,"" he said. ""Today, the former President is receiving heightened protection, and we take the responsibility to ensure his safety and security very seriously.""

TRUMP ANNOUNCES OUTDOOR PENNSYLVANIA RALLY TO 'FINISH OUR SPEECH' AT SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Guglielmi said that the USSS is ""coordinating closely"" with the Pennsylvania State Police as well as local law enforcement.

""We are also leveraging other federal security resources to expand personnel and technology,"" he said. ""To maintain the integrity of our protective operations, we cannot go into specifics regarding the security enhancements. Residents in the area should expect traffic delays and an increased presence of state, local, and federal law enforcement as part of our efforts.""

Supporters noticed the heightened protection and said they felt safer than they did during the July 13 rally.

""It's obviously more secure. Way more secure,"" David Mills told Fox News Digital, pointing to the snipers on the rooftops. ""You have snipers up on the roof back there. Law enforcement is everywhere.

""I didn't feel unsafe in July, but the security back in July was way less than four years ago [in Butler] and today,"" he added.

Others said that the extra security made them feel safe when attending.

""I do feel safe. I listen to Fox News, and I know they ramped up security,"" Denise Materia, an athletic secretary for the Saint Mary School District said. ""I see the security here, and I saw the notices of things that we cannot bring in.""

Dan Beasley, a real estate broker, quipped that this was the ""safest place in America.""

""It's probably the safest place in America right now,"" he said, laughing. ""I'll say that.""

""People are calm,"" he continued. ""This is a group of God-fearing people who are here taking a stand.""

Former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod argued that Vice President Kamala Harris voters will be clever enough to navigate voting in the wake of the devastation from Hurricane Helene, while saying that rural Trump voters will have a harder time getting to the polls.

Axelrod made the claim during an episode of his podcast ""Hacks on Tap"" that aired Wednesday, predicting that liberal voters in Asheville, North Carolina - a predominantly blue area in the state - will ""figure out a way to vote"" more so than conservatives in the storm's aftermath.

Describing Asheville as a ""blue dot"" in the state, he continued, ""Those voters in Asheville are - they're, you know, the kind of voters that will figure out a way to vote. You know, they're upscale, kind of liberal voters, and they're probably going to figure out a way to vote,"" Axelrod said.

He continued, stating rural conservatives may not be as resourceful in finding ways to vote following the destruction of their homes and communities.

""I'm not sure a bunch of these folks who've had their homes and lives destroyed elsewhere in western North Carolina - in the mountains there - are going to be as easy to wrangle for the Trump campaign,"" the political commentator hypothesized.

""I don't know how that's all going to play out, but it's an unpredictable element in North Carolina that has made it, maybe a little more interesting,"" he mused.

Communities in North Carolina - which Axelrod noted is the second-most rural state in the country - were hit especially hard by the effects of Hurricane Helene. Catastrophic flooding has destroyed roads and bridges, cutting off communities from getting much-needed aid.

More than 70 people are now confirmed dead in North Carolina, and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for due to the lack of power and communication access.

As of Thursday, the death toll among the six states most affected by Helene - Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee - sits at 170. Disaster response teams fear that number will climb as they regain access to communities isolated by the storm.

Multiple prominent X users commented on Axelrod's political assessment.

OutKick.com founder Clay Travis posted, ""On his podcast @davidaxelrod says Democrat voters in Asheville, North Carolina are smarter, wealthier and will still show up to vote for Kamala while he thinks Trump voters won't. This is why Kamala and Biden aren't helping, they benefit from the disaster.""

The Federalist editor-in-chief Mollie Hemingway commented, ""I fear that Axelrod's point is why Harris and Biden are letting these people drown.""

Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce slammed Axelrod over his take, asking, ""Did ya know that famous Democrat operative David Axelrod figures city Democrats are smarter and more resourceful and will figure out how to vote whereas the dumb Trump deplorables up in the mountains of NC who just lost everything, won't. Was he on the verge of a Kamala cackle?""

A former North Carolina judge whose church is supporting relief efforts for those affected by Hurricane Helene told Fox News Digital there ""is a resounding faith"" among residents that ""God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this.""

Judge Phil Ginn, a resident of Boone, said the Perkinsville Church in the western North Carolina town is one of several in the region stepping up in the wake of the devastating storm, which has so far left more than 230 dead and caused billions in property damage.

""We're housing people in our church. We've given up all of our Sunday school space to literally house people who are coming to work,"" said Ginn, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. ""And so our church had just seen fit to not only help our neighbors, but to help those who are coming here to help our neighbors by feeding them. We've got a shower trailer set up and washer and dryer to keep their clothes clean.""

Ginn described the storm as a ""generational event"" and said the recovery effort is going to be a ""marathon that's going to last for years."" However, he added that ""it's amazing to me to see God has come to us during the storm.""

""There is a resounding faith among folks that I'm talking to out there that God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this. And so we have that faith to lean into,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital. ""And it is stronger now than it ever was. The bond between us as human beings, as brothers and sisters, has really increased.""

The help seems to be coming more from local people than the federal government, Ginn said.

President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump have each made multiple trips to affected areas, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has committed $110 million in federal aid to Helene victims, the White House said Saturday.

Ginn said people are coming together to help each other regardless of their circumstances or backgrounds.

""Nobody's asking what your politics are. Nobody's asking what your faith is. Nobody's asking if you just got out of prison. There's nothing of that,"" he said. ""It's just if you need help, you're getting it from local people.""

GEORGIA MAN SHARES STORY OF SURVIVAL IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE: 'INCREASED MY FAITH IN GOD'

Ginn's seminary, working alongside Samaritan's Purse and the North Carolina Baptist Men's Association, has established the SES Benevolence Fund for Hurricane Helene Relief, which is helping provide food, water, hygiene items, first aid kits and other essentials to those in need across four southeastern states.

""The great problem that we have right now is that virtually all of the damage was caused by water or mud, and none of that is covered by insurance. And so we've got families who were barely edging by with inflation and everything else, and now they've lost everything,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital.

""They've lost all their personal possessions. They can't live in their home. Their property is gone ... so it's going to be a mental health issue, and it's going to be an economic issue as well.

""It will never return to what it was,"" Ginn added. ""We have not only buildings gone and towns gone, but the land on which these buildings are set ... that's gone too. Rivers have changed courses.

""I think that what we saw over the summer and prior to that with the campus uprisings across the country, we heard from young people who are very concerned, but also saw that certain college presidents lost their jobs and we've seen the community over and over again, specifically the uncommitted vote, call out where President Biden as well as Vice President Harris are on this issue.""

Vice President Kamala Harris recently recorded an interview with the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, though she continues to play coy with traditional media outlets.

The Harris campaign confirmed that Harris sat down for the interview this past Tuesday where she focused on talking to audiences about abortion and reproductive rights issues. The interview is set to air sometime next week.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview comes as she has been criticized for not doing enough traditional news interviews since the start of her presidential campaign in late July.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

So far, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., have done a combined 24 interviews, a number which pales in comparison to the Trump-Vance ticket's combined 63 interviews in that same time frame.

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

The ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, put on by SiriusXM, is hosted by Alex Cooper and reaches a massive, predominantly female audience. According to Spotify, it is ""the most-listened to podcast by women.""

The podcast is well-known for hosting explicit discussions about sex and women's health advice. Axios reported that the vice president's appearance on the podcast ""highlights her campaign's emphasis on appealing to women voters and younger audiences."" According to CNN, the podcast generally has ""a reputation for raunchy sex and relationship conversations.""

Former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance have done multiple interviews on major podcasts shows in recent months, trying to bring their messaging to younger audiences.

Trump recently sat down with podcaster and influencer Theo Von on his podcast and did a livestream with popular influencer Adin Ross that was conducted at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence. Vance did an interview on the Full Send Podcast in August.

That Harris would opt for a sit-down with the sex-positive show generated some chatter on social media.

The former Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers star wide receiver announced in a post on X on Friday that he is looking to get Pennsylvania voters registered for the upcoming election. Brown also suggested that he would be making an in-person appearance at the Steelers game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night to promote these efforts.

""Steeler Nation see you on Sunday at the game. Before then make sure to sign up to vote in this year's election,"" Brown wrote.

Brown even posted an alleged screenshot with Trump's running mate JD Vance, in which Vance expressed hope to meet the former NFL star soon.

As a former star with the Steelers, many of Brown's fans reside in western Pennsylvania and could cast critical votes in November.

Brown has been a vocal supporter of former president Trump throughout the current election cycle. The former football star said he would officially endorse Trump, back in May, during an interview with OutKick's Nick Adams, praising the former president's background and contributions to figures in the Hip-Hop industry.

""I've never met him. I've got admiration for his business moves and I study his dad, Fred Trump. But, I think Donald Trump is a good businessman and come[s] from a good family and has been a good president,"" Brown said. ""I think he does some great things for my brothers in the music industry in regards to Lil Wayne, Kodak [Black].""

In the days leading up to the 2020 presidential election, five-time Grammy Award winner Lil Wayne met with Trump at a Florida golf club. Just a few weeks after the meeting, Wayne was charged with felony gun possession. He proceeded to enter a guilty plea. At the time, the music star faced up to a decade in prison.

But Wayne's sentencing never happened, as the hip-hop artist was among the 143 pardons and commutations announced by the former president on his final day in office. On Jan. 21, 2021, Wayne thanked Trump for granting his pardon. Kodak Black was also pardoned by the former president just before he left office after the rapper was sentenced to almost four years in jail in 2019 for making a false statement to buy a firearm.

ANTONIO BROWN AVOIDS CHARGES IN FLORIDA FOLLOWING ALLEGED DOMESTIC DISPUTE

Attorney Bradford Cohen, who represents both Lil Wayne and Kodak Black, told Rolling Stone magazine: ""President Trump and his administration have been tireless advocates on behalf of the African-American community.

""These pardons are a perfect example of this administration following up on its reforms and commitments.""

Desiree Perez, the CEO of Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation and Death Row Records co-founder Michael ""Harry O"" Harris, were also on the list of individuals who received pardons or commutations.

Brown, a controversial figure on social media, has frequently expressed his support for Trump in the form of memes and more straightforward political messaging on the former NFL star's social media platforms in recent years.

When Taylor Swift was seen hugging Brittany Mahomes at the U.S. Open in early September, Brown made a post on X that read, ""White People for Trump,"" referencing Mahomes being linked to displays of support for Trump on social media.

After the assassination attempt against Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in August, Brown commended the former president for his resilience.

""Cue up Many Men by 50 and we gonna win the presidency in a landslide F---ing Legend of the Decade,"" Brown wrote on X.

Brown's efforts to help Trump in Pennsylvania will be aiding one of the most important swing-state ground games of the entire election.

Pennsylvania is viewed by many as the biggest swing state of this cycle, as Trump won the state in 2016 to essentially clinch the presidency that year, but lost in 2020.

Trump will be returning to Butler on Saturday to give another rally, and billionaire tech mogul and X owner Elon Musk is expected to join the former president on stage.

""I will be there to support!"" Musk wrote on X late Thursday in response to an image Trump shared promoting the upcoming event.

The July results, conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, but before she was conclusively the nominee, were deadlocked at 49% each. But even in March, when Biden was the presumed nominee, the contest was close to even.

Since July, Harris has widened her lead among women (by 9 points), nonwhite voters (+8), and voters under age 30 (+17). Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength: college graduates and urban voters. Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters.

Trump's best groups include men, Whites without a college degree, independents and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July."

Former President Trump admitted to not feeling safe on the campaign trail during an exclusive sit-down interview with Fox Nation host Kellyanne Conway, where he told his former senior counselor that the risks he faces mean he's ""doing the right thing.""

""I'm in a very dangerous position and, sadly, it's only consequential presidents that this happens to,"" he said during a recent episode of ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne.""

""I have a lot of enemies because I'm doing the right thing. This 'MAGA' is a great thing because it says it better than anything anybody can say. I want to make America great again, and that's what we're doing. We have more support, I think, than anybody's ever had, and I think we're going to have a great election.""

MULTIPLE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS PUT ON LEAVE FOLLOWING TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Trump narrowly dodged death twice, once at an open-air rally outside Butler, Pennsylvania, in July and another at the Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County, Florida, in September.

He first escaped a bullet that would have struck his skull if not for a fateful last-second turn. Instead, the bullet struck his ear, sending blood streaming down one side of his face as he dropped to the floor, surrounded by Secret Service agents as the threat - 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks - was neutralized.

His life was spared a second time when a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun pointing through a fence and immediately opened fire, sending suspect Ryan Wesley Routh fleeing until he was apprehended shortly after.

Though his Secret Service detail now matches that of an incumbent president, both incidents ignited a flurry of concerns that the Republican candidate could still be in danger.

MELANIA RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN VIDEO PROMOTING HER NEW MEMOIR

Former First Lady Melania Trump echoed those concerns as she opened up about her reactions to both incidents during a recent interview with Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt.

""I saw it on the television and as soon as I saw it on television, I called again, and he was OK because Secret Service were great,"" she said.

""The team, they were fantastic, and I think both of the events, they were really miracles. If you really think about it, July 13 was a miracle. How... like that much,"" she said, gesturing a tiny distance with her fingers, ""And he could not be with us.""

Meanwhile, former President Trump has vowed to continue fighting and has blamed Biden-Harris rhetoric - as well as rhetoric from other prominent Democratic politicians - for the violence.

""He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" he told Fox News Digital of Routh following the second apparent attempt on his life.

""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country -- both from the inside and out.""

Despite admitting to feeling unsafe, Trump announced he would be returning to the site of his first assassination attempt on Oct 5, to ""finish"" his speech from July 13.

""President Donald J. Trump will return to Butler, Pennsylvania, to hold a rally on the very same ground where he came within a quarter of an inch of losing his life less than three months ago,"" the campaign said in a news release late September.

The New York Times Magazine's Ethicist columnist on Thursday answered a reader's question about whether it is appropriate to leave the country if the ""wrong"" candidate becomes president.

Without calling out former President Donald Trump by name, the reader, along with some friends have ""no doubt that the U.S. would fall to some form of authoritarianism if the wrong candidate were elected.""

""They, and I, are white, well educated, nonimmigrants and upper middle class, with a wide range of well-connected and financially stable friends,"" the reader said of themselves and their circle of friends. ""Our demographic backgrounds are relevant to my question, which is on the ethics of leaving a country because its democratic institutions are failing.""

""As members of some of the groups who most likely will retain many tangible privileges and are least likely to be negatively affected, do we have an ethical obligation to stay and help those who will be impacted more harshly than us, or is it ethically acceptable to leave the country? -- Name Withheld"" the question reads.

The headline for the advice column read: ""Is It OK to Leave the U.S. if the Wrong Candidate Becomes President?""

Ethicist columnist Kwame Anthony Appiah compared it to the G.K. Chesterton complaint that to say ""my country, right or wrong,"" was like saying ""my mother, drunk or sober.""

HUNTER BIDEN WORRIED HE'LL HAVE TO FLEE THE COUNTRY IF TRUMP WINS IN 2024: REPORT

""By my lights, though, when genuine patriots say 'my country, right or wrong,' they mean that it's their country whether or not they agree with what is done in its name,"" he wrote. ""That's the opposite of giving the country a free pass. It expresses a commitment to trying to help your country do what it should -- which is how we should normally feel about our families too.""

But, he argued that pride and shame in your country is about a concern for national honor and a shared responsibility for its fate.

""Leaving your country because you think it has gone off the rails isn't really consistent with this sense of shared responsibility or with a commitment to trying to make things better,"" he wrote.

While the columnist admitted ""skedaddling does strike me as unpatriotic,"" it ""doesn't mean patriotic self-sacrifice is a duty. If you're convinced that life here will be unbearable for you, you are morally free to go.""

Appiah said he didn't share the reader's concern that the U.S. was on the brink of authoritarianism as he grew up under civilian and military dictatorships in Ghana, where his dad was a political prisoner.

""But if I did believe what you believe, I confess that, as a patriot, I would want to stick around and join with others to help bring us back from disaster,"" he concluded.

The New York Times this week endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has endorsed every Democrat for president since John F. Kennedy in 1960.

Liberal celebrities have, for years, threatened to flee the country if Donald Trump was elected commander-in-chief.

Comedian Bill Maher called out the Hollywood stars in February over their previous vows to flee, but pointed out that they are ""still here.""

""And is it possible for a country to lose itself so much that leaving it is justified? Yes, but we're not there yet,"" Maher said. ""Not by a long shot. And we don't need quitters. We need people who will stay and fix it.""

""Maybe the problem isn't that America isn't worth defending. Maybe the problem is that lots of people today are entitled whiners who have no perspective and no idea how good they have it,"" he continued.

Maher recalled some of the celebrities who vowed they would leave the U.S. before Trump was elected president in 2016.

STORMY DANIELS' HUSBAND SAYS THEY'LL PROBABLY LEAVE COUNTRY IF TRUMP GETS ACQUITTED

""Miley Cyrus once said 'I am moving if Trump is my president. I don't say things I don't mean,"" Maher said. ""Here she is looking miserable having to endure America at the Grammys last Sunday. I guess she flew back from Tajkisistan.""

""In 2016, Eddie Griffin said, 'If Trump wins I'm moving to Africa' - apparently very slowly because in Trump's four years, he only got as far as Van Nuys,"" he continued. ""George Lopez once said that if Trump won, he 'won't have to worry about immigration. We'll all go back.' George Lopez, still here. And it doesn't look like the migrant traffic is going back.""

Last month, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, said he would leave the U.S. in the event of a second Trump term for fear of political retaliation after he cooperated with investigations into his former boss, publicly testifying against him during Alvin Bragg's hush money trial and becoming a vocal critic.

208,Why the slow collapse of Harris-Walz won't stop before Election Day,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-slow-collapse-harris-walz-wont-stop-before-election-day,2024-10-05T11:27:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as anticipated, easily won the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, October 1, on demeanor, facts, and analysis. But in fairness to a sometimes herky-jerky and nervous Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he had the harder task of defending the temporary pseudo-conservative make-over of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

His additional burdens were her co-culpability for the last three-and-a-half-years of the Biden disaster, and her unwillingness to implement her supposedly ""change"" agenda in the last months of her vice-presidential tenure.

The CBS News moderators, Nora O'Donnell, and, especially, Margaret Brennan, also as expected, ganged up on Vance. They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing from the last disastrous, and biased debate moderators.

EMHOFF DENIES REPORT HE SLAPPED EX-GIRLFRIEND OUTSIDE RITZY OVERSEAS MOVIE EVENT

The two moderators shamelessly broke their own rules by fact-checking (wrongly and solely) Vance. They ignored questions of the administration's tardy responses to Hurricane Helene, the Ukraine war, the recent Trump assassination attempts, or crime, while only briefly touching on Iran and a Middle East on the brink of total war. Instead, they concentrated, as also expected, on climate change, abortion, healthcare and childcare.

All were issues they thought might more easily embarrass Vance. And, of course, as also expected, the two ended the debate pressing Vance on January 6. And yet Vance again parried easily and won decisively. In doing so, he dispelled the smear that he was somehow ""mean,"" when, in fact, he proved calm and magnanimous as he methodically dissected Walz.

The nation perhaps learned that a confident Trump selected him to articulate his MAGA positions, and perhaps in a manner superior to Trump's own.

In contrast, an insecure Harris picked Walz. The vice president was assuming that he would not upstage her and perhaps, by his limitations, would make her look competent in comparison.

The debate will give some momentum to Trump-Vance in the last month of the campaign.

It follows the lethargic Biden-Harris reaction to Hurricane Helene, whose toll in human life and property had been initially and vastly ignored by the media.

It follows the growing specter of a theater-wide Middle East war, as a solitary Israel faces off against Iran and its appendages (all empowered after 2020 by Biden-Harris).

It follows the chaos of a longshoremen's strike intended to shut down the entire country. And it follows Harris's continued inability to survive even serial soft-ball interviews without her memorized and banal answers.

As a result, the slow, steady hemorrhaging of support for Harris-Walz will likely still continue in the last month of the election."

Many conservative commentators said Friday that President Biden tying Vice President Kamala Harris so closely to his administration's record is a boon to former President Trump's campaign.

For the first time, Biden made an appearance during a White House press briefing where he spoke briefly about the averted port workers strike, Friday's positive jobs numbers and announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

Biden was asked what role Harris has played amid numerous crises at home and abroad.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

Former President Trump on Friday said that Israel should attack Iran's nuclear facilities while mocking President Biden's answer earlier this week on the subject.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

Trump went on to say that nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

TRUMP SLAMS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO HURRICANE HELENE

The former president said he rebuilt the ""entire military, jets everything, I built it, including nuclear"" while he was president. ""I hated to build the nuclear, but I got to know firsthand the power of that stuff, and I'll tell you what: we have to be totally prepared. We have to be absolutely prepared.""

He said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been ""'Hit the nuclear first, worry about the rest later.'""

Trump made similar comments in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, telling correspondent Bill Melugin Biden's response on Israel attacking Iran was the ""craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.""

He continued, ""I mean, to make the statement, 'Please leave their nuclear alone.' I would tell you that that's not the right answer. That was the craziest answer because, you know what? Soon, they're going to have nuclear weapons. And then you're going to have problems.""

Former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel, who served under Trump, said this week: ""Iran launched a war into Israel, so to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans.

Since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July, Harris has enjoyed a wave of momentum and enjoyed a surge in fundraising. In the all-important cash dash, Harris and the DNC appear to hold a large advantage over Trump and the RNC.

And that's helped bolster what was already a very impressive ground game organizational advantage the Democrats held over the Republicans.

""We started laying the foundation well before 2024 by investing in our ground game,"" Harrison highlighted. ""We have been on the ground since the earliest days of this campaign getting our message out.""

The DNC chair touted that there are ""more than 312 coordinated offices across the battleground states,"" with ""over 2,000 coordinated staff...doing the hard work on the ground.""

IN BID FOR DISGRUNTLED REPUBLICANS, HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH CHENEY IN GOP BIRTHPLACE

But Whatley wasn't phased.

""The Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money,"" Whatley said, noting that Trump was outraised in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.

The RNC chair emphasized that ""we have the resources we need to get our message out to our voters and to every voter. I feel very, very comfortable about the campaign plan.""

And while the Harris campaign and allied groups have outspent Trump and his aligned groups in the ad wars, Whatley pointed to the former president's ability to capture free media.

""Donald Trump is out there talking every single day to the voters in a way that only he can. He can generate news. He can go out there and generate social media hits. He can communicate directly with the American voters like no other politician of our generation, so it's a huge advantage for us,"" he said.

Veteran Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducted the Fox News Poll along with longtime Republican pollster Daron Shaw, said with four weeks to go, ""my expectations of plausible outcomes range from a narrow Electoral College victory for Trump to a modestly more comfortable victory for Harris.""

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

But while Harris holds a slight two-point edge in an average of the national surveys, Shaw noted that ""the issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump.""

Veteran political scientist and New England College president Wayne Lesperance said that ""this presidential contest is shaping up to be one of the closest in history, with the results likely to be slow-coming.""

And longtime Republican consultant Matt Gorman, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, highlighted that ""we're slated for the tightest race since 2000.""

""There are no more debates. There's going to be a vacuum of news,"" he said. ""It's integral the Trump campaign fill that vacuum with a message that puts Harris on the defensive.""

Trump, like Biden, is a well-known commodity.

But Harris, even after being in the spotlight for nearly two months, is still less well-defined.

""The more voters get to know Vice President Harris, the more they like her,"" Democratic strategist and communicator Chris Moyer argued.

""It's imperative that she continues to get in front of swing state voters, and she could afford to do more in the final weeks,"" he offered. ""She should barnstorm the key states, filling up her schedule with rallies and local interviews and off-the-record stops that produce shareable clips that bounce around social media. They've run a nearly perfect race to this point, but many voters still want to know more about who she is, what she believes, and what she will do as president.""

With one month to go, there's always the possibility of an October surprise that could rock the White House race.

The dockworkers strike earlier this week - which closed major ports - could have wreaked havoc on the nation's supply chain. It could have turned into an October surprise, but the strike was suspended after just two days.

Hurricane Helene, which tore a path of destruction through the southeast, also made an impact on the presidential contest - and there were memories of how Superstorm Sandy rocked the 2012 White House race between then-President Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

And the strife in the Middle East - between Israel, Iran, and Hezbollah, also threatens to upend the election.

It's important to note that while Election Day is a month away, in over two-dozen states, early in-person voting, absentee balloting, and voting by mail, are already underway."

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event. This week she taped an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

MSNBC analyst Michael Steele lashed out at Democrats and the press for putting pressure on Vice President Kamala Harris to engage more with the media, arguing Harris was being unfairly treated compared to her 2024 opponent, former President Trump.

""I don't see Donald Trump doing sit-downs and press conferences with the mainstream media every week,"" Steele said during a Friday interview on MSNBC.

""So let's stop -- let's hold her to the same standard we're holding Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump is not giving you anything except a rally in which he dribbles and -- and nods off and just goes off on -- on tangents. And the press accepts that. And yet they look at her and say, 'Well, how come you're not, you know, giving us more of what we want?' Well, as soon as you get it from Donald Trump, she'll give it to you,"" the former RNC chairman continued.

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 63 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to only 23 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far.

DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT HARRIS' CAUTIOUS MEDIA APPROACH IN TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'VOTERS DESERVE BETTER'

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

With just over a month to go until Election Day, some Democrats and media critics are warning the Harris-Walz campaign that their strategy could backfire with voters who are still uncertain about the Democratic candidate.

After the vice presidential debate last week, several media commentators argued Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, appeared unprepared because of his overall lack of media exposure on the national stage.

On MSNBC on Friday, host Chris Jansing asked Steele if Harris was being ""smart"" with her limited media approach this close to the election.

""Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times yes,"" Steele said, before dismissing these concerns.

""It's Democrats being Democrats and it's the mainstream media being the mainstream media. They want to be coddled. They want to show that they got the connection, they got the in,"" he said.

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

Steele argued that the vice president's campaign should not be compared to past presidential campaigns, because Harris emerged as the presidential nominee so late in the election cycle. He said she was being selective in her media appearances with the limited time left until election day.

""At the end of the day, you're talking 140 days to run a national presidential campaign. She's got to be particular with the targets. If she had an extra 400 days, everybody would get touched in the mainstream media and in the Democratic Party. This is not the Hillary campaign of 2016, this is not Joe Biden's campaign of 2020,"" he said.

""I think she's focused where she needs to be, and the Democrats need to stop acting like Democrats, get your behind on the ground, organize, turn out your vote. You need to overwhelm the ballot box on November 5, because that's the end game. And don't worry about a press conference today. You need to worry about how many voters you got turning out on November 5,"" he continued.

Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz defended the campaign's media strategy in a statement to NBC News Friday.

""Our task for the final stretch of this campaign is ensuring that [Harris'] winning vision reaches the undecided voters who will decide this election in places and ways that will actually reach them. That may look different in today's evolving media environment than prior campaigns, but coupled with campaign events, aggressive organizing and a historic paid media campaign, it's a winning approach,"" Munoz said.

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits, a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station and an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle."

President Joe Biden held the floor for an impromptu Q&A session Friday afternoon during the White House press briefing, where he claimed Vice President Kamala Harris is ""in constant contact."" His comments may not come across as music to the Harris campaign's ears.

In the president's surprise appearance, he remarked on the port strike, the latest jobs numbers, and briefly on Hurricane Helene. No reporters asked about the administration's response to the storm, but one asked Biden to assess whether Harris has been deeply involved in policy.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

The president strongly linked Vice President Harris to the Biden administration's record over the past 3 ½ years, despite the Harris campaign's attempts to distance her from everything from ""Bidenomics"" to inflation to the border crisis, since Biden announced he was ending his reelection campaign, and Harris assumed the mantle of nominee.

Harris recently changed the Biden fiscal year 2025 plan from a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% on a salary of $1M or more to her own 28%, for example. As illegal migration across the border surged to historic levels, Harris has also insisted she was never in charge of Biden's border policy, despite Biden personally handing her the reins at the White House in March 2021.

Axios reported that Harris would begin creating some daylight between herself and Biden in August in order to defeat Trump, as inflation raged, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East heated up, the border crisis continued, crime lingered as a concern, and other factors, including Harris' own weak approval rating, weighed her campaign down. Other outlets and pundits on the left soon followed suit.

But Biden has reportedly bristled about his vice president distancing herself from him behind the scenes. He has also hinted that he believes he could have won the election had he not dropped out.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

During an appearance on The View last week, Biden said, ""I never fully believed the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance to my running again. The fact of the matter is, my polling was always in range of beating [Trump]."" Biden even joked about jumping back into the race during Friday's surprise appearance at the White House.

He also began his first White House briefing appearance of his presidency at the same Harris was taking the stage at a campaign event, raising questions over whether it was a communications issue between him and the campaign, or he was trying to upstage her.

Biden sparked questions on the topic before, on the anniversary of September 11, by wearing a Trump hat momentarily. The White House referred it to as a ""unity gesture"" - after Biden spent years casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy.""

The Harris campaign has further distanced itself from the Biden administration by mentioning him less and less often as the election nears. During Tuesday's Vice Presidential Debate, Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, only referred to the sitting president by referencing the ""Biden-Harris administration.""

So, in these final weeks of the campaign, expect a blitz of appearances by the Obamas and other celebrities, the usual suspects.

A Rolling Stone reporter argued Friday that former President Trump wishes he could have ""death squads"" of police to shoot criminals and pile their bodies in the streets.

MSNBC host Jonathan Lemire interviewed Asawin Suebsaeng about a piece he wrote with fellow Rolling Stone senior politics reporter Tim Dickinson headlined, ""'American Death Squads': Inside Trump's Push to Make Police More Violent.""

Trump spoke about crime at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, this past Sunday, suggesting that a brief, decisive period of law enforcement could drastically reduce crime in America.

""One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know? It will end immediately,"" Trump said.

ICE NON-DETAINED DOCKET EXPLODES TO 7.4M CASES

""So it wasn't just that Trump saw the film 'The Purge' on his flight there heading to that rally, there's some teeth to this proposal,"" Lemire said as he spoke to Suebsaeng about his piece. ""Tell us what you found.""

The Rolling Stone reporter said that this statement from Trump was ""definitely not a rhetorical one-off thing,"" and that ""he and his chief ideological lieutenants have shown over the years, including during his administration, including during this current campaign, that they want to back up with the full force of the Department of Justice, the executive branch, and the federal government.""

Suebsaeng claimed that according to insiders from the Trump White House, the former president had outbursts demanding crackdowns on criminals.

""During his presidency, there would be multiple times where, according to our sources, he would be doing things like banging his fist on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and demanding that, 'Why aren't the police going around shooting all kinds of street criminals and drug dealers and piling up their bodies on American streets, so it can send a very grim message to gangs and all kinds of other suspected criminals in America?'"" the reporter claimed.

""He did this so often and so garrulously that there were some administration officials who referred to it to us as his 'American death squads' idea, which was something highly influenced by his admiration of what Rodrigo Duterte did in the Philippines,"" he added.

The reporter conceded that death squads ""maybe"" won't happen, but emphasized the significance of even the possibility.

""Is it possible that a second term, re-elected Trump could get exactly that? No, maybe not. But the point is, he wants to get to as close to that as humanly possible, which is a remarkable thing for a modern American presidency,"" he said.

Suebsaeng then claimed that in late 2020, Trump ""toyed with the idea of pulling federal funding from different states and cities that were not sufficiently 'pro-cop' enough for his liking, or didn't let the police get away with enough degrees of abusive behavior or even alleged racial bias. He'd threaten to pull federal funding if they didn't do those things to his liking.""

He claimed further that Trump ""has talked to people recently about using pardon powers to excuse different officers, where people have been federally charged with things.""

""There's all kinds of things that his second administration would be planning with the Department of Justice, with the power of the executive branch, to try to make police in this country as cartoonishly violent as men like Donald Trump would like them to be,"" the Rolling Stone reporter said.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung responded to Fox News Digital, ""President Trump has always been the law and order president and he continues to reiterate the importance of enforcing existing laws. Otherwise it's all-out anarchy, which is what Kamala Harris has created in some of these communities across America, especially during her time as California attorney general when she emboldened criminals. Now she has allowed criminals and terrorists cross the border unchecked, wreaking havoc throughout communities."""

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten noted on Friday that it would be unprecedented for Vice President Kamala Harris, representing the incumbent Democratic Party, to win the presidency considering so few Americans believe the country is on the ""right track,"" according to recent polling.

Enten pointed to polling showing that only 28% of Americans currently think America is on the right track and noted that this is close to the average rating when the party in power loses major elections.

""You're very much in the danger zone when we're looking at that right track, wrong direction number, that's where Democrats are right now,"" the data reporter declared.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

Enten explained the predicament, noting both the historical average percentage of Americans who believe the country is on the right track when the incumbent party loses an election - 25% - and the average percentage in the same category when that party retains power via an election, which he revealed was 42%.

He spelled out to viewers that the current 28% right track number is much closer to the rate that is present when the incumbent loses.

Pointing to the numbers on screen, Enten said, ""Look at that. It's just 25%. That looks a heck of a lot like that 28%, right, that currently think the country's on the right track.""

He continued, ""When the White House party wins - i.e. Kamala Harris' party, the Democrats - 42% on average think that the country is on the right track. This 25% looks a lot more like this 28%. It doesn't look anything like this 42%.""

Summarizing the data, he declared, ""This to me is a bad sign for Kamala Harris' campaign. The bottom line is it looks a lot more like a loser than it does like a winner when it comes to the country being on the right track.""

CNN anchor John Berman asked if it was possible that the Democratic Party could win with these numbers, to which Enten cited the average ""right track"" rate during every election since 1980 in which the incumbent won.

His chart revealed that the lowest rate of Americans thinking the country was on the right track when an incumbent won in the modern era was in 1996, when 39% of voters thought the nation was moving in the right direction.

The other rates were at 41% or higher when incumbents won since 1980, the highest being 47% of the country thought it was on the right track when former President Ronald Reagan won re-election in 1984 by a landslide.

""There is no historical precedent for the White House party winning another term in the White House when just 28% of the country thinks that we're on the right track,"" he said, adding, ""John, simply put, it would be historically unprecedented.""

At Berman's urging, Enten mentioned a small hope for Democrats that the latest midterm elections could represent the country is in a new era in this regard, showing numbers revealing that the Democratic Party had a successful 2022 midterms even though only 26% thought the country was on the right track at the time.

""Maybe we've entered a new political environment where Donald Trump is so unpopular that these historical norms, these historical measures that we look at don't actually mean what we think anymore,"" he stated.

""I'll tell you this much, Kamala Harris better hope that's the case, because otherwise this right track, wrong direction situation will not work out in their favor."""

Reporters had a unique opportunity to question President Biden when he made a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing on Friday, but didn't ask about the historic disaster unfolding in the Southeast in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

It was the first time that Biden appeared at a White House press briefing since taking office. The president spoke briefly about the suspended port workers strike and Friday's positive jobs numbers, and he announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts. But there was no follow-up from the press on hurricane relief.

After thanking the president for his presence, the first reporter asked about Republicans casting doubt on his economic numbers, saying, ""Florida Sen. Marco Rubio described today's jobs report as having fake numbers. What do you make of that? And how worried are you that many Americans are hearing that the jobs numbers aren't real?""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The crisis in the Middle East was the biggest topic, with questions about Biden's comments about strikes on Iranian oil facilities, Israeli plans to retaliate, possible U.S. sanctions, and worries about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu trying to influence the U.S. election.

Election security and the peaceful transfer of power were also top of mind for reporters.

""The election is a month away. One, I'd like to know how you're feeling about how this election is going. And then also, do you have confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that it will be peaceful?"" one reporter asked. ""Are you making any preparations, getting security briefings related to domestic security?""

The only mention of Hurricane Helene, with a death toll topping 230, was in a question about Vice President Kamala Harris' role in the administration.

""There have obviously been a number of crises that the country has been facing over the past several days with the hurricane, with the port strike, with the situation in the Middle East. Can you talk about how your vice president, who is running for the presidency, has worked on these crises and what role she has played over the past several days?"" a reporter asked.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from former President Trump for the federal response to the devastation left by Helene, already one of the deadliest hurricanes this century.

The White House has pushed back hard against these criticisms, emphasizing that Biden has coordinated the federal response, including approving emergency declarations and deploying 1,000 active-duty soldiers to support search-and-rescue efforts. More than 4,800 personnel from FEMA and other agencies have been deployed to North Carolina and neighboring states impacted by Helene. Additionally, FEMA has shipped over 8.5 million meals, more than 7 million liters of water, 150 generators and over 220,000 tarps to aid response efforts, according to the White House.

As of Friday, the federal government has provided more than $45 million in Individual assistance to survivors affected by the storm, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, including in the form of one-time $750 payments from FEMA to qualified applicants in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

Former President Obama is preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for Vice President Harris, focusing on key battleground states in the lead up to Election Day, according to a senior campaign official with anonymity to discuss the matter.

Obama, who served back-to-back terms as president from 2009 through 2017, will kick off his drive in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania on Thursday, a state which remains one of the tightest contests in the nation and which could tip the scales for either candidate.

A Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters last week found Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. President Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes in 2020.

President Obama's Senior Advisor Eric Schultz tells Fox News that the 44th president is determined to help Harris and other Democrats get elected.

""President Obama believes the stakes of this election could not be more consequential and that is why he is doing everything he can to help elect Vice President Harris, Governor Walz and Democrats across the country,"" Schultz said. ...Read More

""The View"" co-host Joy Behar urged Republican voters to put aside their party affiliation and vote for the Democratic Party just this one time to get rid of former President Trump.

Behar made the appeal during a conversation about former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney recently endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy, asking other Republicans to join her in voting against Trump this election cycle.

""Just do it this one time. Do it this one time. Vote for the Democrat to save the country,"" she said.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIA SAY

Prior to Behar's appeal, ""The View"" panel discussed the individual Republicans, including co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin and Cheney, who are working to stop Trump's second term. Griffin, a former Trump aide, brought up her upcoming ""fireside chat"" she's doing in Pennsylvania alongside Cheney and former Trump staffers Cassidy Hutchinson and Sarah Matthews next week.

""I've never voted for a Democrat in my life,"" Griffin said. ""This man is so wholly unfit for office. And so, next week I'm traveling to battleground Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney and my friend Sarah Matthews and Cassidy Hutchison. And we're there with a nonpartisan group to talk about the threat that Donald Trump poses and why he should not be back in the White House.""

Griffin's comments prompted cheers from the audience and a wider conversation about how it's significant that conservatives like Cheney are aligning themselves with the Democratic Party this election cycle.

Co-host Sunny Hostin said, ""I certainly have been a Liz Cheney critic because, you know, she voted with Trump 93% of the time. But I have had a change of heart when it came to this, when I saw this, because I think it's brilliant that Kamala Harris is willing to have other voices in the room. I think it says a lot about the type of president that she would be.""

She then brought up how Harris pledged to have a Republican in her cabinet as president, which prompted the panel to wonder if that cabinet member could be Cheney.

Later, the topic of bipartisanship led to co-host Ana Navarro reminiscing about her own switch to voting Democrat after voting Republican her whole life. ""So I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was the first time I voted for a Democrat and it was a very difficult thing to do, because when politics has been such a part of your profession, of your social circle, of your family life, it really is a very hard thing to do.""

""So I want us to recognize just how hard what she did is and Liz Cheney has been paying a price for standing on principle since January 6,"" Navarro declared."

A ""painful"" Israeli response weighs over the heads of the Iranian regime after their ballistic missile attacks on Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden has insisted that an angry Israel should not strike Iran's nuclear sites - and should make sure its response is measured - proportional.

""Iran launched a war into Israel,"" said former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel.

""So to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

On Thursday, he revealed that he was ""discussing"" recommending Israel target Iran's energy facilities.

""That put the oil markets into a tailspin, even if we are talking to them about it. It's not something you muse about publicly,"" said former Trump deputy national security advisor Victoria Coates.

""If you've made a decision, and you have something to announce, fine. You want to level with the American people as much as you can. These random comments are really damaging and confusing to the Iranians, because . . . they don't have any guidelines or guardrails about what might be coming and so they might do something weird.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH KHAMEINI DEFENDS MISSILE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL

Israel's counterattack could come at any moment. ""We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.

Rather than its longtime goal of helping to negotiate a ceasefire, the Biden administration has now shifted its priority to containment - helping the region avoid all-out war between its two hegemonic superpowers.

""This is the 1930s all over again. G7 leaders - led by President Biden - are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital.

""The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality,"" he went on. ""Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?""

Former President Donald Trump has not said how Israel should respond to the attacks - which he insists never would have happened under his watch.

Striking Iran's nuclear facilities risks provoking all-out war on yet another front for Israel in the eyes of the Biden administration. The Trump team is caught between an anti-war mindset and a penchant for supporting Israel without conditions. It's unclear whether they still believe the two can exist in harmony.

Proportionality is ""clearly not what Israel is doing,"" according to Coates.

""It really seems to me that after the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] left Washington in July, after that visit, some factor, or combination of factors, really changed his calculus,"" she said.

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""He appears to have gotten home with the attitude of, 'I want to get everything I can get done before the election.' He's not really listening to the White House at all, which is unfortunate.""

After Iranian plots to assassinate him and the hacking of his campaign, Trump did say that if he were president, he would tell Iran, ""I'm going to blow you to smithereens"" if they harm any U.S. political figures.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he wished he had responded more forcefully after Iran fired dozens of missiles at U.S. forces stationed in Iraq in 2020, leaving many with traumatic brain injuries.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean? 'Injured' means -- you mean, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort,"" Trump said.

""So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq,"" Trump continued, saying 'Iraq' instead of 'Iran.' ""When you say not tough, they had no money. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. And when we hit them, they hit us. And they called us, and they said, 'We're going to shoot at your fort, but we're not going to hit it.'""

Defense officials have said more than 100 suffered traumatic brain injuries after the January 2020 attack.

That attack came after Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani due to an uncovered Iranian plot to kill American diplomats and service members.

Trump vowed to hit 52 Iranian sites ""very hard"" if Iran were to carry out the plot, representing the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days after being seized at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979.

Still, in January, Iran lobbed attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, including the Ain al-Assad military base, and a second facility near Erbil airport.

In March, three U.S.-led coalition forces were killed when multiple rockets hit Taji military base.

Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, has insisted to reporters this week that ""nobody [was] ever tougher on Iran"" than he was.

'Look at the World today -- Look at the missiles flying right now in the Middle East, look at what's happening with Russia/Ukraine, look at Inflation destroying the World. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT!' he wrote on Truth Social.

Alexander Vindman, the former Trump National Security Council Director for European Affairs for the United States, claimed that the former president was ""fearful"" of escalation with Iran.

""Iran struck first and early, during Trump's presidency, attacking US troops. Trump consistently recoiled in fear inviting further attacks,"" he wrote on X.

""Fact check: In 2020, Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in retaliation for the Soleimani assassination. 110 U.S. service members sustained traumatic brain injuries. Many administration officials remain on an Iranian hit list today,"" former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

But Patel argued the Biden administration's lifting of sanctions on Iran -- and the Obama administration's 2015 nuclear deal -- is what led to the attacks in the first place.

""The JCPOA, which was called the 'Iran nuclear deal' for a reason. It was never intended to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It literally gave them one on a timeline,"" he said.

""Now I believe they have one, because for four years they haven't stopped them or slowed them down. They've only been successful in politicizing national security."""

President Biden entered the White House briefing room on Friday to audible gasps from reporters as he unexpectedly took the podium and fielded questions.

It was the first time that Biden, 81, made an appearance during a White House press briefing since he assumed office in 2021. The president spoke briefly about the averted port workers strike, Friday's positive jobs numbers and announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

""We're going to have to deal with unforeseen cost what this hurricane is going to cost. It's going to cost a lot of money and I'm probably going to have to ask the Congress before we leave for more money to deal with some of those problems,"" Biden said.

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from former President Trump for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. The death toll in southeastern states hit hardest by the storm has risen past 215, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

The White House has pushed back hard against these criticisms, emphasizing that Biden has coordinated the federal response, including approving emergency declarations and deploying 1,000 active-duty soldiers to support search-and-rescue efforts. More than 4,800 personnel from FEMA and other agencies have been deployed to North Carolina and neighboring states impacted by Helene. Additionally, FEMA has shipped over 8.5 million meals, more than 7 million liters of water, 150 generators and over 220,000 tarps to aid response efforts, according to the White House.

As of Friday, the federal government has provided more than $45 million in Individual Assistance to survivors impacted by the storm, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, including in the form of one-time $750 payments from FEMA to qualified applicants in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

BUTTIGIEG'S MESSAGE ON RESTRICTING CIVILIAN DRONES NEAR HURRICANE HELENE DAMAGE PROMPTS OUTCRY, CLARIFICATION

Biden's surprise in-person appearance in the White House briefing room comes after an Axios report highlighted his absence from public view in the final months of his presidency.

Axios reported Thursday that Biden had not scheduled a public event in 43 of the 75 days since he dropped out of the 2024 presidential election. He has participated in just one campaign event with Vice President Kamala Harris, who succeeded him as the Democratic nominee.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

Critics, including many Republicans, have questioned whether Biden is able to handle the pressures of the presidency at his advanced age, noting that most of his public appearances are scheduled between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. The president has also only given two interviews since July 21.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates waved off criticism of Biden's public schedule as part of the White House's media strategy in a statement to Axios.

""Being commander-in-chief is about far more than public events, which are scheduled at strategic times to reach the most Americans possible, like before 20 million Americans watch the national evening news,"" Bates told the outlet.

224,Biden admin won't extend parole for Venezuelan migrants in US via controversial flight program: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-wont-extend-parole-venezuelan-migrants-us-via-controversial-flight-program-report,2024-10-04T19:12:32Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

The Biden administration has reportedly decided against extending parole for tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants who came to the U.S. through a controversial Biden-era travel program that was temporarily halted due to discoveries of fraud in the program earlier this year.

Officials have decided not to extend parole for Venezuelan nationals who came into the U.S. via the parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV), according to a CBS News report.

The program was first implemented for Venezuelans in October 2022 and extended to the other nationalities in January 2023. It allows migrants to use the CBP One app to enter the U.S. on temporary parole and receive a work permit if they pass background checks and have a sponsor.

NEW POLL REVEALS TRUMP HAS SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

Through the end of August 2024, nearly 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans arrived lawfully on commercial flights and were granted parole under these processes, nearly 117,000 Venezuelans.

The program has received furious opposition from Republicans, some of whom have described the administration as running migrant flights, but under this program, migrants must organize their own travel.

However, the program was paused briefly in August when an internal report unearthed large amounts of fraud in applications of those sponsoring the program. It later unfroze the program after installing what it said were additional vetting and protections against fraud.

BIDEN ADMIN FREEZES CONTROVERSIAL MIGRANT FLIGHT PROGRAM AFTER FRAUD REVELATIONS

It was expected that the administration would extend the parole status, as it has done with other parole populations, but CBS reported that DHS has decided against it, and Venezuelans would be told to either apply for another immigration status or leave the country -- although Venezuela is currently not accepting deportations from the U.S. It is also unclear if the administration intends to stop bringing in new migrants via the program. DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

If they arrived before July 2023, they may be eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which the Biden administration redesignated and extended for Venezuelans last year.

The status of the other three nationalities will begin to expire in January next year if the administration makes a similar decision not to extend their parole status.

The move will likely infuriate immigration activists, who have cried foul as the administration has moved away from more liberal policies as the election approaches. The administration threw its weight behind a bipartisan border security bill this year that would have allowed for a limit to be placed on asylum entries and given additional funding to border agencies.

DHS DOCS REVEAL WHERE PAROLED MIGRANTS UNDER CONTROVERSIAL BIDEN FLIGHT PROGRAM ARE LANDING

When that bill failed to pass, President Biden signed an order limiting asylum entries in June, which was followed by a sharp drop in arrivals at the border by more than 50%, leading to numbers lower than anything during the current administration.

The administration has also touted an increase in removals. Biden followed that up with a ""parole in place"" scheme for illegal immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens. But in the last week, he announced new measures to prevent that limit on arrivals at the border from being lifted.

It comes as Vice President Harris battles with former President Donald Trump over who is the tougher candidate on border security. Harris has accused Trump of failing to back the border security bill for political reasons, while Trump has accused Harris of being responsible for the crisis at the border.

Alexander Yui on the impact of the U.S. election.

Taiwan's top official in the U.S. is warning that China has ramped up its aggression toward the island, and that its people are ready to fight.

""Yes, of course,"" Alexander Yui, the Taiwanese representative to the U.S., told Fox News' Aishah Hasnie when asked whether the island's residents were willing to meet the moment, if China were to invade. ""We've seen Ukraine.""

Taiwan has been intensely watching the conflict in Eastern Europe as Kyiv's forces have battled a Russian invasion for more than two years.

TRUMP-ENDORSED HOUSE CANDIDATE SOUNDS ALARM ON CHINA'S GROWING INFLUENCE IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

Yui said he hoped to not need help from U.S. troops, which Ukraine also does not have, but suggested they would be eagerly accepted if offered.

""If your house is under fire, and they respond to help you with a bucket of water, would you say no?"" Yui posed.

The diplomat said Chinese President Xi Jinping has escalated regional tensions since former President Donald Trump left office, but he stopped short of blaming the Biden administration for emboldening China.

""XI Jinping has been emboldened because he wants to realize what he calls his China dream,"" Yui said. ""It's not about which administration is in the United States . . . but rather, what are the thoughts of Xi Jinping?""

Taiwan's ministry of defense tracked eight Chinese military aircraft and two naval ships near the island earlier this week. The defense ministry said four of the eight planes crossed the median line dividing China and Taiwan's territory in the Taiwan Strait - though Beijing, which claims ownership of Taiwan, does not recognize the geographic delineation.

A week prior, on Sept. 25, Taiwan's defense ministry said it had detected 43 Chinese military aircraft in a 24-hour period, with 34 having crossed the median line. The next day saw 41 Chinese military planes detected near Taiwan.

226,My friend Melania Trump is finally telling her story. Let's take a moment to hear her out,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/my-friend-melania-trump-finally-telling-her-story-lets-take-moment-hear-her-out,2024-10-04T19:04:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

After two decades of friendship, and as someone who had the honor to serve on Mrs. Trump's White House team for a time, I am excited that the former first lady is finally telling her story in her forthcoming book, ""Melania."" For this reason, I can no longer remain silent as many self-proclaimed ""experts"" continue to opine on her thoughts, her statements and her actions -- especially when many of them have obvious malice in their hearts and money on their minds.

The hate-Trump media industrial complex is largely a money-making endeavor attracting many longing to remain relevant, become famous, advance personal agendas, or cash in while they can.

Mrs. Trump's response to all of this -- she ignores all but the most egregious attacks -- is not surprising to those who truly know her as a woman of tremendous strength, grace and resilience, a loving and devoted mother, wife, daughter and friend.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP ON RELATIONSHIP WITH HUSBAND, WHAT PREPARED HER TO BECOME FIRST LADY

Their vitriol is only likely to reach a more fevered pitch in coming days, ahead of the Oct. 8 release of Mrs. Trump's memoir, ""Melania."" Yet I remain hopeful that, with the book's publication, the public will finally have a chance to learn her story, firsthand, and come to understand the remarkable woman I am so fortunate to call my friend.

In my role as one of Mrs. Trump's advisers in the White House, I was in many of the rooms and witnessed many of the moments that have since been drastically recast in books, tweets and interviews by former staffers -- and I am aghast at the disparity between the truth I witnessed and the skewed narrative that is widely promoted.

Consider the ongoing rants of one of her former staffers, and self-proclaimed close friend, who has since worked indefatigably to promote herself while bashing Melania. After her contract with the White House was terminated, (full disclosure: my contract with the White House was also terminated at the same time) she wrote a one-sided book about her former boss. She admitted to secretly taping personal phone calls with Mrs. Trump, who was first lady at the time. An unprecedented breach of trust and civility if not ethics.

MELANIA TRUMP ON WHY THE 2024 ELECTION IS DIFFERENT: 'WE ARE DEALING WITH MUCH MORE DANGER'

Further, after leaving the White House, she began her campaign to criticize Mrs. Trump at every turn, apparently not only to sell her book but also to settle imagined personal scores. Like other former Trumpians, she apparently was positioning herself to be the go-to expert about a woman to whom she has not spoken now in more than seven years.

Examine her ongoing hateful tweets, such as opining about why Melania was not on the campaign trail with her husband last fall. When Mrs. Trump told reporters to ""Stay tuned"" about her plans to campaign, this former staffer predictably chimed in with a supposedly all-knowing tweet: ""Let me interpret this for you: DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATHE! [sic]""

How, exactly, would she know that -- or anything else about the former first lady? She was clearly so far out of the loop that she was unaware that Mrs. Trump was caring for her dying mother at the time. So much for expertise.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HER HUSBAND: SURVIVING BOTH WERE 'REALLY MIRACLES'

Then there is Mrs. Trump's onetime White House press secretary, who also appears to be competing to become the Left's Melania expert. This, after writing a self-aggrandizing book that attacked her former boss while auditioning for the never-Trump ""conservative"" seat on ABC's ""The View.""

This former ""insider"" is the same person who, embarrassingly, could not correctly explain to reporters in 2018 why the first lady wore a now-famous Zara designer jacket with its bold logo -- ""I Really Don't Care, Do U?"" -- on a flight to visit migrant children detained at the Texas border. This press secretary told reporters: ""It's just a jacket. There was no hidden message.""

How did she not know that the first lady was intentionally signaling to her critics with that jacket and not referring to the children? And if she had no understanding of Mrs. Trump then, while working for her, how can she possibly be considered an expert on her now when she has had no access to Mrs. Trump in years?

It took the former first lady herself to clear up the confusion and repair the damage. Melania told an ABC News interviewer that the jacket was ""kind of a message, yes,"" but one directed at her critics: ""I want to show them that I don't care. You could criticize whatever you want to say, but it will not stop me to do what I feel is right.""

Sadly, we have rarely seen any positive reporting on Melania's achievements because Mrs. Trump has seldom been recognized or credited for the important initiatives she undertook and supported during her four years as First Lady and in the years since.

As first lady, she worked to focus attention on the opioid crisis and its toll on families when visiting Lily's Place, a treatment center in Huntington, W.Va. She championed ""Be Best,"" her campaign which aimed at building children's wellness and emotional intelligence in education which included her work against cyber-bullying in schools.

Since leaving the White House, she has created ""Fostering the Future,"" to raise college scholarship funding for former foster children. Since its inception, ""Fostering the Future"" has given out scholarships to many students. You have probably heard little about it.

Democrats are warning Vice President Kamala Harris that she needs to ramp up her engagement with voters and the media or it could cost her the election.

Harris is neck-and-neck with former President Trump in the 2024 race, according to national polls. While Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, have stepped up their interviews in recent weeks, she has also faced criticism from media critics for being evasive, even in interviews with friendly liberal outlets like MSNBC.

""Ms. Harris responded to the fairly basic and predictable questions with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer,"" The New York Times reported after Harris' interview with MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle last month.

According to a Friday report from NBC News, some Democrats are worried the Harris campaign's media strategy won't help win over undecided voters who have yet to warm up to the Democratic presidential candidate.

75 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

""They're trying to keep her away,"" Steve Shurtleff, former Democratic speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, told NBC News of the Harris campaign. ""It's like seeing your favorite Hollywood actor, and then they're on a talk show and they can't even speak.""

""The President of the United States has to be able to be on their toes all the time and answer questions,"" he continued. ""It's so obvious she's been avoiding the one-on-one interviews, and the voters deserve better.""

Other Democrats in the report said that the Harris campaign's approach of avoiding the media was a risky strategy in such a tight race.

""The campaign is taking a chance that they can run out the clock and Trump's weaknesses will be enough to win,"" Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist told NBC. ""But the danger in that is if you don't define your own candidacy well enough, people will start defining it themselves.""

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

""It's been a mistake to shield Walz and Harris from interviews,"" a Democratic lawmaker also told NBC. ""It's like playing basketball -- if you don't play for weeks, you're not going to get it into a game and do well. You've got to be on the court...I would have them out there very extensively.""

Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to NBC, ""Our task for the final stretch of this campaign is ensuring that [Harris'] winning vision reaches the undecided voters who will decide this election in places and ways that will actually reach them. That may look different in today's evolving media environment than prior campaigns, but coupled with campaign events, aggressive organizing and a historic paid media campaign, it's a winning approach.""

It's uncertain if this strategy will convince undecided voters to support Harris.

According to the latest Fox News poll of voters in Pennsylvania, Harris retains a narrow edge over Trump among registered voters and the race is tied among likely voters in the battleground state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

""The whole world is watching, and I'm sure the diplomatic community here in Washington, D.C., is also watching closely and [trying] to reach out to both candidates or to the people around the candidates,"" Yui said.

Blinken penned an op-ed in Foreign Affairs Magazine on Oct. 1 that said world powers were in competition to set the stage for a ""new age"" of international relations.

Melania Trump is not the only first lady to express pro-choice views. She joins several former Republican first ladies who have shared similar perspectives, often in their memoirs, despite this stance historically contrasting with the GOP platform.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

As a more conservative first lady, Nancy Reagan avoided taking a public stance against abortion that would put her at odds with former President Ronald Reagan. However, she later revealed her personal position on the issue.

""I'm against abortion, I don't believe in abortion,"" Reagan said at George Washington University in 1994, five years after her husband left the Oval Office. ""On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice. So, it puts me somewhere in the middle, but I don't know what you'd call that.""

Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush's wife, was more reserved in her public statements about abortion and was at odds with her husband's anti-abortion stance. While she was not as outspoken as Betty Ford, she wrote in her 1994 memoir, ""I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.""

Former first lady Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush and daughter-in-law to Barbara Bush, also differed with the former Presidents Bush on abortion.

""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people for medical reasons and other reasons,"" she said in an interview with Larry King Live in 2010.

Pat Nixon, then-President Richard Nixon's wife, told reporters during a 1972 press conference - as Roe v. Wade arguments were being considered by the Supreme Court - that she supported the right to choose an abortion, but opposed ""wholesale abortion on demand.""

Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, she expresses a viewpoint closely aligned with that of former first ladies before her.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Trump reportedly wrote.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The former first lady drew criticism from pro-life advocates on social media after the excerpts were published just a month away from Election Day. This year, the Republican Party's official platform also softened its language on abortion, as former President Trump also said he would not support a federal abortion ban."
232,CNN legal analyst says Special Counsel Jack Smith bent rules to get 'cheap shot' in on Trump before election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-legal-analyst-says-special-counsel-jack-smith-bent-rules-get-cheap-shot-trump-before-election,2024-10-04T17:01:18Z,"Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett on a judge unsealing a key filing in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election case against former President Trump.

Special counsel Jack Smith ""bent ordinary procedure"" to kneecap former President Trump after he failed to try the candidate before the November election, a legal analyst argued in a piece for New York Magazine.

In Thursday's ""Jack Smith's October Cheap Shot"" essay, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig analyzed Smith's decision to drop a 165-page federal court filing related to the issue of Trump's immunity from prosecution.

According to Honig, Smith successfully received permission from Judge Tanya Chutkan to file a 180-page long brief -- four times the normal maximum.

Honig noted that Chutkan now claims she does not care about the upcoming election despite earlier efforts to expedite Trump's immunity and get it in before November 5. After redacting several names, she complied with Smith's request and made the rest of the brief public.

5 KEY DETAILS IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S TRUMP ELECTION CASE FILING

""The larger, if less obvious, headline is that Smith has essentially abandoned any pretense; he'll bend any rule, switch up on any practice -- so long as he gets to chip away at Trump's electoral prospects. At this point, there's simply no defending Smith's conduct on any sort of principled or institutional basis,"" Honig wrote.

He added that Smith's ""unprincipled, norm-breaking practice"" is neither a response nor an excuse to suggestions that voters should have the utmost information about presidential candidates before they cast their ballot.

In standard criminal procedure and under federal rules, a prosecutor first files an indictment, the defense makes a motion and then the prosecution responds to said motions. However, Honig said Smith turned these rules ""on their head"" when he asked Chutkan to file without a pending defense motion.

""Trump's team objected, and the judge acknowledged that Smith's request to file first was 'procedurally irregular' -- moments before she ruled in Smith's favor, as she's done at virtually every consequential turn,"" Honig continued.

PROSECUTORS REQUEST INDEFINITE DELAY IN TRIAL FOR TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH

He stressed that Smith's proactive filing is ""prejudicial"" to Trump in the legal and political sense, but also ironic because Smith previously complained that Trump's words might taint the jury pool for the case.

Now, Smith is using grand-jury testimony, which often remains hidden at this stage of a case, and has drafted a massive document that ""contains all manner of damaging statements about a criminal defendant, made outside of a trial setting and without being subjected to the rules of evidence or cross-examination.""

In his words, ""If prosecutors bend their principles depending on the identity of their prey, then they've got no principles at all.""

In the unsealed filing, Smith told the court that Trump is not immune from the remaining allegations against him and laid out his case for why Trump ""must stand trial for his private crimes.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Justice Department for comment.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him by Smith."

Mike Kelly, R-Pa., on the upcoming Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania and the security changes following the first assassination attempt.

Elon Musk says he will ""be there to support"" Donald Trump on Saturday when the former president returns to Butler, Pennsylvania to hold a rally at the site where the first assassination attempt against him unfolded earlier this year.

The Republican presidential nominee is slated to speak on Oct. 5 at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds in the suburb north of Pittsburgh.

""I will be there to support!"" Musk wrote on X late Thursday in response to an image Trump shared promoting the upcoming event.

""Butler on Saturday - historic!"" Trump wrote on X alongside an image of him raising his fist that was taken on July 13, moments after he had been shot.

OBAMA TO CAMPAIGN FOR HARRIS IN PENNSYLVANIA, OTHER KEY STATES

Musk had said following that rally that ""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.""

Trump's campaign said last week that ""President Donald J. Trump will return to Butler, Pennsylvania, to hold a rally on the very same ground where he came within a quarter of an inch of losing his life less than three months ago.""

During a rally last Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump said that he wanted to return to the venue in Butler to ""finish our speech.""

""As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of... and the first case in Butler, Pennsylvania, great place, and we're going back to Butler,"" he said. ""We're going to go back and finish our speech.""

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

Trump's campaign said that the former president would honor those lost in the assassination attempt during the rally.

Corey Comperatore, 50, was a firefighter and a father of two daughters. He ""historically sacrificed his life to shield his wife and daughters"" during the assassination attempt against Trump, the campaign said.

Trump will also recognize the two other Americans who were wounded by the shooter, David Dutch and James Copenhaver.

""He will express his deep gratitude to law enforcement and first responders and thank the entire community for their outpouring of love and support in the wake of the attack,"" the campaign said.

""And when a shooter attacked our democracy and tried to end this movement, President Trump will return to the site, joined by tens of thousands of proud citizens, and together, they will celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before,"" his campaign added.

A Florida restaurant owner struggling to keep doors open in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic received a surprise message of support from former President Trump.

""I'd like to ask everybody to pitch in and help save Harry and the Natives. It's a special restaurant, a very special place. People love it. It's been around a long time. Like a really long time. But it's fallen prey to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's economy,"" Trump told owner Harry MacArthur in a pre-recorded message Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We have to keep the good ones open, especially when it comes to Florida. Florida is a very, very special place, and that's a very, very great restaurant. So Harry and the Natives, keep it going. We love it. And you're going to be around for a long time.""

'ECONOMY WAY BETTER UNDER TRUMP': BLACK VOTERS SHARE IF THEY WERE BETTER OFF 4 YEARS AGO

Co-host Steve Doocy hosted Friday's show from the packed restaurant in Hobe Sound after MacArthur wrote on Facebook he would have to shut down unless something changed by October 12.

The community, however, rallied behind MacArthur by supporting a GoFundMe set up by his son, Wyatt.

MacArthur called the response from Trump and the community ""overwhelming.""

""Turns out everybody cares,"" he said.

The restaurant has been in MacArthur's family for 72 years. Although the business was originally run by his parents, MacArthur reopened the business as Harry and the Natives after his father died in the 1980s.

MacArthur's business was close to bankruptcy in 2021, but after a ""Breakfast with Friends"" segment, the business was able to hold on. But the financial struggle was not over.

""It's like a nationwide thing. Family restaurants aren't going to be there.""

235,Trump teams up with former GOP nemesis to survey storm damage in key battleground state,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-teams-up-former-gop-nemesis-survey-storm-damage-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T15:58:43Z,"Army veteran Sara Snide joins 'America's Newsroom' to highlight the problems facing Americans in areas battered by Hurricane Helene as grocery prices skyrocket.

Former President Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will appear together on Friday for the first time in four years as they receive a briefing on recovery and relief efforts one week after Hurricane Helene tore a path of destruction after slamming into the southeast United States.

The former president and the popular two-term conservative Georgia governor are scheduled to be briefed on storm damage and to ""deliver remarks to the press"" as they team up during a visit to Evans, a town in the northeast portion of the state.

The event is not being described as a campaign stop.

For Trump, it's his second trip this week to Georgia, following a visit on Monday in Valdosta. The state, along with North and South Carolina, and Tennessee, took direct hits from the powerful storm. The death toll from Hurricane Helene now stands at over 220, with hundreds still missing, more than 800,000 people in seven states still without power or running water, and damage estimated in the billions.

TRUMP CLAIMS BIDEN, HARRIS, STORM RESPONSE IS INCOMPETENT

With Trump locked in a margin-of-error presidential race with Vice President Kamala Harris, and Georgia and North Carolina crucial battleground states, Trump has repeatedly slammed President Biden and Harris over their handing of the federal response to the storm.

""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,"" Trump claimed in a social media post on Thursday, as Biden spent a second straight day in the southeast surveying storm damage.

And Harris stopped in Georgia on Wednesday for storm briefings and to meet with local officials and victims of the storm, as she canceled a campaign swing in another key electoral state, Pennsylvania.

The vice president heads to North Carolina on Saturday to survey damage and get briefed on federal, state and local efforts.

When Trump visited Valdosta on Monday, he wasn't joined by Kemp, who was surveying storm damage in other parts of Georgia.

For two years after his 2020 election defeat to President Biden, which included a razor-thin loss in Georgia, Trump attacked Kemp for failing to overturn the election results in his state.

Trump urged, and then supported, a 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary challenge against Kemp by former Sen. David Perdue.

The former president toned down his criticism of the governor after Kemp crushed Perdue to easily win renomination on his way to re-election.

KEMP SAYS THERE'S NO PATH TO 270 FOR TRUMP WITHOUT GEORGIA

But in August, Trump went on a 10-minute tirade against Kemp at a rally in Atlanta just blocks from the Georgia State Capitol. He blamed the governor not only for failing to overturn the 2020 vote count but also for not stopping a county prosecutor from indicting the former president for his attempts to reverse the results.

""He's a bad guy. He's a disloyal guy. And he's a very average governor,"" Trump said. ""Little Brian. Little Brian Kemp. Bad guy.""

But just a couple of weeks later, in a major about face for Trump, the former president praised Kemp in a social media post ""for all of your help and support in Georgia, where a win is so important to the success of our Party and, most importantly, our Country.""

""I look forward to working with you, your team, and all of my friends in Georgia to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" the Republican presidential nominee added.

Trump's change of heart came amid a margin-of-error presidential race in Georgia.

The Peach State is one of seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and are likely to determine whether Harris or Trump succeeds the president in the White House.

Republican strategists agree that to recapture Georgia, Trump will need assistance from Kemp's well-oiled and funded political machine to turn out GOP voters.

Kemp emphasized in an exclusive national interview with Fox News Digital in August that ""there's no path for former President Trump to win or any Republican . . . to get to 270 [electoral votes] without Georgia.""

The governor said his state ""should be one that we win if we have all the mechanics that we need. And I'm working hard to help provide those in a lot of ways and turn the Republican vote out.""

""It's my belief that we cannot afford four more years of [President] Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris and [Minnesota Gov.] Tim Walz, which I think would probably be worse than even Biden and Harris were,"" Kemp said.

Kemp also told Fox News at the time that Trump's tirade from early August ""was a small distraction that's in the past"" and emphasized that Republicans ""need to stay focused on the future. . . . We need to be telling people why they should vote for us, what we're going to do to make things better than they are right now. And there's a host of issues that I think you could contrast Kamala Harris and her record."""
236,'It makes no sense': Jordan says FBI stonewalling requests for briefing on Iran hack of Trump campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/it-makes-no-sense-jordan-says-fbi-stonewalling-requests-briefing-iran-hack-trump-campaign,2024-10-04T15:36:44Z,"EXCLUSIVE: The FBI is refusing to give the House Judiciary Committee a briefing on Iran's hack of the Trump campaign and other key issues, Chairman Jim Jordan told Fox News Digital, saying that the American people deserve to have the information before Election Day.

Jordan, R-Ohio, spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital and said that he and his committee have been seeking a briefing in an unclassified setting to obtain information relating to Iran's hack of the Trump campaign, and whether the former president and his team had been given a defensive briefing on the matter.

The FBI has told Fox News Digital that it is committed to working with the committee but did not say if or when officials would brief Jordan.

""This hacking of the Trump campaign by Iran -- it looks like there was a dossier on JD Vance -- that dossier winds up at the Harris campaign, and somehow, it happens to wind up in the press,"" Jordan said. ""There are lots of questions, like when did you find out about this? How did you find out about this? Did you give Trump a defensive briefing? Who was the person in the Harris campaign who got the information? How did they get the information? When did they tell you they had the information? How did it then get to the press?""

HOUSE JUDICIARY INVESTIGATING DOJ FOR RELEASE OF ROUTH MANIFESTO OFFERING $150K TRUMP BOUNTY

Jordan said, ""Those are just questions off the top of my head.""

""It makes no sense, because we know if everything were reversed and the Iranians hacked the Harris campaign and there was a dossier on Tim Walz that winded up in the Trump campaign and then in the press, we know that they would all be going crazy,"" Jordan said. ""There would probably already be a special counsel.""

Jordan also pointed to the fact that the hack was taken by an adversarial nation -- Iran.

""This is the same country that says they are trying to assassinate President Trump. This is the same country who is the chief sponsor of terrorism. This is the same country that wants to assassinate [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu. And this is the same country who just sent rockets to our best ally -- ballistic missiles to our best ally -- the State of Israel,"" Jordan said. ""And we want to be briefed on this hacking, and they won't do it.""

The Trump campaign said that the documents had been obtained ""illegally from sources hostile to the United States,"" who ""intended to interfere in the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process.""

IRAN IS 'INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE' IN ITS OPERATIONS TO TARGET US PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS: INTEL COMMUNITY

The hack by Iran came ""after recent reports of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump around the same time as the Butler, PA tragedy.""

The documents were sent to Politico and included a 271-page ""dossier"" that the Trump campaign had put together on his eventual running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, that dated back to February, the outlet said.

It included Vance's past stances on issues, statements and previous criticisms of Trump in a section called ""POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES.""

Meanwhile, Jordan also said his committee has other questions relating to Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, including why the Justice Department released the ""bounty letter"" from the second attempted assassin, Ryan Routh, who offered $150,000 to someone who could ""complete the job"" against Trump if he were to fail.

The DOJ, in a court filing last month, released Routh's letter as evidence in a detention memo by the Justice Department in an effort to ensure Routh's detention.

DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES NOT DENY FBI INFORMANTS WERE AMONG JAN 6 CROWD

Jordan also told Fox News Digital he wants information from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who testified last week that he would include in his highly anticipated report on Jan. 6, 2021 details about confidential human sources from the FBI and whether they had been embedded in the mob during the Capitol riot.

During the hearing last week, Horowitz was asked whether he would ""expose that there were confidential human sources at the Capitol"" on Jan. 6, and ""how many went into the Capitol?""

Horowitz replied, ""I'll have that information in the report.""

Horowitz, though, indicated his report would not be made public until after Election Day.

""Well, for goodness' sake, it's been four years,"" Jordan said. ""Why not give us that information now, right?""

But Jordan said that ""the FBI will not sit down with the committee.""

Jordan stressed that the House Judiciary Committee is ""the authorizing committee for the Justice Department.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS WERE HACKED, INCLUDING VANCE 'DOSSIER,' BY FOREIGN SOURCES

""They will not sit down and talk with our committee, and it's ridiculous,"" Jordan said. ""This is important information for the American people to know before a consequential election.""

Fox News Digital has learned that representatives for the House Judiciary Committee began requesting the briefing during a phone call on Sept. 24 with the FBI. The committee then had two phone calls on Sept. 25 with the FBI requesting a briefing, a call with the Justice Department on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing, and two calls with the FBI on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing.

A source said representatives of the committee also left a voicemail for the FBI on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing and had a call with the FBI again on Oct. 2.

An FBI spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the bureau ""has continually demonstrated its commitment to working with the Committee to accommodate its requests, and we have provided numerous documents and briefings.""

""The FBI recognizes the importance of congressional oversight and remains committed to cooperating with the Committee in good faith,"" the FBI spokesperson said.

But that cooperation has not met Jordan's requests, the chairman said, and warned that all options are on the table.

""We have done more than 100 subpoenas this Congress, so every option is on the table for us to try to get the information that we believe the American people are entitled to have before making a decision, as I said, in an election that is so consequential,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital.

""We've got important questions about important issues that impact our country and one of the major candidates for political office,"" he said. ""Give us the briefing, for goodness' sake. Answer our questions."""

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

Musk had said following that rally that ""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.""

Trump's campaign said last week that ""President Donald J. Trump will return to Butler, Pennsylvania, to hold a rally on the very same ground where he came within a quarter of an inch of losing his life less than three months ago.""

During a rally last Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump said that he wanted to return to the venue in Butler to ""finish our speech.""

Corey Comperatore, 50, was a firefighter and a father of two daughters. He ""historically sacrificed his life to shield his wife and daughters"" during the assassination attempt against Trump, the campaign said.

Trump will also recognize the two other Americans who were wounded by the shooter, David Dutch and James Copenhaver.

""He will express his deep gratitude to law enforcement and first responders and thank the entire community for their outpouring of love and support in the wake of the attack,"" the campaign said.

Former President Donald Trump let loose on former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney following her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris.

Citing her historic defeat by a 2-to-1 margin in 2022 -- and the controversial leadership of her father, Vice President Dick Cheney, during the U.S. invasion of the Middle East -- Trump called the former Wyoming Republican a ""low IQ war hawk.""

""Liz Cheney lost her Congressional Seat by the largest margin in the history of Congress for a sitting Representative. The people of Wyoming are really smart!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY

He continued, ""She is a low IQ War Hawk that, as a member of the J6 Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs, ILLEGALLY DESTROYED & DELETED all documents, information, and evidence.""

Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot on the U.S. Capitol vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

The former representative campaigned for Harris in battleground Wisconsin on Thursday -- pushing a message of unity against their mutual enemy's campaign to return to the Oval Office.

The campaign event took place in Ripon, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

Trump's social media remarks lumped together Liz Cheney and her former vice president father -- who has also endorsed Harris -- writing them off as ""two fools"" who are ""suffering gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

""Her father, Dick, was a leader of our ridiculous journey into the Middle East, where Trillions of Dollars were spent, millions of people were killed - and for what? NOTHING!

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before: a former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.""

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What January 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney said.

Former Trump administration staffer Cassidy Hutchison - who testified against her former boss in the Jan. 6 Committee hearings - as well as Trump's former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews will be part of the event that is meant to help deliver the swing state to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

(Courtesy: CrimeCon)

Kim Kardashian believes the Menendez brothers should be freed from prison.

The reality star is the latest person to weigh in on the controversial pair of convicted murderers.

Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing new evidence to determine whether the siblings should be serving life sentences for killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion more than 35 years ago, the city's district attorney said on Thursday.

The case is being highlighted in a new Netflix scripted series and an upcoming documentary.

""You think you know the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez,"" Kardashian wrote in her opinion essay for NBC News published on Thursday. ""I certainly thought I did.""

""In 1989, the brothers, aged 21 and 18, respectively, viciously shot and killed their parents in their Beverly Hills home,"" she wrote. ""In 1996, after two trials, they were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. As is often the case, this story is much more complex than it appears on the surface.""

Kardashian is a prison reform advocate who previously worked with the Trump White House to reduce sentences for several convicts found guilty of non-violent offenses. She also spoke at the White House earlier this year about criminal justice.

The mother of four centered the argument in her essay mainly on the brothers' claims that they were emotionally, physically and sexually abused by their parents and feared for their lives.

MENENDEZ BROTHER, WHO GUNNED DOWN PARENTS, SLAMS NEW SHOW FOR 'DISHONEST PORTRAYAL'

""Following years of abuse and a real fear for their lives, Erik and Lyle chose what they thought at the time was their only way out -- an unimaginable way to escape their living nightmare,"" Kardashian wrote.

She said that after the jury was deadlocked in their first trial, the judge decided many of their abuse claims were inadmissible in the second trial.

""Their only way out of prison now is death,"" Kardashian said, writing that their first televised trial became ""entertainment for the nation,"" and that they were portrayed as ""monsters and sensationalized eye candy"" by the media, ""two arrogant, rich kids from Beverly Hills who killed their parents out of greed.""

""There was no room for empathy, let alone sympathy,"" she noted.

""Following years of abuse and a real fear for their lives, Erik and Lyle chose what they thought at the time was their only way out -- an unimaginable way to escape their living nightmare.""

-- Kim Kardashian

DO MENENDEZ BROTHERS STAND A CHANCE AT FREEDOM?

""Erik and Lyle had no chance of a fair trial against this backdrop,"" the 43-year-old claimed, adding that there was a stigma on male victims of sexual abuse at the time.

""Can anyone honestly deny that the justice system would have treated the Menendez sisters more leniently?"" she postulated, adding, ""Many people believe the crimes the brothers committed are unforgivable -- but what about the decades of alleged abuse they suffered as children?""

FOX NATION SPECIAL: 'MENENDEZ BROTHERS: VICTIMS OR VILLAINS

She said she had recently spent time with the brothers, who she said have ""exemplary disciplinary records"" in prison.

They ""are not monsters. They are kind, intelligent, and honest men,"" she argued.

Kardashian also said that one of the prison wardens told her he would be comfortable having the brothers as neighbors.

While Kardashian called the murders of their parents ""inexcusable,"" she said the brothers were treated more like ""serial killers"" than two men who had ""endured years of sexual abuse by the very people they loved and trusted.""

She added, ""I don't believe that spending their entire natural lives incarcerated was the right punishment for this complex case. Had this crime been committed and trialed today, I believe the outcome would have been dramatically different.

""I also strongly believe that they were denied a fair second trial and that the exclusion of crucial abuse evidence denied Erik and Lyle the opportunity to fully present their case, further undermining the fairness of their conviction.""

However, not everyone agrees with Kardashian's assessment.

""If they were brought to trial again today, they would be found guilty,"" Clark Fogg, a retired senior forensic specialist with the Beverly Hills Police Department who investigated the murders, told Fox News Digital this week.

Fogg believes the brothers' motive for the murders had to do with ""greed and money.""

""Why did they even have to kill their mom in the first place?"" Fogg said. ""If you killed Mr. Menendez separately from her, she would end up getting the inheritance, right? So they had to eliminate both of them in order to have the inheritance.""

Fogg investigated the Menendez brothers' case in 1989. He took photos and preserved evidence at the crime scene, attended the autopsies and took the stand during both trials.

When speaking with Fox News Digital, he painted a horrific picture of the crime scene.

""One of the detectives had to actually hold a golf umbrella over my head as I was taking photos because, every so often, things would be falling from the ceiling,"" Fogg said.

""It comes down to one thing. The reason why they're in jail is that they killed their mother and father brutally, not poison them, but shotgun them to death to a point that they were all over the ceiling. ... That's how brutally they were murdered.""

Fogg said it appeared their mother was trying to escape when she was killed because there was blood on the soles of her shoes.

""Even at that point, they kept on killing her with... gunshot blasts, one after another,"" he told Fox News Digital."

Former President Obama is preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for Vice President Harris, focusing on key battleground states in the lead up to Election Day, according to a senior campaign official with anonymity to discuss the matter.

Obama, who served back-to-back terms as president from 2009 through 2017, will kick off his drive in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania on Thursday, a state which remains one of the tightest contests in the nation and which could tip the scales for either candidate.

A Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters last week found Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. President Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes in 2020.

'GOING TO BE A CLOSE ONE:' DETROITERS REVEAL IF THE CITY IS LEANING TOWARDS HARRIS OR TRUMP

Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Harris for president in July, five days after President Biden ended his 2024 re-election in a blockbuster announcement.

The 44th president then stumped for Harris at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, saying she ""is ready for the job.""

""It's up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in,"" Obama said. ""And make no mistake: It will be a fight.""

""This is a person who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a champion. Kamala wasn't born into privilege. She had to work for what she's got, and she actually cares about what other people are going through.""

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP IS MAKING GAINS WITH YOUNGER VOTERS

Harris and Obama's friendship goes back 20 years to when they met on the campaign trail while he was running for Senate in Illinois, the senior campaign official says. Harris was an early supporter of his 2008 presidential campaign and even knocked doors for him in Iowa ahead of the caucus, per the official.

Last month, Former President Obama headlined a fundraiser for Harris that raised $4 million, per The Washington Post. His fundraising efforts so far on her behalf -- fundraising content and events that feature him -- have raised $76 million, per the outlet.

Harris' campaign is headed by Jen O'Malley Dillon Harris, a veteran of Obama's two campaigns who also managed President Biden's 2020 campaign and built his 2024 operation from the White House.

Other former Obama advisers on the Harris team, include David Plouffe, who was manager of Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 and a senior aide during his 2012 re-election victory.

Springsteen later provided a voiceover as well as his song ""My Hometown"" for a pro-Joe Biden ad.

""We are rudderless and joyless. We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great.

246,6 ways Iran could strike US in the Mideast or here at home,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/6-ways-iran-could-strike-us-mideast-here-home,2024-10-04T11:10:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran's terror goons are in crisis mode right now. Having seen their missile attack on Israel fail yet again due to Israel's powerful defenses, Iran is now expecting an Israeli counterstrike.

""There will be severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday, October 1. All the G7 nations agree Israel has the right to strike back, President Joe Biden added Wednesday.

Iran wants blood. But they are running out of options. More than 40,000 U.S. forces were already deployed to U.S. Central Command in the Middle East, in locations from Syria to the Red Sea. Three more squadrons of F-15Es, F-16s and A-10s are on the way to U.S. Central Command, joining stealth F-22s, F-35s and others already in the region.

TRUMP SAYS IRANIAN PRESIDENT BEING GUARDED AT UN WHILE PLOTTING ASSASSINATION 'A STRANGE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES'

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is launching jets day and night and the USS Wasp, with a Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, is in the eastern Mediterranean. The submarine USS Georgia, carrying 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, is nearby too, along with a bevy of U.S. Navy destroyers.

Make no mistake. This is enough firepower to hit many types of Iranian targets. Guarantee you, Iran's military units are scrambling to prepare. While being very, very careful about using cellphones.

Whatever action comes will aim to weaken and contain Iran. Iran's proxies Hamas and Hezbollah have been mauled. But this conflict won't be over as long as the ayatollah holds power over Iran's people. That gang has been in the ideology and terror business for almost 50 years and won't go quietly.

Look for desperate Iran to consider six moves - including two here in the USA.

Already in massive violation of the United Nations inspection regime, Iran proclaimed in July they would install more than 1,400 centrifuges at the underground Fordow facility. ""Iran has managed to reach a point where it can not only produce nuclear weapons on-demand but produce large quantities of WGU [weapons-grade uranium] quickly in a very hard-to-destroy enrichment plant,"" expert David Albright noted. The best case is that Iran's new president wants more enriched uranium as a bargaining chip. The worst case is rapid production of three to five nuclear warheads.

Many of the recent deployments directed by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are beefing up security against direct attacks from Iran, like the January 2020 ballistic missile attack on U.S. personnel at a base in Iraq. U.S. outposts will be on guard against attempted strikes by Iran-backed militia.

The Houthis, supplied by Iran, will continue to menace Red Sea shipping. Iran has also been working a deal for Russia to supply upgraded P-800 ""Oniks"" anti-ship missiles to the Houthis.

Even after tactical failures on Apr. 13 and Oct. 1, more missile attacks from Iran remain a concern. Fortunately, U.S. Navy destroyers USS Cole and USS Bulkeley fired interceptors from the eastern Mediterranean against Iran's attack. This is sweet vengeance for the USS Cole, nearly sunk by al Qaeda terrorists in Yemen in 2000, with the loss of 17 sailors killed and 37 wounded.

Beyond this, U.S. Central Command is massing a powerful defensive and offensive force starting to serve a new deterrent role. Should Iran field nuclear weapons, this is the type of force array that will be necessary to deter their attacks. Iran's leaders must get the message that any nuclear-armed missiles they may build in the future won't get through.

Two more threats from Iran could aim directly at the U.S.

The FBI says threat indicators are spiking. In early September, the FBI warned Iran is targeting hospitals and healthcare in the US. Don't forget Iran almost opened the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye, New York back in 2013; by chance, the sluice gate was offline for maintenance. A 2023 bulletin from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps group ""CyberAv3ngers"" is still targeting wastewater management systems. Who knows what cyber tricks Iran may have learned from Russia.

The Director of National Intelligence has briefed former President and Republican nominee Donald J. Trump on ""real and specific threats"" to assassinate him. ""I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before,"" Trump posted on Truth Social last week. Sadly, violence against American leaders fits Iran's playbook.

Be assured the U.S. and allies are prepared to counter every one of these options.

Former President Trump will headline the National Rifle Association's (NRA) Defend the 2nd event in Savannah, Georgia, Oct. 22, the organization announced Friday morning.

""This election is a pivotal one for America's gun owners. Kamala Harris and her far-left allies have big plans to erode Second Amendment protections,"" NRA Vice President and CEO Doug Hamlin said in a statement.

""Donald J. Trump has proven himself a fighter for Americans' right to keep and bear arms. We are excited to have him speak at our Defend the 2nd event and to support his return to the White House in January.""

Earlier this year, the NRA endorsed Trump in his presidential campaign. Trump also spoke at the NRA's convention in May.

The NRA has been ramping up its attacks on certain Democratic candidates who are softer on gun owners' rights. Ohio is the second state the NRA Political Victory Fund has targeted this election cycle. Last month, the gun group launched a major radio campaign against vulnerable Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.

The International Association of Fire Fighters' (IAFF) decision not to endorse a candidate this year was seen as ""another blow"" to the Harris campaign's bid to retain working class voters.

""Today, the IAFF Executive Board, by a margin of 1.2%, voted to not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election,"" a statement from the IAFF read Thursday.

The IAFF added, ""The IAFF Executive Board determined that we are better able to advocate for our members and make progress on the issues that matter to them if we, as a union, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. This decision, which we took seriously, is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity.""

Because the union had endorsed President Biden in 2020, this was seen by many as a win for Trump and a failure for Harris.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

""Translation... The IAFF firefighters endorse Trump!"" New Hampshire state Rep. Fred Doucette exclaimed.

GRV Strategies founder Garrett Ventry wrote, ""Another blow to Harris. She failed to get the Teamsters endorsement as well. The Biden 2020 [coalition] is falling apart for her.""

""Kamala loses the unions, gains the Cheneys. It's like she's trying to hemorrhage working and middle class voters,"" Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller joked.

Politico senior political columnist Jonathan Martin wrote, ""Building trades adjacent...Just adds pressure on Kamala to build on Biden's college+ support.""

""Similar to the Teamsters non-endorsement. This is another huge win for Trump!"" Townhall.com columnist Dustin Grage commented.

NBC News senior national political reporter Henry J. Gomez reported, ""Significant non-endorsement here, given how huge IAFF was for Biden four years ago. Tim Walz spoke at their convention last month -- and so did Republican VP nominee JD Vance.""

""CRUSHING DEFEAT FOR CROOKED LYIN' KAMALA HARRIS! When is the last time that NEITHER the Teamsters nor the IAFF endorsed the Democrat nominee???"" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller asked.

The IAFF has primarily supported Democratic presidential candidates in the past and was the first major union to endorse Biden in 2019. Prior to this year, the IAFF had only withheld their endorsement in 2016, when it did not commit to supporting either Hillary Clinton or Trump.

This announcement came weeks after the Teamsters, another major union, declined to support a 2024 presidential candidate. It was the first time the union had not endorsed a candidate since 1996 after largely supporting Democrats.

Despite not backing a candidate, a Teamsters poll found that nearly 60% of union members supported Trump."

Fox News Digital spoke with Detroit, Michigan, residents about the political pulse in the city as Election Day nears in the crucial swing state.

""It got to be Trump for the whole city,"" Keandre, an east-side Detroit resident, told Fox News Digital. ""They are all voting Trump.""

One resident of St. Clair Shores in Macomb County said that he thinks the support for former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is split.

""People on both sides. It's going to be a close one,"" Tom said.

Two other Detroit natives who spoke to Fox News Digital supported Harris.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP IS MAKING GAINS WITH YOUNGER VOTERS

""All my friends that are Trumpers only think about themselves and we have to think about the world,"" Ron said.

""I really like Kamala Harris because she's got a lot more compassion. It's not about yourself. It's about everybody,"" he explained further.

""I think it's time for history to be made,"" Mandela said.

""I just think that it's going to be a woman president,"" he added.

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%.

Hillary Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016 despite consistently leading in the polls there, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988. Joe Biden won the state in 2020.

The Trump and Harris campaigns have prioritized Blue Wall states in campaign stops throughout the summer. Trump's 2016 victory was powered by his surprise wins in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which all had lengthy Democratic winning streaks until then. The winners of the past four elections have won the three states.

Michigan residents also weighed in on which presidential candidate they think would be a stronger leader.

Mandela admitted he thought it was Trump despite his support for Harris.

""I think Trump is [stronger] because I think that Trump is not going to let anybody run over us,"" he said.

When asked who was the stronger leader, Keandre said it was Harris.

251,"New poll reveals Trump has significant lead on immigration, border security in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-trump-significant-lead-immigration-border-security-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T08:09:41Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

""He picked up the phone and calls some friends in Congress and said, stop the bill. Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,"" she said. ""And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games."""

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience, as she formally endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self - a true patriot.""

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership.

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming by a candidate that was backed by Trump.

At a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, Cheney announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election. Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What Jan. 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney claimed.

WHAT THE LATEST POLL IN BATTLEGROUND WISCONSIN SHOWS

Harris, speaking after Cheney, highlighted that ""anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has....must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.""

And Harris emphasized that ""I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.

Cheney was not always a fan of Harris.

The Trump campaign on Thursday repeatedly pointed to a social media post by Cheney during the 2000 election where she argued that ""@KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America.""

Trump, speaking with Fox News' Bill Melugin during a rally in Michigan on Thursday, said that Cheney was ""terrible"" and ""a stupid warhawk. All she wants to do is shoot missiles at people.""

On Cheney's backing of Harris, Trump argued ""I think they hurt each other. I think they're so bad, both of them.""

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states."

Trump attorneys filed a memo Thursday in support of their motion to dismiss all charges brought against the former president by Special Counsel Jack Smith, discussing the Supreme Court's recent decision in Fischer v. United States, which they believe further supports their argument to dismiss the obstruction charges.

The filing Thursday comes as Trump attorneys are using two blockbuster Supreme Court decisions -- United States v. Trump, which dealt with presidential immunity, and United States v. Fischer, which dealt with obstruction -- to attack the legal theories pressed by Special Counsel Jack Smith.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL'S ELECTION CASE AGAINST TRUMP

Trump attorneys filed a motion to dismiss all charges brought against the former president by Smith last year, but the case was stayed. The filing Thursday is a reply brief to their motion seeking dismissal of all charges.

Trump attorneys in their brief on Thursday said Smith's superseding indictment against the former president, which was filed after the Supreme Court ruled that presidents and former presidents had immunity from official acts, ""seeks to assign blame for events President Trump did not control and took action to protect against.""

""The Special Counsel blatantly ignores the fact that federal prosecutors have taken the opposite position in this District,"" the filing states. ""It is apparently of no consequence, to the Office and those who support their efforts, that former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was caught on a previously undisclosed video accepting 'responsibility' for the events at the Capitol.""

Trump attorneys also argue that General Mark Milley acknowledged, ""long before charges were brought in this case"" that Trump ""had instructed the Defense Department on January 3, 2021 to 'make sure that you have sufficient National Guard or Soldiers to make sure it is a safe event.""

TRUMP BLASTS DOJ FOR 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE,' CALLS JACK SMITH CASE A 'SCAM' AFTER JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING

Trump was charged with count 1: conspiracy to defraud the United States; count 2: conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; count 3: obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and count 4: conspiracy against rights.

Trump attorneys, though, stressed that Smith and federal prosecutors ""cannot ignore or hide from"" new precedent from the Supreme Court's decision in Fischer v. United States, saying it is ""another key application of the rule of law to reject lawfare overreach targeting President Trump.""

""Fischer requires the dismissal of Counts Two and Three of the Superseding Indictment, and its logic fatally undermines Counts One and Four as well,"" the filing states.

U.S. v. Fischer stems from a lawsuit filed by Joseph Fischer -- one of more than 300 people charged by the Justice Department with ""obstruction of an official proceeding"" in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. His lawyers argued that the federal statute should not apply, and that it had only ever been applied to evidence-tampering cases.

The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a participant in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot who challenged his conviction for a federal ""obstruction"" crime.

In a 6-3 decision, the high court held to a narrower interpretation of a federal statute that imposes criminal liability on anyone who corruptly ""alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.""

The ruling reverses a lower court decision, which the high court said swept too broadly into areas like peaceful but disruptive conduct, and returns the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, who will have the opportunity to reassess the case with Friday's ruling in mind.

SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT PARTICIPANT WHO CHALLENGED OBSTRUCTION CONVICTION

""Under Fischer, the Office [of Special Counsel] may not use the statute as a catchall provision to criminalize otherwise-lawful activities selectively mischaracterized as obstructive by those with opposing political views,"" the filing states, noting that the Fischer decision ""requires proof of evidence impairment coupled with corrupt intent.""

""Once stripped of President Trump's official acts subject to immunity and protected First Amendment political advocacy, the Superseding Indictment lacks sufficient factual allegations to support either element as required by Counts Two and Three,"" Trump attorneys argue. ""President Trump expressed sincere and valid concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election pursuant to his authority as the Chief Executive.""

Trump attorneys said Trump was ""part of open, public discussion regarding use of contingent slates of electors in a manner consistent with historical practice and contemplated by the then-existing version of the Electoral Count Act.""

""The congressional record from January 6 reflects lawful debates on certificate objections contemplated by the ECA, as well as acknowledgment of the historical precedent for the contingent slates,"" they argued. ""There is no precedent for a criminal prosecution based on such a record.""

Trump attorneys said Smith's office ""cannot establish the required nexus between alleged obstruction and any 'evidence' used in the certification proceeding, or that anyone acted with corrupt intent.""

TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY

Trump attorneys also said the Fischer decision ""forecloses the Office's efforts to rely on events at the Capitol on January 6 to support charges."" They said the ""superseding indictment does not sufficiently allege that President Trump impaired, or intended to impair, the integrity or availability of any document or other object used in any official proceeding.""

Meanwhile, when the Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts, Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the Supreme Court ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court's ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the new indictment as well.

Last month, Chutkan said she would not hold the trial for Trump on charges stemming from Smith's Jan. 6 investigation until after the 2024 presidential election. She set deadlines for replies and paperwork from federal prosecutors and Trump's legal team for Nov. 7 -- after Election Day."

Eleven family members of the 13 American troops killed at Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan also signed the letter, which praised Trump's foreign policy record in contrast to Biden's controversial actions.

""When President Trump took office, the war in Afghanistan had dragged on for almost 16 years. By February 2020, a peace agreement was reached, ensuring no American soldier was killed in combat until the end of the Trump Administration. This agreement held strong because the Taliban understood President Trump's resolve and U.S. forces were prepared to ensure their compliance,"" the letter reads.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan under the Biden-Harris Administration in 2021, led to the unnecessary deaths of thirteen brave American troops at Abbey Gate and left untold billions of dollars of high grade military equipment to the Taliban, making it the most well-armed terror organization in the world.""

Additionally, 40 retired U.S. ambassadors, 75 retired senior military officers and several hundred officials from previous Republican administrations signed the letter, praising Trump's diplomatic efforts on cease-fire agreements between Turkey and Kurdish fighters in Syria and the Abraham Accords. The letter refers to Trump as a ""peacemaker.""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""Securing peace is in the greatest tradition of American foreign policy and the Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation was founded,"" the letter continues before quoting from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew. ""Jesus said, 'blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be sons of God.' (Matthew 5:9) Such is the legacy of the Trump Administration.""

Writing on X, O'Brien said he was ""honored"" to join his colleagues from the Trump administration in ""supporting a return to a 'peace through strength' foreign policy under President Trump.""

Another signatory, Dr. Jerry Hendrix, former director of the Secretary of the Navy's Advisory Panel, said it ""wasn't a hard decision"" to attach his name to the letter.

""Trump had 1 of the more successful foreign policy presidencies since the Cold War,"" Hendrix wrote on X. ""He ended sequestration. He invested in the Navy. The Biden-Harris admin has been one foreign policy debacle after another.""

Tim Walz attempts to clarify remarks he made about being in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 pro-democracy protests during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., has been called out so many times for false claims, one news outlet warned it may unravel his public image.

CBS debate moderators confronted the governor during his vice presidential debate with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tuesday regarding Walz's claim that he had been in Hong Kong in May 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August, a few months later.

Politico observed this is part of a history of factual inaccuracies Walz has told about his past, in an article headlined, ""Tim Walz has a tendency to misspeak. It may haunt the campaign.""

""Since being tapped as Kamala Harris' running mate, the folksy, plain-speaking Minnesota governor has had to explain a growing number of inaccurate statements -- and at times embellishments -- about his past,"" Politico's Meredith Lee Hill and Mia McCarthy wrote. ""They range from comments about his military service to his visit to Hong Kong more than three decades ago to clarifying that his family didn't specifically use in vitro fertilization.""

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT TELLS DR. PHIL HE SAW 'PANIC' ON WALZ'S FACE DURING KEY DEBATE MOMENT

""It's unclear whether Walz's verbal errors will undercut his credibility with voters. But the need to continually clean up those claims could politically hurt Walz and Harris, who are locked in a tight race with Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" the reporters added.

""And in some cases, key members of Harris' circle weren't aware of some of the inaccurate statements until they became public despite the vetting process, according to four people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.""

The writers said, ""Walz's misstatements could contradict the image that the campaign has painted of him as an upstanding, everyday Midwest guy.""

During the debate, Walz responded to a question about his Tiananmen Square claim by speaking about how he ""grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies 'til the streetlights come on,"" then described joining the National Guard and becoming a teacher. He glossed over his trips to China but acknowledged, ""I've not been perfect, I'm a knucklehead at times.""

When confronted again by one of the moderators for not answering the question, he conceded he ""misspoke"" about the Tiananmen timeline.

The day after the debate, Walz told reporters during a campaign stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ""Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989... I speak like everybody else speaks. I need to be clearer.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

A spokesperson for the campaign defended Walz's record to Politico, noting he ""cares deeply about democracy.""

""As the governor has said, he sometimes misspeaks. He speaks like a normal person and speaks passionately about issues he cares deeply about, including democracy and stopping gun violence in our school,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said, adding former President Trump and Vance ""repeatedly lie and mislead about their plan to ban abortion nationwide"" and other topics."

A federal judge on Wednesday unsealed a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith's updated election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing, in which Smith argues that Trump is not immune from prosecution for his alleged criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith submitted the document after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" Smith wrote. ""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role."" ...Read more

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

PRO-LIFERS BLAST TRUMP 'BETRAYAL' WITH SHIFTING ABORTION STANCE, ANSWER ON FLORIDA AMENDMENT 4

Lila Rose, founder of leading pro-life advocacy group Live Action, also responded to a promotional video Melania posted for her memoir in which she states, ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard... what does my body my choice really mean?""

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

President of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, wrote on X: ""The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.""

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

Trump has also said he opposes a nationwide abortion ban and the GOP's official platform softened its language about its abortion stances this year.

A federal judge ruled in favor of a southern border rancher who had argued that the Biden administration had violated environmental law in it's ""haste to reverse its predecessor's border policies"" in 2021.

An Arizona rancher, Steven Smith, was part of the lawsuit, Massachusetts Coalition for Immigration Reform et al. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, challenging the Biden administration. The suit claimed that the Department of Homeland Security had failed to conduct a mandatory review required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) before halting border wall construction, a key Trump-era project.

Under NEPA, a federal agency must conduct an Environmental Assessment to determine whether a federal action has the potential to cause significant effects on the human environment, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

After a two-day bench trial, Judge Trevor McFadden of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling on Friday that Smith ""suffered concrete and particularized injuries"" as a result of DHS not meeting the requirements of NEPA.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH 'TERRORISM TIES' WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT BORDER, HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT WARNS

The Trump-appointed judge also concluded that the actions taken by DHS, such as ending the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, resulted in indirect effects relating to population growth.

Smith testified that migrant activity on his ranch had ""dramatically increased"" after President Joe Biden was elected, and that he had begun seeing illegal immigrants on his property multiple times a month and finds trash on a daily basis.

Smith claimed that the trash left by the migrants has had negative impacts on the environment, as well as on his own cattle, which were eating the litter.

GAETZ TO INTRODUCE BILL CUTTING OFF FEDERAL AID TO GROUPS HELPING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ENTER US

The rancher also testified that water for cattle and other wildlife was a very scarce resource and that migrants were taking it from a trough on his land. According to court documents: ""While this may aid thirsty trespassers, it causes Smith to lose 'thousands and thousands of gallons of water,' which 'can take [him] days and days and days to regain.""

The judge ruled that Smith, a Cochise County resident, ""suffered tangible harms"" caused by the migrant crisis and is entitled to relief after illegal immigrants ""trespassed onto his land, stole his water, and trashed his property.""

""At trial, Smith proved as a matter of fact that his harms traced to migrants who reacted predictably to DHS's decisions,"" the ruling reads."

Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate offered a refreshing change from the combative tone that has plagued our political discourse over the past eight years.

For many viewers, it was a relief to witness a civil exchange between two candidates who, surprisingly, seemed to respect one another. Sen. JD Vance showcased his skills as both an orator and debater, garnering a more favorable opinion from many voters.

On the other hand, Gov. Tim Walz, while appearing somewhat nervous and lackluster, managed to connect with viewers through his likability and relatability. The unfortunate reality, however, is that neither candidate did enough to change any votes.

VANCE VS. WALZ DEBATE LEAVES AMERICANS WITH THIS BIG TAKEAWAY

So, what can we take away from this debate?

Despite various pundits highlighting the strengths of the two vice presidential candidates, Tuesday night's debate ultimately had little impact on undecided voters. While Walz's performance had its successes, his nervous start and notable gaffes left much to be desired. In the end, both candidates offered a little something for everyone -- but for those still weighing their options, there were no compelling reasons to change their minds.

As we approach the final stretch of the presidential election, the challenge for both candidates and their running mates is clear: how can they win over undecided voters in just 33 days? The answer lies in two crucial areas:

Given the current economic climate, this task may be easier for former President Donald Trump, especially in light of the anticipated repercussions from the port strike and escalating energy prices due to turmoil in the Middle East.

That there is a leader in office who has their backs. Voters are understandably anxious about the future, and both candidates have already tapped into this concern -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz highlighting the threats to democracy and Trump and Vance focused on the difficulties we face with the economy and immigration.

Yet, what Americans urgently need now is assurance: a promise that if they cast their vote for the right candidate, life will improve once again. In turbulent times marked by international conflicts, rising prices, and the aftermath of natural disasters, that message of hope and stability is not just important; it is essential.

As the clock ticks down to Election Day, the ability to inspire confidence and reassure voters will determine the next leader of this nation."

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff denied the veracity of a Daily Mail report in which three unnamed sources accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival.

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

The Daily Mail's exclusive story on Tuesday quoted a trio of unidentified sources who claim Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend while the couple waited in a valet line following an event in Nice, France, in 2012. The alleged altercation was purportedly sparked when the woman - identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane"" and described as a successful New York attorney - flirted with a valet, according to the article.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News.

Several media outlets, including Semafor, noted they had been unable to match the Daily Mail's reporting and legacy media companies such as the New York Times have yet to report on the claims.

The Daily Mail's article hinged on the recollections of three people described as being Jane's friends. The outlet said its sources requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from Emhoff. The three friends reportedly provided the outlet with a photo of the pair when they were still a couple, as well as itineraries and correspondence between Emhoff and Jane to substantiate that they made the trip to France in May 2012.

One of the sources is described by the Daily Mail as a female New York attorney who learned about the alleged incident from Jane.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend, described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman, told the outlet Jane called him sobbing following the alleged incident.

PROGRESSIVE WOMEN'S GROUPS SILENT ON SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUG EMHOFF'S AFFAIR

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

The male friend said he learned more details about the alleged episode after the initial phone call.

""It was something like 3 a.m. They were trying to get out of there and they both had been drinking. There was a gigantic line for taxis,"" he told the outlet. ""She went up to one of the valet guys, offered him 100 euros or whatever, to get to the head of the line. She told me she put her hand on his shoulder. Doug apparently thought that she was flirting, and came over and slapped her in the face.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

""[She] is a gorgeous, strong woman and you would never expect somebody to hit her,"" the third friend told the Daily Mail. ""When he hit her she hit him back, like, 'Don't you ever do that again,'""

The third Daily Mail source added: ""I asked her if he ever apologized. She said 'no,' but he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

All three friends told the outlet that Jane hit Emhoff back after the alleged initial slap. They also claimed that Jane tried to leave the valet area after the alleged slap, but that Emhoff got into a cab with Jane.

Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France, according to the friends. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip short and returned to the U.S. for his daughter's birthday at the end of May, and never saw Jane again, the friends told the outlet.

Emhoff's alleged relationship with Jane unfolded after his 2008 divorce from his first wife and before his 2014 marriage to Harris.

The New York Post on Wednesday slammed Emhoff as ""Worst Gentleman"" in its cover story detailing the Daily Mail's article.

Emhoff is fresh off of a Sunday sit-down interview on MSNBC during which Jen Psaki celebrated him as having reshaped ""the perception of masculinity.""

""There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,"" Psaki said. ""I'm not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that's part of the role you might play as first gentleman?""

Emhoff responded: ""It's funny. I've started to think a lot about this. I've always been like this. My dad's always been like this. To me, it's the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other's back.""

DOUG EMHOFF'S EX-WIFE RESPONDS AFTER SECOND GENTLEMAN ADMITTED TO AFFAIR WITH NANNY

He added: ""I've said many times when we lift up women, we support women, whether it's pay equity, child care, family leave, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That's not the American way.""

Clips of the exchange spread like wildfire on social media as critics noted that, in August, Emhoff admitted to having an affair with his family's nanny during his first marriage years ago.

Emhoff's admission came shortly after the Daily Mail published a separate report in August claiming that he got his daughter's nanny pregnant.

The affair occurred before Emhoff's relationship with and eventual marriage to Harris.

""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff said over the summer, acknowledging the affair, but not naming the nanny.

Emhoff and his first wife were married from 1992 to 2008 and share two adult children. Harris married Emhoff in 2014, and helped co-parent his children, who call their stepmom ""mommala.""

Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins November's presidential election, but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.

""I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don't think that's right,"" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.

The comments come as Kent County, which includes Michigan's second-largest city of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November.

While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state's population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Barack Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while former President Donald Trump took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.

This year's race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.

""Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn't bring us into any wars,"" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris' ""stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.""

Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.

""People having the rights to be in our country and the rights to health care,"" said0 the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.

""Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,"" he added. ""Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.""

However, another voter disagreed on the economy, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.

""I believe that a person who has run a company, that's been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,"" the voter said.

That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.

""I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,"" he said. ""I think other world leaders took note of that.""

Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.

""One candidate gets it and the other doesn't,"" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.

""She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don't think Trump understands that,"" the voter continued.

Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.

""One day I'll go one way and another day I'll go another way,"" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.

""It's hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,"" she said on Harris, while also noting that he finds it ""very hard to believe"" that someone as rich as Trump "" could care about people that don't have any money.""

The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the ""tone of his voice.""

""The name calling, I don't particularly care for that,"" the voter said."

The report by the House Judiciary Committee says the number of ""special interest aliens"" (SIAs) came from a congressional staff briefing by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials. SIAs are those who have come from countries identified by the U.S. government as having conditions that promote or protect terrorism or potentially pose some sort of national security threat to the U.S.

In 2019, the DHS defined an SIA as ""a non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests. Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism.""

HARRIS VISITS CRUCIAL BORDER STATE AS IMMIGRATION RECORD SPARKS SCRUTINY: A TIMELINE

""DHS analysis includes an examination of travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments that are tied to current assessments of national and international threat environments,"" it said.

The House report says that there are currently 26 special interest countries, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Syria and Turkey. The agency recently removed 11 countries from the list and added 12 others, including North Korea, China and Venezuela.

The U.S. has seen numerous Chinese and Venezuelan nationals in particular, with nearly 300,000 Venezuelans encountered at the border this fiscal year so far and more than 73,000 Chinese nationals.

Border Patrol sources have previously told Fox News they have extreme concerns about people coming across from special interest countries, given they have little to no way to vet them. Unless they have committed a crime in the U.S. or are on a federal watch list, agents have no way of knowing their criminal history because their countries do not share data with the U.S., so there is nothing to match their name against when authorities run their fingerprints.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH 'TERRORISM TIES' WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT BORDER, HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT WARNS

The committee said that DHS told the committee that being a national from a special interest country does not affect a migrant's admissibility into the U.S., although officials have previously stressed that all migrants are vetted using a multi-layered process that includes biographic and biometric information.

As an example of the risks that can be posed by the release of SIA migrants, the committee pointed to the case of Mohammad Kharwin, who was released into the U.S. and later on bond by an immigration judge despite potential terror ties. The DHS located and rearrested him two weeks later. DHS has since agreed to a voluntary departure of Kharwin from the U.S., and he is currently in ICE custody.

""Congress must take seriously its efforts to secure the border and stop the weakening of U.S. national security,"" the report said.

""As the case of Mohammad Kharwin exemplifies, the Biden-Harris Administration has sown chaos at America's borders and allowed potential national security and counterintelligence threats to enter the United States -- and, at least in Kharwin's case, be released into the country multiple times,"" it said.

The report found that there were around 98,000 SIA encounters in FY 21, which went up to 482,705 in FY 22, then 597,058 in FY 23 and 531,768 in FY 24 so far. Of those, most were encountered at the southern border, with 95,705 southwest border encounters of special interest aliens in fiscal year 2021; 465,664 in 2022; 566,079 in 2023; and 504,215 in 2024 so far.

The increase in SIAs has come amid an ongoing debate about the southern border and how to tackle it. The Biden administration has pointed to a sharp drop in encounters since June, which it attributes to a June presidential proclamation which limited the number of asylum entries into the U.S.

According to those numbers, encounters between ports of entry have decreased by more than 50%, and DHS has removed or returned more than 131,000 individuals to more than 140 countries, including operating more than 400 international repatriation flights.

""In that period, DHS has almost tripled the percentage of noncitizens processed for Expedited Removal, and the percentage of releases pending immigration court proceedings is down nearly half. Total removals and returns over the past year exceed removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010 and a majority of all southwest border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return, or expulsion,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a release last month.

It has also called for the passage of a bipartisan Senate bill that would increase funding to border agencies, including for detention beds, and would also place limits on migrant entries into the U.S. Conservatives have said it would codify high levels of illegal immigration.

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the border in Arizona last week and hammered former President Donald Trump for his lack of support for the bipartisan bill. However, Republicans have noted that the House passed a sweeping border security bill last year, but the Senate has yet to pass that either.

267,Cruise passengers go wild hiding rubber ducks on ships in viral game of hide-and-seek,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cruise-passengers-go-wild-hiding-rubber-ducks-ships-viral-game-hide-seek,2024-10-03T17:13:07Z,"Stewart Chiron, a Miami-based cruise industry expert known as ""The Cruise Guy,"" tells Fox News Digital the reasons why cruise passengers are sailing now, more than any other time in history.

Travelers onboard cruise ships around the world are taking a new approach to souvenirs by bringing -- and leaving -- rubber ducks around boats.

The trend has people purchasing rubber ducks and hiding them in spots around cruise ships. Over the last year alone, TikTok videos garnering thousands of views show users hiding and finding ducks like it's a game.

In one Facebook group, named ""Cruising Ducks,"" which has more than 284,000 members, the trend is described as a ""cute and entertaining way to have a blast on cruises and to brighten others' days.""

HUGE RUBBER DUCK APPEARS IN MAINE HARBOR, AMUSES RESIDENTS: 'IT'S WONDERFUL'

Reports say that a young girl named Abby Davis started the Easter-egg-like idea -- and it has since taken off.

The Facebook group explains, ""Our goal is to see how far our ducks will travel and where their journey might take them. Keep or hide, you decide, but please post your ducks' travels here so everyone can enjoy.""

Members are then asked to post a photo of their rubber duck onboard a ship and to specify which cruise line they are on.

TRAVELERS REFLECT ON VIRAL 9-MONTH-LONG WORLD CRUISE THAT TOOK OVER TIKTOK

In the last month, roughly 3,500 posts have been featured on the Facebook page.

One person posted a photo of their children, writing, ""Kids came back with 20ish ducks. They loved finding them! Carnival Dream, September 21-29.""

Another person posted a photo of their 113 ducks found on the Carnival Cruise Lines Jubilee in September, saying they had five ""active hunters"" on the boat and brought over 400 to hide themselves.

TRAVEL EXPERTS REVEAL BEST TIME TO FLY BEFORE A CRUISE AND WHY

The trend has made its way to Reddit as well, with one traveler posting on the ""r/royalcaribbean"" subreddit, saying they paid for a carry on just for their rubber duckies.

Reddit users took to the comments to weigh in on the offbeat trend, with one person writing, ""I hate to be a killjoy, but there's really no reason for it. Just go on the cruise and enjoy what's already there.""

Another user explained that hiding and finding ducks on the ship was a fun activity for their kids on sea days when the boat didn't stop at ports.

""My daughter works on the Utopia of the Seas and loves finding these! When her contract finishes, she plans to hide all the ducks she has collected around the ship,"" another Reddit user commented.

Cruising Ducks also has its own line of rubber ducks that can be purchased to take onboard cruise ships.

For anywhere from $14 to $26, customers can purchase different types of themed ducks -- Dorothy, Glinda the Good Witch, ""The Godfather"" and even Donald Trump.

Several theories online claim that some cruise ships discourage guests from hiding ducks on board.

268,RIP Never Trump GOP. Vance's dominant debate is beginning of the end,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rip-never-trump-gop-vances-dominant-debate-beginning-end,2024-10-03T16:51:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ever since former President Donald Trump became the GOP presidential nominee in 2016, there has been a small but loud group of so-called Republicans in the media and the halls of power who have fervently dreamed of the day when he loses his hold on the party.

Until the vice-presidential debate, these MSNBC ""conservative"" pundits and figures such as former Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney could have hoped that if Trump face plants this year, the GOP will finally come back to its senses and put them back in charge.

Sen. JD Vance put that theory squarely to bed onstage in New York City.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

Though polling varies, by most accounts, Vance scored a win over Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (not to mention the wildly biased moderators) with his command of the issues and a surprising affability that even seemed to have Walz charmed at times.

But it was the substance, not the style of Vance's answers that should worry the Never Trump crowd. Because Vance, for maybe the first time, is a major political figure who is not Donald Trump, but who can explain and embody Trump's populism even in the loftiest forums.

The cover of Time magazine this week acknowledged this with a portrait of Vance and the words, ""The New Right,"" which is, in fact, another term for the changes that Trump has wrought in the GOP.

Trumpian populism, or the New Right, has four essential pillars erected by Trump: anti-globalism, a strong border, energy independence and taking the fight to wokeness. On all four, Vance made the case.

The Ohio senator spoke of bringing manufacturing home with smart tariffs, balancing climate change with the need for cheap fuel, aggressive deportations of illegal immigrants, and has throughout his career been a strong voice against the excesses of wokeness in areas like education and gender.

It is a stark contrast to Trump's former veep, the old guard, establishment-friendly Mike Pence, who notably, is not supporting his old boss this time around.

If Pence served as a drawbridge to traditional Republicans, Vance is like a high castle wall, protecting the core tenets of the New Right from would-be interlopers wishing to return to the days of Romney and Cheney.

In Vance, we saw a future for Trumpian populism in the absence of its creator. And it's not just JD, all of the up-and-comers on the GOP bench largely embody the substance of the New Right, if not exactly Trump's tactics.

When we look at businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; all essentially embrace the New Right. Even former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whose supporters Democrats have hoped to pluck, realizes that the vast majority of Republican voters want Trump's New Right policies.

Notwithstanding the fact that the GOP's turn to the populist side is now complete, we see groups like ""Republicans for Harris"" touring the country, doing Zoom calls, and they clearly have some real money behind them. What they lack is any semblance of popular support.

Today, we can see that Never Trumpism was never really about mean tweets, or womanizing, or threats to democracy. No, from the start, the stalwart Never Trumpers opposed Trump and the voters' priorities and preferred policies.

On immigration, they want compromise, not a strong border. On trade, they want big global deals, not protectionism. On energy, they seek to appease the alarmists. And when it comes to wokeness, well, they really just don't want to talk about it.

If you put aside the Never Trump movement's weird sense of entitlement and nonstop moral outrage, you can understand why they are upset. Their brand of neoliberalism, the chamber of commerce GOP of the Bushes is no more.

If Pence served as a drawbridge to traditional Republicans, Vance is like a high castle wall, protecting the core tenets of the New Right from would-be interlopers wishing to return to the days of Romney and Cheney.

On its face, it would seem that the best options for the Republicans for Harris are to simply become Democrats and try to keep the party of Jefferson and Jackson from careening into a leftist ditch. That's similar to the way they always played defense when they were in power in the GOP.

But, if they do that, they lose their value. They can no longer be used by the liberal media to pretend some large swath of conservative voters is against Trump. They become, in a word, irrelevant.

After Vance's performance against Walz, it is fair to say that irrelevance is already upon the Never Trumpers. They saw the future and it is not them. The fight is finally over."
269,Ohio GOP Senate candidate Moreno hits Brown on Inflation Reduction Act vote in ad that's part of $25M buy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-gop-senate-candidate-moreno-hits-brown-inflation-reduction-act-vote-ad-thats-part-25m-buy,2024-10-03T16:19:51Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno is hitting incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

As President Biden spends a second straight day surveying damage and getting briefed on recovery and relief efforts in the storm-damaged Southeast, he's once again coming under political attack from former President Trump.

As the death toll from Hurricane Helene climbs to close to 200 people, with hundreds still missing, millions still without power or running water, and damage estimated in the billions, Trump took to social media on Thursday morning to paint Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as incompetent.

""Kamala and Sleepy Joe are universally being given POOR GRADES for the way that they are handling the Hurricane, especially in North Carolina,"" Trump charged in a social media post. ""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE.""

Trump, who's locked in a margin-of-error race with Harris with less than five weeks to go until Election Day in November, has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to the powerful storm for nearly a week.

BIDEN, HARRIS, INSPECT STORM DAMAGE WITH TRIPS TO SOUTHEAST

And with two of the hardest hit states - North Carolina and Georgia - two of the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, the hurricane has become front-and-center in the White House race.

Trump this past weekend accused the president of ""sleeping"" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.

NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL

And speaking with reporters as he arrived in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to survey storm damage and bring relief aid, the former president charged that ""the federal government is not being responsive.""

And he falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican.

Pushing back against the political attacks, Biden has noted that he was on the phone with federal, state and local officials throughout the weekend and returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor storm rescue and relief efforts.

""We had over 1,000 federal personnel, including search and rescue teams, at the ready on the ground before it hit,"" the president said on Tuesday. ""Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the governors, the mayors, the county officials, and all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia.

And Biden emphasized that his administration has sent ""every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region"" and pledged ""we'll be there until this work is done.""

More than half of the deaths from the storm are in North Carolina, where entire communities in the western part of the state were demolished by fast-moving waters.

As the floodwaters from the storm receded, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lamented that, in the western part of his state, ""communities were wiped off the map.""

The president on Wednesday was in North Carolina, where he surveyed damage from a helicopter flight over the city of Ashville, one of the hardest hit areas. Biden also visited a rescue command center in the state before also stopping in neighboring South Carolina.

""My top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday as he spoke during a Cabinet meeting focusing on the federal response.

And the president ahead of his trip to the region green-lighted the use of up to 1,000 active duty troops to support relief efforts.

And huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region on Wednesday, Biden emphasized that ""in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here - there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans - our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.""

Trump on Sunday attacked Harris for attending ""fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors"" in California over the weekend. And he argued that Harris ""ought to be down in the area"" where the storm caused destruction.

On Monday during his stop in Georgia, Trump repeated the dig, saying, ""The vice president, she's out someplace campaigning looking for money.""

The White House has highlighted that the vice president over the weekend was on the phone with federal, state and local officials.

Harris said on Saturday that she and the president ""remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.""

On Monday, Harris visited FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she received a briefing on relief and rescue efforts.

""We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover,"" Harris vowed.

Harris on Wednesday traveled to Georgia to survey the impacts of the storm and receive an on-the-ground briefing and provide updates on the federal response.

""We are here for the long haul,"" Harris told residents in Augusta, Georgia. ""There's a lot of work that's going to need to happen over the coming days, weeks, and months, and the coordination that we have dedicated ourselves to will be long-lasting to get families, to get residents, to get neighborhoods back up and running.""

Harris was originally scheduled to take part Wednesday in a campaign bus swing through central Pennsylvania, another key battleground state, with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With the vice president headed to Georgia, Walz headlined the bus tour, which came the day after he faced off in the running mates debate against Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee.

During his Monday stop in Georgia, Trump highlighted that ""I've come to Valdosta with large semi-trucks, many of them filled with relief aid. A tanker truck filled up with gasoline, a couple of big tanker trucks filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day.""

And a GoFundMe page set up by the Trump campaign earlier this week has raised over $4 million so far for storm victims.

""I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis,"" Biden told reporters on Monday.

And Harris said on Tuesday, ""I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible - but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations, because that must be the highest priority and the first order of business.""

But the optics of Trump's Monday stop in Georgia may have put some political pressure on Biden and Harris.

Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care - they're not doing anything and I think they're reacting to it.""

The response by elected officials to natural disasters can impact their political standing.

President George W. Bush was heavily criticized in the summer of 2005 for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.

And Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island."

""To me, he's more for the people, the hard-working people,"" one voter said.

Some Michigan Democrats are worried about a repeat of Hillary Clinton's loss in the state as election day nears and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump remain neck-and-neck in the polls, according to reports.

""Smart Democrats have a healthy sense of paranoia,"" Michigan Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond told the Associated Press (AP). ""If polling is as far off as it was in 2016, we're cooked.""

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%. Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988.

Hemond noted that in 2016, some polls did not show how much support Trump had in Michigan.

""Democrats' financial resources absolutely dwarf anything that the Republicans have,"" former GOP Michigan Gov. John Engler told the outlet. ""But Trump is making stops in locations that have never had presidential visits before, and those are impactful with margins this close.""

Slotkin reportedly said during a recent virtual fundraiser that Harris was ""underwater"" in Michigan, although it's typical for candidates to stoke fears of losing among their base to drive up fundraising.

U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing, in which Smith argues that Trump is not immune from prosecution for his alleged criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith submitted the document after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" Smith wrote. ""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role.""

The Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. United States held that Smith could not prosecute Trump for the president's alleged use of the Justice Department to look into unproven claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In response, Smith filed an updated indictment that revised the allegations against Trump to fit within the scope of the Supreme Court's decision.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL'S ELECTION CASE AGAINST TRUMP

In the unsealed filing, Smith told the court that Trump is not immune from the remaining allegations against him and laid out his case for why Trump ""must stand trial for his private crimes.""

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him by Smith.

Here are five key details from the special counsel's new filing, which is partially redacted:

In the filing unsealed Wednesday, Smith outlined a ""factual proffer,"" alleging Trump ""resorted to crimes to try to stay in office"" after losing the 2020 presidential election.

""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,"" Smith wrote.

""His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.""

PROSECUTORS REQUEST INDEFINITE DELAY IN TRIAL FOR TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH

Smith claims that the ""throughline of these efforts was deceit,"" alleging Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.""

Smith claims that several people close to Trump had told the former president his claims of election fraud were ""bulls---.""

According to Smith, in one conversation, an unnamed Trump attorney had told Trump that the campaign was ""looking into his fraud claims and had even hired external experts to do so, but could find no support for them.""

""He told the defendant that if the Campaign took these claims to court, they would get slaughtered because the claims are all 'bulls---,'"" the filing states, with Smith claiming that a lawyer discussed with Trump the investigations and ""debunkings on all major claims.""

For example, the attorney allegedly told Trump that Georgia's audit disproved claims that votes had been altered.

TRUMP BLASTS DOJ FOR 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE,' CALLS JACK SMITH CASE A 'SCAM' AFTER JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING

Smith also claims a senior campaign adviser who spoke with Trump on a ""daily basis"" and had ""informed him on multiple occasions that various fraud claims were false"" had complained that Trump was losing his election lawsuits because his lawyers could not back up false claims about the election.

""When our research and campaign legal team can't back up any of the claims made by our Elite Strike Force Legal Team, you can see why we're 0-32 on our cases,"" the campaign adviser allegedly wrote.

""I'll obviously hustle to help on all fronts, but it's tough to own any of this when it's all just conspiracy s--- beamed down from the mothership.""

The filing details several alleged interactions between Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence in the days following the election.

Smith details a Nov. 7, 2020, call between Pence and Trump in which Pence allegedly ""tried to encourage"" Trump ""as a friend"" by reminding him that he ""took a dying political party and gave it a new lease on life.""

Smith also details a private lunch between Trump and Pence on Nov. 12, 2020, when Pence allegedly gave Trump a ""face-saving option."" That option, according to the filing, was ""don't concede but recognize the process is over.""

In another private lunch between Trump and Pence on Nov. 16, 2020, Pence allegedly tried to encourage Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024. Trump is alleged to have responded, ""I don't know, 2024 is so far off.""

TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY

In yet another private lunch on Dec. 21, Pence allegedly ""encouraged"" Trump ""not to look at the election 'as a loss - just an intermission.'"" Later that day in the Oval Office, Trump allegedly asked Pence for advice on what he should do. According to Smith, Pence said, ""after we have exhausted every legal process in the courts and Congress, if we still came up short, Trump should 'take a bow.'""

Additionally, Smith reveals that Trump allegedly showed little regard for Pence's safety during the Jan. 6, 2023 riot at the U.S. Capitol after it became clear that Pence would not support his attempt to stop the certification of the election.

Smith alleges that an unnamed Trump aide, ""upon receiving a phone call alerting him that Pence had been taken to a secure location... rushed to the dining room to inform the defendant [Trump] in hopes that the defendant would take action to ensure Pence's safety.""

Smith writes that instead, after the aide delivered the news, Trump ""looked at him and said only, 'So what?'""

Smith alleges that Trump at multiple times showed complete disregard for those who informed him his claims of voter fraud were false, including Republican elections officials in states where Trump had claimed the election was stolen.

""Election officials, for instance, issued press releases and other public statements to combat the disinformation that the defendant and his allies were spreading,"" Smith wrote. ""At one point long after the defendant had begun spreading false fraud claims, [REDACTED], a White House staffer traveling with the defendant, overheard him tell family members that 'it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.""

Smith goes on to assert that Trump and his legal team ""repeatedly changed the numbers in their baseless fraud allegations from day to day,"" and even ""made up figures from whole cloth.""

TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH

The special counsel claimed Trump ""was on notice that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud in Arizona within a week of the election"" and claimed Trump also ""had early notice that his claims of election fraud in Georgia were false.""

By the time Trump spoke at his rally on Jan. 6, after Pence had refused to stop the certification of the election, Smith said the former president knew his ""last hope"" to overturn the results was ""the large and angry crowd standing in front of him.""

""So for more than an hour, the defendant delivered a speech designed to inflame his supports and motivate them to march to the Capitol. The defendant told the crowd many of the same lies he had been telling for months -- privately and publicly, including to the officials in the targeted states -- and that he knew were not true.""

Smith argues that based on a ""factbound analysis"" of Trump's conduct, the court should determine that the former president was not acting in his official capacity when he challenged the election results and is therefore not immune from prosecution.

""None of the allegations or evidence is protected by presidential immunity,"" Smith wrote, asserting Trump's ""scheme was a private one.""

""He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office,"" Smith claimed. ""To the limited extent that the superseding indictment and proffered evidence reflect official conduct, however, the Government can rebut the presumption of immunity because relying on that conduct in this prosecution will not pose a danger of intrusion on the authority or functions of the Executive Branch."""
275,"Virginia Senate debate: Clinton ex-running mate Kaine, GOP challenger Cao spar on immigration, DEI in military",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-senate-debate-clinton-ex-running-mate-kaine-gop-challenger-cao-spar-immigration-dei-military,2024-10-03T13:08:23Z,"Virginia Gov. Glen Youngkin joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the 2024 election as early voting starts in the key swing state.

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican challenger Hung Cao clashed on the debate stage Wednesday night on a range of issues including immigration, education and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the military.

Kaine, who previously served as governor of Virginia and was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate in 2016, made his case during the hourlong showdown at Norfolk State University on why he should keep his seat in the upper chamber of Congress. The only debate of the campaign focused on national issues and matters that resonate in Virginia and the coastal city of Norfolk, which is home to the country's largest Navy base.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran endorsed by former President Donald Trump, criticized COVID vaccine mandates for service members and the Biden-Harris administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal when asked about the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. He also criticized DEI efforts.

""When you're using a drag queen to recruit for the Navy, that's not the people we want,"" Cao said. ""What we need is alpha males and alpha females who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. Those are the young men and women that are going to win wars.""

VIRGINIA SCHOOL BOARD TO PAY 'WRONGFULLY FIRED' TEACHER WHO REFUSED TO USE STUDENT'S PREFERRED PRONOUNS

Kaine, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded by saying that railing at DEI ""is a red herring"" and the real challenge is informing more Americans about the benefits of the military when only about 1% of the population serves in the armed forces. ""We need to do a better job of talking about the G.I. Bill and other benefits as well as the tremendous leadership training that you get in the military,"" Kaine said.

Cao, meanwhile, brought up the G.I. Bill when challenging Kaine on student loan forgiveness. The incumbent Democrat had praised the Biden administration for having forgiven ""the loans of more than a million public servants in thanks for the public service they provide, whether it's in the military, whether it's teaching, whether it's working as a frontline health professional or working for a local or state government.""

The moderator then posed a question to Cao on how the Republican candidate would ease the burden, noting that the U.S. Department of Education reports more than a million Virginians owe a collective $43 billion in federal student debt as of last October, impacting their ability to contribute to the state's economy.

""If you're struggling to pay for your school, then get a G.I. Bill,"" Cao said. ""That means go out and serve in the military. You'll get a stipend as well as tuition. We need to fix education, and we need to do it now. But here's the thing with people like Senator Kaine, you've been an officer for 30 years in various offices, in the U.S. Senate for 12. Why have you not fixed it yet?""

VIRGINIA FAA CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY SPIED FOR IRAN, SHARED PRIVATE INFO ON US AIRPORTS, ENERGY INDUSTRY: DOJ

Kaine responded by saying Virginia ""was named the best state for a child to be raised in the United States"" and ""the best managed state and the best state to do business"" when he was governor from 2006 to 2010.

""Oh, again, he says what he's going to do,"" Cao shot back. ""Honestly, of the 227 bills that Senator Kaine has proposed, only three of them made it through... That's a 99% failure rate.""

""Check the tape on that. That's completely wrong,"" Kaine insisted.

However, Cao retorted, ""There's two truths in the world, okay? Never walk into a target store wearing a red shirt and never go against an Asian when it comes to math. Trust me.""

""He's got a 99% failure rate,"" Cao added. ""If I just had 99% failure rate, and I defused bombs, I wouldn't be here right now.""

The moderator also pressed Cao, whose family fled Vietnam during the 1970s, on whether he supports the mass deportation of ""all undocumented immigrants.""

""When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to go, and America had brought us in and my parents waited in line for seven years. We all did for seven years to get our citizenship. The last thing that my dad had [hung] over his bed when he passed away two years ago was his naturalization certificate. I love this country so much that I wrote a blank check - up to including my life - to defend it for 25 years in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and other parts of the world,"" Cao said. ""Here's my thing to anybody who wants to come here, don't ask for an American dream. If you're not willing to be American laws and embrace the American culture, because I did.""

""If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you're a violent crime person,"" Cao said, citing new Immigration and Customs Enforcement data provided to lawmakers last week.

""There are 13,000 convicted murderers and 16,000 convicted rapists that came across under their watch. That's unacceptable. We need to protect Americans every single day,"" Cao said.

""If you came here illegally, you've basically screwed up the whole system,"" Cao said. ""You can't jump the line - I mean, you go to Costco and jump the line, what do you think is going to happen? You can't come here and expect the American dream if you're not willing to obey the American laws and embrace the American culture.""

""Deport anybody that's committing crimes right now,"" he added. ""That's the first thing we need. Secure the border.""

Kaine said he never supported mass amnesty but believes it would ""devastate the economy"" to deport the 10 million illegal immigrants who crossed the border during the Biden-Harris administration - a figure the moderator cited and the Democratic candidate echoed. He also slammed former President Donald Trump for asking Republicans to oppose the last congressional border deal.

""We recently negotiated a very tough border deal that would have put a lot of resources on the border to stop illegal immigration,"" Kaine said. ""President Trump asked for Republicans to oppose it, even though it was supported by the border control union.""

Another subject was Trump's proposal to place more tariffs on imported goods.

""What we need to do is not tax our industry here,"" Cao said. ""What we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods.""

Kaine criticized Trump's proposal. ""The Trump tariffs would be a massive tax that would cause prices on all of these items that are imported to go up,"" Kaine said. ""On that, I differ strongly from my opponent.""

With Kaine's seat considered solidly Democratic, the race has not seen the kind of dead-heat polling as the national presidential contest or the high-stakes drama of other Senate races such as those in Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents face tough re-election bids, according to The Associated Press.

Trump has endorsed Cao, and political scientists say his path to victory is narrow given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters, according to the AP.

Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a U.S. Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.

276,MSNBC host shocked as impeachment witness says Trump regained his support: 'So striking!',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-host-shocked-impeachment-witness-says-trump-regained-support-striking,2024-10-03T13:01:10Z,"MSNBC host Ari Melber shouted in disbelief after a former Trump official who testified against him in the first impeachment said he supports the former president due to 'how badly' the Biden-Harris administration has gone.

Gordon Sondland, who served as then-President Trump's ambassador to the EU and who became a star witness against him in his first impeachment, shocked an MSNBC host by saying Trump won his support once again.

MSNBC host Ari Melber spoke with three former Trump officials, including White House advisor Peter Navarro, White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews, and Sondland about topics such as how working for the Trump administration has impacted their lives or what the most important thing was that they learned about the former president. Sondland in particular was asked whether he stands by a previous disavowal of the president after the events of January 6, 2021.

""No, I don't stand by it, and I'll tell you why,"" Sondland began. ""I've now lived four years under the Biden-Harris policies and I have to say that those policies are not only becoming an existential threat to our country's way of life, but to our allies as well.""

The host loudly interrupted him and began shouting, ""I'm going to let you finish, but this is so striking. You said it was a 'no for me' after that, after January 6. And here we are right now, And you're saying it's a yes for you?""

""It is a yes, for me. It is an absolute yes for me,"" Sondland said. ""That is how badly the Biden-Harris team have prosecuted their job.""

Melber continued speaking at a loud volume during the exchange: ""But the whole point you seem to be making was that January 6th and that kind of attack on democracy is bigger than any policy-""

""I am seeing so many attacks on democracy that eclipse January 6th,"" Sondland replied, encouraging Melber to ask him what those are. Earlier in the same panel, he had voiced his concerns about a future scenario where ""if the Democrats are able to impose their desired program over the next several years, there will be massive voting irregularities.""

""I want to express is that I've now lived for four years under the Biden-Harris administration,"" he said. ""I live in a bucolic city of Portland, Oregon, which has been destroyed by those policies.

Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining her lead over former President Trump in Wisconsin despite Trump leading on the key issues, according to a Wednesday poll.

The new poll from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump in a 52%-48% match-up. The poll also found that voters are deeply invested in the election, with 46% of respondents saying they have stopped talking to someone about politics due to the presidential race.

Marquette conducted the survey from Sept. 18-26, polling 882 Wisconsin registered voters and 798 likely voters. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4.4%.

Despite trailing in the polls, Trump leads Harris in the top issues in the race, including border security, the economy, and handling the Israel-Hamas war.

Trump enjoys a sizable 49-37% lead over Harris on immigration. Meanwhile, 50% of Wisconsinites say he will handle the economy better than Harris, with the vice president getting just 42% support. Trump also enjoys a 45%-33% lead when it comes to Israel's conflict in the Middle East. He also has a narrow lead over Harris when it comes to foreign relations more generally.

Harris does have a lead over Trump in a number of other issues, however, namely abortion and election concerns. Roughly 53% of respondents said they trusted Harris to handle the former, compared to 36% for Trump. Another 49% said Harris would be better for ensuring a fair and accurate election, compared to Trump's 39%.

Wisconsin is among a handful of swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Other states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are also critical to either a Trump or Harris victory.

Pennsylvania in particular is one of the tightest contests in the nation, where Harris leads Trump in a razor-thin 49%-47% match-up, according to new data from AARP.

279,Stop the insanity. Our national debt now tops $35 trillion...,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/stop-insanity-national-debt-now-tops-35-trillion,2024-10-03T10:06:48Z,"They know entitlement programs feature benefit promises far exceeding their tax base, but have done nothing to make them sound. Meanwhile, both parties demand more spending increases -- despite the national debt soaring to $35 trillion, or more than $100,000 for each American, rich and poor alike. Under rosy assumptions, over $20 trillion in debt is projected to be added over the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

TRUMP, HARRIS BLASTED FOR IGNORING EXPLODING BUDGET DEFICIT, AS ECONOMISTS PLEAD WITH BOTH TO 'GET REAL'

Some argue tax cuts are to blame for the soaring debt. But as data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows, revenue has remained largely stable while spending has grown significantly above prior levels.

Much of the growing debt is baked into the budgetary cake, and experts have long warned about rising costs when the Baby Boom generation retires. But growing Social Security payouts -- long ago engineered to rise faster than prices -- are only part of the problem. Soaring health spending, driven by the same demographic factors and compounded by exploding medical costs, is an even bigger challenge.

America's mountain of debt has been exacerbated by massive so-called emergency spending enacted by both parties. During the pandemic, legislation added over $5 trillion to the debt. Now the nearly $1 trillion in annual interest on the debt exceeds all federal spending on children, and defense spending, too.

Efforts to balance the budget are repeatedly dismissed. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, one of us regularly proposed and passed balanced budgets, only to see hope for such discipline overcome by a desire for ever-greater spending. Important-sounding commissions (including one dubbed the ""supercommittee"") issued detailed recommendations that were mostly ignored.

Experts produced reams of data showing nations deep in debt inevitably reach a financial crisis, even as proponents of modern monetary theory (MMT) argued no amount of spending is too great. According to MMT advocates, the federal government can always print more money.

Americans have already experienced where inaction and that illogic lead. During the pandemic, former Obama Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that massive new federal spending would lead to significant inflation, which is exactly what happened, with prices growing 20% since the start of the Biden-Harris administration.

The Federal Reserve's response led to the highest interest rates in two decades, helping drive the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home up by over $1,000. Lower-income Americans spend a greater share of their income on housing, so such rising costs are just one example of why they tend to suffer most from inflation and higher interest rates.

Yet despite expressing concerns about inflation, both presidential tickets propose even bigger deficits. In fact, they seem to be in a bidding war to make them worse. Former President Donald Trump proposed exempting tip income from federal taxes, and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly followed suit. Both ignored the 10-year costs of this proposal, which stretch into hundreds of billions of dollars.

Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance suggested more than doubling today's $2,000 child tax credit to $5,000, which Harris one-upped by proposing $6,000 payments in a child's first year. Senator Vance hasn't spelled out important details of his plan, but we know most of Harris's plan comprises bigger benefit spending instead of tax relief. Both proposals would cost over $1 trillion during the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

Neither campaign has a plan to cover the new costs. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, counting their economic effects, Trump's plans would increase deficits by $4 trillion versus Harris's $2 trillion. But that assumes Harris doesn't revive the massive spending plans she promoted as one of the most liberal members of the Senate. Her plans included a ruinously expensive Medicare-for-all proposal, along with $2,000-per-month stimulus checks for most Americans costing $21 trillion. If you believe a Harris administration wouldn't revive such proposals during the next economic crisis, you haven't paid attention to recent Washington policymaking.

While both campaigns suggest we can have higher spending and debt alongside lower prices and interest rates, recent experience suggests otherwise. So where does the buck really stop? That is, who will ultimately pay for all this?

The reality is every American will pay, especially those with modest incomes and younger Americans who will suffer the longest from higher taxes, inflation and interest rates. We should demand more from our leaders than promises of bigger giveaways, followed by empty handwringing about the soaring debt and financial pain that inevitably result.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Radio show host Charlamagne Tha God on Monday applauded GOP presidential nominee former President Trump's political ad that highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris' support for taxpayer-funded surgeries for trans prisoners and illegal immigrants.

""That ad [Trump] was running during the football games this weekend claiming the vice president supports funding gender transition surgeries for all prison inmates and migrants in the U.S."" Charlamagne Tha God said on Monday during the radio show he co-hosts called ""The Breakfast Club.""

""That was nuts,"" he added.

YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS

The Trump campaign aired an advertisement over the weekend attacking Harris' past support for government-funded transgender surgeries for prison inmates and migrants held in detention facilities.

The narrator in the campaign ad began by saying, ""Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.""

""Surgery for prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system will have access,"" Harris said in the ad. The ad shows Harris making those comments during an interview with the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).

The New York Post reported her comments during the NCTE interview were made during the 2020 election cycle as the vice president was doubling down on her position on supporting transgender prisoners.

""It's hard to believe, but it's true. Even the liberal media was shocked Kamala supports tax-payer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens,"" the narrator in the ad said.

""Kamala's for they/them. President Trump is for you,"" the narrator in the ad said.

The ad concluded with a CNBC headline reading, ""Trump: Lower taxes, bigger paychecks for workers.""

Reacting to the Trump campaign's attack ad, Charlamagne Tha God said that ""that ad was impactful"" and ""effective.""

HARRIS FINALLY ADDS POLICY PAGE TO CAMPAIGN WEBSITE, DEVOTES SEVERAL SECTIONS TO TRUMP

""I don't know if it was the backdrop of football, but when you hear the narrator say Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners. That one line ..."" he said. ""I was like, 'Hell no. I don't want my taxpayer dollars going to that.'""

He suggested Harris counter with her own ads during football games.

The vice president's position was recently resurfaced by CNN, which reported on the presidential candidates' responses in a questionnaire.

When asked by the ACLU if ""as President will you use your executive authority to ensure that transgender and nonbinary people who rely on the state for medical care -- including those in prison and immigration detention -- will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care?,"" Harris responded in the affirmative.

""I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained. Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment,"" she wrote in the questionnaire.

Many of Harris' past positions have been put in the spotlight since she ascended to the top of the ticket after President Biden withdrew from the presidential race."

Several political commentators and critics linked Gov. Tim Walz's debate performance to an overall lack of media exposure following his vice presidential debate performance against Sen. JD Vance.

""I think the lack of interviews he has done with national media, with local media, it showed,"" CNN host Dana Bash, who interviewed Walz in August alongside Vice President Kamala Harris for their first interview since Harris became the nominee, said.

Former President Trump and Vance have done at least 61 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to 23 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far.

""I think that Walz did seem unsteady,"" ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl said after the debate. ""And frankly, what I saw is somebody who has not faced questions on a national stage since he became the Democratic nominee. He was simply out of practice. I mean, I don't know why they've done it, but they've kept him out of the limelight. They've kept him away from reporters. They haven't had him do any interviews. And he was clearly unsteady through much of that debate. In contrast, JD Vance was very smooth.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

""Hate to say it but Walz would have benefitted from doing a few Sunday morning shows, as Vance has been,"" Financial Times associate editor Edward Luce said.

Vance has done several appearances on Sunday morning news programs since joining the Trump ticket, including with CNN's Bash, NBC's Kristen Welker, ABC's Jonathan Karl, CBS' Margaret Brennan - one of the debate's moderators - and Fox News' Shannon Bream.

MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell said Wednesday that Walz was ""notably rusty"" due to his lack of media exposure, although she incorrectly said he hadn't done ""any solo interviews"" since he joined the ticket. Walz has done several local TV and radio hits and did interviews on MSNBC and ABC after the Trump-Harris debate last month, but he has done far fewer formal media sit-downs as a running mate than Vance.

Abby Phillip, a host on CNN, said the Minnesota governor was unprepared for Tuesday night's showdown.

""He didn't respond to a lot of the criticisms and attacks that Vance put on the table. He allowed some clear falsehoods to just go completely unanswered,"" Phillip added.

""It took him several sentences to get to the part of his answer, Walz's answer, where he actually responded to that,"" she said. ""I mean, I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution here on Walz's part.""

GOP flack Matt Gorman said during an appearance on CNN on Wednesday that Vance's prep and interview experience showed through the debate.

""And when you saw with Walz, who hasn't done really many interviews, only really outside of it with Dana Bash, obviously, not having that interview prep, not having the tough questions and the ability to refine your arguments made him a little tougher to kind of pivot out of those trickier subjects,"" Gorman said.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Politico Magazine's analysis of the debate also said Vance and Walz had different preparation strategies.

""The Democrats' campaign chose a different path for Walz, as well as his running mate -- essentially avoiding tough environments. And it showed. At times, Walz seemed unprepared either to defend himself (such as his whereabouts during the Tiananmen Square protests) or to summon the most effective lines of attack against Vance and Trump,"" the analysis read.

Walz joined MSNBC and ABC for brief appearances after his running mate's debate against Donald Trump. He's also done some interviews with smaller, local news outlets.

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said he was surprised by the lack of media exposure Harris and Walz have had.

""I've been bewildered a little bit by the absence of both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate on television since they became the nominees, because that's how people get to know you. And they haven't really spent a lot of time with either of them before now,"" Axelrod said. ""He was all over before he became the nominee when he was campaigning for vice president.""

Axelrod concluded that Walz put himself at a disadvantage.

""So I also think that it may be a little bit of a problem for Walz having not done this. Sitting with [the media] is good prep for debates. It's good batting practice for these events. Walz has not been doing it. So I do question that,"" he said, ""It's bewildering.""

In an effort to win the vote of disgruntled Republicans as she battles former President Trump in the race for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

A senior Harris campaign official says that the vice president on Thursday will team up in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who became her party's most visible anti-Trump leader.

The campaign event will take place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

According to her campaign, Harris plans to spotlight the significance of that moment and that place - as she makes another direct appeal to Republican voters frustrated that Trump is their party's presidential nominee - and as she reiterates her pledge to be a president for all Americans.

LIZ CHENEY WEIGHS IN ON WHOM SHE'LL BACK IN THE 2024 ELECTION

Harris is also expected to praise Cheney for her courage and patriotism in putting country over party.

Cheney, at a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

""As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.""

Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to a candidate that was backed by Trump.

Cheney -- who has argued that the former president is a ""liar,"" a ""con man"" and a potential ""tyrant"" who, if elected again, would ""torch the Constitution"" -- vowed after leaving Congress that ""I will do everything I can to make sure [Trump] is never anywhere near the Oval Office again.""

The Harris campaign says that the vice president, at her event with Cheney, plans to note that while Republicans may not agree with her on every issue, she promises to uphold the Constitution, America's fundamental principles, and the rule of law.

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states."

The debate between the candidates for vice president -- GOP nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz -- was dominated by Vance, and all but a handful of hardened partisan pundits agree on that conclusion.

Walz wobbled and panicked from the first question -- which everyone in the world knew would be about Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier in the day. Yet Walz still fumbled his response, and it got worse from there until the CBS moderators invoked the unwritten mercy rule for left-wing moderators watching the Democrat melt and tossed Walz some softballs on J6 at the debate's close, by which time the internet was howling and laughing at the Minnesota governor.

There were three important takeaways:

NEW YORK POST CALLS OUT CBS FOR 'RIDICULOUS' FACT-CHECK OF JD VANCE: 'SHAMEFUL MOMENT'

First, Vance is a superb and calm debater and a reassuring figure on the national stage.

Second, Walz is not, and he represents the one big decision Vice President Kamala Harris has had to make since President Joe Biden dropped out. It was a terrible decision. Imagine her Cabinet and White House staff if somehow, she wins.

Third, legacy media is irretrievably broken and cannot be reclaimed from its lurch into rote leftism and extreme partisanship, or even pulled back to a minimum level of seriousness on big occasions.

Do executives at these networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- not see what has happened? Americans don't trust the news divisions at the legacy networks. It's as if those divisions are run by a combination of fresh-from-campus-demonstration interns and hardened partisans from the Obama years.

The CBS debate was not, however, as overtly biased against Vance as ABC's earlier debate was against Trump, but it was still very, very biased against the center-right and conservative audience. Viewers saw the question set veer quickly from a world crisis and the border crisis to get to the left's favorite issue of abortion.

With the world tuning in only hours after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan did open with an obligatory round of questions on that crisis. But, after 10 minutes, they plowed on to a quick exchange on immigration and the Biden-Harris massive fail on the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's savaging of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia in order to get to ... abortion, which had been discussed at length in the ABC debate and about which there are zero mysteries.

Three rounds of questions on abortion, really? And three rounds marked by the rote framing favored by the hard left? Predictable but still shocking.

The debate ended in a morass of childcare questions and then the obligatory ""Wasn't January 6th terrible?"" questions.

What a farce. Not one question on China's vast military build-up and its threat against Taiwan and the Philippines. Not one question on the Chinese Communist Party spies shot through our country, including the office of New York's current and past governor. Not one question on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Yes, there was a quick dash through the consequences of more than 10 million illegal immigrants flowing across the southern border under the Biden-Harris regime, but also a quick cut-off when Vance began what was an obviously embarrassing factcheck of the CBS factcheck on the ""legal status"" of the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. ""We have a lot to get to,"" was the trigger for cutting off anything uncomfortable.

Walz was asked about his lying about his trips to China -- sort of. It was left hanging. A knuckleheaded answer for a knuckleheaded team of debate organizers. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a sort of Voldemort for the networks -- never to be named -- perhaps because ABC and CBS all have corporate ties to companies that must do business there?

Look, whatever votes were moved by the debate moved toward the GOP because Vance hammered that the costs of everything from food to gas skyrocketed under Biden-Harris, gave a quick tutorial on why construction costs have soared and thus the price of houses, and repeatedly reminded the audience of Harris's failure in her job as ""border czar,"" while also stressing the need for more domestic energy production. Tim Walz provided comic relief.

The loser wasn't just Walz though. It was also CBS, which joined ABC in a legacy media hall of shame. When we get back to debates in four years, the good news is the ""debate commission"" is already dead and that, by 2028, the idea of the big networks hosting debates unchecked by center-right moderators will be as well. The candidates will call on C-SPAN and find some fair moderators. Siri could have done a better job in our past two debates this year.

What has to be dawning in the C Suites of networks -- if they are at all self-aware -- is that their product and their talent are awful, and their audiences have already left or will soon leave. Tuesday night was just the most recent example of why."

Illegal immigrants with ""terrorism ties"" are expected to exploit the U.S. border as the threat environment remains high, the Department of Homeland Security warned Wednesday.

The agency detailed a number of warnings in its annual Homeland Threat Assessment, which is used to inform local, state and federal agencies about public safety and security threats, saying the ""terrorism threat environment"" over the next year ""will remain high.""

""Over the next year, we expect some individuals with terrorism ties and some criminal actors will continue their efforts to exploit migration flows and the complex border security environment to enter the United States,"" the assessment states.

""Individuals with potential terrorism connections continue to attempt to enter the Homeland at both the US-Mexico and US-Canada borders and also through the immigration system,"" it continued.

There were 172 encounters of nationals on the terror watchlist at the border between ports of entry last fiscal year and more than 560 at the ports of entry.

The report also laid out concerns about violence in response to the 2024 election cycle, which has already seen assassination attempts on former President Trump's life, as well as foreign violent extremists carrying out potential attacks in response to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.

Groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda ""maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland and have leveraged the conflict in the Middle East to reaffirm this intent,"" the report said.

""Among state actors, we expect Iran to remain the primary sponsor of terrorism and continue its efforts to advance plots against individuals -- including current and former US officials -- in the United States,"" the assessment warned.

In addition to Iran, China and Russia have increasingly used artificial intelligence to create ""more believable"" text, video and audio to reach American audiences while hiding their origins, the report said.

The terror watchlist, called the Terrorist Screening Dataset, includes known or suspected terrorists, as well as additional individuals believed to pose a potential threat to the U.S. -- including affiliates of individuals on the watchlist.

Despite migrant encounters dipping slightly, they are still arriving in high numbers, ""complicating border and immigration security,"" according to the threat assessment.

""Migrant encounters along the US-Canada border continue to increase, with over 181,000 migrant encounters in FY 2024 through August, compared to about 170,000 encounters at the same time in FY 2023,"" the report said. ""In contrast to the US-Mexico border, many watchlist encounters along the US-Canada border occur at ports of entry, and the vast majority of these individuals have legal status in Canada.""

A school safety expert told Fox News Digital JD Vance and Tim Walz presented two different visions on how to tackle gun violence in America during this week's vice presidential debate, but only one candidate appears to be ""much closer to the answer"" when it comes to protecting children in classrooms.

Vance argued during the debate that ""we have to increase security in our schools"" by adding more school resource officers and making doors and windows tougher to breach. Trump's running mate added that the U.S. also needs to get to the root causes of a ""mental health crisis"" that isn't the ""whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem, but I do think it's a big piece of it.""

Walz responded by saying, ""This idea of stigmatizing mental health -- just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes, it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it.""

Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was one of the 17 killed during the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, told Fox News Digital after Tuesday's debate that ""in the 6½ years that I have been working on school safety, what I've learned about how we protect our nation's schools tracks much more closely with the response JD Vance gave than anything Tim Walz said.""

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN

""I don't even know what he means when he says, 'Sometimes it's the guns,'"" Petty said when asked about Walz's remarks. ""It has nothing to do with guns. The causes of school violence are not the freedoms that we enjoy and the rights that we have under the Second Amendment.

""The problem is much deeper and requires a more comprehensive solution, and JD Vance was much closer to the answer. We got to protect our schools. we got to increase the security there. Having more school resource officers on campus as both a deterrent and a last measure to stop an attack once it starts is exactly the blueprint we followed here to protect Florida schools after Parkland,"" he added.

During the debate, Vance said, ""We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And, of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So, we've got to make our schools safer. And I think we've got to have some commonsense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.

""Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids -- it doesn't earn as many headlines -- is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.""

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ DURING DEBATE, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS

""We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,"" Walz said during the debate.

""In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence.

""There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment and the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense.""

WATCH: WALZ ASKS, DO YOU WANT SCHOOLS HARDENED TO LOOK LIKE A FORT?

""No one's trying to scaremonger and say, 'We're taking your guns.' But I ask all of you out there, do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?"" Walz added.

Gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety said in a statement after the debate that ""voters heard two starkly different approaches to America's gun violence crisis: JD Vance, who recently called school shootings a 'fact of life' and thinks the solution to the problem is more guns, or Tim Walz, who will work alongside Vice President Harris to make sure our kids come home safe every night.""

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

However, Gun Owners of America, a Second Amendment advocacy group, told Fox News Digital, ""Knives and hammers kill far more often than the guns Kamala and Tim want to ban.""

""Tragedy is never just the fault of an inanimate object. There is always an evil person responsible -- a criminal who would never abide by any gun laws in the first place,"" said its director of federal affairs, Aidan Johnston. ""That's why Gun Owners of America fights to protect our Second Amendment, which empowers law-abiding citizens to fight back and to protect themselves and their loved ones from becoming the next victim.""

Second Amendment Foundation Executive Director Adam Kraut added, ""The Harris-Walz campaign has made clear over and over again their intent to demonize peaceable gun owners and ban and confiscate the most popular guns in America.""

Randy Kozuch, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, also told Fox News Digital in a statement that ""Kamala Harris and Tim Walz make up the most anti-gun presidential ticket in modern history.""

A letter from 73 lawmakers, led by Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland said they were ""deeply concerned"" by reports of noncitizens registering to vote and voting in federal elections and had not received a response from an inquiry in July on the matter.

""As of today, there has been no response from you or your Department regarding the inquiry on July 12, 2024, seeking information on efforts undertaken by your Department to enforce laws prohibiting non-citizen voting. Given that the 2024 Presidential Election is in less than 34 days, your Department's inaction and refusal to provide any information regarding its efforts to promote public trust and confidence in our elections is especially alarming,"" they wrote.

Specifically, they asked how many aliens have been prosecuted under laws related to noncitizen voting, how the DOJ handles allegations of noncitizen voting or registration and the steps it takes to prevent such practices.

Noncitizens are not allowed to vote, and top Republicans, including former President Trump, have repeatedly expressed concern that noncitizens may attempt to vote in federal elections, particularly given the influx of immigrants across the southern border in recent years.

DOJ: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT STOLE US CITIZEN'S IDENTITY TO VOTE IN MULTIPLE ELECTIONS, OBTAIN AMERICAN PASSPORT

In August, Republican lawmakers pushed for the SAVE Act, which aimed to require states to obtain proof of citizenship in person when registering an individual to vote and require states to remove noncitizens from voter rolls, to be attached to a spending bill extension to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year.

The lawmakers in the letter cited an announcement by the Virginia attorney general that it had identified 6,303 noncitizens on its voter rolls in 2022 and 2023, while Texas had removed 6,500 noncitizens from its voter rolls. Of those, 1,930 had a history of voting.

The DOJ itself announced last month that it had charged an illegal immigrant with stealing a U.S. citizen's identity to vote in multiple elections and fraudulently obtain a U.S. passport.

""Clearly, there is a non-negligible amount of voter participation by non-citizens in federal elections, which is not only a serious threat to the integrity of our elections and the democratic process they represent, but also has the potential to reduce Americans' trust and confidence in election results,"" they wrote.

It also asks what steps the department is taking to prosecute noncitizens registered to vote in the 2024 election. Fox News Digital reached out to the DOJ for comment.

This week, the DOJ sued Alabama, alleging the state removed voters who had been issued noncitizen identification numbers from its election rolls too close to Election Day. The agency argued that officials violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states to complete any changes to the voter registration lists no later than 90 days before federal elections.

(Credit: CBS)

And there's no question that JD Vance easily won the vice presidential debate. Tim Walz did better than anticipated - perhaps those expectations were deliberately set low - but despite some strong counterpunching, he frequently stumbled.

Each man had a mission: to defend his running mate and rough up the opposing presidential candidate.

But Vance had a second goal beyond talking up Donald Trump, and that was softening his own image. He made a concerted effort to project empathy, to appear reasonable, to be open to opposing viewpoints.

VOTERS REACT TO GOV TIM WALZ DODGING TIANANMEN SQUARE QUESTION: 'I'M A KNUCKLEHEAD AT TIMES'

There is a caricature of the Ohio senator as a hard-right ideologue with little sympathy for women, as reflected by the famous childless cat ladies comment. But when the subject of abortion came up, he went out of his way to sound sympathetic to the pro-choice side:

""I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight and I love you.

""And she told me something a couple of years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party? We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us.""

(Vance's website describes him as ""100 percent pro-life."")

Walz countered with specific stories of women who died or whose health was damaged because they lived in states that tightly restrict abortion.

The Minnesota governor hit his talking points, but regularly took a long time to get to his main argument. A question about Kamala Harris' plan to build 3 million housing units produced a detour about how Walz has only bought one home.

WATCH: VOTERS REACT IN REAL TIME TO KEY VANCE-WALZ DEBATE MOMENTS ON IMMIGRATION, DEMOCRACY, ABORTION

Walz often spoke in a clipped shorthand - the ACA, Springfield, Vance creating stories - without explaining, for instance, that he meant the false tale of Haitian migrants eating pets.

The CBS moderators, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, edged into ABC territory by fact-checking only Vance, despite saying they would try to avoid that. After the senator referred to illegal immigrants in the Ohio town, Brennan said Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected."" That's a point Walz should have made, but didn't.

Many questions were framed from the left. ""Senator Vance,"" said Brennan, ""you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s.""

Walz's worst moment was one he should have anticipated, a story in the New York Times and elsewhere saying he was not in China for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as he had claimed, but got to Hong Kong months later. The governor began with a word-salad answer about growing up in Nebraska before retreating to ""I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Pressed again, he said he had misspoken.

Vance's worst moment was about Jan. 6. O'Donnell began, ""You have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors that has been called unconstitutional and illegal.""

POLITICS HIJACKS HURRICANE DEVASTATION IN THE SOUTH, BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A LIAR

The senator countered that Trump ""said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January the 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House.""

This time Walz was ready. Trump ""lost this election and he said he did. 140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died.""

He turned to Vance and said: ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

When Vance tried the ""focused on the future"" line again, Walz called that ""a damning non-answer.""

But Vance largely came off as a Bush-style compassionate conservative. He must figure that win or lose, he'll be running for president in 2028 and needed to combat all the negative coverage.

Walz looked like a man who was happy to survive his turn on the national stage. The debate would have looked very different if Harris had picked Josh Shapiro, given that she's tied with Trump in Pennsylvania.

The Harris campaign has bubble-wrapped Tim Walz, not allowing him to do a single solo interview. JD Vance is constantly doing interviews, podcasts and press conferences, the best kind of preparation for a big debate. And that, in the end, may have been the difference."

Former first lady Melania Trump said the 2024 presidential election differs from previous elections because the country is much more divided.

""We are dealing with much more danger,"" she said Wednesday on ""Hannity."" ""And especially, we see what's going on in the world and the threats that we get. And my husband, what he went through in the last few months,"" Melania continued, referring to the two attempted assassination attempts on former President Trump's life.

Would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks fired several shots at the GOP presidential nominee during his Butler, Pa., rally in July before he was shot and killed by a counter sniper.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: WHISTLEBLOWERS CLAIM THEY WERE 'WOEFULLY UNPREPARED' TO PROVIDE SECURITY

A few months later, Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old from Hawaii, was spotted by a Secret Service advance agent poking a rifle out of the tree line near Trump's West Palm Beach golf course. He's since been charged with the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate, among a slew of other charges.

Melania told Fox News host Sean Hannity that people need to learn to listen to each other again and respect differences of opinion.

""I think we need to have - we have different perspectives, we have different beliefs. We need to respect our freedom of speech and of our individuality. I think it's very important that ideas are heard, that we have very, very straightforward communications, and we share the idea with debate,"" the former first lady said.

""Because I think with that, we could have innovation and success in this country. I feel it's a troubling trade in this country that we are canceling people that don't agree on certain issues.""

Melania admitted the election cycle is a long and grueling process, particularly in the weeks and days leading up to November, but she's ""in it"" and tries to ""enjoy it"" as much as she can.

""You need to be very focused and take it day by day. Some surprises come as well, so it is very important that you prepare for those surprises,"" she said, adding her calmness is what gets her through Election Day itself.

""That's maybe my personality. And because I know on Election Day, it's all in the people's hands. People decide what they want for this country, and it will be again this year on November 5th.""

'Outnumbered' panel discusses concerns with DOJ releasing Ryan Routh's letter to the public.

Federal prosecutors requested an indefinite delay Wednesday in scheduling the trial for Ryan Routh, the suspect in the second assassination attempt on former President Trump, citing an enormous amount of evidence gathered since his arrest.

In a filing on Wednesday, prosecutors asked Florida District Judge Aileen Cannon to officially designate Routh's case as ""complex.""

Prosecutors revealed the scope of the investigation, which spanned multiple states, involved hundreds of interviews and included hundreds of digital media for review.

""The government has worked diligently since September 15 to investigate the incident. Over the past two weeks, the United States has interviewed hundreds of witnesses,"" the filing said. ""It has also executed 13 search warrants in Florida, Hawaii, and North Carolina, and seized hundreds of items of evidence, including multiple electronic devices.

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS FORMALLY CHARGE SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH WITH ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF TRUMP

Investigators claimed that they have more than 100 outstanding subpoena returns that are still pending, and they estimate that they have ""thousands of videos to review"" from the large volume of electronic devices seized.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT WROTE CHILLING LETTER MONTHS BEFORE GOLF COURSE PLOT

""All videos, still images, text files, and audio files constitute approximately 4,000 terabytes (4 million gigabytes) of digital review to complete,"" the filing said.

The filing noted that the FBI is continuing to conduct forensic tests on evidence, including ballistic testing, and fingerprint and DNA comparisons, saying that the evidence would likely include them preparing several expert witnesses to testify.

Due to the sheer amount of evidence collected, prosecutors asked Cannon for the trial to be delayed indefinitely to allow adequate time for parties to review the discovery and determine which motions need to be filed.

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT ROUTH NOT TO BE RELEASED

The government also requested that the motion deadlines, calendar call, and trial date set be delayed indefinitely. According to the filing, Routh's defense attorneys did not oppose prosecutors' request to delay the trial date.

Routh is facing attempted assassination charges. He was previously charged federally with possessing a gun with a scratched-out number and with possessing a gun illegally as a felon. He was ordered by a federal judge to remain in custody.

On September 15, Routh allegedly hid in the bushes outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach with a rifle as Trump was playing.

Authorities said a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of the gun sticking out and immediately opened fire. Routh allegedly took off, but was arrested a short time later."

JESSE WATTERS: The VP debate last night told you everything you needed to know about Kamala Harris: She has terrible instincts.

Tim Walz was supposed to be a normal Midwestern White guy and said this ...

... What? Kamala's right-hand man told 40 million people he has become friends with school shooters, but he wasn't finished. ...

...

Kamala hired a knucklehead who's friends with school shooters to be a heartbeat away from the presidency? You can call that coup insurance. The assistant coach fumbled the ball twice in the first half and never recovered.

The Democrats wanted an attack dog, and they got a bald basset hound nodding along to everything Vance said. Walz kept agreeing that American workers needed to be protected against cartels and Big Pharma. Good. And instead of appreciating American unity, the media said, ""C'mon, coach, just play the race card.""

Civility was a mistake. That's what the Democrats are saying. Walz was Minnesota nice instead of Minnesota nasty. He must not have gotten the memo. You can't be civil to a dictator. And not to be superficial, but did you know Walz is the same age as Greg [Gutfeld]? Kamala says she's the new generation of leadership.

""Some people have been talking s--t, because it's election time in America. Saying, 'ooh Maya, suddenly everything you've been in your life, you're not it.'

On Wednesday, a day after the massive attack and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack, Biden briefly spoke with reporters before boarding Air Force One.

He said all the leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

""We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us [G7 nations] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond proportionally,"" he said.

The recent assault on Israel follows the Biden administration souring on the prospects of an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""No deal is imminent,"" one U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not sure it ever gets done.""

During Tuesday's vice presidential debate with Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Democrat nominee Vice President Harris' ""steady leadership"" in the region is necessary.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed,"" he said.

""And as the vice president said today, we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences,"" he said.

Vance voiced support for GOP nominee former President Trump's ""peace through strength"" policy toward Israel.

""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you need peace through strength,"" Vance said. ""They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

Well, I don't say this too often, but Sen. McConnell was right, but this was a hard choice. It was controversial.

Former President Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday for having ""disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference"" after a key filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith's election case against him was unsealed with just weeks before Americans cast their ballots.

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing Wednesday afternoon. The filing lays out his case and the alleged evidence he intends to use in an eventual trial against Trump.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges brought by Smith.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S ELECTION CASE

But Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday evening.

""For 60 days prior to an election, the Department of Injustice is supposed to do absolutely nothing that would taint or interfere with a case,"" Trump posted in all capital letters to his Truth Social. ""They disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference.""

""I did nothing wrong, they did!"" he continued.

DOJ practice during an election year has often been to hold off on major actions in cases that could impact elections during the 60 days leading up to Election Day, an unwritten policy commonly referred to as the ""60-day rule."" The ""rule,"" which is really more of a tradition because it is not an actual rule, has been cited many times in recent years.

""The case is a scam, just like all of the others, including the documents case, which was dismissed!""

Trump was pointing to the other case Smith brought against him related to classified records. The case was tossed out by a federal judge in Florida who ruled that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel.

The former president further blasted Democrats, saying they are ""weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they I know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing candidate, Kamala Harris.""

Trump said the unsealing of the Smith filing, which he called the ""latest 'hit job,'"" happened because his running mate, Sen. JD Vance ""humiliated"" Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate.

Trump said the Justice Department ""has become nothing more than an extension of Joe's, and now Kamala's, campaign.""

TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY

""This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,"" Trump said. ""The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country that tries to censor, harass, and intimidate their Political Opponents. What they have done to our Justice System is one of the Great, All Time, Tragedies.""

The former president added that the Democrat Party ""is guilty of the Worst Election Interference in American History.""

""They are trying to DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY, allowing millions of people to enter our Country illegally. They are determined to stop us from winning back the White House, sealing the Border, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT THEY WILL FAIL, AND WE WILL SAVE OUR NATION!"" Trump posted.

Trump also blasted Smith as ""deranged,"" and said that he, the ""Harris-Biden DOJ, and Washington, D.C. based Radical Left Democrats, are ""HELL BENT on continuing to Weaponize the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power.""

""'TRUMP' is dominating the Election cycle, leading in the Polls, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are totally 'freaking out.' This entire case is a Partisan, Unconstitutional, Witch Hunt, that should be dismissed, entirely, just like the Florida case was dismissed!"" Trump said.

Trump's comments came in response to Smith's newly-unsealed filing, in which he alleges Trump ""resorted to crimes to try to stay in office"" after losing the 2020 presidential election.

""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,"" Smith wrote.

""His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.""

Smith claims that the ""throughline of these efforts was deceit,"" claiming Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.""

The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH

Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the Supreme Court ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court's ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the new indictment as well.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital the release of the ""falsehood-ridden, unconstitutional J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz's disastrous debate performance is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American Democracy and interfere in this election.""

""Deranged Jack Smith and Washington DC Radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,"" Cheung said. ""President Trump is dominating, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are freaking out.

""This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.""

JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota jumped back on the campaign trail with stops in two crucial battleground states.

As he arrived at the airport near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, Walz pointed toward his debate hours earlier with Vance and told reporters, ""New York City was a little crazy last night.""

Most pundits said Vance was the more polished of the two candidates on the vice presidential debate stage Tuesday night, although flash polls indicated debate watchers were mostly divided on which running mate was victorious.

An accidental response by Walz during the debate quickly went viral, as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate mistakenly said he had ""become friends with school shooters.""

The mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

Asked to clarify his debate gaffe, Walz said Wednesday, ""I'm super passionate about this. The question came up about the school shooting. We're talking about everything except school shootings. And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound movement.

""David Hogg [a leading gun control activist and school shooting survivor] is a good friend of mine.""

VANCE, WALZ, SPAR OVER ISSUES AT VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Walz acknowledged ""I need to be more specific on that. But I am passionate about this.""

Vance, speaking at a rally in Auburn Hills, Michigan, said he didn't hear Walz's comment until he was told about it during a conversation with his running mate, former President Trump, after the debate.

""He said that Tim Walz said that he was friends with school shooters twice,"" Vance said, referencing his conversation with Trump. ""And that's something I actually didn't notice that Tim Walz had said that on the debate stage.

""I said, 'Did he really say that, sir?' And he [Trump] said, 'I'm telling you, man, go and watch the clips.'

HARRIS, BIDEN, HEAD TO STORM-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP TRIP

""And I said that was probably only the third or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night.""

The debate moderators also confronted Walz on his claim to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, China.

Walz admitted he traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 massacre, adding he can be ""a knucklehead at times.""

The governor on Wednesday reiterated that he had his ""dates wrong.""

Trump, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News' Brooke Singman, called his running mate's performance ""fantastic"" and that it had ""reconfirmed my choice.""

The former president also argued that Walz had ""embarrassed himself"" during the debate.

Another major moment in the debate came near the end, when Vance wouldn't say that President Biden won the 2020 election over Trump. The former president for four years has repeatedly made unproven claims that the election was rigged and rampant with voter fraud.

Walz, on Wednesday, once again emphasized that ""it is disqualifying to not acknowledge that the 2020 election was won by Joe Biden. It's as simple as that.""

An hour later, speaking to a large crowd at a rally at the York Fairgrounds, Walz charged that ""you can't rewrite history. And trying to mislead us about Donald Trump's record. That's gaslighting.""

Vance, asked about his avoidance of answering the 2020 election question during the debate, reiterated his charge on Wednesday that ""the simple reason"" is that ""the media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense, economic policies.""

Walz arrived at his rally in York to cheers as he pulled into the York Exposition Center riding his campaign bus.

But York is Trump country. The former president won York County by roughly 25 points over Biden in 2020.

Walz's Pennsylvania swing through Harrisburg, York and Reading kicked off what the Harris campaign described as a more aggressive post-debate travel and voter engagement blitz by the governor, with stops in two other battleground states -- Arizona and Nevada -- and a fundraising blitz in Ohio, California and Washington

And the campaign noted that Walz would participate in more media interviews. Vance has done dozens of interviews and repeatedly fielded questions from reporters on the campaign trail since Trump named the senator as his running mate 2½ months ago.

Vance made the first of his two stops in Michigan in Auburn Hills, at Visioneering, an automotive industry tool supplier.

Auburn Hills is in Oakland County, which has swung heavily toward the Democrats in recent election cycles. Biden carried the county by roughly 14 points over Trump four years ago.

Michigan and Pennsylvania are two of seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Trump or Harris win the 2024 presidential election.

He would help him, and he would have helped him last time overturn an American democratic election,"" Karl said.

He added, ""You finally got to that at the end. But, for the first 90 minutes or so, this looked like it is simply a campaign about policy differences. And it's really not, George. It is more than that.""

During the debate, Walz confronted Vance over his stance on the results of the 2020 election.

""This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say - he is still saying he didn't lose the election,"" Walz said. ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

""Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?"" Vance responded.

Walz called it a ""damning non-answer.""

According to the Fox News Debate Dial, the dials for independents and Democratic voters dropped significantly at Vance's answer on whether former President Trump lost the 2020 election, with independents seeing the sharpest decline.

""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,"" Smith wrote.

""His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6m 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.""

Smith claims that the ""throughline of these efforts was deceit,"" claiming Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital that the release of the ""falsehood-ridden, Unconstitutional J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz's disastrous debate performance is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American Democracy and interfere in this election.""

""Deranged Jack Smith and Washington DC Radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,"" Cheung said. ""President Trump is dominating, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are freaking out.""

Cheung added: ""This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes."""
298,Trump ups his ante with September fundraising haul,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ups-his-ante-september-fundraising-haul,2024-10-02T20:25:46Z,"Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley expressed confidence to Fox News Digital about having resources to get GOP message to voters.

Former President Trump's campaign said on Wednesday that they hauled in over $160 million in fundraising in September, in figures shared with Fox News.

The haul by the former president's campaign is up from the roughly $130 million that Trump's various fundraising committees brought in during the month of August.

Trump faces a large fundraising deficit to Vice President Kamala Harris, with just under five weeks to go until Election Day in November.

FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AIMS TO FLIP THE SCRIPT ON THE CASH DASH

The Harris campaign announced last month that it raked in a staggering $361 million in August, nearly triple Trump's fundraising.

The Harris campaign has yet to report its September fundraising figures.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION

The Trump campaign, in revealing its fundraising numbers, said that it had $283.1 million cash-on-hand as of the end of September. That's down slightly from the $295 million it had in its coffers a month earlier.

The Harris campaign, in its announcement last month, reported $404 million cash-on-hand.

Trump's team, in releasing their latest figures, showcased their small-dollar grassroots fundraising, saying the average donation they received was $60 and that 96% of their contributions were less than $200.

The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.

Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.

But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in fundraising didn't last and, by early July, began to significantly slow down.

Biden bowed out of the 2024 race July 21, and the party quickly consolidated around Harris, who instantly saw her fundraising soar, spurred by small-dollar donations.

When asked about the fundraising deficit, Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital last month that ""the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money.""

However, he emphasized that ""we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message out to all the voters that we're talking to and feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to see this campaign through, and we're going to win on November 5.""

Fundraising, along with polling, is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used - among other things - to hire staff, expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, pay to produce and run ads on TV, radio, digital and mailers, and for candidate travel."

Despite calls from both sides of the aisle to lower the political temperature following the two assassination attempts against former President Trump, MSNBC host Joy Reid recently claimed that Democratic voters want someone to give him a ""knuckle sandwich.""

Reid employed the violent imagery during MSNBC's vice presidential debate coverage on Tuesday night, telling a network panel that the Democratic base really want someone to engage in a ""fistfight"" with the former president.

""Democrats want to see someone get up there and give a knuckle sandwich to Donald Trump,"" Reid said to the panel, which included fellow MSNBC anchors Nicolle Wallace, Lawrence O'Donnell, Rachel Maddow and others.

A VISIBLY SHAKY WALZ SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS 'STEADY LEADERSHIP'

Reid began her point by stating that Gov. Walz's, D-Minn., vice presidential debate performance seemed tailored to a ""small, narrow group"" of swing voters, who want ""more substance"" from candidates.

""Tim Walz was very detailed and he spoke the way a governor speaks about really specific issues like gun violence, like health care. He was substantive and knowledgeable, so if you are that person who the thing that is keeping you on the fence is you need more details, he gave you more details.""

She continued, explaining that the base of the party prefers to see a brawl between the two candidates, and their preferred leader taking it directly to Trump with heavy blows.

""No. 2, I don't think that small narrow group of people wanted to see a fist fight. And so, I think that the people who want the fist fight are the base of the Democratic Party.""

Reid noted that it isn't the Democratic base that ""needs this debate,"" but those swing voters who do. She argued that Walz delivered in connecting to these people.

""I think the reason that Tim Walz was effective in the way he did it - he wasn't angry, he was disappointed. And that's actually in some ways stronger,"" she said, elsewhere adding, ""Tim Walz gave you that specificity that I think is going to get those people to feel more comfortable"" voting for the Democratic ticket.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Several X users blasted Reid for using the violent imagery against Trump only weeks after he was nearly killed by a second would-be assassin at his golf course in Florida.

Popular conservative account Libs of TikTok criticized the host, stating, ""2 ass*ss*nation attempts and Iran plotting to try to get Trump and Democrats are still calling for violence.""

Conservative commentator Paul Szypula chimed in, stating, ""Joy Reid is an angry person filled with hate. She needs help.""

""Steve Bannon's War Room"" co-host Natalie Winters remarked, ""Wow, @JoyAnnReid just said the quiet part out loud. Democrats want a 'fist fight' and someone to 'give a knuckle sandwich to Trump.'""

The Post Millennial editor-in-chief Libby Emmons commented, ""This is a call for political violence.""

Heavy metal singer and conservative commentator Phil Labonte added, ""there have been two attempts on Donald Trump's life in the past three months."""
300,NEWT GINGRICH: At VP debate a star is born and Trump is vindicated,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-vp-debate-star-born-trump-vindicated,2024-10-02T18:42:02Z,"'Fox News @ Night' panelists Michael LaRosa, Erin Perrine, Lauren Wright, Jennifer Sey, Julie Hamill and Elisha Krauss share their takeaways from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The vice presidential debate on Tuesday night was staggeringly one-sided.

Sen. JD Vance was poised, calm, friendly, likable, and in control of the facts and himself.

By contrast, Gov. Tim Walz began the debate so nervous it was painful to watch. Then he made a series of mistakes which were cumulatively disqualifying. It was hard to believe he is on a national ticket.

VANCE VS. WALZ DEBATE: TOP TAKEAWAYS FROM VP CANDIDATES' FACE-OFF

Callista and I went to bed on Tuesday night convinced that Sen. Vance had won a substantial triumph. In that victory, he also vindicated President Donald J. Trump's gamble in selecting a running mate so early in his career. At 40, with only two years in the U.S. Senate, Vance is only a few months older than Richard Nixon when President Dwight Eisenhower picked him to be the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1952. Nixon would remain a major part of the political scene for 42 years. That would give Sen. Vance a potential role in American government and politics until 2066.

When I got up on Wednesday morning, virtually all the commentaries validated the sense that the debate was something extraordinary.

This new reality was best summarized by Mark Halperin in the Wide World of News newsletter:

""1. One can pretend, as most of the Dominant Media does, that Tim Walz was not 'clobbered' by JD Vance, but, as honest Joe Klein (fully credentialed as second-to-none in contempt for Donald Trump and Vance) told the world, Walz was indeed clobbered, so badly that it 'wasn't as bad as Biden's debilitated performance in June, but it was close.' Remember: Biden's perf[romance] was so bad it ended his candidacy and career.""

Pollster Frank Luntz tweeted that his focus group voted 12 to 2 that Vance had won.

Glenn Greenwald posted on X: ""The most bizarre part of that debate was how Tim Walz repeatedly and flagrantly undercut Dems' core attack on Trump/Vance: that they're ""weird,"" freakish dangers wildly out of the mainstream.

""Everything Walz said treated Vance as a totally normal, reasonable, likable colleague.""

New York Times columnist Ross Douthat posted: ""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012.""

Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume had no regard for the performances of moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, saying they were ""obnoxious"" and made the debate a three-on-one proposition against Vance.

These were just a few. The Trump-Vance campaign collected no fewer than 22 journalists and public figures who agreed that Vance trounced Walz.

Donald Trump Jr. was the third big winner in this debate. He had strongly backed Sen. Vance as a running mate and worked to get his father to pick him. That choice certainly seemed to work out brilliantly.

As Caitlin Doornbos in the NY Post wrote, Gov. Walz's problems started at the beginning.

""Tim Walz got one chance to make a first impression at Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, and blew it before his opponent, JD Vance, even got the chance to speak.""

His nerves clearly kept him from meeting the challenge.

Finally, Gov. Walz said a couple of things that were just weird.

In a clear moment of confusion, he said he'd become ""friends with school shooters."" When asked why he had lied about being at Tiananmen Square during the 1989 suppression and killing of students demonstrating for democracy, Walz ultimately called himself a ""knucklehead"" for simply saying something that was false.

Being the ""knucklehead candidate"" is not a good way to campaign for the last five weeks before the election.

After last night, Sen. Vance is a huge national figure among Republicans and conservatives. He will have much more impact campaigning than he did before the debate.

After Tuesday night, Gov. Walz will be seen by most Americans as someone who is clearly not ready to be president or vice president.

Vice President Kamala Harris's comment that she was exhausted and sleepless when she picked him will now look like a first step toward minimizing his role - and her ability to make decisions under pressure.

Vice President Kamala Harris sidestepped answering directly whether she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem during an unearthed 2016 interview, instead delivering a rambling response that is currently receiving backlash on social media ahead of the general election.

While serving as attorney general of California, Harris joined PBS reporter David Nazar to discuss her Senate run and campaign platforms on issues such as criminal justice reform, the Black Lives Matter movement and the economy in California. During the discussion, Nazar pressed Harris if she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem.

""Should folks stand for the national anthem?"" Nazar asked in the interview, which was published in October 2016.

Harris' response focused on Americans' rights protected in the Constitution, and did not include a direct answer on whether athletes should stand for ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

""We are all, and should be, treated as equals. We articulated those principles in our Constitution. And part of what we decided is what makes a fair and just and noble society in a democracy, a true democracy, is freedom of religion, freedom, right, of association, freedom to organize, First Amendment,"" she responded.

""So, that is part of who we are as a country, and I will defend it to the core, which is that we give people, certain choices in this country.""

PRO ATHLETES WHO STOOD FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM AMID FEVER PITCH TO SUPPORT SOCIAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES

In 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism. The form of protest, which began in Harris' backyard of San Francisco, soon spread to other sports leagues and athletes.

Athletes such as Megan Rapinoe knelt for the anthem ahead of soccer games in 2016, while Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball athlete to kneel during the national anthem in 2017.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The form of protest hit a fever pitch in 2020 following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis during an interaction with police. Scores of athletes knelt ahead of games that year during the anthem, while the NBA unveiled a court painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" amid social justice protests that year, and some Olympians took a knee during the Tokyo Games.

The protests were slammed by conservatives in the U.S., including former President Trump, who ripped the athletes for politicizing games.

TRUMP GIVES TWO-WORD RESPONSE IN REACTION TO NFL PLAYERS KNEELING BEFORE THANKSGIVING DAY GAME

""I think it's been horrible for basketball. Look at the basketball ratings. They're down to very low numbers. People are angry about it. They don't realize.... They have enough politics with guys like me. They don't need more as they're driving down... going up for the shot. They don't need it. There's a nastiness about the NBA about the way it was done too. So I think the NBA is in trouble. It's in big trouble. Bigger trouble than they understand,"" Trump said in 2020.

Trump also posted to X, then Twitter, that kneeling for the national anthem is ""a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag,"" saying the ""game is over"" for him when he spots an athlete kneeling.

Harris' unearthed interview was criticized on social media this week, with OutKick founder Clay Travis saying Harris delivered a ""long jumble of nothingness.""

COLIN KAEPERNICK PROTEST FALLOUT SHOWED 'REALLY HOW A LOT OF THE WHITE PEOPLE SEE US,' NFL LEGEND SAYS

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the 2016 interview, but did not immediately receive a response.

Harris defended athletes who knelt during the anthem in 2017, after she was elected senator, saying they should not be ""threatened or bullied"" for the protest.

""Let's speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied,"" Harris said during an event in Atlanta, the Hill reported at the time.

""When we sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' we rightly think about the brave men and women from all backgrounds who proudly defend the freedom of those they may never meet and people who will never know their names.

JD Vance's performance during the vice-presidential debate.

NBC News' Kristen Welker revealed that Democrats were worried about how ""likable"" Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, came across during Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Welker appeared on NBC's ""Today"" on Wednesday and confessed Democrats had texted her mid-debate ""panicked"" over how Vance's performance could turn the tide on his low favorability ratings.

""Sen. JD Vance clearly knew his challenge was to deal with the likability factor. The fact that in our poll, he's the second most disliked running mate in history. So I was getting texts from Democrats panicked, quite frankly, who were saying, 'Wow, he's really moderating himself on these issues. He's the most likable he's ever been,'"" the ""Meet the Press"" host said.

Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced off against Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday, at their first and likely only debate before the November election. Media critics later called the debate in Vance's favor, saying Walz appeared ""unsteady"" and ""nervous"" compared to Vance's ""smooth"" demeanor.

REACTIONS ROLL IN FOR VP DEBATE AS CRITICS GIVE VANCE A WIN OVER WALZ

However, Welker noted that Democrats saw a weakness in Vance dodging a question from Walz about whether he agreed with former President Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election.

""Yet, that moment at the end where Gov. Walz pressed him on whether he accepts whether former President Trump lost the election and he said, 'Let's focus on the future' -- they are going to try to make that into a flash point,"" Welker said.

""They're already in the process of turning that into an ad. They believe that is going to be a way to really try to appeal to that very small sliver that is still undecided, but moderate, independent, suburban voters,"" she continued.

Voters in a Fox News focus group showed mixed reactions to that exchange in the debate.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS: 'CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

Several media pundits still agreed that Vance won the overall debate.

""Vance is going home tonight with Walz's wallet. Vance didn't even have to snatch it, Walz just handed it over, along with a bunch of unearned compliments to Vance's fine character,"" The Atlantic's David Frum posted on X.

""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012,"" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat said.

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN: 'YOUR MICS ARE CUT'

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

The frequent MSNBC guest also weighed in on criticisms that the debate was boring, which he said will be a ""referendum"" on what people want going forward.

""I think the big theme of this thing was that it was very congenial, and it was not a blood sport,"" he said. ""It was not UFC. It was more like boxing. And if the American public -- your intuition says, well, the American public is ready for that, they want that, but then I kind of said to myself, is there this sick, twisted thing that people are addicted to the sick entertainment value of Donald Trump, and that they were kind of disappointed?""

""It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring,"" used to just be a nursery rhyme. Today it is the frightening reality of our lack of leadership in the White House, as President Joe Biden old-man shuffles his way to the end of his misbegotten and only term as president.

On Wednesday, October 2, Biden is finally set to visit the site of devastation in North Carolina wrought by Hurricane Helene, even if he has to skip a nap or two. This comes amid real concerns that the federal response is lackluster and insufficient.

Then there is the ongoing war in the Middle East, which on Tuesday, October 1, saw Iran launch the largest ballistic missile attack in human history against Israel. This, despite the fact that, on several occasions when Biden seemed half cogent, he warned the mullahs by sternly saying, ""Don't""

BIDEN HAS 'PRIVATELY COMPLAINED' ABOUT HOW QUICKLY DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED ON FROM HIM: REPORT

Well, they did anyway. And while, thankfully, owing to the military might of Israel and America, the Iranian onslaught carried all the devastation of a Nerf gun fight, it was still a slap in the face of our feckless president.

As if those two disasters weren't enough, this same week has also seen the International Longshoremen's Association go on strike from Maine to Texas, shutting down the supply line for everything from batteries to bananas, despite Biden's claim that a deal would be worked out.

Of all these crises, these latter may be the most devastating to Scranton Joe because it is something that, in his prime, Biden would have been able to clean up faster than a Swiffer.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

This is why president by committee doesn't work. Longshoremen might have trusted Biden; they do not trust the faceless deep state blob that rules us today.

Americans know they currently have no functioning president, and have for some time. In August, Sam, a restaurateur in San Francisco told me, ""I don't know who's running the country, but it's not him."" In Virginia, Sarah, a Democrat, simply said, ""It's sad, but he's just gone.""

To be blunt, this situation is incredibly dangerous. We heard almost nothing from our president as Iran attempted to start World War III. Instead, we saw National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the White House podium, the very man whose incompetence helped light the match of this conflagration.

You remember Sullivan, he was the guy who said days before the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that the Middle East was quieter than it had been in two decades.

Amazingly, Sullivan, who shouldn't even be managing a Dairy Queen, much less American foreign policy, still has his job. And why? Because he doesn't have a boss. Nobody in the administration does. I'm not convinced Biden can recognize Jake Sullivan, much less fire him.

It really is a fine mess the Democrats have gotten us into. The president is incapable of fulfilling his duties, and his vice president is now running for president. And by running, I mean as far away from Grandpa Joe as she can get.

In a sane world, our senile commander in chief would step down, and Vice President Kamala Harris would take the reins. But that can't happen because, if it did, she would suddenly be responsible for the haywire state of world and domestic affairs and might actually have to do a serious interview or two.

For all intents and purposes, the United States of America has no president. But what we do have is a host of crisis-level situations at home and abroad that are not being competently addressed.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

For four more months, until either former President Donald Trump or Kamala Harris is sworn in as president next year, our ship of state has no captain. And rudderless, it is at significant risk of capsizing.

Joe Biden has gone to bed, he's wrong in the head, and he doesn't start work until 10 in the morning. Our allies know it. Far worse, our foes know it, and as usual, it is the American people who are suffering.

In a normal world, Joe Biden would have stepped down by now, and he'd be free to lay on the beach in Delaware all day, which he does anyway. But these are not normal times, so until January 20, the best we can do is cross our fingers and hope for the best."
307,"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace claimed on Tuesday that the ""worst moment"" for Sen. JD Vance in the vice presidential debate was when he attempted to ""mansplain"" over muted mics, and argued the moment was specifically bad for female voters.

""I actually think if you're a woman, that might be the worst moment JD Vance had, because he was going to mansplain right over that mute button. He was, and again, I don't pretend to know how everyone will react to this. I think that a lot of women, in positions of authority that should command respect just by virtue of that dynamic, will see themselves and some do, the direspect of them and talked over,"" she said.

Vance called out the debate moderators, CBS' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, during the debate for fact-checking him during the debate after he brought up migrants in Springfield, Ohio. The moderators eventually muted his microphone as he was trying to talk.

She compared the moment to the debate Vice President Kamala Harris had with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, when Harris said, ""I'm speaking.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""There was this real belief that what he had to say was more important than the debate rules and the moderators,"" she said.

Wallace also praised the debate moderators for using ""their mic muting power.""

The Trump campaign ripped Wallace in a statement to Fox News Digital, calling her an ""unhinged idiot who beclowned herself by acting like a crazy person."" ""She's a joke and nobody takes her seriously,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said to Fox Digital.

Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance pushed back. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Walz attempted to argue with him.

The media criticized Walz following the debate for what they deemed was a lack of preparation.

The New York Post editorial board criticized CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan on Tuesday after the vice presidential debate moderator attempted to fact-check Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, for his comments on illegal immigration.

During the debate, Brennan interjected when Vance suggested that illegal immigrants had overwhelmed government resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

The Post editorial board wrote that Vance was ""accurately describing"" the migrant crisis, calling Brennan's attempted fact-check ""ridiculous.""

""It was made all the more partisan by the fact that when Gov. Tim Walz told the howler that 'illegal border crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office,' which is not even close to true, no one let out of a peep. Some 'facts' are too good to check,"" they continued.

The board later suggested the interaction was a nationally televised example of how the media's ""obsession"" with misinformation and fact-checks is a ""load of horse manure.""

Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday said he wanted to focus on the future when asked about former President Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election - an answer that drew negative reactions from some voters, according to the Fox News Debate Dial.

Vance was asked by Democratic candidate Gov. Tim Walz whether Trump lost the 2020 election, something that Trump has repeatedly denied, and which led to the protests on Jan 6, 2021.

""This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say - he is still saying he didn't lose the election,"" Walz said. ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

Vance attempted to put the ball back in Walz's court.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?"" he responded.

Walz called it a ""damning non-answer.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance said, going on to say that there were ""problems"" in 2020.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

""But you guys attack us for not believing in democracy,"" Vance then said. ""The most sacred right under the United States democracy is the First Amendment. You yourself have said there's no First Amendment right to misinformation. Kamala Harris wants to use the power of government and Big Tech to silence people from speaking their minds. That is a threat to democracy that will long outlive this present political moment.""

""I would like Democrats and Republicans to both reject censorship. Let's persuade one another. Let's argue about ideas, and then let's come together.""

As he spoke, the Republican dials increased significantly, the independent dial improved slightly and Democrats' approval stayed generally the same.

Tim Walz ""embarrassed himself"" during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while Sen. JD Vance's steady presentation ""reconfirmed"" his choice to make the senator from Ohio his running mate.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning, hours after Vance, R-Ohio, and Walz faced off in the CBS News vice presidential debate in New York City. The two sparred on issues like foreign policy, border security, abortion and climate change, while introducing themselves and their records to the American people.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""JD was fantastic last night -- it just reconfirmed my choice,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""There was a brilliance to what he did.""

""On the other hand, Tim Walz proved to be a man that doesn't have it in any way shape or form for the office that he is seeking, though I would put him a large number of steps above Kamala,"" Trump said.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee said Walz ""embarrassed himself and the Democrat Party last night but was made to look even worse by JD's brilliant performance.""

""This is what the country needs; smart people, not people that can't put two sentences together,"" Trump said. ""We have to take our country back.""

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs. Tuesday began with nearly 50,000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said, ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys.""

Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last 3½ years? And the answer is, your running mate, not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, saying he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves, ""When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border, a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no, told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them, hopefully, are at homes with their families.

""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now."""
312,"Vance oozed confidence compared to jittery Walz, body language expert says: 'Captain of the ship'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-oozed-confidence-compared-jittery-walz-body-language-expert-says-captain-ship,2024-10-02T15:31:39Z,"Body language expert Carole Lieberman, M.D., weighs in on Vance-Walz VP Debate.

Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought together two candidates with different visions for the future of America.

Their body language also sharply contrasted with one another as Vance espoused a sense of calmness and command of the issues, whereas Walz appeared nervous and overly fidgety at times, although he did manage to find his stride later in the debate, body language expert Carole Lieberman, M.D., tells Fox News Digital.

""What JD Vance had that made him most likable and most trusted was that he was authentic... you could just say it in one word. JD Vance was authentic. He did big hand movements and so on, but they were just to explain what he was saying,"" Lieberman said.

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN: 'YOUR MICS ARE CUT'

""JD Vance came across as being very steady, like you can kind of see him as a captain of the ship, and he wasn't too stiff, but you knew what you were going to get. Each time he seemed sure of himself... And so you felt like you would be safe with him. He gave an air of stability,"" Lieberman added.

That ran counter to Walz, whom Lieberman said was anxious and jittery, particularly at the beginning of the debate.

""With Tim Walz, he was all over the place. He was very nervous, and he also had body language signs of lying. His body language was discordant with what he was saying. It was like too much, it made you feel exhausted and scared.""

Lieberman says Walz fumbled his question about being in Tiananmen Square for the deadly protests in the spring of 1989. Walz previously said he was in Hong Kong during the protests, but Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets report that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy. Walz initially tried to talk around the question but eventually admitted he ""misspoke"" after calling himself a ""knucklehead at times.""

""He was so defensive, he was just talking in circles and didn't want to admit that he had lied. If he had said that at the very beginning, it would have been more honest.""

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

Lieberman says body language plays an important role in debates, as people may not give their full attention to the entire debate and some topics interest people more than others.

She says 40-year-old Vance came across as the more experienced politician, even though he has only served in the Senate since January 2023, whereas Walz served in Congress from 2007 to 2019 before going on to be governor of Minnesota.

""[Walz] seemed like he was the new politician, like he was just trying to figure these things out. He was always looking down... I mean yes, it's OK to take notes when you're talking but... he was frantically taking notes like, 'Oh man I better say that' and 'This is the answer to that.' It really didn't seem to help him much, but I think it was a nervous compensation.""

""Whereas with JD you could see the Yale debater,"" Lieberman said.

""He obviously has had... years and years of practice, debating in college and as a lawyer and so on. You read about or heard about both of them practicing, but if it's coming from an authentic place, you don't really have to practice that much. You know what you want to do and you just say it. Whereas if you're hiding things by squirreling around, then you do have to practice to make sure you don't say that, or you do say that. And that's kind of how it came across.""

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. During the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

Commentators on both sides of the political spectrum largely agreed that Vance won the debate with a more polished performance in what was a highly policy-driven event devoid of personal attacks. The pair were seen shaking hands and chatting immediately after the debate.

Lieberman says Vance was confident in prosecuting the case for the Trump ticket and was comfortable arguing the issues the Republican Party stands for.

""He wanted to 'Let's go, I can't wait to do this, I'm going to do it'... he's Trump lite,"" Lieberman said. ""It's kind of the authenticity that I want to take care of America, I want to make America great again, all of that just came through naturally and by the end, you just kind of wanted him to push Tim Walz away. 'You're making me nervous' kind of thing and with JD Vance you just kind of felt 'OK, that's good.'""

Lieberman says it appears that Walz's strategy was to blame Trump, in large part, for many of the issues or cite Trump when responding to answers, and when that line of response became ineffective, he appeared lost.

""Walz was nervous, in parts, and then he had some signs of lying, like, for example, fidgeting. Mainly his movements were discordant with what he was saying. These puppy dog looks at Vance did him in, in my opinion... He was practicing what to say bad about Trump and that was not a good plan.""

""Throughout the 90 minutes, you would find yourself getting more and more nervous, anxious, irritated by Tim Walz, whereas you were beginning to feel calmer and as though things were going to be OK with JD Vance. And even if you couldn't hear the words that they were speaking and you were just watching them, this is how you would feel."""

""Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big beautiful wall, and Mexico will pay for it.

Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris each travel to the storm-ravaged Southeast on Wednesday, as the death toll and devastation from Hurricane Helene soars and a couple of million people remain without power and running water.

Over 160 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast. The storm sparked millions of power outages and billions of dollars in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

As the floodwaters from the storm receded, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lamented that in the western part of his state ""communities were wiped off the map.""

NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL

North Carolina and Georgia, which was also hard hit by the storm, are two of the seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 election victory over former President Trump and are expected to determine the outcome of the 2024 showdown between Harris and Trump.

And with a margin-of-error race between the vice president and Trump with less than five weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, and with the former president during a trip to the storm-damaged region earlier this week blasting both Biden and Harris over the federal response, the hurricane has become front-and-center in the White House race.

RESCUE MISSIONS UNDERWAY IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE BRINGS 'HISTORIC' FLOODING, LANDSLIDES

The president on Wednesday heads to North Carolina, where he'll survey damage from a helicopter flight over the city of Ashville, one of the hardest hit areas. Biden will also visit a rescue command center in the state before also stopping in neighboring South Carolina.

""My top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday as he spoke during a Cabinet meeting focusing on the federal response.

Trump this past weekend accused the president of ""sleeping"" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.

And speaking with reporters as he arrived in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, the former president charged that ""the federal government is not being responsive.""

And he falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican.

Pushing back against the political attacks, Biden has noted that he was on the phone with federal, state and local officials throughout the weekend and returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor storm rescue and relief efforts.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON HELENE'S HAVOC

""We had over 1,000 federal personnel, including search and rescue teams, at the ready on the ground before it hit,"" the president said on Tuesday. ""Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the governors, the mayors, the county officials, and all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia.""

And Biden emphasized that his administration has sent ""every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region"" and pledged ""we'll be there until this work is done.""

Trump on Sunday attacked Harris for attending ""fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors"" in California over the weekend. And he argued that Harris ""ought to be down in the area"" where the storm caused destruction.

On Monday during his stop in Georgia, Trump repeated the dig, saying, ""The vice president, she's out someplace campaigning looking for money.""

The White House has highlighted that the vice president over the weekend was on the phone with federal, state and local officials.

Harris said on Saturday that she and the president ""remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.""

On Monday, Harris visited FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she received a briefing on relief and rescue efforts.

""We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover,"" Harris vowed.

Harris on Wednesday travels to Georgia to survey the impacts of the storm and receive an on-the-ground briefing and provide updates on the federal response.

Harris was originally scheduled to take part Wednesday in a campaign bus swing through central Pennsylvania, another key battleground state, with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With the vice president headed to Georgia, Walz will headline the bus tour, which comes the day after he faced off in the running mates debate against Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee.

During his Monday stop in Georgia, Trump highlighted that ""I've come to Valdosta with large semi-trucks, many of them, filled with relief aid. A tanker truck filled up with gasoline, a couple of big tanker trucks filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day.""

And a GoFundMe page set up by the Trump campaign earlier this week has raised nearly $4 million so far for storm victims.

Presidents and vice presidents often don't travel immediately to storm-damaged areas, to prevent their trips from hampering badly needed rescue and relief efforts.

""I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis,"" Biden told reporters on Monday.

And Harris said on Tuesday, ""I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible - but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations, because that must be the highest priority and the first order of business.""

But the optics of Trump's Monday stop in Georgia may have put some political pressure on Biden and Harris.

Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care - they're not doing anything and I think they're reacting to it.""

The response by elected officials to natural disasters can impact their political standing.

President George W. Bush was heavily criticized in the summer of 2005 for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.

And Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island."

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT ON HARRIS

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""Senator, we have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Brennan said before urging O'Donnell again to move on to the next question.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" she added when Vance continued to respond.

Johnson commended Vance for his performance as he went head-to-head against the Minnesota governor, praising him for shedding light on the Biden-Harris administration's ""open"" border policies.

""The immigration policy is basically nonexistent,"" Johnson said. ""They opened the border. They're allowing everyone in. They put out the welcome mat, and the catastrophe that this has been to our country in every metric of public policy, with the fentanyl poisonings of it being the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 49. The trafficking, the fact that JD pointed out so well, they have lost all of these children who came across the border.""

""If a Republican administration had done that, it's all you would see every day, but they try to bury it,"" he continued.

""JD was so good last night because he brought answers, solutions. He talked about policies. He showed us his depth and he came across as just being very reasonable and likable. I just thought he was at his best. He did a great job.""

CBS News announced last week that it would not allow its moderators to partake in any fact checking or correcting live in an effort to avoid the fury sparked by ABC News for its partisan handling of the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

One of Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's biggest debate moments was when he explained his complete reversal of feelings about his running mate.

Vance was asked at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday how he went from calling Trump potentially ""America's Hitler"" and an ""idiot"" to joining the former president's 2024 ticket.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said Tuesday night.

He continued, ""But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on.""

Fox News' Debate Dial audience feedback system showed viewers' approval rates shooting in different directions during Vance's explanation of how he came to be a Trump supporter.

Republican audience approval surged past 80% and at one point even over 90%, maintaining solid support throughout Vance's statement.

Meanwhile, Democratic viewers expressed discontent - ratings from Democrats fell below 40% and at one point bottomed out near 20%.

Vance emphasized that there were mistakes made in the first Trump administration that he wishes could have been handled better, but placed a significant portion of blame on Congress.

""There were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they govern the country.

JD Vance of Ohio, stated that he and former President Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" while responding to a question on the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate stage about climate change, the Fox News Debate Dial showed.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do?

The dial for independents remained flat as Vance moved into criticizing Kamala Harris on energy policy. Support among Democrats took a dive by contrast.

""What have Kamala Harris policies actually lead to more energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world,"" Vance said. ""When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So, if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people.

Vance began his response by recognizing the hurricane as ""an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy"" and recalling a photograph of grandparents and a six-year-old child on a roof that later collapsed, causing those people to lose their lives. ""I'm sure Governor Waltz joins me and saying, our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them,"" Vance said.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan were panned by critics as they moderated Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, the moderators repeatedly did so. Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

The fact-checking by the CBS moderators was slammed by critics.

""The moderators were obnoxious and made it feel like three on one on Vance,"" Fox News' Brit Hume reacted.

Fox News' Laura Ingraham called out the ""smug, arrogant bias"" of the moderators.

""Almost every question was designed to make Republicans look bad, slanting Trump's views on childcare. And yet Vance seemed to take it all in stride. And he really, I think, with most questions, really showed his humanity and also his knowledge of the issues,"" Ingraham said.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Critics also took to social media to pile on the CBS anchors.

""Once again another major media outlet embarrasses themselves on a debate stage,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote. ""In just the first 30 minutes of the CBS debate the moderators have already offered two gratuitous editorial statements, (one of them misleading), taking a shot at JD Vance under the guise of 'fact checking'.""

""CBS literally cut off @JDVance's mic mid-sentence as he was trying to fact-check Tim Walz. They'd never do it if the tables were turned,"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah said.

""Margaret Brennan interrupting JD Vance technically correcting her false fact check of him is a terrible look for @CBSNews,"" conservative strategist Brad Todd said. ""They just cannot help themselves. Democracy Dies in Muted Microphones.""

""What is this CBS bulls---? If you're going to fact check, then say you will. Don't say you won't and then do!"" exclaimed ""Breaking Points"" co-host Saagar Enjeti.

""The way the moderators think it's their job to have the last word on how to frame an issue is amazing,"" Wall Street Journal film critic Kyle Smith quipped.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Fox News' Bill Melugin, who has extensively covered the migrant crisis during the Biden-Harris administration, provided his own fact-check of the debate exchange.

""CBS cuts Vance's mic while he's explaining how the Biden/Harris admin has allowed over 800,000 migrants to enter the U.S. via the CBP One App 'lawfully'. It then sounded like Walz claimed the CBP One app has been used since the 90s, which is completely false,"" Melugin wrote on X. ""The Biden/Harris admin started using it in winter 2023 to begin mass paroling migrants into the country by the hundreds of thousands, typically between 1,300-1,500 every single day.""

Notably, O'Donnell and Brennan cooled off on the fact-checking after they returned from the commercial break.

The backlash the CBS News moderators received resembles the uproar sparked by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis for their partisan moderating during the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Halloween pop-up store chain Spirit Halloween recently slammed iconic sketch-comedy show ""Saturday Night Live"" in an X post this week after the NBC program made fun of the store in a skit last weekend.

The store's official X account trolled SNL with an image of a mock Halloween costume that slammed it as an ""irrelevant 50-year-old TV show"" whose ratings are ""shrinking.""

Spirit Halloween's made the anti-SNL statement just a few days after the show featured a sketch mocking the holiday-themed store.

The sketch - which aired during the premiere episode of the comedy show's 50th season - was a fake commercial for the store that poked fun at it for repurposing the storefronts of shuttered businesses in towns that have hit hard times, only to leave after selling Halloween costumes for six weeks.

""Thanks to us, what used to be a condemned AutoZone where a murder happened is once again a thriving business where a murder happened,"" SNL castmate Michael Longfellow quipped during the sketch while portraying a Spirit Halloween employee.

The official SNL X account shared the sketch to the social media platform with the caption, ""when others leave, Spirit Halloween shows up.""

The holiday store shot back on X on Monday, providing a spoof of its own on the long-running comedy show.

The store shared an image of an ""SNL 50"" costume contained in Spirit Halloween's recognizable orange packaging.

Like Spirit's real-life packages, the spoof featured descriptions of the costume, in this case, negative lines about SNL's 50th season.

The package read, ""Includes: Dated references, Unknown cast members, Shrinking ratings.""

In the post's caption, the store wrote, ""We are great at raising things back from the dead @nbcsnl.""

X users found the feud between the store and the show amusing.

Comedian and author Lou Perez wrote, ""Both the SNL sketch and Spirit Halloween's response are funny. More of this, please.""

Actor Nathan Brimmer mocked the store, commenting, ""Seeing you butthurt over getting properly served on SNL is delicious.""

Comedian Luis J. Gomez praised Spirit, stating, ""Spirit Halloween with the kill shot.""

The latest episode of SNL went viral for other reasons this weekend. Former NBCUniversal senior executive Mike Sington slammed the show for doing a sketch making light of the assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump.

The sketch featured Trump - played by SNL castmember James Austin Johnson - urging his rallygoers to stay as gunshots ripped towards him.

""Where the hell is everyone going? Where are you going? I see you trying to leave, but the doors are locked. Come on back -- we're having fun. We love my rallies, except when someone does the 'bing, bong, bing, bing, bing' right at me,"" Johnson as Trump said, with finger guns.

Sington told Fox News Digital this week, ""I was watching it live, and actually cringed when they mocked the assassination attempts in an effort to be funny. I'm no fan of Trump's, but I thought it was in extremely poor taste.""

Tim Walz called himself a ""knucklehead"" for claiming to have been in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Moderators confronted Walz on the claim during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Tuesday night. Walz admitted that he only traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 massacre. The focus group found that voters were initially skeptical of Walz's answer, but he eventually recovered.

""Can you explain that discrepancy?"" a moderator asked, as the focus group remained neutral.

""Look, I grew up in small rural Nebraska, a town of 400. A town that you rode your bikes with your buddies until the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the national guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it. Young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of '89 to travel to China--35 years ago, to be able to do that,"" Walz said.

The focus group showed support from Republicans, independents and Democrats all going down for Walz during the first portion of his response.

However, Walz recovered among independents and Democrats when he went on to admit that he can be ""a knucklehead at times.""

""Many times I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric,"" he said, as support from independents rose above 50% in the focus group.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping."

In his remarks during last week's United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, claimed that Iran wants to ""live in peace."" He demanded ""a world free of nuclear weapons,"" and declared that Iran ""is ready to disarm,"" if Israel does the same.

But just two weeks prior, Iran and its fellow dictatorship Russia were slapped with new economic sanctions by the Biden-Harris administration for Tehran's delivery of ballistic missiles to Moscow. In fact, the national security community is increasingly concerned about the growing relations between two of America's top adversaries. However, as Team Biden-Harris is hyper-focused on the threat this unholy alliance poses elsewhere in the world - Ukraine, the Middle East - what about us? Is anyone in charge of protecting our homeland?

As a former U.S. intelligence analyst who led Red Teams during war games, my team's job was to come up with, thinking like our adversaries, out-of-the-ordinary ideas - no matter how implausible - that Red Force (Russia, Iran, etc.) could use against Blue Force (U.S. and Allied militaries). The goal was to enable the president, the Pentagon and other decision makers to develop plans for countering our adversaries and protecting the homeland. Here are a few insights, from the intelligence perspective, that make the Iran-Russia threat even bigger than most Americans realize.

First, neither Russian nor Iranian leaders respect the Biden-Harris administration, making them more likely to act more aggressively against the United States. As a clear sign of indifference to Washington's ire, two days after the new sanctions went into effect, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with Ali Ahmadian, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran. In it, he praised the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, for fostering ""additional momentum"" in Russian-Iranian relations and thanked Pezeshkian's team for making the relationship a ""priority."" Five days later, Putin dispatched his top security official, Sergei Shoigu, to Tehran, where Shoigu held secret talks with Pezeshkian.

WHY RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA IS OBSESSING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION AND PRAISING WALZ

Neither Russia nor Iran is afraid of economic sanctions. They've used loopholes in the sanctions regime to circumvent them and found alternative ways to finance their policy priorities and military programs. Despite the fact that the U.S., European Union (EU) and its Western allies banned nearly all Russian imports at the start of the war in Ukraine, Western nations purchased $2 billion worth of Russian oil indirectly through Turkey.

In 2023, the Biden-Harris administration released $6 billion in unfrozen assets to Iran as part of the deal to release five American hostages in exchange for five Iranians held in U.S. prisons. It is almost a certainty that some of those funds were diverted by Iran toward its military programs and to train and equip its proxy terrorist groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.

Sanctions, therefore, are an optics instrument that politicians use to virtue signal that they are doing something in response to hostile foreign activities. They have not and will not change the behavior of our adversaries.

Second, both Putin and the ayatollahs understand that as Team Biden-Harris is focused on European and Ukrainian security, security inside the homeland isn't taken seriously, presenting a vulnerability to be exploited. Explaining the decision for the new sanctions package, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern that Moscow will ""likely use... Iranian ballistic missiles... against Ukraine."" Blinken characterized the weapons trade between Moscow and Tehran as a ""threat to European security.""

The Biden-Harris administration has approved billions of dollars for Ukraine to aid its defense against Russia, even as our own Secret Service is in crisis due to staffing shortages, high levels of turnover, inadequate training and incompetence of some of its personnel.

RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA RATCHETING UP THREATS AGAINST US. WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW

Two failed assassination attempts on former President Trump, during which would-be assassins were able to penetrate the security perimeter of the protectee, clearly demonstrate that the level of protection the Secret Service delivers is low. If security for a former president, with all the law enforcement personnel surrounding him 24/7, can be breached by an amateur, an operative trained and resourced by a state-actor like Iran or Russia, can do so much more damage. It also means that other targets - government buildings, military installations, critical infrastructure - are likely to be equally vulnerable. Saying nothing of soft targets, such as shopping malls and other public spaces.

Third, Russia and Iran have the capabilities and political will to conduct hostile clandestine operations inside the U.S. The recent arrest in New York of a Iranian-linked Pakistani man who plotted to kill American leaders, highly likely including Trump, is just one example of Iran's ongoing policy of infiltrating operatives inside the U.S. for nefarious purposes.

Moreover, according to a 2024 report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran has been developing ""surrogate networks inside the United States"" for ""more than a decade."" This assessment is consistent with a warning contained in another report about Iran's plans to attack strategic security assets and institutions in the U.S. The report, titled ""The Unseen Threat of the Mapping Project,"" claims that Iranian elements have identified 298 American strategic security assets and institutions, as well as personnel, for attacks, kidnappings and assassinations.

Couple this with the fact that Russia, for decades, has been running an ""illegals"" program aimed at maintaining networks of deep-cover sleeper agents inside the United States. In 2010, the FBI had to pull the plug on a 10-year counter-intelligence operation aimed at rooting out such a spy network inside the United States because one of the female spies was moving uncomfortably close in access to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her husband Bill Clinton, and members of their inner circle. The Russians almost certainly keep this program alive, now that the Biden-Harris open border policy has made it so much easier to infiltrate foreign operatives.

The Iranian regime has been funding anti-Israel protests on university campuses across the country. These ostensibly ""grassroots activist"" groups, which sometimes don't know who is behind them, present a vast pool of resources that could be weaponized, with the help of foreign clandestine operatives. What Putin and the ayatollahs want is to foment social unrest inside the United States, consistent with the Russian doctrine of ""controlled instability.""

Fourth, should Russia and Iran join forces in strategic capabilities, the threat to homeland security could be catastrophic. The U.S. government investigation in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks concluded that the government's principal error was a failure to ""connect the dots."" In other words, the pieces of the puzzle were to be found in many corners of the U.S. government. Yet no one connected the dots, making it impossible to predict and preempt the attacks.

We are now living in a similar period. Our security apparatus is stretched thin, with analysts being pulled in many different directions - Ukraine, the Middle East, China. The same failure of imagination that plagued our intelligence in 2001 could prevent us from visualizing an impending threat coming from Iran-Russia cooperation. Below, I will connect the dots.

Putin spokesperson Dmitriy Peskov acknowledged that the two countries are cooperating, including on ""the most sensitive"" areas,"" which he didn't specify. As someone who spent my intelligence career tracking threats to our homeland, here they are - cyber attacks, space warfare and WMD. We are vulnerable in these areas due to our reliance on technology in military operations and civilian life.

Russia has the world's most extensive nuclear know how, some of which it is likely sharing with Iran, which is already extremely close to operationalizing its atomic weapons. Russia is also sharing space launch technology with Iran, helping Tehran place its satellites into orbit. A multi-mission satellite network is a pre-requisite for missile warning, targeting, and command and control, including the employment of nuclear weapons.

Russia has developed a comprehensive suite of counter-space weapons to target U.S. satellites during wartime and electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt the functioning of U.S. satellites in peacetime. Moscow has already used some of these capabilities during its war on Ukraine. It probably will share some of these technologies with Iran, which already has demonstrated jamming capabilities.

U.S. airlines, which rely on GPS for flight navigation, are already concerned about becoming targets of GPS spoofing. Spoofing attacks have surged over the past six months, with most of them originating from electronic-warfare transmitters in Russia, Ukraine and Israel.

Russia already poses a chemical and biological weapons (CBW) threat and retains an undeclared chemical weapons program, having used them at least twice in recent years, according to a 2024 intelligence report. Iran continues ""research and development of chemical and biological agents for offensive purposes."" ""Iranian military scientists have researched chemicals, toxins, and bioregulators, all of which have a wide range of sedation, dissociation, and amnestic incapacitating effects.""

Military ties between Moscow and Tehran are indeed the closest they've ever been, having strengthened dramatically on Biden-Harris' watch. As we are nearing the presidential election and Team Biden-Harris continues to prioritize someone else's security, Americans must decide which future president is more likely to place America's security first."
323,Several questions about Walz's record not asked about during vice presidential debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/several-questions-about-walzs-record-not-asked-about-during-vice-presidential-debate,2024-10-02T11:11:31Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responds to a question on Vice President Harris' handling of the border at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was not asked about several highly talked about news stories in the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday, including his military service, which Walz did not strongly invoke either.

The CBS Vice Presidential Debate in New York City showcased the Republican and Democrat candidates answering questions on a variety of issues, but Walz's military service, which he has faced sharp criticism from Republicans and some veterans for allegedly embellishing, was not asked about.

Walz only briefly mentioned his military service during the debate when he was forced to correct the record on whether he was in China for the Tiananmen Square protests.

At another point in the debate, Walz referred to himself as a ""good soldier.""

Walz was also not asked during the debate about how many times he has visited China.

A VISIBLY SHAKY WALZ SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS 'STEADY LEADERSHIP'

In the past, Walz has claimed he went ""dozens of times"" and once claimed he went ""about 30 times."" This week, the Harris-Walz campaign walked that back and said the actual number is ""closer to 15 times.""

Other questions Walz was not asked during the debate include his disputed claims about his wife's IVF treatment and his claim that he carried weapons ""in war.""

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Walz attempted to argue with him.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Democrats quickly came out in support of Walz's debate performance as it was unfolding, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who said Walz was ""laying down facts.""

""Gov Walz dominating JD Vance on the immigration exchange with undecided voters in a western battleground state,"" David Plouffe, campaign manager and White House Senior Advisor for Barack Obama and Senior Advisor for Kamala Harris for President, posted on X. ""Reminding these voters Donald Trump built only 2 percent of the wall and Mexico didn't pay a dime strongest moment of the debate.""

""JD knocks it out of the park with first question!!! Tim Walz implodes on first question in presentation, communication, and substance,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., wrote on X.

""Senator JD Vance spitting the cold hard TRUTH on the debate stage,"" Trump 2024 national press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X."

Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz faced backlash on social media after he defended an individual healthcare mandate during a back and forth with his counterpart, Republican Sen. JD Vance, in their first and only debate on Tuesday night.

""The question about this of young people, whatever, that's the individual mandate,"" Walz said during a conversation on healthcare and the Affordable Care Act at the CBS News debate in New York City. ""And Republicans fought tooth and nail saying Americans should be free to do this.""

Vance then interjected, asking, ""Tim do you think the individual mandate is a good idea?""

""I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone -- that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn't, it collapses. You are asking pre- ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on health care. People expect it to be there.""

BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN HAS 'FAILED' REPEATEDLY ON HEALTH CARE: ANALYSIS

Walz went on to say that the ACA ""works"" but we can ""continue to do better.""

Walz's comments defending the individual mandate drew criticism on social media, with people pointing out that it was repealed during the Trump administration.

""We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year -- forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans,"" Trump told an audience during the 2018 State of the Union Address.

""We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual mandate is now gone,"" he added.

7 REASONS TO FEAR KAMALA HARRIS' RADICAL 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SCHEMES

""Tim Walz just endorsed reinstating the Obamacare mandate which was a massive tax penalty for Americans who can't afford to buy insurance,"" GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X.

""Oh my god, Walz defending the individual mandate,"" journalist Josh Barro posted on X. ""Does he know there isn't one anymore?""

""Tim Walz doubles down on his support for Obamacare's individual mandate tax, by far the least popular part of Obamacare,"" Americans for Tax Reform Director Mike Palicz posted on X.

""This would violate Kamala's pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400K. Trump Tax Cuts repealed the hated individual mandate tax.""

During the debate, Vance argued, ""Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non-chronically ill, it's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along.""

Fox News Digital reported Monday that Walz has previously voiced his support for single-payer government-run healthcare.

""I think that's probably the path where we end up,"" Walz said in a 2018 debate while running for governor when asked, ""Are you for single-payer?""

""And I say that because, be very clear about this, there were no protections for preexisting conditions before the ACA,"" Walz continued. ""A vote for the ACA was the first time in this nation's history we had those protections and making sure people have that protection, making sure they were covered, and then making sure we were focused on preventative care, people were finally getting that under the ACA, we started to see health outcomes improve and that's the real key to driving down insurance premium prices."""

Former President Donald Trump has weighed in on Pete Rose's potential Hall of Fame induction.

Major League Baseball's all-time hit king died on Monday at the age of 83 due to hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Rose has a complicated legacy, as his stats scream Hall of Fame, but due to gambling while he was a manager, he was placed on baseball's permanently ineligible list.

Two years later, the Baseball Hall of Fame voted in 1991 to ban those on that list from ever being inducted. Thus, he remained a non-Hall of Famer.

The debate is now almost four decades old, and the consensus feeling is that Rose would eventually get into Cooperstown after his death.

That would inevitably be the case, but Trump does not want to wait any longer - he wants Rose in the Hall ""now.""

""The GREAT Pete Rose just died. He was one of the most magnificent baseball players ever to play the game. He paid the price!"" Trump posted on both Truth Social and X during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. ""Major League Baseball should have allowed him into the Hall of Fame many years ago. Do it now, before his funeral!""

LEGENDARY SPORTSCASTER JIM GRAY REMEMBERS MLB GREAT PETE ROSE

MLB, despite the two parties' differences, shared a statement about Rose.

""Major League Baseball extends its deepest condolences to Pete Rose's family, his friends across the game, and the fans of his hometown of Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Montreal and beyond who admired his greatness, grit and determination on the field of play. May he rest in peace,"" the league wrote.

Rose broke out with his hometown Cincinnati Reds, the team he played 19 of his 24 seasons with, three of which he also served as acting manager, in 1963, and he went on to make league history, while securing three World Series titles along the way.

Nicknamed ""Charlie Hustle"" for his relentless drive when on the diamond, Rose was league MVP in 1973, a 17-time All-Star, three-time batting title winner, Rookie of the Year, and World Series MVP in his career. MLB denied all of his requests for reinstatement.

Rose later admitted in 2004 that he did bet on baseball and the Reds, and a June 2015 investigation by ESPN found that Rose did indeed bet on baseball while serving as player and manager for the Reds, with records of the bets made public.

Rose, a switch-hitter, not only leads MLB in all-time hits, but he also has the most games played (3,562), at-bats (14,053), and singles (3,215) recorded. He owned a career .303/.375/.409 slashline with 746 doubles, 1,314 RBI and 160 home runs.

Politico's chief Washington correspondent and Playbook co-author Ryan Lizza is taking a leave of absence after his ex-fiancée, Olivia Nuzzi, accused him of harassment and blackmail in a court filing.

It was revealed last month that Lizza and Nuzzi had previously called off their engagement when news broke that the star New York Magazine writer had been inappropriately involved with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

In the court filing to Washington DC's Superior Court on Tuesday, Nuzzi reportedly claimed in August that Lizza ""explicitly threatened to make public personal information about me to destroy my life, career, and reputation -- a threat he has since carried out.""

""POLITICO and Ryan Lizza have mutually agreed that it is in everyone's best interest for him to step back and take a leave of absence while an investigation is conducted,"" a Politico spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

NEW YORK MAG PUTS REPORTER OLIVIA NUZZI ON LEAVE FOR ALLEGED 'PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP' WITH RFK JR.

Neither Lizza nor Nuzzi immediately responded Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Nuzzi had been placed on leave by New York Magazine last month as a result of the Kennedy revelation.

Nuzzi alleged the harassment began in July and accused Lizza of trying to blackmail her into staying together, according to CNN.

""She said by the next month, Lizza had stolen a personal electronic device from her, was hacking her devices, then anonymously shopping information about her to the media,"" CNN reported. ""Some of the information may have been 'doctored' to hurt her more, Nuzzi alleged, and she believes Lizza impersonated 'an anonymous campaign operative' to give a political campaign information that would hurt her further, according to the court records.""

'THE VIEW' CALLS OUT 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN NY MAG REPORTER'S 'PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP' WITH RFK JR.

Nuzzi also accused Lizza of tipping off her employer about her relationship with RFK Jr. possibly ""through a third party or anonymous channel"" and that he ""threatened her with violence 'to assume his share of financial responsibility' for a joint book contract they had,"" per CNN's reporting.

A judge granted Nuzzi's request, temporarily barring Lizza from contacting her. A hearing is set for Oct. 15, giving a chance for Lizza to respond in court, though he denied Nuzzi's allegations to CNN.

""I am saddened that my ex-fiancée would resort to making a series of false accusations against me as a way to divert attention from her own personal and professional failings. I emphatically deny these allegations and I will defend myself against them vigorously and successfully,"" Lizza told CNN.

Nuzzi's relationship with RFK Jr. began late last year after she interviewed the then-independent presidential candidate, who has since suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Trump. RFK Jr. is married to actress Cheryl Hines.

It has been reported that Nuzzi initially denied she was personally involved with RFK Jr. after being confronted by her boss, New York Magazine editor David Haskell, but eventually came clean.

""Earlier this year, the nature of some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal,"" Nuzzi said in a statement last month. ""I did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source. The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I've disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York.""

A Kennedy spokesperson also previously denied any sort of physical relationship and said he had only met Nuzzi once.

New York Magazine said in its statement at the time that Nuzzi would have been removed from her reporting duties on the campaign if it had been made aware of the relationship earlier.

""Had the magazine been aware of this relationship, she would not have continued to cover the presidential campaign. An internal review of her published work has found no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias,"" New York Magazine said.

""She is currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review,"" the statement continued. ""We regret this violation of our readers' trust."""

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., met face to face on Tuesday night in New York City for the only vice presidential debate before the election.

The event covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before election day.

Here are the top moments from the debate:

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

After CBS News' Margaret Brennan offered an impromptu fact-check in response to Vance describing cities being overwhelmed by illegal immigration, noting that many Haitians in Springfield, Ohio have been granted a legal status, Vance hit back at her for violating the terms of the debate.

""Margaret, the rules were that you are not going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" he said. ""So there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Vance told Walz that he was sorry to hear that his son had been witness to a shooting, in a moment of civility that was particularly frequent during the vice presidential debate. This civility has also been less and less common during presidential debates, which have proven contentious in recent election cycles.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

""The American citizens have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim,"" Vance said during the debate.

""And I actually think I agree with you,"" the Ohio senator said, adding, ""I think you want to solve this problem.""

""But I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz claimed there would be ""a registry of pregnancies"" under what he said was Trump and Vance's Project 2025. The Project 2025 is an endeavor of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.

""It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments,"" he said.

But Vance denied this claim. ""No, certainly we won't,"" he pushed back at the statement.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Walz referred back to his notes in one answer on Tuesday night, after frequently scribbling down observations during the debate.

""Economists can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted,"" he listed, referencing Vance's skepticism of those heralded as experts. ""Look, if you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does.""

Even Trump poked fun at the noticeable amount of notes that the Minnesota governor was taking, writing on Truth Social, ""Walz is taking so many notes - Never seen a Candidate take more! He needs the notes to keep his brain intact."""

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION'

""Very proud of JD for a stellar performance tonight,"" former presidential candidate Vivek Ramasawmy posted on X. ""And my condolences to Tim Walz - it was unkind for them to put him in this position.""

""JD Vance won big and demonstrated why he was a fantastic pick by President Trump,"" Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X. ""He skillfully contrasted Trump's record of peace and prosperity with Kamala's record of disaster.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""
330,Mothers who lost daughters to illegal immigrants say VP Harris' border trip was 'political stunt',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/mothers-lost-daughters-illegal-immigrants-vp-harris-border-trip-political-stunt,2024-10-02T08:07:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Two mothers who lost their daughters to illegal immigrants called out VP Kamala Harris for not reaching out to their families and called the vice president's border trip a ""sham"" and a political stunt.

""I lost my 12-year-old daughter to illegal immigrants that the Biden-Harris administration policies, border policies have let in this country, and we're not safe anymore,"" Alexis Nungaray, who lost her daughter Jocelyn, said on ""Hannity"" Monday.

Jocelyn Nungaray was sexually assaulted before being strangled and left dead in a Houston creek by two illegal immigrants from Venezuela in June.

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

""I think Kamala Harris's border trip this past Friday was such a sham. It was the most disgraced, hollow effort I have ever seen from a candidate for presidency,"" she added.

Harris visited the southern border in Douglas, Arizona on Friday; Arizona is a swing state that is currently considered a ""toss up"" for the presidential race, according to the latest Fox News Power Rankings.

Nungaray said, ""it pissed me the hell off when I saw it. She's been in charge of the border for more than three years. She's done absolutely nothing.""

She added that Harris had her people there to capture the ""right angles"" during her border trip, calling it a photo-op for ""political gain.""

Nungaray said it was ""disgusting"" that she was only at the border for approximately ""20 minutes"" and didn't speak to any ""ground people or agents.""

Nungaray said when Trump visited the border she was invited, but she was not invited by Harris.

""If I was there this time and I would have witnessed how she handled that entire interaction, I would have walked up to her and I would have asked her, 'with this same effort you're giving, which is not any, would it be the same if this was your daughter that you had to bury?'"" said Nungaray.

Additionally, Nungaray said Harris has not reached out to her family to ""even give condolences.""

""It's because of people like Kamala Harris and [Democrat] Collin Allred, who's running for senator in Texas, which is where I'm at. People like that, they don't keep the people safe. They don't keep our children safe. We need somebody who will actually make change and actually do something. And that's not Kamala.""

Patty Morin, who lost her daughter Rachel Morin to an illegal immigrant, called out Harris as well.

Rachel Morin, a mother of five, was raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador in an affluent Baltimore suburb north of the city while going on a run in 2023.

""She's done nothing the last four years. She's denied that there's been a problem. She hasn't even acknowledged the murders of my daughter or Alexis's or some of the other victims,"" Morin said on ""Hannity.""

""This whole thing going to the border is just a political stunt, hoping that she's going to check off a box and win some points.""

""[Harris] has not done anything to keep America safe at all,"" Morin added.

Nungaray said she felt ""empathy"" from former President Trump when he reached out to the family.

""It wasn't him calling me as a previous president. It was him calling me as a father. As someone who has kids, someone who couldn't even imagine what it would be like if this was their child.""

Morin said, ""President Trump has reached out to our family multiple times, to multiple members. He's been very compassionate and genuinely cares about our family and our recovering from this tragedy.""

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona on Friday, the first time she has been to the border since 2021. It comes as her campaign is being dogged by her record on illegal immigration.

""After years of not just ignoring the problem, but helping create it, Vice President Kamala is finally headed down to the border,"" the National Border Patrol Council said in a statement. ""This is nothing more than for her to check the box, but what it is in reality is a slap in the face towards the men and women that put their lives on the line every day, and also a slap in the face to the American public. Where has she been?""

Harris became vice president in 2021 and the administration immediately rolled back a number of Trump-era initiatives and attempted to place a moratorium on deportations.

Migrant numbers skyrocketed, and Biden told reporters in March that Harris would be put in charge of tackling root causes, issues like climate change, poverty and violence that the administration believes was driving migrants north.

It quickly led to Harris being dubbed by media outlets and Republicans as the ""border czar."" The White House rejected that title, but it has made her a figurehead along with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the crisis.

""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed,"" Harris said on NBC in 2022.

Fiscal year 2023 broke the record for migrant encounters with over 2.4 million, while December had nearly 250,000 encounters in a single month."
331,"Politics hijacks hurricane devastation in the South, Biden calls Trump a liar",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-hijacks-hurricane-devastation-south-biden-calls-trump-liar,2024-10-02T07:15:37Z,"Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) reacts to Hurricane Helene response from Biden and Harris and said visiting areas affected by the storm helps bring additional help and support.

Television news, with few exceptions, completely botched the unimaginable devastation that struck western North Carolina over the weekend.

Once Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and headed inland, officials assumed it would lose strength. Instead, cities like Asheville, and eastern Tennessee, were hit with an almost biblical level of flooding, leaving a trail of impassable roads and collapsed bridges.

Why was this not the lead story everywhere?

To be candid, North Carolina is just a blip on the radar of the coastal media elites, dismissed as fly-over country. Most news organizations don't have a single reporter based there.

NORTH CAROLINA REELING FROM DEVASTATING HELENE AS DEATH TOLL CLIMBS: 'NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS'

President Biden just put out statements over the weekend, adding to the sense that this wasn't a Katrina-level crisis. I went to New Orleans eight months after that 2005 storm and was stunned to see mile after mile and after mile of uninhabited suburban homes damaged by the flooding.

Imagine if the same level of flooding hit northern New Jersey, right across from Manhattan. There would have been 500 times as much coverage. In fact, we had a real-life example in Superstorm Sandy, which rightly drew enormous media attention.

Many shows had their B teams in, with few taking charge and ordering a full-scale mobilization on the story.

I was just realizing the magnitude of the destruction on my show when leadoff guest Mary Katharine Ham, who's from North Carolina, texted me an hour before airtime and pushed to cover the story that was being largely ignored. It was a packed program, but I gave her a couple of minutes to talk about it on ""Media Buzz.""

By Monday, perhaps realizing that they looked terrible, TV outlets shifted gears and started constant coverage of the plight of North Carolina, interviewing local officials and survivors. But their journalists faced the challenge of getting to a mountainous region that was isolated and in some towns all but wiped out.

And yet the New York Times and Washington Post did a terrific job of getting their reporters to produce one front-page story after another from the city of Asheville, an artsy town partially submerged by the monster flooding.

KAMALA HARRIS' SOFT MEDIA INTERVIEWS ARE A 'BETRAYAL OF JOURNALISM': MARY KATHARINE HAM

As the Times put it, the storm left ""at least 37 people dead in the region and communities struggling to cope without water, food, power, gasoline and cellphone service.""

The Washington Post, from Canton, N.C.: ""Doris Towers awoke to the beeping of her husband's dialysis machine early Friday morning, meaning it had lost power. Her neighbor's Christmas lights, still up from last year, had gone out. Those were early hints of Helene's destruction to come. She hadn't known a storm was on the way.

""Across the mountains in Swannanoa, Joe Dancy and Jenna Shaw got up before dawn to walk their dog and saw floodwaters creeping toward their house. An hour later, they were climbing out a window with the help of a National Guard soldier.""

Biden, who will visit North Carolina today - Kamala Harris is also planning a visit-addressed the nation on Monday morning with his trademark empathy: ""I'm here to tell every single survivor in these impacted areas that we will be there with you as long as it takes.""

But the president, who kept coughing because of a cold, should have given that speech on Sunday. That would have spurred the journalists into action, because they often follow the White House, and instead left the impression that no one was in charge.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, visited a shelter in Valdosta, Ga., and said, reading from notes:

TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M

""As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. At a time like this when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved.""

The important thing is that Trump, working with Franklin Graham, son of Rev. Billy, who heads a Christian relief group, brought plenty of supplies.

But the former president didn't stay on that high road for long. He posted that Biden and Harris ""have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.""

FEMA officials have been working furiously - more than 3,300 federal agents are on the ground-and Harris, canceling several events, returned to Washington for a briefing from agency chief Deanne Criswell, and addressed officials there about the ""heartbreaking"" losses.

Trump also claimed that GOP Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. But Kemp told reporters he did talk to Biden and the president ""offered that if there are other things that we need just to call him directly, which - I appreciated that.""

""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden said. ""I don't know why he does this. I don't care what he says about me. I care about what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are.""

Trump also suggested, without evidence, that the Biden-Harris administration is deliberately not helping Republicans in red counties.

332,Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Now they know more, and on the basis of Tuesday night's performance, Vance might have won over a few folks. With the race a dead heat, everything matters."

In a tense interview with CNN, Donald Trump Jr. said Tuesday the media is partly responsible for the recent assassination attempts against his father, former President Trump, by pushing false narratives that radicalize his critics.

In the spin room following the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, Trump Jr. agreed with CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the event was ""civil"" and noted Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz even acknowledged when they agreed. The CNN host then asked, ""Should we see more of that on the debate stage when your dad's up there?""

""You know what? I'd love to see that across the board,"" Trump Jr. said. ""We've all heard about Trump Derangement Syndrome, we've seen what they've lied about ... 'I was an agent of Russia, but Hunter Biden's laptop was totally Russian disinformation.' It turns out, the opposite was true.""

""The media did that, they created so much of that environment. The media has radicalized the people that are trying to kill my father. I've had to deal with that twice now in the last two months,"" he continued. ""I've had to have that conversation with my five young children twice in the last two months about someone trying to shoot their grandfather.""

Trump Jr. then said ""that didn't just magically happen,"" and accused the media of creating a ""fake Russia scenario"" to tarnish his father.

""They ran with it for years, even when it was disproven, they still ran with it. You know, that environment wasn't just created by Donald Trump,"" Trump Jr. said.

Collins shot back, ""Everyone wants your dad to be safe. Nobody wants the threats against his life to happen, but you can't blame the media for those threats. There's been no evidence.""

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

The former president's son disagreed.

""When someone allows someone to have a platform to call someone 'literally Hitler,' every day for nine years, it creates it. Whether you want to believe it or not, that's a fact,"" Trump Jr. said.

When Trump narrowly survived the assassination attempt against him in July, a bullet grazed the former president's ear and the shooter killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore -- a husband, father and former fire chief at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also critically wounded two other rally-goers.

Just two months later, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested on Sept. 15 after allegedly pushing the muzzle of an AK-47 through the chainlink fence outside where Trump was golfing in Florida. No shots were fired at Trump after the Secret Service spotted the potential gunman and opened fire; the suspect fled and was arrested shortly afterward.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

When the microphones were cut off, the independent voter dial line can be seen moving in the approval direction as Republican approval decreased slightly.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters,

""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding,"" Vance argued during Tuesday's debate. ""We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around 50% approval with Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Donald Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

As Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off in the Vice Presidential debate in New York City Tuesday, both parties took to social media to express support for their candidate, with Democrats fact checking Vance on every point.

Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg claimed Walz was ""laying down facts"" and that Vance was ""unaware"" that the U.S. energy production was up.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also fact checked Vance and said if he and Donald Trump were elected, American families would pay a high cost.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Vance made ""false"" claims about the Middle East.

""Vance says Trump ""restored deterrence"" in the Middle East. Totally false. Iran and its proxies weren't shooting at U.S. troops UNTIL Trump became President,"" Murphy wrote.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer applauded Walz for ""standing up for American workers.""

""Michigan remembers what happened under Donald Trump. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost across all industries, including manufacturing. The Biden-Harris administration was critical to bringing jobs back to Michigan.""

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., alleged that Trump and Vance's ""Project 2025 agenda will raise costs on Arizona families while giving more tax breaks and power to big corporations.""

""@KamalaHarris and @Tim_Walz will lower costs and build an economy that works for all Americans.""

Project 2025 refers to a set of conservative policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation and has turned into a right-wing-'boogeyman' style Democratic talking point and fodder for Trump critics.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz baffled the internet on Tuesday when he accidentally declared he has ""become friends with school shooters"" during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate against Sen. JD Vance.

The poorly timed mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

While Walz presumably meant he has become friendly with parents who lost children during horrific school shootings, the internet was sent into a tizzy.

""Walz saying he's become friends with school shooters, when he meant victims, is an innocent misstatement. Repeatedly lying about his military rank, his DUI, IVF and Hong Kong/Tiananmen Square are not innocent misstatements,"" Fox News contributor Guy Benson responded.

The Media Research Center called it an ""unfortunate slip of the tongue.""

Walz's critics were quick to mock Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. Former President Trump asked if Walz is ""insane,"" Trump War Room quickly shared video of the gaffe and Walz was declared ""not ready for primetime"" by Trump national press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz sparred on the issue of immigration in their debate Tuesday night, and Vance called out the immigration policies of VP Kamala Harris.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during the Tuesday night debate on CBS during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris' open border. It is a disgrace, Tim, and I actually think I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz repeatedly made the case that Trump shut down the Senate immigration bill earlier this year that VP Harris has said she will sign in a move he believes would have made strides at the border.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

Vance referred to the Biden-Harris record on immigration as a ""disgrace.""

""Look, what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test,"" Vance said. ""For three years. Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country.

""And now that she's running for president or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cares a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the vice president, when she became the appointed border czar was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop. And it will when Donald Trump is president.""

A Harris campaign official told Fox News Digital that its focus group of undecided voters watching the debate reacted more strongly in favor of Walz's comments.

""Overall, Gov. Walz outperformed JD Vance in the immigration section, and the highest rating for Gov. Walz of the night so far was when he reminded viewers of Donald Trump's failed promise to build a wall, only building 2% of it,"" the campaign said."

""Senator, we have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Brennan said before urging O'Donnell again to move on to the next question.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" she added when Vance continued to respond.

CBS News announced last week that it would not allow its moderators to partake in any fact checking or correcting live in an effort to avoid the fury sparked by ABC News for its partisan handling of the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Instead, the network offered viewers a QR code where their reporters are fact-checking the candidates' remarks in real time on their website.

343,Walz forced to correct record on whether he was in China for the Tiananmen Square protests,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-forced-correct-record-whether-he-china-tiananmen-square-protests,2024-10-02T02:36:59Z,"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., joins 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to discuss a House investigation into Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz's alleged ties to China.

Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was forced to answer questions about his controversial travel to China, and misstatements about those trips, during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

COMER SUBPOENAS DHS FOR RECORDS RELATING TO WALZ'S ALLEGED TIES TO CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly-shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

Walz said that as a ""passionate young teacher"" he had ""the opportunity in the summer of '89 to travel to China -- 35 years ago.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times,"" Walz said.

Walz said his commitment ""from the beginning"" has been to ""make sure that I'm there for the people.""

""Many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about China,"" Walz said. ""I hear the critiques of this.""

Walz said he would ""make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us.""

""I guarantee you he wouldn't be, praising XI Jinping about Covid. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing,"" Walz said. ""So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is.""

He added: ""My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress. Those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.""

But Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question, and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So I will just that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests went in and from that I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

Walz's ties to China have come under the microscope since becoming Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT INVESTIGATING WALZ OVER 'LONGSTANDING CONNECTIONS' TO CHINA

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., launched an investigation into Walz's alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

Comer revealed that Walz has ""engaged and partnered with"" Chinese entities, making him ""susceptible"" to the CCP's strategy of ""elite capture,"" which seeks to co-opt influential figures in elite political, cultural and academic circles to ""influence the United States to the benefit of the communist regime and the detriment of Americans.""

Comer has pointed to reports that Walz, while working as a teacher in the 1990s, organized a trip to China for Alliance High School students. The costs were reportedly ""paid by the Chinese government.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Comer is investigating Walz's 1994-created private company named ""Educational Travel Adventures, Inc.,"" which coordinated annual student trips to China until 2003 and was led by Walz.

The company reportedly ""dissolved four days after he took congressional office in 2007.""

Comer said Walz has traveled to China an estimated ""30 times.""

Comer has now issued a subpoena for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, compelling him to produce DHS records related to Walz's alleged ties to the CCP.

Walz, meanwhile, during a congressional hearing in 2016, said he had ""been to China dozens of times.""

""I've been there about 30 times,"" Walz told an agriculture-focused publication in 2016.

However, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson recently said to Minnesota Public Radio that the number was ""closer to 15 times."""

""Honestly, Tim, I think he's got a tough job here because you've got to play Whac-A-Mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did,"" Vance said Tuesday evening during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Vance was responding after Walz slammed the GOP ticket as one that protects billionaires with tax cuts and pledging that he's a ""union guy"" who wants to keep jobs in the U.S.

The economy is a top voter concern this election cycle, ranking alongside issues such as the immigration crisis, abortion and national security.

""I hope we have a conversation on health care then, senator,"" Walz said as Vance wrapped up his points on the economy.

""Please,"" Vance responded.

The debate marks the first time the pair have squared off against one another, and will likely be the only vice presidential debate this cycle."

Tim Walz has the capacity to be 'sharp' during the CBS Vice Presidential Debate on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz kicked off his debate against Ohio Sen. JD Vance on shaky footing when he was first asked about his foreign policy platform in the Middle East.

""Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the Situation Room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?"" CBS' Margaret Brennan asked Walz on Tuesday evening in New York City during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Walz thanked the moderators for hosting him before delivering a halting and stammering answer while calling for ""steady leadership.""

""Iran, our I, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. Getting its hostages back, fundamental. And ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States to have to steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today where along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack,"" Walz responded, taking a few pauses between words.

ISRAEL UNDER ATTACK: IRAN LAUNCHES MISSILES, GUNMEN KILL AT LEAST 8 NEAR TEL AVIV

Earlier Tuesday, Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles at Israel. War broke out in Israel nearly one year ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched attacks on the nation.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,"" Walz continued.

GOP LEADER SAYS VANCE 'ABSOLUTELY PREPARED' FOR VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN WITH WALZ

Walz continued his response by taking shots at former President Donald Trump and his former administration officials.

""His chief of staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed human being you'd ever met. And both of his secretaries of defense and his national security advisers said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them... said he's unfit for the highest office. That was Sen. Vance,"" Walz said, referring to Vance's previous criticisms of Trump before he was elected to the White House in 2016.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership.

Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather scolded his former employer for declining to fact-check during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, saying the network is ""trying to avoid the blowback ABC got"" for fact-checking former President Trump.

Rather stepped down from his role as CBS' evening news anchor in 2005 and eventually left the network the following year after reporting a discredited story about then-President George W. Bush. He took to Substack Monday ahead of his old employer hosting the CBS Vice Presidential Debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz, which will be moderated by Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell.

""There are few guarantees in life, but odds are that more than one lie will be told by Donald Trump's protege and running mate, JD Vance. If there's one thing Vance has learned from Trump, it's that lying to get ahead is OK. If you get caught, just double down and lie some more. Who's going to fact check you? Well, apparently not CBS News,"" Rather wrote.

ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: MODERATORS DAVID MUIR AND LINSEY DAVIS FACT-CHECK TRUMP 5 TIMES, 0 FOR HARRIS

Rather said he was ""reluctant"" to criticize CBS News, where he worked for 45 years, but he feels it is necessary. His call for fact-checking come after ABC News was widely criticized for correcting Trump multiple times but failing to fact-check Vice President Kamala Harris during the recent presidential debate.

""With that as background, it is necessary to report and comment on the fact that CBS News has decided not to fact-check the candidates in real time. I would love to know what went into this decision, because it feels spineless, especially after ABC's Linsey Davis and David Muir effectively and correctly fact-checked Trump during the debate with Kamala Harris,"" Rather wrote.

""CBS says it is up to the candidates to fact-check, though 'the moderators will facilitate those opportunities' during rebuttal time,"" he continued. ""While both fact-checking (ABC during the Harris-Trump debate) and not fact-checking (CNN during the Biden-Trump debate) have drawn criticism this year, for the most part, the criticism was unsurprisingly partisan.""

Rather noted that CBS News would fact-check the candidates online, but dismissed viewers for being able to follow along in real time.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""Simply put, this 'rule,' imposed by CBS, incentivizes lying. It invites the participants to bend the truth, since their opponent then has to spend his rebuttal time calling out the lie, rather than giving an opposing view. And the calling out of a lie by an opponent rather than an impartial moderator is less credible,"" Rather wrote.

""It seems clear that CBS is trying to avoid the blowback ABC got after the presidential debate. A journalist, much less a news organization, should not be afraid to take heat,"" Rather continued. ""Their responsibility is to call out lies. If they don't do that on live television, during the most consequential election in modern history, they are the lesser for it. But the biggest loser is the American electorate.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump campaign is denying that it had ever formally accepted the invitation for former President Trump to sit for a ""60 Minutes"" interview after CBS News claimed he had backed out.

""60 Minutes is scheduled to air a primetime election special on a Monday edition of the broadcast on Oct. 7 at 8 p.m...

Hours before the vice presidential debate, former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at his campaign rally in Wisconsin and bashed the Biden administration over Iran's historic attack on Israel.

""A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel... I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. We're not going to make [predictions]... but they are very close to global catastrophe,"" Trump said. ""We have a non-existent president and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on.""

Trump's comments come after Israel said Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at the country, marking the largest ballistic missile attack in history.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

""That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore. The so-called enemy doesn't respect our country any longer,"" Trump said.

Trump claimed Biden and Harris made Iran rich in a very short period of time.

""They have $300 billion now. They're rich. I mean, they pay 6 billion every time they have somebody that was kidnaped, it's always $6 billion,"" Trump said.

""Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. They had no money left. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. The people they're fighting now, they would have been willing to make any deal. You could have made any deal. But Kamala flooded them with American cash and everything. Now, I mean, they're flooding them with cash. It's honestly not even believable,"" Trump continued.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan characterized the attack as a ""significant escalation"" while speaking at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

""We do not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel. In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. The word fog of war was invented for a situation like this. This is a fluid situation,"" he said.

Many missiles were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems, while others did hit the ground.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken published an op-ed Tuesday touting the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy record, stating they took drastic deviations from former President Trump, the same day Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel Tuesday evening local time in what the administration called a ""signigicant escalation by Iran."" The indiscriminate rocket fire were part of the Shia regime's response to Israel assassinating nearly all of Hezbollah senior leadership, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hours before Iran's attack, Blinken's op-ed touted how Biden-Harris' ""renewal"" strategy post-Trump was working and strengthening America's interests abroad.

""The Biden administration's strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,"" Blinken said.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Blinken said the administration prioritized international cooperation and avoided making decisions abroad in isolation.

""From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris made a foundational choice that in a more competitive and combustible world, the United States cannot go it alone. If America wants to protect its security and create opportunities for its people, it must stand with those who have a stake in a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and stand up to those who threaten that world,"" he wrote. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad,"" he said. ""This twin-pillared strategy, they believed, was the best way to disabuse competitors of their assumptions that the United States was declining and diffident.""

Blinken also stated the war in Gaza is interconnected to Iran's maligned behavior.

""Without an end to the war in Gaza and a time-bound, credible path to statehood that addresses the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and Israel's security needs, normalization cannot move forward. But if these efforts succeed, normalization would join Israel to a regional security architecture, unlock economic opportunities across the region, and isolate Iran and its proxies,"" he continued. ""Glimmers of such integration were on display in the coalition of countries, including Arab states, that helped Israel defend itself against an unprecedented direct attack from Iran in April.""

JD Vance had ""nothing to lose"" during his debate against Tim Walz, due to his low favorability ratings.

CNN data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that Sen. JD Vance had nothing to lose in his debate against Gov. Tim Walz because of his low favorability ratings.

""This is the net favorable ratings, -11 points for JD Vance. No bueno,"" Enten said. ""Tim Walz, look at that, a +4 net favorability rating.""

According to the favorability ratings, Vance has a lower net favorability than his running mate, former President Trump, whose net favorability rating is -9. However, Walz has a higher net rating than his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, who sits at a +1 net favorability rating.

""The bottom line is JD Vance not very well liked going into this first debate, but he really has nothing to lose because he's already the least liked VP nominee going into his first debate. I mean, you can't get worse than last, so let's see if you can come out tonight, maybe show the voters something that they haven't seen before and aren't expecting,"" he said.

Enten said Vance has been a ""drag"" on Trump.

""J.D. Vance has actually, if anything, been a drag on the Republican side of the ticket, while Tim Walz has actually, if anything, helped Kamala Harris up a little bit. But the bottom line is here, this negative 11 points, no good. This plus four points, pretty good in today's polarized environment,"" Enten said.

The CNN data reporter also said Vance had the worst net favorablity rating of all time heading into a VP debate.

""The only other person in negative net favorability territory is Dan Quayle back in 1988, with a -3 net favorability rating, if you know anything about VPs and the way that folks view them, you do not want to be in the company of Dan Quayle, JD Vance is in the company and is actually in a worse position going into his first debate than, of course, Dan Quayle was going into his first debate in 1988. And of course, that debate did not go very well,"" Enten said.

Enten said that low expectations for Vance might end up helping him in the debate, as Walz was favored to win the debate.

""Who do bettors think will win the first debate? In fact, they believe that Tim Walz is the favorite going into this first debate, JD Vance is actually the underdog, at least who the bettors think will win in those post-debate polls that we'll obviously get later on,"" Enten said.

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod suggested Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, was better prepared for Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate because he had been frequently engaging with the media while his opponent, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, ""has not.""

""Vance was chosen by Trump to be his designated hitter on TV and he is ubiquitous on these Sunday shows and in interviews. He has been prepping, not just for the last week, but through these appearances, Walz has not,"" Axelrod said Tuesday on CNN.

Vance and Walz will face off in their first and likely only debate before the November election on Tuesday. The debate will be moderated by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.

According to staffers for the Walz campaign, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate is reportedly nervous about coming off poorly during the debate and letting down his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris.

TRUMP-VANCE TICKET HAS DONE COMBINED 60 INTERVIEWS SINCE LAST MONTH COMPARED TO 21 FOR HARRIS-WALZ

Axelrod said these leaked comments to the media show that his campaign is ""actively trying to lower expectations"" for the Democrat ahead of the debate.

""It's interesting to me that the campaign has basically leaked over the last 24 hours, 'Well, he told us that he wasn't a good debater.' I mean, they're actively trying to lower expectation for Walz,"" he continued.

""[V]ance is very good at this. And he was chosen for that. Walz was chosen for that affability, that warmth. And the question is, is it going to be a Labrador Retriever versus a coyote? And how does that turn out?"" Axelrod asked.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

WALZ'S DEBATE PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS LOWERED AHEAD OF SHOWDOWN WITH VANCE: 'STILL LARGELY UNTESTED'

The Democratic presidential ticket still lags behind the Republican ticket in sitting down for interviews with the media, though Harris has stepped up her appearances in recent days.

Trump and Vance have sat down for at least 60 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, as of Monday, compared to 21 non-scripted interviews for Harris and Walz.

Former Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argued on MSNBC that the media should ""lower"" its expectations for Walz's performance on Tuesday.

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point. I think people -- yes, JD Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said on the liberal network on Sunday.

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

The Washington Post's coverage of GOP vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, is overwhelmingly negative, with almost none of its content resembling anything positive in recent weeks, Fox News Digital has found.

From August 6 to September 30, a whopping 71% of The Post's content was negative, according to its online search results. Just 1.4% was positive, while roughly 28% was neutral.

The search results included news reports, opinion pieces, political cartoons, videos and podcast links spanning from when his Democratic rival, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was tapped by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate. Negative results include unflattering reports about the candidate.

CBS NEWS CASTS A LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Seventeen of the 49 negative results, or more than one-third, involved his comments about Springfield, Ohio. Three of them involved taking his quote about school shootings out of context when he said ""I don't like that this is a fact of life."" Also among the negative results were five separate fact-checks against Vance, three of them resulting in the harshest rating of ""Four Pinocchios.""

Last week, The Post made headlines after it obtained private messages Vance sent in 2020 critical of then-President Trump.

Perhaps the most prolific in the anti-Vance bashing is columnist Philip Bump, who has written at least ten pieces primarily knocking the Republican hopeful during the 55-day period.

Fellow columnist Jennifer Rubin is setting expectations low for Vance ahead of Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate with Walz, in a piece headlined, ""Vance had better buckle up: His debate might go as badly as Trump's.""

The only remotely positive article Fox News Digital was able to find was an op-ed with the headline ""JD Vance isn't wrong about the value of family caregivers.""

Meanwhile, Walz has gotten much rosier coverage since he joined the Democratic ticket. More than 50% of The Post's coverage was either positive or took a defensive stance of the Minnesota governor. Just 8% of the coverage was negative, and 41% of the results were neutral.

Two of the eight negative articles among the search results were on how Walz was facing ""new scrutiny"" over his military service record as well as his handling of the 2020 George Floyd riots in Minneapolis.

While Vance was the subject of five fact-checks, Walz was only the main subject of two, one of them rated ""Four Pinocchios."" Walz was also included among fact-checked speakers on Day 3 of the Democratic National Convention.

FOX NEWS MEDIA WILL PRESENT SPECIAL LIVE COVERAGE OF VANCE-WALZ DEBATE

The only opinion piece overtly critical of the governor that Fox News Digital was able to find was one written Aug. 30 by columnist Kathleen Parker about his history of dishonesty.

Despite largely keeping a low profile, particularly from the media, Walz was showered with glowing pieces by The Post right out of the gate.

""Tim Walz's journey from high school football coach to VP candidate,"" one headline read on the day Harris announced her running mate. The next day, columnist Michele L. Norris laid out ""6 reasons Tim Walz was the right choice."" The day after that, The Post published the story ""Harris and Walz seize on joyful message in contrast to darker Trump themes.""

According to The Post, Walz was a man of political evolution in stories like ""How Tim Walz went from NRA-endorsed to a gun-control advocate"" and ""How Black women shaped Tim Walz's politics after the death of George Floyd.""

Additionally, the ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" paper made Walz into a fashion icon with stories like ""For Tim Walz, 'a dad in plaid,' dressing down is leveling up"" and ""Viral Harris-Walz camo hats riff on red-state style, draw ire of NRA."" He became the pinnacle of manliness in articles like ""Masculinity's check-engine light is on. Let Tim Walz have a look"" and ""Tim Walz as football coach: A rambunctious, rah-rah joker.""

A new report disclosed that President Biden is feeling left out in the cold by the Democratic Party after going all in on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

According to the Monday NBC News report, Biden has mentioned to his allies his feeling that his accomplishments and legacy as president are being forgotten by the party, especially as Harris has tried to distance herself away from her boss' policies and forge her own political identity after replacing him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

""President Joe Biden has privately complained to allies that his name and his accomplishments have virtually disappeared from the national conversation and about how quickly the party that he has served for more than five decades appears to have moved on from him, according to six people familiar with his comments,"" the piece reported.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF 'EVERYTHING IS OK' BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: 'YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM'

According to these sources, the president has commented on Harris not mentioning him during recent campaign speeches, noting that he believes she should acknowledge his economic accomplishments while touting her own vision on the issue.

""Biden has noted at times that Vice President Kamala Harris... hasn't been mentioning him in her campaign speeches lately, including when she talks about an economy he believes his policies set on a positive trajectory, these people said,"" according to NBC.

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

359,DAVID MARCUS: The Vance vs. Walz debate is best scored using boxing rules,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-vance-vs-walz-debate-best-scored-using-boxing-rules,2024-10-01T17:53:41Z,"DEBATE DAY: Live coverage begins today at 8 p.m. ET for the Fox News Simulcast of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

The first rule of deciding who won a major political debate is that nobody wins a major political debate. There is no final score as the buzzer sounds, no final wink to be tiddled, it is a purely subjective matter. And that will be true of the vice-presidential debate between Republican nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz.

That having been said, I've recently adopted a method of scoring debates from the world of pugilistics, that I think actually gives a pretty decent assessment of what most American voters see.

My advice in picking a winner is to borrow the scoring system of a boxing match. The basic rules are relatively simple. In each round the boxer who wins the 3 minutes gets 10 points, the loser gets 9, unless there is a knockdown or it is overwhelming, in which case the round is scored 10-8. A tie is 10-10.

Obviously, a knockout ends the fight.

HEIGHTENED 'SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE' AS VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF IN VP DEBATE

I first tried this approach last month with the Trump vs. Harris debate. And I wound up with Trump winning 157 to 150. It wasn't the only reason I thought and wrote that night that Trump won the debate, despite overwhelming media insistence that girl boss Kamala had kicked ass. But it was part of it.

And with polling showing no significant bump for Harris since their face-off and the fact that we've even seen some Trump swing state surge since their debate, my ostentatious declaration of a Trump victory looks a little less crazy today.

The legacy news media, who wanted any excuse to hand Harris a W anyway, viewed the tête-à-tête as a kind of Lifetime movie in which Harris had finally spoken truth to power, but I find in most of America that narrative doesn't have a whole lot of purchase. The voters want answers.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

That's where boxing scoring comes in. If openings, closings, and each question, are the ""rounds"" of the debate, you wind up with about 15. See what I'm saying? The incremental 10-9 or 10-8 scores of each, mirror the nuance of how swayable voters watch the event.

The basic philosophy behind boxing scoring is that the primary job is to survive the round, so if you manage that, you get an automatic 8 points, winning the round, and can only bump that up by at most 2.

One could argue there is a fundamental unfairness here, that if I am 40 percent better at landing punches in a round than my opponent, I only get a 10 percent point advantage in scoring, but that is also the beauty of the system. Fights aren't just about math.

This actually tracks very well with how political debates work.

The audience, which is to say the voters, do tend to see each question or issue as one round, and if Walz can get a 10-8 on abortion, or Vance can on the border, that goes a long way towards the kind of 7 point win I gave Trump over Harris.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Another way to think of this is that 90 percent of Americans likely already know who they are voting for, only 10 percent can be swayed, and boxing's unique scoring system almost perfectly corresponds to this.

Eighty to 90 percent we are just scoring as a wash.

There is, of course, the chance of a knockout, but these days, that chance seems remote. Back when Reagan said ""There you go again,"" or Obama, in retrospect wrongly, told Romney the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back over fears regarding Russia, the possibility of something near consensus on the question existed.

Those days are no longer with us, if they aren't over forever.

Nobody really wins a debate, but we can still score them, we can still pay close attention to who is and isn't actually answering the questions, and that has a lot of value.

So give a shot, grab a pad and paper, if you still have those, and just jot down your score for each question, 10-10, 10-9 or 10-8. Like a Ouija board your political leanings might push the pen a bit, but even so, you might be surprised by the results.

As Mike Tyson once put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Let's keep a close eye on the flying rhetorical hands of Tim Walz and JD Vance."

North Carolina remains a dead heat in the presidential race as the November elections draw ever nearer.

The state - which is now undergoing serious recovery efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Helene - has been consistently close in its political polling.

A new poll conducted by the Washington Post finds former President Trump leading with 50% of likely North Carolina voters compared to Vice President Harris' 48%.

BIDEN TO VISIT NORTH CAROLINA DAYS AFTER HELENE'S PATH OF DESTRUCTION LEAVES MANY DEVASTATED

Trump's slim lead is within the poll's +/- 3.5% margin of error, but the former president won the state in 2020 with a similarly tight 1.3% lead. The poll contacted 1,001 registered voters randomly selected from a statewide database.

North Carolina has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since former President Obama's 2008 victory, but the Democratic National Committee sees the state's Republican majority as fragile, with a possibility to tip the other way.

Because the majority of the survey was conducted before the full impact of Helene on the state, it does not reflect any possible shifts the storm may cause in public opinion.

More than 120 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast.

JD Vance of Ohio is ""absolutely prepared"" for Tuesday night's vice presidential debate showdown.

Vance, former President Trump's running mate on the GOP 2024 ticket, will face off in New York City with Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota in the one and only debate between the two running mates.

""You look at everything he's done since he was named as the candidate. He's been preparing, he's been talking with the press, he's been out there, he's been moving around and talking to the American voters. So, he's very ready to have this conversation,"" Whatley emphasized in a Fox News Digital interview hours ahead of the debate.

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep told Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor was in debate camp ahead of the showdown to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters, ""She wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error White House race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there will be heightened stakes at the running mate debate, which is traditionally seen as a second-tier event in the presidential campaign.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head match-up between the principal candidates and this is the last meet-up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

Most political pundits said Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

And there's a precedent from 12 years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Whatley, the former RNC general counsel and former North Carolina GOP chair who's a close ally of Trump, told Fox Digital that Vance's debate mission is to ""deliver the message"" to voters across the country.

Whatley argued that ""if you look at the Democrats, they don't just have messenger problems, they have message problems. The polices that they're pushing right now are not popular with the American people.... I think on every single one of these issues, the Republican ticket is the ticket of strength, the ticket of common sense, and I feel really great about where we're going into tonight.""

The RNC chair also said that when it comes to Vance's game plan for the debate, ""I think he's going to talk about the issues that the voters care about and those are the issues like inflation, like the southern border, like prices at the grocery store and at the gas pump. That's really what people care about. That's what we're going to talk about.""

Part of the Harris campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

For weeks, they've painted Walz as a regular guy who will be facing off with the Ivy League-trained Vance. What they don't mention is that Walz won six House races and two gubernatorial elections.

The Trump campaign's playing the same game.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well-prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

But Trump seemed to undercut this campaign's argument, charging in an interview with Kellyanne Conway's Fox Nation program ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne"" that Vance is ""going up against a moron. A total moron, how she picked him is unbelievable.""

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable."

364,"With Hezbollah weakened, Israel's challenge becomes knowing when to pull back",CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/middleeast/israel-incursion-lebanon-analysis-intl/index.html,2024-10-01T15:06:47Z,"The word ""limited"" is going to have to do a lot of work in the weeks ahead.

Israel has described its initial ground incursion into southern Lebanon as such, although its key ally, the Biden administration, has already suggested that what may initially begin as small in scope could risk dragging on.

It will take a remarkable amount of efficiency and discipline from the Israeli military and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to know when it is time to stop. Militaries are not particularly keen on pulling back, especially in large scale operations. If the incursion is easygoing, it could incentivize the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to push forward, sensing a weakened enemy against which swift progress can be made. If the going gets tough, the IDF can suggest the mission is more imperative than ever, and that they must push on.

But, quite remarkably after two weeks of technological wizardry and ruthless, calculated attacks against Hezbollah - starting with the simultaneous explosion of communication devices and culminating in the killing of the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah - the playing field may shift. The Israeli military are now walking into the ground trap that their adversary has been setting for them for well over a decade.

They may discover that Hezbollah, its leadership decapitated, is so enfeebled that it is genuinely a less challenging task than imagined to mop up what remains of its ground troops after months of heavy airstrikes. But southern Lebanon was always going to be where the Iran-backed group held the home advantage. Its tunnel network provides them an endless maze for Israeli forces. And so, knowing when to stop is going to be key to this not becoming a quagmire for Israel. Almost every modern war that has dragged on for years began with the idea that it would all be over in a matter of weeks.

While Israel's operations over the past three weeks have been brutal, they have shown discipline and superior intelligence. But we're now entering a new phase of this conflict in which key decisions must be made by an Israeli prime minister who was has shown himself to be maximalist in his military steps, and who is also desperately in need of a prolonged conflict to maintain his grip on power. It is going to take some extraordinarily swift dismantling of Hezbollah by the IDF for Netanyahu to be able to pull his forces out in a matter of days, and avoid months of not quite being sure how this all ends.

Does Israel's Lebanon operation increase the chances of wider war with Iran? The US warned Tuesday of a possible retaliatory ballistic missile strike by Iran on Israel, but that does not translate in to guaranteed damage, given the April interceptions of dozens of similar rockets, and Iran has clearly shown that - so far - it does not have the resources nor the willingness to lead a wider regional response against Israel.

But this is also an increased hazard for the civilians of Lebanon and some form of enduring peace, or at least sustainable calm, in the region. The less likely a wider conflagration is, the less leverage the US and Europe have over the Netanyahu administration. Time and again the West has managed to pull the region back from a brink they have said is perilously close. But now all the red lines to Israel's north have literally seen troops march over them, and it really is not clear if Iran has any viable means of intervention at this time, outside of missile attacks that it has tried before to little avail.

Yet the arc of retaliation is long, and Iran may exact retribution in ways not imminent yet still horrifically destabilizing - such as its very advanced nuclear program. But immediately they don't seem to be able to deter Israel in any way.

And so, a fearful month begins, bedeviled by US electoral paralysis, in which any notions of the outgoing Biden administration being able to rein in Israel seem a little fanciful. The White House is, it seems, being told about huge escalations, like the assassination of Nasrallah last week, as they actually happen. If US Vice President Kamala Harris wins, her White House may decide to switch off the taps and slow Israel's moves. And even Donald Trump, who seems to want all wars to stop, may have less of an appetite for a lengthy Israeli operation deep inside Lebanon that he ends up partially paying for. But on the hustings neither candidate wants to give the other the chance of labeling them weak on defending Israel.

Netanyahu's full intentions remain unclear. The closure of towns around Metula in northern Israel and shelling across the border has led to some speculation the IDF might be attempting a lightning race West towards the Lebanese city of Tyre, effectively cutting off all of Hezbollah in the country's south. While this may be attractive strategically on a map, it is potentially a huge task with a lot of unkind geography in its way.

But this is emblematic of the extraordinary jeopardy Israel now finds itself in. With a maximalist leader who had appeared to have shunned all diplomacy, it must now set a limited scope on an operation that it also hopes can permanently redefine the security threat to its north. It must find a way of inflicting significant damage on an adversary that has never been so weak, but also avoid getting caught in a trap.

The Israeli prime minister has sanctioned actions over the past fortnight that have seemed tactically astute despite an apparent disregard for civilian casualties. But they are an outlier in the scope of the past year. The open sore of Gaza - a conflict without a perceivable end, or idea solution for coexistence and political accommodation for the Palestinians - shows how belligerent the current war cabinet can be when faced with larger strategic decisions. For Israel's military endeavor to last weeks and not months, they will need extraordinary and rare success, discipline, and political wisdom."
365,Press freedom group warns a Trump victory could embolden attacks on journalists,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/media/journalists-threats-election-trump/index.html,2024-10-01T14:45:07Z,"Next month's presidential election could make America's hostile media climate even worse for journalists. And it's not just Americans who have something at stake: Reporters in other countries are watching the United States with apprehension.

That's the takeaway from a new Committee to Protect Journalists report about the state of press freedom in the US.

""Media workers are confronting challenges that include an increased risk of violence, arrest, on- and offline harassment, legal battles, and criminalization,"" said Katherine Jacobsen, the report's author.

Her research pointed to other causes for concern, like political polarization, ""a lack of police accountability for their treatment of journalists,"" and the legacy of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Freelance photojournalist Amanda Andrade-Rhoades, who was on assignment at the Capitol for The Washington Post, told Jacobsen that ""January 6th was a warning shot.""

""It was a wakeup call to the fragility of our democracy and trust in institutions - like journalism, like the government - that's been eroding for a very long time,"" she said.

The Committee to Protect Journalists has historically called attention to journalists being arrested and killed in repressive regimes. The presidency of Donald Trump - with its ""enemy of the people"" rhetoric and destabilizing actions against the press - caused the nonprofit group's leaders to look inward.

While the Biden administration ""has tried to restore an air of normalcy around media freedom,"" Jacobsen wrote in Tuesday's report, Trump-era ""hatred of the press"" has ""gone unchecked in much of the country"" and continues to have deleterious effects.

According to the US Press Freedom Tracker, assaults on journalists in the US have soared by more than 50% in 2024 compared to last year.

On the campaign trail this year, Trump has ""threatened to further his anti-press agenda,"" including by asserting that NBC's parent company Comcast should be investigated for treason, the report stated.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the ""corrosive political environment"" has intensified safety concerns for journalists - forcing newsrooms to conduct safety assessments, evaluate online threats, and hire extra security. ""It's a pressure cooker unlike anything we've seen in modern American journalism,"" Bruce Shapiro, the executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at Columbia University, told Jacobsen.

Some of the reporters Jacobsen interviewed said, ""they feel as though they are operating in a different reality from their readers; that the 'alternative facts' of the Trump years have spun entirely different narratives about current events, including the upcoming election.""

Jacobsen added that ""the next person in the White House could determine whether independent media function as a cornerstone of U.S. democracy - including holding politicians accountable by fact-checking their claims and following up on their promises - or whether journalists will be at increasing risk from a fresh siege of legal and verbal attacks.""

The outcome could have serious impacts on press freedom well beyond America's borders. ""Overseas,"" Jacobsen writes, ""journalists fear that a second Trump term would again embolden foreign leaders to restrict their own media, negatively affecting the global press freedom landscape and undermining those in regions that rely on U.S. aid and support.""

The committee's CEO, Jodie Ginsberg, wrote to both Trump and the Democratic party's nominee, Kamala Harris, and asked the candidates to ""publicly affirm the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment and abide by basic principles to respect and promote media freedom at home and abroad."" Neither candidate has committed to the pledge yet, according to the group."
366,Some Biden 2020 voters say they don't know enough about Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/some-biden-2020-voters-say-dont-know-enough-kamala-harris,2024-10-01T14:33:38Z,"Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Tim Hogan analyze Vice President Kamala Harris' 'easy' interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle.

Some Biden 2020 voters still want to know more about Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the election, telling the New York Times that they don't know enough about the Democratic nominee's policies.

""I need to hear more from Kamala Harris in terms of what she wants to do. I hear a lot from Trump, and I agree with some of his policies, but I don't like his character. And I think I need to hear a little bit more from her for her to win my vote,"" Prince, a Democratic North Carolina voter, told the Times.

The New York Times spoke to 15 voters that voted for President Biden in 2020 in a Times Opinion focus group. While some said they still wanted more from Harris, by the end of the discussion, only three voters remained truly undecided between Harris and former President Trump.

""I don't know that there's much that Trump could say, because we already know what he's like. I think for Harris, if she came out with a more specific outline of some of her policies and if I heard some policies that aren't too good to be true, like the $25,000 home-buyer tax credit,"" a North Carolina Republican voter said.

72 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO A FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

The third person who was undecided, a 35-year-old Independent voter from Georgia, said he wanted to know more about Harris' plan for immigration and her economic policies.

The voter also said that he would be more invested in the vice presidential debate and hopes Gov. Tim Walz will be able to talk about Harris' policies in more detail.

An Independent voter from Nevada said while she leaned more towards Harris, she pulled back a bit because she didn't ""know enough about her.""

However, at the end of the discussion, the voter did not say she remained undecided.

The New York Times' moderator of the discussion, Magie Omero, asked the group what they liked best and least about the vice president and the former president.

One Michigan voter said what he liked best about Harris was that she was not Trump. Another said Harris is smart and ""relatable."" Others likened Trump to a dictator, and many suggested he was ""self-centered.""

""I don't feel like she's had time to set herself apart from what Biden's been doing for the last four years. For the most part, she's run with a similar plan. I don't know that that's the best plan,"" one of the Republican voters from North Carolina said, responding to the question about what they like least about Harris.

Another Republican voter agreed and added, ""She gives the impression of a fresh perspective, but I don't think we've had enough time to actually get details as to what that perspective is.""

A Democratic Pennsylvania voter agreed with both Republicans and said they didn't know enough about Harris' agenda.

When asked if they were happy that Harris was the Democratic nominee, multiple people said they were not satisfied, as Harris is the current vice president.

""I'm not that satisfied. She has been the vice president for the past four years and not really implemented anything. I wish the economy were better, and I heard she was in charge of border issues. We could have done a little bit better for a Democratic candidate,"" one Wisconsin Democrat said. She also said Harris was ""wishy-washy."""

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Some Democratic allies of Gov. Tim Walz are concerned about how he will fare in the vice presidential debate between him and Sen. JD Vance, worrying that the Minnesota governor remains untested.

""We've never seen him on the national scale before,"" a Minnesota Democrat told Politico. The outlet reported that Vance hasn't been tested in a scenario like a debate, where he will face direct questioning and attacks from the other side.

Walz and Vance are set to clash on Tuesday during the first vice presidential debate, which will be moderated by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.

""He can be very: 'That's it I'm done,'"" a Minnesota state lawmaker told the outlet. Politico reported that Walz shuts down conversations and gets defensive when he's asked to discuss ""missteps"" in private, and it noted Walz was ""still largely untested and has never faced the intense, direct questioning that Vance is sure to launch.""

HARRIS 2024 SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISER PREVIEWS UPCOMING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS'

""She did so strong. She's actually made it very difficult for Walz, because I don't see any way that he could match her level of intensity and humor,"" another ally of the Minnesota governor said, noting Vice President Kamala Harris' debate performance against former President Trump that received high media praise.

Harris' inner circle reportedly discussed Walz's habit of being ""gruff and brass,"" Politico reported, while they were vetting him.

According to the outlet, a Minnesota lawmaker recalled Walz saying ""'Alright, I've done all the answering I'm going to do. Meeting's over,'"" when he was asked about questions he didn't want to talk about.

A Democratic lawmaker described a call with Walz in 2020 amid the George Floyd riots, during which Walz reportedly ""signaled he was done with the conversation,"" after he was pressed on why he didn't call the National Guard in sooner.

""I don't think he hung up, but definitely that was it. The call was over,"" the Democratic lawmaker said.

""At times, he could be the exact opposite of what he usually is. That was one of them,"" the person told Politico.

Politico also reported that Walz struggled to explain Harris' economic agenda and kept repeating the words ""opportunity economy."" The report said it came off as vague to those in attendance.

MSNBC's Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator, said during an interview on Monday that expectations for the VP debates should be ""lowered.""

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point. I think people -- yes, J.D. Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said.

McCaskill said it would be a ""challenge"" for Walz to be able to counter Vance and ""stay really likable and relatable.""

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

Brian Mast, R-Fla., is demanding that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) immediately fire the at least a dozen employees who reportedly improperly accessed the medical records of vice presidential candidates Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this summer.

Mast, chairman of Veterans For Trump, penned a letter urging VA Secretary Denis McDonough for a ""swift response and action to prevent such egregious violations of privacy within the VA from occurring again."" The Florida Republican is also calling for the FBI to get involved to investigate the possibility of foreign election interference.

""I urge you to buck the employee union of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and immediately fire the employees who were caught snooping into the private medical records of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz - who are both running to be vice president. VA employees know this is not permitted,"" Mast wrote in a letter first obtained by Fox News Digital. ""As a combat-injured veteran, I rely on the VA for my medical care. This isn't just a legal misstep; it's a breach that undermines veterans' confidence in the VA and raises serious questions about the professionalism of VA personnel.""

The Washington Post first reported Monday that at least 12 VA employees within the agency's health administration were under criminal investigation after VA investigators discovered they improperly accessed the medical records of Vance and Walz. VA Inspector General Michael Missal's office reportedly informed both candidates' campaigns and shared evidence with federal prosecutors related to several of the health system employees, including a physician and a contractor who ""spent extended time"" viewing the files of former President Trump and Vice President Harris' running mates.

VA EMPLOYEES IMPROPERLY ACCESSED JD VANCE, TIM WALZ'S MEDICAL RECORDS, PROMPTING CRIMINAL PROBE: REPORT

""Dismissing these employees and referring them to the Justice Department for prosecution, provided there is evidence that laws were broken, is the first step the VA must take to restore credibility,"" Mast wrote. ""Furthermore, I urge you to fully brief Congress on how this violation of privacy transpired and implement new guidelines to prevent such acts from occurring in the future.""

Mast, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, implored McDonough to coordinate with the FBI.

The letter comes a week after Trump's campaign said he was briefed on ""real and specific threats"" from Iran to assassinate the Republican presidential nominee.

""Given the recent foreign meddling in our elections - like Iran's assassination plots against President Trump - I also request your department coordinate with the FBI to ensure Senator Vance and Governor Walz's medical information was neither shared with foreign operatives nor accessed on their behalf,"" Mast, who served in the U.S. Army for 12 years and lost both legs to catastrophic injuries endured while working as a bomb disposal expert in Afghanistan, wrote. ""Safeguarding sensitive information about our public officials is critical to national security and the integrity of our democracy.""

TRUMP REACTS TO ASSASSINATION PLOTS WITH BIG WARNING TO IRAN

Last month, experts from the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a summary of the current threat environment citing how the ""big three foreign influence actors, Russia, Iran, and China are all trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in U.S. society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability.""

""Like Russia, Iran has a multi-pronged approach that looks to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process. Tehran has also sought cyber access to individuals with direct ties to the presidential campaigns of both political parties, while elements have also denigrated the former president,"" they said. ""Iran has a suite of tools at its disposal, as demonstrated in recent reports outlining Iran's cyber operations, including the hack-and-leak operation against the former president's campaign. Iran is also conducting covert social media operations using fake personas, and is using AI to help publish inauthentic news articles.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the VA and the FBI regarding Mast's letter.

Regarding the Post's reporting on Monday, VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said in a statement that the agency ""reported to law enforcement allegations that VA personnel may have improperly accessed Veteran records"" and takes ""the privacy of the Veterans we serve very seriously and have strict policies in place to protect their records.""

""Any attempt to improperly access Veteran records by VA personnel is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,"" Hayes wrote.

The potential motive for accessing the medical records is under investigation, and investigators are still trying to determine if Vance and Walz's information was shared as a result of the breaches, the Post reported.

The VA employees under investigation, including the physician and contractor, accessed the medical records using their VA computers and did so mostly from their government offices, sources told the newspaper. Some of the staffers in question reportedly told investigators they were simply curious to see the files of Vance and Walz given both candidates have defended their military records on the campaign trail.

The Department of Justice declined to comment about the report. The breach reportedly did not include access to any disability compensation, which has more security protocols than health information."

373,"Five weeks to Election Day, pre-election voting looks set to decline from pandemic-era highs",CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/election-2024-early-voting-data/index.html,2024-10-01T10:16:44Z,"While there are still five weeks until Election Day, voting is already underway across the country and a CNN review suggests pre-election voting this year will drop from the pandemic-era highs of 2020.

More than 430,000 votes have already been cast as of Monday in 25 states for which data was available, according to election officials, Edison Research and Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit advocacy groups, including insights into who is voting before November.

That's a tiny fraction of the roughly 158 million votes cast for president in the 2020 election.

In the 34 states and the District of Columbia where data is available, more than 53 million pre-election ballots have been requested by voters so far, including in states where all voters receive a ballot in the mail. But across the board, ballot requests are down from where they were at this point four years ago, according to Catalist's data.

While early voting data is not predictive of ultimate outcomes, it can give a good picture of ""general trends"" across voters of different ages, genders and races in the lead-up to the election, Catalist CEO Michael Frias told CNN.

The downtick in interest in early voting so far shouldn't be surprising.

The 2020 election featured historic levels of pre-election voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some voters were wary to vote in-person with guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommending social distancing. Four years later, with the country out of the pandemic, more voters could be heading back to the ballot box for in-person voting either before or on Election Day.

That shift is evident in how older voters make up a larger share of people requesting ballots so far, compared with this point in 2020.

In Georgia, voters 65 and over for 59% of requests, up from 48% in 2020. In Michigan, they account for 53%, up from 42%. In Pennsylvania, voters 65 and over account for 50% of ballots requested so far, up from 38% in 2020. And in Wisconsin, 46% of requests came from these voters, up from 34% in 2020. While fewer voters of all ages are requesting ballots so far this year, the drop has been far smaller among this oldest group of voters.

During the pandemic, mail voting was more widespread among all age groups.

Partisan breakdown

While Democrats had a wide advantage over Republicans in pre-election voting four years ago, there's some early evidence that the gap may not end up being quite so wide this year.

Generally, in recent election cycles, Democrats nationwide have shown a preference to cast their ballots in advance, while many Republicans opt to vote on Election Day.

But since 2020, Republicans have been trying to convince their supporters to bank their votes early, despite former President Donald Trump's baseless claims that mail voting is rife with fraud.

In the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, Democrats have requested 62% of all ballots, according to the latest Catalist data, while Republicans have requested 26%. However, at the same point in the 2020 election, Democrats accounted for 66% of all ballot requests, while Republicans accounted for 24%.

In Florida, once a key battleground state that has become less competitive for Democrats, there's a similar trend. Democrats account for 42% of the ballots requested, the most recent Catalist data showed, slightly down from 44% at the same point in 2020. Republicans account for 35% of requests, up from 33% in 2020, and those without a party affiliation made up 20% of requests, down from 22% in 2020.

Early in-person voting hasn't yet started in most of the country, and in recent years Republicans have shown they're more likely to vote early in person than by mail.

While partisan data on early voting is only available in states that allow voters to register by party, data by race is more widely available.

In the key states of Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the racial breakdown of voters requesting ballots is almost identical to what it was at this point in 2020.

The story is slightly different in Florida, where White voters make up a slightly larger share of those requesting pre-election ballots compared with this point in 2020 (74% versus 69%), with Latino voters (13% vs. 16%) and Black voters (10% vs. 12%) making up slightly smaller shares.

Comparing data for 2024 with 2020 is not as straightforward as it has been in previous election cycles, according to Catalist's Frias, since early and mail voting four years ago was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's going to be a relatively normal election, meaning you didn't have a pandemic, you didn't have an outside event that was forcing people inside and reducing the amount of in-person activity,"" Frias said.

But the data is still useful to both the Trump and Harris campaigns, giving them a small peek into just how successful they've been so far in reaching key voter demographics.

""The campaigns have been executing outreach to voters for the entire year,"" Frias said. ""This is the first real opportunity that they have to see the folks that they're talking to."""
374,Democrats aim to show a judge how pro-Trump Georgia election board could spark certification 'chaos',CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/certification-lawsuits-georgia-swing-states/index.html,2024-10-01T10:16:42Z,"Four years after certification of the presidential election led to rioting at the US Capitol, fights over the once pro forma process are becoming more frequent and widespread as Republicans in battleground states that could be decided by only thousands of votes try to challenge the process.

Disputes across the country are brewing over the role of local election boards and how much power they have to question - or even throw out - election results. Given the thin margins in battleground states like Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, the election between former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris could be in the balance.

While Republicans say they are worried about voter fraud, Democrats fear local officials who buy into conspiracy theories and false claims of fraud will refuse to certify results, leading to a potential legal morass and possible delays that inject uncertainty into the November election.

In Georgia, for instance, Trump-backed members of the state election board recently passed controversial rules that could allow local election boards responsible for certifying results to conduct investigations that threaten to delay certification.

Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee, the Georgia Democratic Party and Democratic members of several county election boards will try to convince a Georgia state judge the rules could throw the upcoming presidential election into ""chaos.""

""The law is very clear in every state that certification is a mandatory duty,"" said Ben Berwick, the head of election law and litigation at the advocacy group Protect Democracy. The role of those officials, he said, is ""simply to affirm that the canvas and tabulation have been completed and that the results are official.""

""Even unsuccessful attempts to block certification can cause delays, and even small delays in the very tight post-election timeline can have us cascading effect,"" Berwick said.

Though every state's certification rules are slightly different, the process is simple: When polls close on Election Day, election officials tally the votes and confirm that every valid ballot was counted. Those officials then turn to local election boards - made up of Democrats and Republicans who may or may not have experience in election administration - to certify the results before passing them along to either a state board of elections or the state's chief elections officer, who will also certify and finalize that result by December 11. They then go to Congress for a final certification on January 6.

In 2020, a pressure campaign from Trump and his allies urging the officials, beginning with local election boards and continuing up to then-Vice President Mike Pence, not to certify the vote totals ended up with a riot at the US Capitol and partisan wrangling over control over the process ever since.

Lawsuits already popping up

Lawsuits aiming to preemptively head off challenges to the certification process are beginning to appear nationwide with mixed results.

In Georgia, the Democratic plaintiffs challenged the new rules around certification shortly before they were supposed to take effect.

One of the Georgia rules, the ""Reasonable Inquiry Rule,"" would allow election officials to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" before certifying election results. The petitioners in the case argue that the rule would give partisan board members a wide ability to cast doubt on, or even reject, election results.

The second rule, known as the ""Examination Rule,"" would allow individual county board members to ""examine all election related documentation"" before certifying.

Georgia Republicans and the Republican National Committee, defending the two rule changes, have argued that they ensure local election boards have the tools they need to make sure vote counts are accurate, and that Democrats have only raised ""abstract and hypothetical"" concerns about their impact.

In some cases, the threat of legal action has been enough to deter officials from pursuing challenges to the certification process. One Republican canvasser in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, was sued by the ACLU over alleged threats to not certify the upcoming presidential race. The canvasser, Robert Froman, denied making the comments and quickly signed an affidavit promising not to interfere in November's election.

Situated in southwest Michigan, the county is home to more than 215,000 registered voters, according to the Michigan Department of State, but it has reliably trended blue in recent presidential history. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020 with 58% of the vote.

Asked if he would certify the 2024 presidential election if it unfolded the same way the 2020 one did, Froman told the Detroit News, ""No. And that's why I'm there.""

Froman has not responded to attempts to reach him for comment.

The suit was dropped, and the ACLU sent a letter to every board of county canvassers in Michigan warning that their organization ""will be carefully monitoring their activities come November,"" and that ""a canvasser who refuses to perform their legal and constitutional obligations by voting to certify the election based solely on the returns may be subject to swift and decisive legal action.""

And in Nevada, the state Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Democratic Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar asking the justices to force the Washoe County commissioners to certify an election over the summer. Washoe County, home to Reno, is a critical swing county with more than 380,000 registered voters, according to the Nevada secretary of state.

The justices dismissed the suit because the commissioners certified the election on their own. But, the justices said, Aguilar could raise the issue again if the commissioners failed to certify an election in the future.

Still, not every suit has ended with resounding wins for officials or advocacy groups aiming to insulate the certification process from challenges. Last week, a federal judge in Arizona blocked a state provision that, in the event local officials failed to certify their county's votes, instructed the Arizona secretary of state to proceed with the state canvass anyway. Officials believed that the provision would act as a contingency plan should some local boards miss their legal deadline.

That judge sided with conservative groups who claimed the provision likely violated the constitutional right to vote because it, in the judge's words, ""gives the secretary of state nearly carte blanche authority to disenfranchise the ballots of potentially millions of Arizona voters.""

Several election experts told CNN they believe that state and federal laws surrounding the certification process will ultimately ensure local boards certify their results this year, heading off potential chaos.

""So far, courts have done a very good job of getting to the heart of the matter on this,"" said Gideon Cohn-Postar, senior adviser for election infrastructure at the Institute for Responsive Government, a nonpartisan good governance group. ""My concern is much more one of narrative than of legality.""

He worried, for instance, of the optics if election skeptics on dozens of boards across the country refuse to certify and are then forced to do so by the courts.

""It's going to look suspect and can be used by bad faith actors that this is somehow compelling people to do things that are illegal,"" Cohn-Postar added. ""That will kind of drive conspiracy theories.""

What happened in 2020 and 2022

Legal challenges to the certification process have been playing out over the past four years in states across the country, including Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Georgia and North Carolina. None of those challenges have succeeded.

The first warning signs of major challenges to the certification process came about in 2020, when Republican officials in Michigan's largest county temporarily blocked the certification of Biden's win.

The two Republicans on the Wayne County Board of Canvassers cited concerns of voting irregularities in Detroit as their reason, though they reversed course hours later and certified the votes.

It was later reported that Trump and then-Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel had called the two Republican officials to encourage them not to certify.

Efforts from Republican officials to block certification only increased in the midterms, when challenges to certification popped up all over the country. In rural Arizona, county officials only certified the midterm election results after an order from a judge - and two of the county supervisors who refused to certify were indicted on state charges for refusing to certify.

Similar delays played out in Otero County, New Mexico, when the county commission initially refused to certify election results over concerns about Dominion voting machines and questions about a handful of individual votes, and in North Carolina, where the election board delayed certification in one district allegations of irregularities with absentee ballots.

In Pennsylvania, the then-acting secretary of the Commonwealth and Pennsylvania Department of State sued the boards of election in three counties over their failure to certify results too.

In all those instances, votes were eventually certified. And in some cases, officials who initially refused to certify the results have been removed from office or faced criminal charges."

Jon Tester.

Montana U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a Republican, ripped his opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, for his ties to lobbyists during a debate on Monday.

Tester is seeking to hold onto his Senate seat to continue representing the red state of Montana in a race that could determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress, and recent polling shows that Sheehy is leading just weeks before Election Day.

During the debate on Monday, Sheehy knocked his Democrat opponent for his relationship with lobbyists in Washington, D.C.

""Sen. Tester knows all about backroom meetings, he's been taking them for 20 years ... While I was fighting in Afghanistan, he was eating lobbyist steak in D.C.,"" said Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL.

'WHOEVER GETS ELECTED': VULNERABLE DEM TESTER DIGS IN HEELS ON NOT ENDORSING HARRIS

Lobbyists have donated more heavily to Tester during this election cycle than to any other member of Congress, according to the non-partisan group OpenSecrets.

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana, where Republicans, including former President Trump, supported Sheehy's campaign with the hope that he could defeat the vulnerable Democrat and help the GOP win back control of the Senate.

Republicans need to gain only two seats in next month's election to win the Senate majority. GOP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is considered a lock in his state's Senate race against Democrat Glenn Elliott, meaning the Senate majority could run through Montana.

Trump won Montana by about 17 percentage points in 2020 and, given that the state is overwhelmingly Republican, Sheehy has often sought to tie Tester to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Republican candidate looks to take advantage of public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to address the influx of illegal immigration at the Southern Border.

JON TESTER CASTS DOUBT ON UNFAVORABLE POLL IN MONTANA SENATE RACE: 'GIVE ME A BREAK'

""Democrats on the Hill refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration in the history of this country,"" Sheehy said.

Tester, however, has declined to endorse Harris and has attempted to distance himself from her on the campaign trail, and he skipped the Democratic National Convention in August, when she was named the party's nominee for president after Biden dropped out.

The Democrat has also criticized some of the administration's policy decisions. This includes his opposition to the move for tighter pollution rules for coal plants and his calls for more to be done on immigration.

""Look, I'll be the first person to tell you that President Biden has not done a good job on the southern border,"" Tester said Monday.

Sheehy and Tester also addressed abortion, in which the Democrat said he wants to reinstate Roe v. Wade after the landmark ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

The Republican acknowledged that remarks he made last year about Native Americans were ""insensitive,"" but refused his opponent's request to apologize. Sheehy had told a group of laughing supporters about bonding ""with all the Indians ... while they're drunk at 8 a.m.,"" while working cattle at a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation.

""Yeah, insensitive,"" Sheehy said. ""I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color jokes sometimes.""

Tester pressed his opponent, ""Tim, the statement you made degrades Native Americans across this country. You're a big guy, just apologize.""

""Will you apologize for opening the border?"" Sheehy shot back."

NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" has been blasted as ""completely inappropriate"" for making light of assassination attempts against former President Trump in its latest episode.

""SNL"" has managed to take a break from comedy for somber moments in the past, such as when Kate McKinnon performed a version of ""Hallelujah"" while impersonating Hillary Clinton following Trump's shock 2016 election victory. But while the Democratic nominee losing to Trump in 2016 was worthy of a melancholy cold open, recent assassination attempts on Trump were not.

The long-running program began its 50th season on Saturday evening with a variety of special guests mocking current political affairs, such as Maya Rudolph as Vice President Kamala Harris, Andy Samberg as her husband Doug Emhoff, Jim Gaffigan as Gov. Tim Walz and Dana Carvey as President Biden.

James Austin Johnson played Trump and lampooned the first assassination attempt - which killed one of Trump's supporters - that occurred July 13 in Butler, Pa., as he depicted the former president at one of his rallies.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""Where the hell is everyone going? Where are you going? I see you trying to leave, but the doors are locked. Come on back -- we're having fun. We love my rallies, except when someone does the 'bing, bong, bing, bing, bing' right at me,"" Johnson as Trump said, referring to the sounds of bullets. ""You know that happened because of the rhetoric of the radical left. They say that me blaming the Democrats for inciting violence is the pot calling the kettle black.""

Former NBCUniversal senior executive Mike Sington, who now bills himself as a pop culture expert and Hollywood insider, couldn't believe ""SNL"" went there.

""I was watching it live, and actually cringed when they mocked the assassination attempts in an effort to be funny. I'm no fan of Trump's, but I thought it was in extremely poor taste,"" Sington told Fox News Digital.

Fox News host Jimmy Failla wasn't surprised because ""SNL"" has pivoted from comedy to ""activism masquerading as comedy"" in recent years. The show openly celebrated Trump losing in 2020, and its cast members

""'SNL' has basically devolved into a group therapy session for liberals who are wildly out of touch with the zeitgeist,"" Failla told Fox News Digital.

Failla said the infamous ""Hallelujah"" rendition following Clinton's 2016 loss proved how self-absorbed the show is, specifically when considering that Trump was a longtime NBC personality prior to entering politics.

""They go after things that work well in a liberal bubble, but look stupid to the rest of us, because it looks like activism masquerading as comedy,"" Failla said.

""The things they made fun of with Biden are the harmless things, whereas the things they make fun of with Trump always have the undercoating that's looking to steer the conversation towards how their viewers are going to vote,"" he continued. ""It's beneath the show that really forged an identity by dabbling in politics, but in an accessible way, which is what we try to do on my show.""

Failla, who hosts ""FOX News Saturday Night,"" believes anything can be mocked if it's done tastefully.

""If you're making fun of a situation where he was shot and someone else was killed, then it better be funny. Like the juice better be worth the squeeze, which it clearly wasn't in this case,"" Failla said. ""And they didn't make any effort to hide their political bias in how they covered this.""

Failla said a lot of people turn to comedy as a distraction, but ""SNL"" doesn't offer the escape that it used to.

""They're keeping the focus on division. And I cover politics every week. So, I'm not saying they shouldn't. I'm just saying they're covering it in a way that's clearly catering so wholeheartedly to one side of the aisle that sometimes you see the malice in what they're doing,"" Failla said.

""You can mock anything in the name of comedy. But if you're mocking it in the name of a political ideology, you're no longer doing comedy,"" he added. ""You're doing activism masquerading as comedy. And that's what that came off as. It came off as just tasteless activism.""

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Political satirist Tim Young believes the NBC program ""jumped the shark politically"" years ago, particularly when they treated Trump's 2016 victory ""as if it were a funeral"" with McKinnon playing the piano on a dark stage.

""From that point forward, it's been full-on leftist propaganda. Their mocking of Trump's assassination attempts was completely inappropriate,"" Young told Fox News Digital.

Young believes poking fun at the assassination attempts ""feeds leftist conspiracies that it never happened"" and also ""downplays the seriousness of the threats on Trump's life.""

""Which I believe encourages more lunatics and foreign adversaries to try,"" Young said.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT WROTE CHILLING LETTER MONTHS BEFORE GOLF COURSE PLOT

The Trump campaign posted to social media, ""There were two assassination attempts against President Trump within a span of seven weeks. @nbcsnl apparently finds that funny. Disgusting.""

""SNL"" also referenced the assassination attempts during the ""Weekend Update"" segment, during which Colin Jost quipped that he was ""starting to worry that bullet got a little more than just the ear,"" after playing a clip of Trump saying he had a better ""body"" than President Biden at a recent rally.

Conservative radio host Jason Rantz said he is ""all for comedy having no rules about what it targets"" for humor as long as everything is balanced and amusing.

""Bad taste? Sure, but that's their choice to make. My issue is how disgustingly one-sided the humor has become,"" Rantz told Fox News Digital.

""It's not just Trump they loathe -- it's everyone who supports him,"" he continued. ""At the very least, you'd hope they'd be funny while being so obnoxiously partisan. But no, they're not funny. They haven't been funny in decades.""

CNN'S DANA BASH ADMITS SHE PREPPED 'MUCH MORE' FOR HOW TRUMP WOULD ACT DURING FIRST DEBATE THAN FOR BIDEN

When Trump narrowly survived the assassination attempt against him in July, a bullet grazed the president's ear and the shooter killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore -- a husband, father and former fire chief at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also critically wounded two other rally-goers. Weeks later, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested on Sept. 15 after allegedly pushing the muzzle of an AK-47 through the chainlink fence outside where Trump was golfing in Florida.

While Young is appalled the program would make light of the assassination attempts, he also noticed something ""significant"" during the same sketch.

""They mocked all of Biden's confusion, smelling hair, etc. for one of the first real times since he's been in office,"" Young said.

""'SNL' defended Biden by not being hard on him before,"" Young added. ""Now that Kamala has been installed as the Democrat nominee, they finally treat him like they have other candidates pre-Trump.""

A senior adviser to the 2024 Harris campaign said Tim Walz is ""looking forward"" to debating JD Vance Tuesday at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City in what could be the first and last meeting between the two before the November election.

Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum asked Ian Sams, the former White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, Monday on ""The Story"" about a CNN report that says Harris' running mate is nervous heading into the debate.

CNN spoke with aides close to Walz and top campaign staffers who said the Minnesota governor is worried about letting Harris down and reportedly said in his running mate interview that he was a bad debater.

""I think voters are going to get a chance to see two running mates who are advocating for two very different visions for the country,"" said Sams.

""Just today, for example, we have a new report out from the campaign on famously, Donald Trump in the first debate, saying he has a 'concept of a plan' on health care. Well, right after that, JD Vance, his running mate, came out and explained what that plan meant by pushing - that we're going to reopen what are called high-risk pools. That's for people with preexisting conditions.""

5 STEPS TOWARD A FRESH APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE REFORM

MacCallum interrupted the senior adviser, returning to her question about Walz's reported nerves and how he's feeling ahead of the debate.

""He's looking forward to the debate,"" Sams said of Walz. ""I think he's looking forward to debating JD Vance, who, again, is continuing to advocate for returning to high-risk pools that'll put people with preexisting conditions back into these high-risk pools that cost them more money and could kick them off of their insurance.""

Vance gave an interview in mid-September to NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in which he attempted to put more meat on the bones of former President Trump's ""concepts"" of a health care plan that would be an alternative to the Affordable Care Act.

""You want to make sure that preexisting coverage - conditions - are covered, you want to make sure that people have access to the doctors that they need, and you also want to implement some deregulatory agenda so that people can choose a health care plan that fits them,"" said Vance.

VA EMPLOYEES IMPROPERLY ACCESSED JD VANCE, TIM WALZ'S MEDICAL RECORDS, PROMPTING CRIMINAL PROBE: REPORT

""We want to make sure everybody is covered. But the best way to do that is to actually promote some more choice in our health care system and not have a one-size-fits-all approach that puts a lot of people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.""

The Harris-Walz campaign released a 43-page report attacking their Republican opponents' health care plan and highlighted four key concepts it says the Trump-Vance campaign wants to end.

Sams said he ultimately believes the November election will be ""really close,"" and voters will be the ones who have the final say in which issues are most important for them as they head to the ballot box.

""I think when we look [at] the fact that we have only 36 or so days left until the election, you know, the candidates are going to have to be out there earning people's support. And this is a 50-50 race,"" he told MacCallum.

378,Kamala Harris makes a desperate move on a critical issue to save a sinking campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-makes-desperate-move-critical-issue-save-sinking-campaign,2024-10-01T09:09:12Z,"The Democrat nominee's campaign is fizzling like a week-old party balloon; desperate to regain momentum, she is trying to defuse one of her most vulnerable positions -- immigration. The latest Quinnipiac poll of 1,728 likely voters shows Harris dead even with Trump; in August the same poll showed her leading by two points. Nate Silver reports that Harris' chances of winning are dropping and the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Harris' lead declining slightly. That small slippage comes despite massive spending by Democrats, and especially in swing states, where Trump on average leads Harris by the slimmest of margins.

The Harris team sees their ""joy"" campaign losing steam and has decided with great trepidation that the candidate must be more accountable on issues important to voters. Immigration is one of those top concerns on which she is currently being clobbered by Trump. According to CNN, 49% of voters trust the former president on immigration compared to 35% trusting Harris. The open border may prove key to winning toss-up states like Arizona and also to winning over Black men, especially those who are concerned about the impact of lawless immigration on the jobs market.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

That's the only possible explanation for why she would humiliate herself by visiting our southern border -- the original Biden-Harris crime scene. From the earliest days of this administration, critics were aghast at the sudden spike in the number of people coming across the border illegally. The surge was not surprising; after all, Biden took 89 executive actions in his first 100 days in office to undo the safeguards erected by Donald Trump and open the floodgates. But many were shocked at the White House's indifference to what was called a ""crisis"" even as it built to horrifying and politically damaging levels.

It takes unimaginable chutzpah, 30 days out from the election, to try to convince voters that Harris has been concerned about the border all along, and that Donald Trump is actually to blame for the flood of illegal entrants in the past three years. To that end, Harris engaged in a meaningless photo op showing the vice president striding resolutely next to a wall that she had previously described as a ""gross misuse of taxpayer money"" and vowed to ""block any funding for"" during Trump's presidency.

Harris seemed to believe that taking 20 minutes - 20 minutes!!! - out of her frantic campaigning would change how millions of Americans viewed her failure to secure our border. She was hoping to be excused for allowing more than ten million people to illegally enter our country, and forgiven by the families of those killed by migrants or by fentanyl.

She took this politically risky leap on the heels of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reporting that 425,431 convicted criminals, including 62,231 convicted of assault, 2,521 kidnappers, 14,301 convicted of burglary, and 13,099 convicted of murder - all of whom crossed our border illegally -- are at large in our country.

Are these the folks that pro-immigration groups, led by United We Dream and Amnesty International USA recently claimed in a letter to Joe Biden, ""make our country better by every measure""? This is an outrage and confirms the system is broken - thanks to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas, who should have been impeached or made to resign for failure to do his job.

Most pathetic, Harris continues to hope that those who blame her for ignoring her duty will decide that it was all Donald Trump's fault. If only he hadn't sabotaged the bipartisan senate bill designed to secure our border, she seems to say, Laken Riley, Rachel Morin and Jocelyn Nengaray would still be alive, as would the hundreds of thousands who have died from fentanyl overdoses.

She lies. The bill that she touts as having had bipartisan backing was ripped by most Republicans because it gave the White House too much discretion in enforcing our asylum laws and left open loopholes flagrantly abused by cartels. It is also true that a number of Democrats voted against the bill, including members of the Progressive Caucus. Finally, the bill showed up just this year after millions of migrants had already trampled our border. As the Border Patrol Union posted on X: ""Vice president Harris has ignored the border problem she created for over three years. She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op... where has she been the last 3 1/2 years?""

Recall that Joe Biden actually introduced an immigration ""reform"" bill the day he took office. Originally called the U.S. Citizenship Act, the bill was a sop to progressives and was not about securing the border. Instead, it was, as the name suggested, all about providing a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. That - and not protecting our border - has been the priority for the Biden-Harris White House. The legislation was such a non-starter that Democrats in charge of Congress never took it up.

A senior official of the National Border Patrol Council, said in a statement to Fox News that Harris's last-minute border visit was ""a slap in the face to the American public."""
379,Pennsylvania absentee voting underway in some counties,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-absentee-voting-underway-some-counties,2024-10-01T09:09:09Z,"Pennsylvania residents spoke with Fox News Digital about their thoughts on 2024's intense political rhetoric and what issues are driving their vote.

Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes are up for grabs in the 2024 presidential election with absentee voting in the Keystone State underway for some voters there.

Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states that flipped from the Democrats to former President Trump and Republicans in 2016, then back to President Biden four years later. In each case, the margin was thin with less than 100,000 votes separating the main candidates.

The state has also been critical to each president's pathway to victory. It has the largest population and the most Electoral College votes of the seven most competitive states in the Fox News Power Rankings.

A recent Fox News survey has the race tied, with Democrat nominee Vice President Harris and Trump each receiving support from 49% of likely voters.

The bulk of the Democrat vote comes from the ""bookends"" of the state, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where Harris will likely perform well among Black and suburban voters.

Trump makes up for that with White rural and non-college-educated voters who live in the middle of the state. The former president has brought these voters out to the ballot box twice, and a Pennsylvania-heavy rally schedule shows he is looking to do that again.

Pennsylvania is ranked ""Toss-Up"" in the Fox News Power Rankings.

The Keystone State also has a U.S. Senate race on the ballot. Democrat Sen. Bob Casey has won three elections before, but securing a fourth will be more difficult with White working-class voters drifting away from his party. Republicans are hoping businessman Dave McCormick will connect with them. That race is ranked ""Leans Dem.""

Pennsylvania is also home to a handful of competitive U.S. House races led by:

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

381,"Heightened 'significance and importance' as Vance, Walz face-off in VP debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heightened-significance-importance-vance-walz-face-off-vp-debate,2024-10-01T08:09:41Z,"NEW YORK - With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there's a lot on the line in the vice presidential debate.

While debates between the running mates are the undercard of a White House race and have rarely moved the need much in the past, when Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats' nominee, face-off on Tuesday, there will be heightened stakes.

Any major knockout blow - or agonizing misstep - could turn what's traditionally seen as a second-tier event into an impactful showdown.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head matchup between the principal candidates and this is the last meet up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Most political pundits said that Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION

And there's a precedent from twelve years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor has been in debate camp ahead of the showdown, to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters ""she wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep tells Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people who ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Emmer and Walz overlapped for four years in the House before Walz won election in 2018 as Minnesota's governor. ""I do know him probably as well or better than most on the Republican side,"" he said.

And Emmer, taking a shot at his fellow Minnesotan, argued ""the hardest part of playing Walz... is trying to tell lies with a straight face, because that's what he does. He's good at the debate game, but there isn't substance there. There's a lot of air.""

Former President Trump, asked Monday if he had given his running mate any advice, told reporters, ""No, he doesn't need it.""

But he added that he and Vance had ""been speaking a little bit back and forth"" and that he thought the senator was in ""good shape.""

Part of the Trump campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

The senator arrived in New York City on Monday afternoon, and in the evening took a break from debate preparations to headline a gathering of GOP mega donors.

Walz was scheduled to fly to New York City on Tuesday, ahead of the debate.

The vice presidential debate is being moderated by ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" host and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

The 90-minute debate, which kicks off at 9pm ET, will take place at the CBS News broadcast center in New York City.

The Fox News Channel, FOX Business Network, Fox News Digital, Fox News Audio and Fox Nation will air special programming of the debate.

Both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to two four-minute commercial breaks during the debate. Campaign staff are not allowed to interact with the candidates during those breaks.

The other rules - including no studio audience - are similar to September's Harris-Trump debate and June's debate between Trump and President Biden.

But there is one major difference - a candidate's microphone won't be muted when the opponent is speaking."
382,Pennsylvania deadlock: Why Kamala picked the wrong running mate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/shows/media-buzz/pennsylvania-deadlock-why-kamala-picked-wrong-running-mate,2024-10-01T07:07:51Z,"Harris 2024 senior adviser Ian Sams reacts to reports Tim Walz is 'nervous' about the vice presidential debate and discusses VP Kamala Harris' stance on the looming port strike on 'The Story.'

If Kamala Harris loses Pennsylvania, Donald Trump is the 47th President of the United States.

Now you could say the same about Michigan or Wisconsin, but it especially seems that a Democratic candidate should be able to carry the Keystone State.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN 'UNDERWATER' IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE, DEM REP WARNS DONORS

And that's why, in my view, Kamala should have picked Josh Shapiro, its popular governor.

I have nothing against Tim Walz, of football coach fame, but I don't see what he's done for the ticket. There's a reason the campaign hasn't let him do any solo interviews - a stark contrast with JD Vance, who is constantly doing interviews and holding press conferences.

In fact, Vance now frequently takes reporters' questions in front of supporters, who boo the journalists, sometimes even before they start speaking.

We'll find out whether Walz can think on his feet when he faces off against Vance in tonight's VP debate. The most generous thing I can say is that the Coach will be rusty.

Let's look at the latest numbers.

The Real Clear Politics average has Trump leading Harris by a miniscule margin, 48.1% to 47.9%, which of course is a statistical tie.

At 538, the micro-margin in Pennsylvania is flipped, with Harris averaging 47.9% and Trump at 47.1%, another tie.

Now imagine that Shapiro, who is more of a moderate liberal than the uber-progressive Walz, was the running mate. And let's say Shapiro had brought in another 50,000 votes as the home-state guy. You can see where that would tip the balance.

Kamala didn't pick Josh for two reasons. They had a rough conversation when she interviewed him, with the governor insisting on an influential role if he were to relinquish his current job. But so what? Presidents and their veeps often don't see eye to eye. She preferred the image of Walz, hunter and fisherman, to the prospect of two East Coast lawyers.

But the more important reason is more troubling. Harris was under pressure from the anti-Israel faction in her party not to tap Shapiro, who is Jewish and a strong supporter of the Jewish state.

So the vice president effectively handed veto power to this minority faction, which basically backs the Hamas terrorists who would wipe out Israel, and would have faced a week or two of controversy as a result. I said at the time this would be a world-class mistake if she lost Pennsylvania.

The reason Harris has spent so much time in the Pittsburgh area is that the western end of the state is much more conservative than the eastern section anchored by Philadelphia. Her goal is to hold down Trump's margin in a part of the state that he'll easily win.

KAMALA HARRIS IS GETTING 'OUTHUSTLED' AND 'OUTCLASSED': JESSE WATTERS

One problem Harris faces right now is that she makes little news. By picking ""friendly"" interviewers, such as MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who has trashed Trump as a danger to democracy, she avoids tough questions and followups.

Visiting the Mexican border was a smart move, not just because Trump has a major lead on immigration, but because Harris broke into the news cycle, where images can count more than words, and attempted to position herself as tougher than Joe Biden on the issue.

Otherwise, I'm just hearing chunks of her stump speech in response to questions, starting with how her mother raised her. Repetition is important in politics, but if you don't throw in a few new lines, the press is left without a headline.

Meanwhile, Trump over the weekend called Harris ""mentally impaired,"" saying Biden just got old but she was born that way. He also said Harris should be impeached, and maybe prosecuted, for the way she helped run the country.

Now that is classic Trump. By using over-the-top rhetoric, he sparks a media debate about whether he's gone too far, and that debate revolves around the words ""Kamala"" and ""mentally impaired.""

IN HYPERPARTISAN ENVIRONMENT, MSNBC DRAWING FIRE FOR ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-HARRIS PROGRAMMING

Harris has wisely not responded to every Trump jab. But remember, Trump benefits from negative coverage as much as positive coverage because he's driving the news agenda.

Here's a pool report from Harris at a West Coast political event over the weekend: ""She then switched her remarks to talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. VP Harris remarks on the issue were very similar to her remarks in Arizona on Friday."" In other words, no news.

Think about this: Trump has been absolutely pummeled by a hostile press corps, is a twice-impeached convicted felon and carries the burden of Jan. 6. Harris has been riding an extraordinary wave of positive press, and yet she's slipped slightly in the polls and is tied in Pennsylvania.

And there's no question that if she loses there, the election is over."
383,What to watch for during the Vance-Walz VP debate,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/what-to-watch-vp-debate/index.html,2024-10-01T04:21:46Z,"Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance are set to meet Tuesday night in the only vice presidential debate of the 2024 election - and in what might be the last time the two campaigns square off onstage.

The matchup between Walz, the 60-year-old Minnesota governor, and Vance, the 40-year-old Ohio senator, is being hosted by CBS News and taking place in New York, without a live audience.

The debate coincides with huge news stories unfolding at home and abroad - including Hurricane Helene recovery efforts across the southeastern United States, and the Middle East on the brink as Israel escalates its campaign against Iran-backed militant groups in Lebanon.

Vice presidential nominees traditionally play the role of attack dog for the top of their tickets - in this case, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump.

But Walz and Vance have also hammered each other for months. Walz earned the Democratic vice presidential nod in part because of his branding of the GOP ticket as ""weird"" in television interviews that served as semi-auditions for the role. Vance, a military veteran, has questioned Walz's service record.

The debate is being moderated by CBS' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan. It starts at 9 p.m. Eastern time and will be simulcast on CNN.

Here are five things to watch at the vice presidential debate:

The coach vs. the ex-pundit

The Middle America roots at the heart of both Walz's and Vance's well-cultivated political identities will be on display Tuesday night as the two men vying to be a heartbeat away from the presidency introduce their biographies to the largest audience of voters they've likely had to date.

Walz, a two-term governor and former congressman, was first elected to the US House in 2006. But expect him to lean into the roles he held before entering politics: high school teacher and assistant football coach.

Vance, meanwhile, is a Marine veteran and the author of a best-selling memoir about the his Appalachian family values and the socioeconomic problems of his hometown. He's likely to highlight how he came around on the former president in recent years, without making much mention of his past as a political commentator who was a strident Trump critic.

Both candidates' biographical pitches are born of an effort to showcase their authenticity - a precious political commodity, particularly in a race in which undecided voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin could determine the outcome.

Voters' decisions are overwhelmingly influenced by the tops of the party tickets, and Walz and Vance are likely to devote much of their time attacking Trump and Harris respectively. But they could also spend time emphasizing parts of their own biographies and attempting to undercut their rivals' - all in an effort to establish their credibility with voters.

Abortion, family issues

The two tickets are split on abortion rights - an issue Democrats see as critical to motivating women and young people and winning over swing voters.

Walz has discussed the issue within the broader framework of Harris' support for ""freedom,"" a contrast with Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted with the majority in 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade's federal protections for abortion rights.

He has also revealed more vulnerable aspects of his own story, including the fertility struggles he and his wife, Gwen, faced. And Democrats have highlighted Vance's 2021 quip about ""childless cat ladies"" in an effort to portray him as judgmental of women's reproductive choices.

Vance and Trump, meanwhile, have at times struggled to get on the same page on the issue of abortion. But Vance has supported policies he says would incentivize child birth.

He has also sought to portray Walz as extreme on the issue of abortion. He said last week at a campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina, that Walz, as Minnesota governor, backed a measure that would allow abortion ""right up to the moment of birth, even to the point at which doctors wouldn't be required to provide life-saving care to a baby who survived a botched abortion.""

""That is just sick,"" he said.

Walz signed the measure into law in early 2023. Advocates at the time said it was intended to keep decisions about reproductive care in the hands of women and their doctors, rather than politicians and judges.

Which Walz do we see?

Walz emerged from relative national obscurity to become Harris's running mate in August, after one of the quickest selection processes in a generation, in no small part because of his sweet and spicy commentary on cable news.

His matter-of-fact insistence that Trump, Vance and their allies were ""weird"" captivated Democrats - desperate for an accessible hit on MAGA Republicans - and vaulted him to within a step of the vice presidency.

Since then, though, Walz has been rather tame.

The cable news appearances trailed off, he did not say much during his joint CNN interview with Harris, and his speeches haven't made many headlines. He spent some time on the defensive over his military record but has largely faded into the background.

On Tuesday night, that will change. What's less clear is, to what effect?

Walz could play the part Biden once did in a debate against another rising young conservative, when the then-vice president stymied Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan in a crucial 2012 debate.

Or is there another reason Walz has been kept somewhat under wraps over the past six or so weeks? The answer should be clear in the first few minutes of the debate.

Walz's military record could come under attack

If past performance is any indication, Vance will hammer Walz over his military record.

Republicans, Vance in particular, have accused the governor of overstating his resume and retiring prior to his unit's deployment to Iraq, claiming Walz proactively tried to avoid serving in combat. A review of the records found that Walz filed to run for Congress, in February 2005, before his unit was notified it could deploy to Iraq. He retired in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard.

Walz has also acknowledged misspeaking about his experience carrying a ""weapon of war."" Still, he never explicitly claimed - per a KFILE review of his earliest campaign - to have faced combat.

The story is nuanced enough that Vance is unlikely to back off. In August, he said Walz was Harris' ""stolen valor sidekick"" and called the governor's past comments ""disgraceful.""

Walz seems unlikely to want to litigate it onstage, but Vance could make him try.

About Springfield, Ohio ...

For weeks now, Vance and Trump have been doubling and tripling down on false claims that Haitians in the Ohio city are abducting and eating their neighbors' pets.

Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and many others have called the claims outlandish, and no one has provided any evidence to the contrary. Still, Trump and Vance want immigration front and center and, even though the migrants are in the country legally, the Republican ticket has sought to use the debunked rumor to gin up anger over the Biden administration's handling of the border.

When Trump brought up Springfield during the presidential debate last month, the moderators fact-checked him in real-time.

Pressed on the claims by CNN's Dana Bash in September, Vance said, ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

It would not be surprising to hear Walz bring up that comment, in particular, in attacking the Republicans' rhetoric."

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 72 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August last month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

President Biden announced on Monday that he will visit North Carolina on Wednesday after Hurricane Helene ravaged the state.

The president's announcement comes after critics slammed him for a lack of leadership after the monster storm's devastating impact on the southeastern portion of the country.

More than 120 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast.

The storm caused millions of power outages and billions in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

While days have passed since the storm struck the region, Biden has not visited the area nor had plans to until now.

""On Wednesday, I'll travel to North Carolina for a briefing at the State Emergency Operations Center and to participate in an aerial tour of Asheville,"" Biden said in a post on X. ""I've ensured my travel will not disrupt the ongoing response. I plan to travel to Georgia and Florida as soon as possible.""

But the president's announcement was followed by harsh criticism from the public, with one person writing, ""Joe Biden's visit is too little, too late.""

Another person wrote, ""Don't come to Florida we got hit ground zero. The governor is covering it,"" referring to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Still, several people wrote that Biden is only visiting because former President Trump had already gone to areas damaged by Helene.

Trump stopped in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday where he was briefed on the devastation left by the storm, but he also assisted with relief distribution and delivered remarks.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for more information about the president's visit to North Carolina this week.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: HURRICANE HELENE IN EYE OF THE CAMPAIGN STORM

During a press conference about the federal response to Hurricane Helene on Monday, Biden vowed to visit some of the most devastated areas.

At the end of the press conference, he got defensive when a reporter pressed him about who was in command over the weekend to direct hurricane response as he spent the weekend at his Delaware beach home.

The reporter yelled as the president walked out of the Roosevelt Room, ""Mr. President, why weren't you and Vice President Harris here in Washington commanding this this weekend?""

North Carolina and Georgia were among the hardest-hit states. They are also two of the seven key battleground states where razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump and are expected to determine the outcome of the 2024 showdown between Harris, the Democrat nominee, and Trump.

At the start of his remarks during the press briefing earlier in the day, Biden assured that he and his team were ""in constant contact with governors, mayors and local leaders"" regarding Hurricane Helene.

The president noted that Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell was on the ground in North Carolina and would remain in the Asheville area.

Biden also said he directed the Federal Communications Commission to help establish communications capability and the National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Defense ""to provide all the resources at its disposal to rescue and assist in clearing debris and delivering lifesaving supplies.""

JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

The images being projected by the DNC - which were shared first with Fox News Digital - include an eight-year old critical comment of Trump that Vance wrote on social media.

""Vance on Trump: 'What an idiot'"" read the projection, which was a portion of a direct quote from Vance's 2016 social media post.

Vance was a one-time Trump critic when the former president first won the White House. But Vance became a major supporter, and after winning election to the Senate in 2022 with Trump's support, has become a top Senate ally of the former president and his America First agenda.

Another projection charges that ""Trump is a chicken,"" as the DNC continues its attacks on the former president - launched recently on mobile and stationary billboards - for saying he won't debate Harris a second time.

Trump has said that it's too late for another debate because early in-person and absentee voting is already underway in a growing number of states across the country.

Project 2025 is a political initiative published by the well-known Heritage Foundation, a top DC-based conservative think-tank. While some of the authors who worked on the initiative - which includes some controversial planks - are veterans of the Trump administration, the former president and his campaign have pushed back vehemently against repeated attempts by Democrats to link him to Project 2025.

Another projection from the DNC is less controversial. It merely says ""Go Coach Walz!""

Walz was a longtime high school teacher and coach in Nebraska and then Minnesota before entering politics.

""These projections on Trump Tower NYC are a reminder that Trump and Vance are out for themselves while Trump remains afraid to go back on that debate stage and be held accountable by Vice President Harris for his failed record and his dangerous agenda,"" DNC deputy communications director Abhi Rahman argued in a statement.

And Rahman predicted that ""America will reject their self-serving, extreme Project 2025 plans this November.""

This is the second time in a month that the Democrats have projected images on a Trump Tower.

The DNC also shined images on Trump Tower in Chicago ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.

""Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump,"" Ruhle said to Maher. ""We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016 for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy.""

Ruhle admitted that Harris didn't answer a question about how she would get the funding for her ambitious economic agenda without Congress, but quickly defended her by saying Trump would ""balloon"" the deficit ""significantly bigger than Vice President Harris will.""

391,Analysis: Why America is looking increasingly powerless as Israel's war expands,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/america-israel-lebanon-war-analysis/index.html,2024-10-01T00:47:13Z,"Israel's expected ground incursion into Lebanon will drive home a new strategic reality of a year of war -- the once-mighty US is powerless to rein in its ally or to influence other major belligerents in a fast-worsening regional crisis.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Monday launched the next stage of its onslaught against Hezbollah with what the Israel Defense Forces called a ""limited ground operation"" into Lebanon -- despite weeks of requests from Washington for restraint and familiar (and spurned) calls for de-escalation.

This came just hours after President Joe Biden said ""we should have a ceasefire now,"" when asked what he knew about Israeli special forces' previous raids into southern Lebanon. ""I'm comfortable with them stopping,"" the president said.

His comments only underscored the chasm between the US and Israeli governments on a day when Netanyahu told Iranians in a broadcast, ""There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.""

The disconnect is widening as it coincides with the endgame of a cliffhanger US election. Biden's room for maneuver is limited if he is to avoid exacerbating the domestic political impact of war in the Middle East -- a factor Netanyahu, a consummate operator in US politics, surely understands. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, has largely stuck to the administration line -- despite earlier comments that suggested she might take a slightly harder rhetorical stance toward Netanyahu while emphasizing the plight of Palestinian civilians.

A humiliating pattern for the US on repeat

The pattern of American impotency and Israeli defiance has played repeatedly since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, which prompted the Israeli pounding of Gaza and the more recent attempt to destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Netanyahu often acts first and consults the US later, even when his actions are certain to buckle American diplomatic efforts and compound fears the US will get dragged into a disastrous regional war. The US was not informed in advance, for example, about the Israeli airstrike Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah even though its global shockwaves were bound to be severe.

This Israeli approach has often made the Biden administration appear a spectator rather than an active player in events, as should befit a superpower. Months of grueling shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Antony Blinken have mostly drawn a blank. And the US has incessantly pushed for a Gaza ceasefire that neither Netanyahu nor Hamas seems to want.

This is not just a diplomatic embarrassment. Any time an American president is publicly spurned, there is a cost to their personal prestige and perceptions of US global power. And the likelihood is growing that Biden, who came to office professing to be a foreign policy expert, will leave the White House in a few months with a raging Middle East war set to stain his legacy.

But the Israeli leader's bet that, for all its reservations, the Biden administration will remain the guarantor of the Jewish state's security has paid off. For instance, the US and its allies helped repel a massive Iranian missile and drone attack against Israel in April. The strikes followed an Israeli strike that the US didn't know about in advance on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus that killed eight senior Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers.

And so far, Biden, who has long prided himself on being one of the most pro-Israeli politicians in US history, has been loath to use the leverage he does have -- for instance, permanently cutting off US military supplies for Israel, a step that would have huge political reverberations ahead of the election and leave him accused of deserting an ally fighting terror.

Netanyahu often seems to be taking conscious advantage of Biden's instincts, reasoning he'll swallow any level of provocation.

A deep symbolic irony encapsulates the duality of the US position in the conflict: a CNN analysis found that American-manufactured 2,000-pound bombs were likely used in the attack on Nasrallah, which threatens to ignite the regional conflagration that would be so ruinous to US interests and diplomatic goals.

The price of US-Israeli tensions

But the months of Israeli disregard for the administration's political and strategic concerns have come at a stiff cost. Relations between Biden and Netanyahu are very tense. And growing antagonism often bursts into the open -- most recently when US officials were furious the Israeli leader dissed an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire proposal by a groups of nations led by the US. Washington demanded the Israelis put out a statement to remedy the diplomatic embarrassment, CNN's MJ Lee, Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hansler reported last week.

Ret. Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, said on ""CNN This Morning"" that conversations between Israeli and US officials ahead of the expected Israeli move into southern Lebanon were ""pretty tense ... especially at the upper levels."" He added: ""The key thing to keep in mind is that Israel has basically deliberately kept the US uninformed when it came to the details of their operations.""

On the one side, Leighton said, ""The US is trying to restrain the Israelis; they're trying to limit the scope of military action that the Israelis are conducting. The Israelis are looking at this from a military standpoint right now, and they're seeing the capability and the possibility of going and basically eliminating Hezbollah as a threat to northern Israel and potentially as a threat at all.""

Why has the US-Israeli split widened?

The last year's events have forced the United States and Israel into a situation in which the critical national interests of each state as perceived by its elected leaders are in direct conflict.

The Netanyahu government interpreted the October 7 attacks as a graphic manifestation of an existential threat to the state of Israel and Jews in the Middle East. With that mindset, even intense ill feeling with the White House can be tolerated. And the sense that Israel is waging a battle for its survival makes it easier for leaders to justify to themselves the massive Palestinian civilian casualties from Israeli actions against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, even if the rest of the world sees the carnage as heinously disproportionate.

The United States might warn against the threat of a regional war, but Israel believes it's been embroiled in such a conflict for years against proxy groups taking direction or inspiration from its enemies in Iran's clerical leadership.

But events look different through Washington's wider strategic and historic lens amid worries that Israel's short-term victories are not sustainable and may simply be laying the predicate for decades more insecurity and warfare.

America's national interests do not just lie in the preservation of Israel. The White House is desperate to avoid being sucked into another bitter conflict in the Middle East, given the two decades it took to extract American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Outposts of US soldiers still in the region, including in Syria and Iraq, also remain highly vulnerable to attacks by Iranian proxies as the deaths of three US service personnel in a drone attack on Jordan in January showed.

The global and political implications of the year of rage in the region are also huge. For instance, months of attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have seen US and allied naval forces often under fire and intercepting missiles from Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Cascading economic impacts from slowed supply chains, as shipping lines send cargo on a longer route around Africa, are also considerable. The clashes are unlikely to end while Israel blasts Gaza and Lebanon.

Israeli thinks it's winning, fueling its reluctance to stop

There are also contrasting military perceptions between Israel and the US.

Israel has wiped out many of its most dangerous enemies in stunning intelligence and military actions. In addition to the elimination of Nasrallah, who built Hezbollah into a grave threat to Israel in 30 years, Hamas has also accused Israel of killing Ismail Haniyeh, one of its top leaders, in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. It has also killed other senior members of the two groups in strikes in Syria, Lebanon, Iran and in Gaza. Israeli-detonated attacks on pagers and walkie-talkies injured or killed thousands of Hezbollah operatives.

So why would Netanyahu not press ahead with the greatest Israeli strategic success in decades whatever Biden says?

But Washington has much wider concerns. They include the horrendous civilian casualties and humanitarian disasters in Gaza and Lebanon, a state that has enjoyed a few decades of comparative stability after a murderous civil war, which raged between 1975 and 1990, and caused considerable US bloodshed. The deaths of thousands of civilians is not just a tragedy in itself, it creates severe pressure on the US from its allies and tarnishes America's image by association.

The longer the war goes on, the greater the threat that conflicts intensifying across the region could all join into one perilous multi-front war and that a direct conflict could break out between the US and its arch enemy Iran. A regional war would have disastrous economic consequences and could further deflect from the US goal of mobilizing for its new superpower showdown with China.

Venomous politics are changing long-held truths about the US-Israel relationship

There are also intractable political factors pulling the governments apart.

For most of Israel's existence, it would have been politically and strategically ruinous for a prime minister to show such contempt for a US president.

But Netanyahu's own march to the far right and the reliance of his coalition on ultra-orthodox parties means that his priority is appeasing the most extreme domestic elements to stay in power.

The weakness of centrist and left-wing parties in Israel means a dearth of alternative leaders like late prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin or Shimon Peres, who were ideologically and temperamentally in tune with US presidents. The rise of incendiary and radical leaders like Nasrallah and Hamas officials also means there are no partners on the other side open to traditional US peacemaking.

Even legendary US secretary of state and peace-shuttler James Baker would have struggled with this regional cast of characters.

American calls for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict may ultimately reflect the only possible route to an ending of a generationslong confrontation -- but they also seem utterly divorced from the realities of the blood-soaked Middle East in 2024.

And many observers in Washington have long suspected that Netanyahu has a strong personal interest in perpetually waging war to redeem his own failure to stop the October 7 attacks and to keep postponing his legal reckoning as he faces serious criminal charges.

America's own venomous political reality is also eroding US power in the Middle East. Support for Israel was once an unshakable principle that united Republicans and Democrats. But Netanyahu's meddling in US politics for years -- over the Iranian nuclear issue, for instance -- has alienated many Democrats and their party's move to the left has further tempered backing for Israel.

Ex-President Donald Trump indulged and encouraged the most radical of Netanyahu's policies -- further politicizing the US-Israel relationship. And pro-Trump Republicans are goading him to go further -- at least partly to weaken Biden and his chosen successor, Harris.

Biden and Harris are in a dicey political spot a month before the election. Biden's failure to rein in Israel in Gaza and now Lebanon - and the consequential human carnage - has split the Democratic Party and threatens to drive down turnout among progressives and Arab American voters, especially in swing states like Michigan. But any move to punish Israel could damage Harris among moderate and swing state voters, who are being barraged with negative Trump ads claiming she and Biden are weak and leading the United States into World War III.

This is just one of many reasons why Netanyahu is incentivized to expand his war no matter how powerless it makes America look.

But David Muir of ABC, fake news, when I said that crime is way up in our country, he corrected me, he corrected me and so much and it was right what I said. He didn't correct [Vice President Kamala Harris] one time, and what she said was wrong, absolutely wrong. So many different -- Charlottesville, she was wrong, all of the different things, almost everything she said, and she was never corrected.

""But he corrected me on crime. He said, 'No, no, crime has not gone up.' I said crime has gone up massively. He said, 'I'd like to state for the record that crime has not gone up.'""

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

Trump went on to allege that ABC News broke the ""deal"" they struck ahead of the debate.

""Now you don't know this, but we had a deal with ABC that there will be no corrections of any kind, and they violated the deal. Why? Because they're bad people, and they're fake news,"" Trump said. ""So he did it many times to me during the debate. He violated the deal. That's the deal, because you can take anything and try and make up stories with it. We had a deal where that wouldn't happen. You could do whatever you wanted as soon as the debate was over, but he did it in total violation of what our agreement was. And a lot of people standing right over there [as he looked toward his staff] will tell you exactly what it was, will show you what it was. David Muir has lost all credibility.""

""I never heard of her. I never want to hear of her. She was terrible. I don't know how she ever got her job in the first place,"" Trump said. ""But we have a country to save, and we can't have fake news like that. And his ratings deserve to go down."""
393,Ex-University of Kentucky staffer asks if Hurricane Helene is act of God to punish MAGA supporters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/ex-university-kentucky-staffer-asks-hurricane-helene-act-god-punish-maga-supporters,2024-09-30T22:53:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A former University of Kentucky staffer took to social media to ask if God was unleashing death and destruction via Hurricane Helene on red states because of their support of former President Trump.

""Hurricane Helene...what if GOD is punishing MAGA populations for their hate and hypocrisy? Works for me!"" Betsy Packard wrote Sunday in a post on X.

Hurricane Helene ripped across the southeast days ago, causing widespread devastation. The death toll from the storm has surpassed 100, as of Monday.

NORTH CAROLINA LAWMAKER COMPARES AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE HELENE TO A 'WARZONE'

After receiving backlash for her remarks, Packard, who claimed to be a writer of feminist revisionist poetry, appeared to double-down.

""ALll (sic) day long, MAGAs post lies and mockng nastigrams about Democrats. So, I mocked them, I hammered on their hypocrisy,"" she posted in response to users who challenged her. ""Talk about toxic vengeance (sic). ""They can dish it out, but they can't take it.""

""An Act of God hammered you, and you still din't [sic] hear Him? God is obviously mighty pissed at MAGAs. How can you not see this?"" she asked one user.

Packard served as a teaching assistant at the university ""a number of years ago,"" university spokesman Jay Blanton told Fox News Digital.

""We were just made aware of this post,"" he said. ""We have reported it to the appropriate offices on campus that review questions around conduct. The person in question is not an employee at the University of Kentucky.""

Packard continued to post and argue with her detractors online. She eventually appeared to walk back the idea that she believed the storm was part of a divine punishment on Trump supporters.

""I need to clarify previous posts. I erred in thinking Americans could read,"" she wrote. ""I said WHAT IF. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Michelle Bachmann attributed disasters to divine punishment. DO I BELIEVE THIS? NO. Did I say I believed it? Nope. But some fools DO believe it.""

The university condemned Packard's remarks, saying they were ""abhorrent"" and ""do not reflect our values as an institution.""

""Our thoughts and concerns are with those impacted by these devastating storms,"" the school said. ""As an institution, we have many members of our community directly impacted by them and are working with them to provide support and resources at this time.""

394,Rev. Franklin Graham and Samaritan's Purse help those suffering from Hurricane Helene,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/franklin-graham-samaritans-purse-help-suffering-hurricane-helene,2024-09-30T22:37:15Z,"Fox News reporter Alexandria Hoff has the latest on the former president's outreach to Americans impacted by the devastation on 'Your World.'

Rev. Franklin Graham, CEO of both Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, on Monday spent time in Valdosta, Georgia, together with former president Donald Trump, to offer assistance and comfort to those impacted by Hurricane Helene's devastation.

While the official death toll as of Monday afternoon is over 125, hundreds more people could be deceased, according to officials on Monday afternoon, Fox News reported.

Roads, bridges, homes and businesses have been destroyed while many of those who are stranded await supplies.

FOX CORPORATION LAUNCHES DONATION DRIVE FOR AMERICAN RED CROSS HURRICANE HELENE RELIEF EFFORTS

Samaritan's Purse is responding in the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, the organization shared with Fox News Digital on Monday.

""This building behind us represents hundreds of thousands of people that have lost homes, businesses, friends, loved ones,"" said Rev. Graham on Monday in remarks.

""It is going to take an army of volunteers and people to respond, and at Samaritan's Purse we want to always respond in Jesus' name. We want people to know that God loves them, that God cares for them.""

Samaritan's Purse disaster relief specialists arrived on Friday afternoon to begin assessments.

He added, ""Sometimes when a storm like this comes, people think, 'Well, maybe God is mad at us, maybe this is His judgment?' No. God loves us. How do I know that? Because the Bible tells us that God loves us and cares for us.""

Graham also said, as shared with Fox News Digital, ""Yes, there are storms in life, but God will take us through those storms if we put our faith and trust in His Son, Jesus Christ.""

He thanked the former president ""for coming and helping to put a spotlight on this city, this state and this region that has lost so much.""

Samaritan's Purse disaster relief specialists arrived on Friday afternoon to begin their assessments, the organization told Fox News Digital.

Crews are continuing the work to clear debris, restore power and get supplies to areas affected by the storm.

Two disaster relief units -- tractor-trailers stocked with tools and equipment -- also departed on Friday from North Carolina, where Samaritan's Purse is headquartered, to serve as a base of operations for volunteer teams, the group said.

395,NYT headline asks why Trump attended Alabama-Georgia game if he 'says he's in danger',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyt-headline-asks-why-trump-attended-alabama-georgia-game-he-says-hes-danger,2024-09-30T22:07:42Z,"New York Times Ukraine correspondent Thomas Gibbons-Neff shared what he thought upon learning a man he previously interviewed had attempted to assassinate former President Trump.

A New York Times headline asked why former President Trump sought ""the embrace of 100,000 fans"" while claiming ""he's in danger"" as he campaigns.

NYT writer Shawn McCreesh wrote how Trump appeared to be ""relishing the dangers of his job"" by attending the Alabama-Georgia college football game Saturday night despite having ""bragged about the mortal danger in which he finds himself"" after two assassination attempts.

""Are his supporters, his rivals, the press and the public to treat his every appearance from here on out as an act of death-defying bravery, as he and his boosters suggest? And if he really is the most marked man in the world, why was he wandering around a football stadium in the Deep South in a state he does not need to campaign in, tossing out poultry and posing for selfies?"" McCreesh asked Sunday.

McCreesh added ""some"" at the game expressed ""cynicism"" at Trump's appearance, citing one anonymous grounds and facilities worker over security measures.

NY TIMES ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, CHOOSES DEMOCRAT IN 17TH STRAIGHT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

""I don't think it's a smart move for him to come,"" the worker said. ""I would say about half the people are probably annoyed.""

McCreesh reported, ""Security was tight, traffic was gridlocked, bomb-sniffing dogs prowled the grounds and a hundred thousand people were told to arrive early to pass through magnetometers in time for kickoff.""

He also spoke to Thomas Radney, a 53-year-old Alabama lawyer McCreesh described as ""a rare Democrat among the red-wearing, red-voting masses there that day.""

""He's as safe as in his mother's arms here -- 95 percent of the folks here think he is the second coming,"" Radney said.

Radney suggested Trump's appearance was mostly for his ego.

""Alabama is going to vote for him by huge numbers,"" he said, ""so the fact that he is here just proves what he wants is accolades and people waving, that's his whole deal. 'I want people to cheer for me.'""

NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHES SCATHING GUEST ESSAY ON FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TWO DAYS AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Trump supporter Ben Wilson conceded the former president probably shouldn't have attended the game because of the intense security measures.

""I'm for him, but I would have preferred he just stayed away today,"" Wilson said, ""for logistical reasons.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said, ""Leave it to the New York Times to disgustingly call everyone a threat to democracy. They're just big mad that Kamala Harris would get booed out of the stadium if she were to show her face there. The fact is that Kamala Harris, Democrats, and their media enablers are the ones who are deranged by emboldening those who threaten the safety of President Trump. There have been two heinous assassination attempts on President Trump's life, and their violent rhetoric are directly to blame.""

He continued, ""Their outright lies and weaponization of the justice system to perpetuate countless witch-hunt hoaxes against President Trump have been nothing short of disgusting and abhorrent. If the Democrats and Kamala Harris do not come out and apologize for their hateful rhetoric and tone down their attacks that have stoked the flames of violence, they are explicitly advocating for and inciting more bloodshed against President Trump.""

This was the first time this year Trump had attended a college football game."
396,Jimmy Carter is setting a new record for American presidents. It's important for everyone,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/jimmy-carter-presidents-what-matters/index.html,2024-09-30T21:34:56Z,"A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

Jimmy Carter sets a new record on October 1, his birthday, when he will become the first American president to reach triple digits.

It's a milestone more and more Americans will reach in the years to come - and something the American social safety net is not prepared for.

Carter's post-presidency began in 1981 after he lost his bid for reelection and when he was 56, too young for Social Security and Medicare.

A very long, incredible retirement

Carter did not dedicate his post-presidential life to sitting on corporate boards and raking in speaking fees, as other recent presidents have done.

Carter got his hands dirty building houses, took on peace missions to Cuba and the Middle East, negotiated the release of hostages, lived in his home town, taught Sunday school and college classes, wrote books, and won Grammys.

His has been, indisputably, the longest, most righteous and most productive post-presidency in history, although John Quincy Adams' post-presidential, anti-slavery efforts in Congress get honorable mention.

In the nearly 44 years since he left office, Carter helped essentially eradicate Guinea worm, a parasite that infected around 3.5 million people in the mid-'80s and just 14 in 2023, according to The Carter Center.

It's been 22 years since he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, just as the US was preparing for war in Iraq. Carter also paid a landmark visit to Cuba that year.

It's been nine years since Carter announced at a news conference that he had been diagnosed with brain cancer and might not have long to live.

CNN's Stephen Collinson wrote at the time:

""I have had a wonderful life,"" Carter said with the same unsparing honesty and meticulous detail that marked his presidency. ""I'm ready for anything and I'm looking forward to new adventure,"" Carter said, in the 40-minute appearance before the cameras, in which he frequently beamed his huge smile and never fell prey to emotion. ""It is in the hands of God, whom I worship.""

Carter had more to do

By December 2015, Carter announced that after treatment, the cancer was gone. A timeline of his life maintained by CNN's research library has many more notable entries.

It's been nine years since Carter published an autobiography, ""A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety."" He won a Grammy Award - his second - for the audiobook. He would win a third a few years later.

It's been seven years since he was hospitalized for dehydration in Winnipeg, Canada, where he was outdoors - still working! - for Habitat for Humanity, the organization with which he had a long association.

It's been five years since 2019, when he won that third Grammy, broke his hip and joked that there should be an age limit on the presidency since he couldn't have done the job at 80. That was also the year he turned 95 and became the longest-living American president, surpassing George H.W. Bush.

It's been nearly two years since Carter entered hospice care and nearly one year since his wife, Rosalynn, died. They were married in 1946.

More people will turn 100

As remarkable as Carter made his years since American voters retired him from the White House, there's also something increasingly normal about people living to 100.

Former presidents, all well-to-do and protected by a generous pension, aren't a representative sample of society, but it's notable that the four oldest former presidents - Carter, Bush, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan - all lived in the 21st century.

Overall, US life expectancy dropped during the Covid-19 pandemic. It has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, and it lags behind other developed countries, according to an analysis by KFF. As of 2022, the life expectancy for US males was 74.8 and for US females was 80.2.

But the population of 100-year-olds is expected to quadruple in the coming decades, according to Pew Research Center. It estimated in January that the current number of centenarians was around 101,000 and that the figure would increase to about 422,000 within 30 years, a small but growing portion of the US population as the average age increases and the birth rate declines.

CNN's Eva Rothenberg wrote a year ago about the challenges many Americans will face later in life as they live longer, with more than half of older Americans likely needing long-term care in the future - something that many will not be able to afford and that is not covered under Medicare, the federal health insurance program that primarily benefits older Americans.

A major issue during Carter's presidency and in 1980

Carter signed a law in 1977 that increased taxes to pay for Social Security and changed how benefits were calculated for younger people, which was supposed to help the program's finances. Later, in 1980, Carter signed additional legislation to control the growth of disability benefits.

In the 1980 presidential election, which Carter ultimately lost to Reagan, the long-term viability of Social Security and Medicare was a major campaign issue and featured prominently in debates. And with good reason: The long-term viability of the social safety net programs, despite the law Carter signed in 1977, was still in serious question.

""There you go again,"" Regan said dismissively to Carter in a presidential debate, denying that he opposed the very idea of Medicare. Reagan said he simply opposed the version that became law. Carter later accused Reagan of what we might today call ""gaslighting"" voters on the issue.

""Governor Reagan has a right to change his mind. He does not have a right to rewrite history,"" Carter said in a statement days before Election Day that year.

Reagan, despite his previous opposition to safety net programs, vowed during the campaign to tend to their finances. Carter, on the other hand, was talking about creating a new national health insurance plan, which remains a dream for many Democrats.

More tough changes under Reagan

As president, after first unsuccessfully proposing benefit cuts, Reagan empaneled a commission, chaired by Alan Greenspan, that suggested fixes - some of which ultimately became law in 1983, and not a moment too soon. Social Security was months or weeks away from being able to pay full benefits in 1983, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The 1983 tweaks to Social Security included, for instance, the counting of some Social Security benefits as taxable income and a gradual increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67.

How gradual? The increase is still kicking in more than 40 years later. The 1983 amendments made the full retirement age 67 for people born in 1960 or later. So those seniors still have a few years to go, although people can retire early for a reduced benefit.

That 1983 law, passed near the beginning of Carter's very early and long political retirement, was the last major structural change to address the solvency of Social Security. There have been more frequent tweaks and major changes to Medicare.

Now the social safety net programs are again teetering on insolvency. Social Security will be unable to pay full benefits in just over a decade, according to the government. Medicare has a smidge more time.

Today, there are new calls to incrementally raise the retirement age or increase the taxes that fund Social Security, which apply only to the first $168,600 of income.

Like in the 1970s and 1980s, changes to the safety net will require a serious debate on all sides of the issue. It's a debate few people are having at the moment.

Neither presidential candidate this year is talking much about the long-term funding of these programs. In fact, one of Donald Trump's major proposals is to end the taxation on Social Security benefits that Reagan and lawmakers imposed in 1983. Vice President Kamala Harris has a vague plan to impose new taxes on the wealthy."
397,Audacy will head to bankruptcy court after months of delays fueled by GOP allegations over Soros' stake in radio giant,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/business/audacy-bankruptcy-soros-gop/index.html,2024-09-30T21:33:08Z,"Audacy will head to bankruptcy court after the Federal Communications Commission agreed to conduct a foreign-ownership review with a new, post-bankruptcy version of the radio giant, a move that comes after months of delays, the result of GOP fearmongering over the Soros Fund Management acquisition of Audacy debt.

The radio company's court appearance comes after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, and when it disclosed it was entering a restructuring agreement to reduce debt from about $1.9 billion to $350 million. In February, Bloomberg reported the Soros Fund Management picked up over $400 million of the radio company's debt, making it the largest contributor among a group of lenders looking to exchange loans for stock.

Audacy's day in court also comes months after the radio giant approached the FCC in March, requesting a full foreign-ownership review while also asking the commission to delay the review until after its bankruptcy court appearance, an FCC spokesperson said. In its request, the radio giant emphasized that it believed about 22% of a new, post-bankruptcy Audacy would be foreign-owned, requesting a review out of an abundance of caution.

Audacy, an internet radio conglomerate, operates hundreds of music, news and sports radio stations. The company, founded in 1968 as Entercom Communications, merged with CBS Radio in 2017, operating as Radio.com before rebranding as Audacy in 2021.

Per US broadcast ownership rules, the FCC sets the limit on the number of radio and TV stations an entity can own. The commission is also required to review foreign investments in radio station licenses and has a 25% benchmark for such investments from foreign individuals, governments, and corporations. Foreign investors can acquire up to 100% of a US broadcaster or radio station, but such requests must similarly be approved by the FCC and are not approved if the commission deems foreign ownership goes against the public interest.

Notably, Soros Fund Management, which was created by the Hungarian-born US investor in 1970, is a privately held investment firm chaired by the billionaire. Attacks on Soros have increased in recent years, just as antisemitic attacks have also risen, many of which stem from right-wing influencers, who vocally champion the international strongmen Soros opposes. Soros, who publicly donates to Democratic candidates and liberal causes, is also the founder and major contributor of the Open Society Foundations, which aims to work for justice, democratic governance and human rights.

In mid-September, the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post reported that the FCC had ""fast-tracked"" Soros' ""acquisition of radio stations that reach more than 165 million Americans,"" emphasizing that Soros' ""purchase of more than 200 radio stations in 40 markets just weeks before the presidential election."" The story also alleged that the move by the FCC marked ""the first time in modern history such a deal has been approved by the full Commission without first running the national security review process.""

The licenses in question will be transferred, not to Soros, but to a post-bankruptcy Audacy of which Soros would be a majority shareholder and not the owner, the FCC clarified. Calling this move a ""shortcut"" or a ""fast-track"" process is also false, an FCC spokesperson said, since the license transfer process is identical to one used under Ajit Pai, the former FCC chair appointed by former President Donald Trump, both in 2018 with Cumulus Media and in 2019 with iHeartMedia, as well as many others. Audacy is the second largest radio company in the United States behind iHeartMedia and ahead of Cumulus.

It's important ""to make the distinction that it's not George Soros purchasing all of these radio stations, it's a company that he's affiliated with,"" a person familiar with the deal told CNN, noting that Soros ""is a major shareholder of this company"" but that ""he is not personally purchasing this company or these radio stations themselves.""

""This has gotten ugly,"" the person told CNN, saying the FCC has received numerous ""dangerously false"" allegations that it's favoring the transaction because of Soros, adding that it's a ""lie"" to say the FCC bypassed its review in a new way.

The FCC has fended off accusations of politicking from the right since April, when Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas, published a letter alleging the commission was looking to ""fast-track"" Soros' ""acquisition"" of the company.

""This transaction, which affects radio stations that reach millions of listeners across the U.S., including in Texas' 21st congressional district, should -- at minimum -- be subject to rigorous FCC oversight to ensure U.S. radio stations are not subject to undue influence,"" Roy wrote in a letter.

In July, Sen. Ted Cruz joined the chorus of conservative voices calling for a review, saying the ""takeover"" merited a full FCC vote.

Typically, the FCC's media desk offers a temporary waiver for bankruptcy and conducts its review afterward. But FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel ultimately approved a full commission vote in August.

""Because of the scrutiny, the chairwoman added an extra step here,"" allowing all the commissions to weigh in, an FCC spokesperson said.

Audacy's court date comes after the FCC's commissioners approved the assignment of licenses held by the radio giant to a new, post-bankruptcy version of the company on September 18, allowing the radio giant to temporarily bypass the commission's review as it presents its new slate of investors before a Texas bankruptcy court.

During the months-long delay, Elon Musk's X has also been awash with antisemitic hate over Soros' involvement, some of which has also been directed at the FCC and Rosenworcel.

""What about the Soros move to fast track his bid to acquire over 200 radio licenses??? A far left progressive self hating Jew wanting to control the airwaves,"" one user posted on Wednesday. ""Sounds like communism to me and YOU'RE allowing it. Our eyes are open and we're watching you.""

""Soros is a cut-out for the Rothschilds,"" another user posted on Tuesday.

""George soros and the chain person of the fcc that is fast tracking this is Jessica Rosenworcel, who both just happen to be Jewish,"" yet another user shared on Tuesday. ""Is this now easy to figure out that she's running this thru so quickly.""

Following the radio giant's bankruptcy court appointment, it will be up to a new Audacy to file paperwork with the FCC to take ownership of the stations in question. Following this request, the radio company will trigger a 30-day window during which it must provide the information required for a full foreign ownership review. These reviews typically take between six months and a year, which is why the FCC typically grants waivers to companies going through bankruptcy, since it can be incredibly costly for them to wait up to a year to only then emerge from bankruptcy.

""We can confirm FCC approval and expect to emerge over the next couple of days,"" an Audacy spokesperson told CNN. ""We will have more to share as the process unfolds."""
398,The Hitchhiker's Guide to how the VP debate is sometimes more memorable than the presidential debates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hitchhikers-guide-how-vp-debate-sometimes-more-memorable-than-presidential-debates,2024-09-30T21:17:26Z,"A 'Fox News Live' political panel provided its expectations ahead of the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz, as well as its views on the border issue.

It's doubtful that this week's debate between Vice Presidential nominees Tim Walz and JD Vance will command quite the same attention as the debate between the nominees: Vice President Harris and former President Trump. But historically, tilts between the running mates are often more pugilistic. A lot feistier. More fun to watch. And sometimes, more memorable.

It's hard to say why the undercard can be more intriguing than the main event. But first round playoff games in hockey are often better matches than the Stanley Cup Finals. I've long asserted that the American League and National League Championship Series is generally more competitive baseball than what you experience during the World Series.

Perhaps it has something to do with the vice presidential candidates introducing themselves to the audience. They simply aren't as well known.

""Who am I? Why am I here?,"" quipped late Rear Admiral James Stockdale when independent Presidential candidate Ross Perot tapped him as his 1992 running mate.

IN CONGRESS - LIKE BASEBALL - THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR

Stockdale's folksy line immediately drew laughter and applause from the crowd gathered that night in Atlanta.

""I'm not a politician. Everybody knows that. So don't expect me to use the language of the Washington insider,"" said Stockdale from his lectern wedged between future President Clinton's running mate, then-Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Vice President Dan Quayle.

While Gore and Quayle quarreled, their verbal fusillades caromed back and forth in front of Stockdale. He was mostly a mute bystander. At one point, trying to get in a word edgewise, Stockdale abruptly blurted that he felt like he was in the ""middle of a Ping-Pong"" match.

Later in the debate, moderator Hal Bruno of ABC News asked if mudslinging tactics were ""necessary"" in the campaign. Stockdale replied he didn't hear the question.

""I didn't have my hearing aid turned on. Tell me again,"" Stockdale requested of Bruno, again triggering howls from the audience.

Sometimes the VP candidates must feel each other out.

EXPERTS PREVIEW VANCE-WALZ DEBATE, SAY USUALLY 'FORGETTABLE' VP BOUT 'MIGHT BE DIFFERENT' THIS TIME

""The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight,"" said then-Vice President Dick Cheney to former Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., then John Kerry's running mate at the 2004 VP debate.

Running mates sometimes try to appear more down-to-Earth than those at the top of the ticket.

""Nice to meet ya,"" declared former Alaska Governor and 2008 VP nominee Sarah Palin (R) as she shook the hand of then-Senator Biden on stage in St. Louis. ""Can I call you Joe?""

""You can call me Joe,"" responded the future president with a smile.

Mr. Biden tried to exude an ""aw, shucks,"" lunchpail personae in the 2012 VP debate. He deployed lay language when trading barbs with GOP VP nominee and future House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.

""When we look weak, our adversaries are more willing to test us. They're more brazen in their attacks,"" said Ryan.

CONTINGENT ELECTIONS: WHAT THEY ARE, AND WHAT TO EXPECT IF 2024 TRIGGERS ONE

""With all due respect, that's a bunch of a malarkey,"" countered the future President.

Palin tried the same thing, using phrases like ""doggone it"" and winking at the audience not once, but four times, to punctuate her responses.

Vice Presidential debates are often stocked with wry humor.

""If you won't use any football stories, I won't tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement,"" promised then-Vice President Gore during his debate with GOP VP nominee Jack Kemp in 1996.

Gore was known for his views on global warming and environmental policy. A former congressman and Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Kemp also starred at quarterback for the San Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills in the American Football League before it merged with the NFL.

A lot of people would pay to be a fly on the wall during some of the debate prep. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., has been playing Walz during the sessions with Vance. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has portrayed Vance during his rehearsals with Walz.

THE MAN IN BLACK: JOHNNY CASH STATUE UNVEILED IN THE CAPITOL

But you don't even have to be a fly on the wall for these debates. Sometimes a fly just shows up - and lands on the head of former Vice President Mike Pence. Such was the case when Pence debated Vice President Harris four years ago in Salt Lake City.

But Vice Presidential debates do grow testy.

Besides the fly, many best remember the 2020 Harris/Pence debate for the Vice President repeatedly declaring ""I'm speaking,"" beseeching Pence to wait his turn.

Viewers also remember Pence and Democratic VP nominee and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., talking all over one another during their 2016 debate.

In the first televised VP debate in Houston in 1976, GOP Vice Presidential nominee and future Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., depicted World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam were ""Democrat wars."" He then added that ""the pardon of Richard Nixon is behind us. Watergate's behind us.""

""I think Sen. Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight,"" responded future Vice President and then-Sen. Walter Mondale, D-Minn.

VANCE VS. WALZ: THINK VP DEBATES DON'T MATTER? JUST LOOK AT THESE 6 EXAMPLES

And future President George H.W. Bush drew the ire of female voters when he appeared to speak condescendingly to 1984 Democratic Vice Presidential nominee and Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., - the first woman to ever appear on a major party ticket.

""Let me help you Miss Ferraro about the difference between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon,"" said Bush.

""Let me just say, first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,"" shot back Ferraro.

The congresswoman noted she had served nearly six years in the House by that point.

But one zinger from a Vice Presidential debate is without question one of the best lines in the history of American politics.

During the 1988 campaign, the press corps and some in the public jeered at Quayle as Bush 41's running mate. His youthful looks and frequent verbal faux pas made Quayle seem unprepared for the job. Quayle was 41 years old at the time. But he had already served nearly eight years in the Senate and four in the House. To compensate, Quayle often spun his youth in the same way that late President ""Jack Kennedy"" captured the imagination of Americans.

HOW TO WATCH THE FOX NEWS - CBS NEWS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SIMULCAST

Compared to Quayle, 1988 Vice Presidential nominee and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., presented himself as poised, stately and steady. Bentsen and his handlers were well aware of Quayle's ""Jack Kennedy"" comparisons. And so during the debate in Omaha, Neb., Bentsen waited for Quayle to bait his own trap.

""I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of Vice President of this country. I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency,"" said Quayle.

Bentsen pounced.

""I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,"" said Bentsen.

The auditorium erupted into hales of applause and shouts.

Quayle stewed, staring daggers at his Senate colleague.

""That was really uncalled for, Senator,"" fumed Quayle.

Bentsen's line has echoed for decades, lampooned on everything from Saturday Night Live to 30 Rock.

Just one historic footnote. JFK and Bentsen never served together in the Senate. But they were members of the House during the same period in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Running mates have two responsibilities. They must demonstrate that they're ready to step into the main job. And they aren't supposed to overshadow the actual nominee. Yet with vice presidential debates, the one-liners often do just that."
399,"In razor-thin Georgia, Harris campaign eyeing Asian American voters",CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/asian-american-voters-georgia-harris-trump/index.html,2024-09-30T21:08:44Z,"The moment Kannan Udayarajan decided to become politically active is seared into his memory.

It was four years ago when Republican Sen. David Perdue struck a mocking tone at a Donald Trump rally as he repeatedly mispronounced Kamala Harris' name. The Middle Georgia crowd laughed right along as he stretched out his words: ""Ka-MAL-a or what, Kamala or Ka-MAL-a, Ka-MAL-a, -mala, -mala, I don't know, whatever.""

That remark became a call to action for Udayarajan, 42, who now leads the Forsyth County Democratic Party and is part of the changing face of Georgia.

""I saw some people rationalizing that mispronunciation, and I felt there was a need to stand up, to speak up, because we should not be normalizing this kind of behavior,"" said Udayarajan, who moved to the US in 2007 after growing up in India. ""That's what initially triggered me to mobilize myself and my friends.""

That mobilization is on full display here in Forsyth County, about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta, where the Asian American population has more than doubled in the past two decades, as it has in neighboring counties. Those voters are a critical piece of Harris' game plan in her race against Trump.

""In 2020, when Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes, Forsyth County delivered 16,000 brand new Democratic votes,"" Udayarajan said. ""Now, four years have passed since then, and the demographics of the county have shifted considerably.""

Those shifts could hold critical clues for the outcome of November's election.

With voter registration deadlines quickly approaching in many states and early voting already underway in several others, the Trump and Harris campaigns are scrambling to maximize their strengths among the nation's various demographic groups in hopes of finding an advantage in their bitterly close duel.

Kannan Udayarajan works at the Forsyth County Democratic Party office in Georgia on September 24, 2024.

CNN

Fastest-growing segment of voters

Both sides see opportunity among Asian American voters, the fastest-growing segment of the eligible electorate of any major racial and ethnic group, with rising populations in Georgia, North Carolina and other battlegrounds. Far from a monolith, the voters hail from more than 20 national origins, each with their own view of politics.

""Our numbers are still small, but we could be the deciding factor in terms of margin of victory,"" said James Woo of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an Atlanta nonpartisan group that helps register voters of all parties and encourages participation in elections. ""We always mention that to our community members who see the difference every single vote can make.""

The razor-thin results of the last presidential election in Georgia - Biden won by less than a quarter of a percentage point, out of nearly 5 million ballots cast - bring to life the adage that every vote counts. Woo said there may be far less allegiance to political parties among many Asian Americans, yet people's backgrounds often help inform voting decisions.

""The economy is a huge issue,"" Woo said. ""A lot of community members we work with are small-business owners. They are working seven days a week at mom-and-pop shops, so the economy really impacts them directly.""

Woo has witnessed the remarkable change in the Atlanta suburbs over the past two decades, where one Asian supermarket of his childhood has given way to bustling shopping malls, bakeries, shops, churches and countless restaurants. A diverse tapestry of backgrounds opens the door to very different politics, he said, with South Asians from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh often holding different views than members of the Korean, Vietnamese or Chinese communities.

An elderly man walking to his car in an upscale strip mall one morning last week said he was voting for Trump. A woman working at a nearby coffee shop said she supported Harris. They, along with several others here, declined to give their names to CNN to discuss politics.

""It's not absolutely like black and white, about how immigrants vote one way or another,"" Woo said. ""We also have to look into a lot of issues and specific areas they are concerned about.""

National surveys show that Asian America voters tend to lean Democratic.

A poll released last week from AAPI Data, a data analytics firm that focuses on Asian Americans, found that 66% of Asian American voters plan to support Harris and 28% intend to back Trump. The same survey found that 62% of Asian American voters say they have a favorable opinion of Harris, compared with 35% who hold an unfavorable view.

About 15 million Asian Americans are projected to be eligible to vote in 2024, according to the Pew Research Center, which is up 15% from the 2020 election.

Georgia has about 328,000 Asian American and Pacific Islander eligible voters, according to AAPI Data, a significant number given the expected tight margins of the presidential race. It offers opportunities for both political parties, Woo said, even though he has seen markedly different outreach efforts from Democrats and Republicans.

""I definitely see the Democratic Party do AAPI specific outreach and events,"" Woo said. ""From the Trump campaign, I haven't seen as much.""

A Republican Asian American community center that opened in 2021 and served as a backdrop for campaign events during the 2022 midterm elections is now closed. A novelty sex shop has moved into the space in Norcross, a city in Gwinnett County, which is home to the largest Asian American population in Georgia.

Republican officials declined to elaborate on efforts to win over Asian American voters.

""The 2024 campaign is poised to build upon the strength and successes of Asian Americans during President Trump's first term to propel him to a historic second term victory,"" Steven Cheung, a senior campaign adviser, said in a statement.

The Harris campaign has three full-time staffers at the national headquarters dedicated to engaging Asian American voters, a spokeswoman said, with additional staff being deployed to Georgia and other battleground states.

Harris, who would be the first Black and South Asian woman elected president, is also leaning into her Indian American roots through paid television advertising. Her latest ad is a biographical spot featuring images of her mother, whom Harris described as ""a brilliant, 5-foot tall, brown woman with an accent.""

Down-ballot candidates

Georgia's Forsyth County is deep-red, which Trump carried in 2020 by more than 30 points. But that was down from his nearly 50-point win there four years earlier and for the first time in years, Democrats are fielding candidates up and down the ballot, including Ashwin Ramaswami, who grew up in the area.

Ramaswami is challenging Georgia state Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican who was indicted last year with Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As he knocked on doors one day last week, Ramaswami said the excitement with Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket will reverberate among Asian American voters and beyond.

""The suburbs and the exurbs of Georgia have been the traditional power base for Republicans for such a long time,"" he said. ""It's not a question of if Georgia will become blue, it's a question of when.""

For the next five weeks, Sonjui Kumar and her ""South Asians for Harris"" group are working day and night to try to elect Harris and the rest of the Democratic ticket in Georgia.

As she presided over a virtual phone bank from her kitchen one night last week, she said she believed Asian American voters could make the difference in her Southern battleground state.

""Our community is not that big - it's 4% of the state's population,"" Kumar said. ""But in some counties, it's 122,000, it's 60,000. It's enough to absolutely make a difference when you're talking in those numbers.""

With an October 7 deadline looming to register new voters in Georgia and early voting two weeks away, Udayarajan splits his time between his information technology company and the Forsyth County Democratic headquarters, where organizers from the Harris campaign have descended upon.

""Forsyth County presents a huge opportunity for Democrats,"" Udayarajan said. ""It's of strategic importance, just looking at the data.""

Beyond the data, the mocking of Harris' name that first drew him into politics four years ago has only intensified since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. He said it serves as a motivating force for him and so many other Indian Americans.

""A lot of people here, their aunts or their grandmothers or mothers might have that name,"" Udayarajan said. ""The mispronunciation of the name kind of triggered community involvement in the political process. More and more people just started showing up."""
400,Man accused of second attempted Trump assassination pleads not guilty,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/ryan-wesley-routh-trump-assassination-attempt-plea/index.html,2024-09-30T21:08:40Z,"The man who prosecutors say stalked Donald Trump in Florida over the course of a month before setting up what they called a ""sniper's nest"" on the fence boarding the former president's West Palm Beach golf course has pleaded not guilty to attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate.

Ryan Wesley Routh faces five charges including the assassination attempt, gun charges and assaulting an officer. He pleaded not guilty to each charge in federal court.

Routh appeared in tan prison scrubs and wore glasses at times during the brief hearing. He told the judge he understood the charges against him.

Armed with a Soviet-designed rifle between two bags packed with bulletproof plates, prosecutors say Routh had a clear shot of the 6th hole green when Trump was golfing that Sunday afternoon.

The former president was minutes away from Routh's line of sight, prosecutors alleged during a detention hearing last week.

Routh was allegedly spotted by a Secret Service agent who was running surveillance ahead of Trump. When the agent saw the barrel of a rifle move, the officer opened fire then ducked behind a tree to reload. Routh allegedly fled the area in a car and was arrested by local police less than an hour later on a nearby highway.

Unlike Thomas Matthew Crooks, who shot Trump during a campaign rally in July, investigators have found a wealth of information allegedly on Routh and what may have been the motivation behind the alleged attempted assassination.

One piece of information prosecutors have cited is a letter Routh allegedly left with a witness who came forward after Routh was arrested.

""This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,"" Routh allegedly wrote. ""I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.""

Trump ""ended relations with Iran like a child and now the Middle East has unraveled,"" the letter says.

Routh also wrote a self-published book in which he told Iran, ""You are free to assassinate Trump as well as me for that error in judgment and the dismantling of"" the Iran nuclear deal.

When arguing for his detention pending an outcome in the case, which was ultimately granted, prosecutors said Routh has been arrested over 100 times - many of which were because of traffic violations - and that his travels to Ukraine and Taiwan show that he's able slip across borders.

Routh's case has been randomly assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who dismissed criminal classified document mishandling charges against Trump earlier this year after his attorneys argued that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully assigned to oversee the investigation and prosecution of Trump."
401,Fact check: 12 election lies Trump is using to set the stage to dispute a potential 2024 defeat,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/fact-check-trump-election-lies-2024/index.html,2024-09-30T21:08:38Z,"Former President Donald Trump has escalated his long-running assault on the integrity of US elections as the 2024 presidential campaign enters its final stretch, using a new series of lies about ballots, vote-counting and the election process to lay the groundwork to challenge a potential defeat in November.

Nonpartisan democracy experts say they're seeing many of the same warning signs that were blinking red before Election Day four years ago, when Trump flooded the zone with election lies and conspiracy theories that he amplified after losing to Joe Biden. His campaign of deception culminated in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.

""The threats have not abated; they have only increased,"" said Lindsay Daniels, a senior director at the nonpartisan Democracy Fund, which works to strengthen US democracy. ""We saw a lot of activity in 2020 around peddling false claims and frivolous lawsuits. We are already seeing signs now, stage-setting, that these things may be attempted again.""

Trump has made at least 12 distinct false claims over the last two months that raise baseless doubts about the validity of a potential victory by Vice President Kamala Harris. (Recent polls suggest the race is very close, and Trump could certainly still win.)

Trump, who wrongly insists the 2020 election was marred by massive fraud, said at a debate in June that he will accept the 2024 results regardless of who wins ""if it's a fair and legal and good election."" A majority of Trump supporters in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania now say they're ""not at all confident"" or only ""just a little"" confident the results will be accurately tallied, according to recent CNN polling.

Trump has lied about the legitimacy of the vote counts in key states, the reliability of mail-in and overseas ballots, the size of Harris' crowds at rallies, and more. Here's a fact check of these and other claims.

False claim: Harris can only win through cheating

For months, starting long before any votes were cast in the 2024 general election, Trump repeatedly claimed that he already has enough votes to win and simply needs to ensure Democrats don't cheat -- insinuating that the only way he could possibly lose is through fraud.

Trump said at an August rally in Arizona: ""The only way they can do anything is if they cheat like hell, and we've been victims of that. ... We don't need the votes, we just want to make sure that they don't cheat."" He said at an August rally in North Carolina: ""Our primary focus is not to get out the vote, it's to make sure they don't cheat, because we have all the votes you need.""

And in a Friday speech in Michigan, he said, ""If I lose - I'll tell you what, it's possible. Because they cheat. That's the only way we're gonna lose, because they cheat.""

Facts First: This is nonsense. It's obviously entirely possible that Harris could legitimately win the presidential election. While it's also entirely possible that Trump wins legitimately, he could not possibly know for sure at the time of these comments that he already had ""all the votes you need.""

False claim: It was 'unconstitutional' for the Democrats to replace Biden with Harris

Trump has repeatedly claimed the fairness of the 2024 election was tarnished because Biden dropped out of the race in July and Harris subsequently became the Democratic presidential nominee. In August, he called Harris' ascension ""an unconstitutional coup"" and claimed Biden's ""Presidency was Unconstitutionally STOLEN from him"" by Harris.

Facts First: Trump's claims are false. There was nothing unconstitutional or unlawful about Biden dropping out and Harris then being chosen by Democratic delegates as the party's presidential nominee.

Biden quit the race before he had become the official Democratic nominee -- the party makes the official nomination at its convention, which hadn't happened yet. That means Biden dropped out before his name was placed on any state ballots.

CNN spoke in July with election authorities in 48 states, and not a single state authority, Republican or Democratic, said there were any legal issues with Harris getting on the general election ballot in place of Biden after she was formally nominated in August. She did not end up facing obstacles getting on the ballot in any state.

And while Biden certainly faced heavy Democratic pressure to leave the race after his poor performance in a debate against Trump in June, the decision to drop out was his alone; he could have kept running if he had chosen to do so. In other words, the candidate switch was the product of politics, not a forcible takeover.

False claim: Voting by non-citizens is a widespread problem in US elections

Trump and his allies have repeatedly raised concerns that the 2024 election will be tarnished by widespread voting by non-citizens and undocumented immigrants.

Republicans put this issue front and center in April, when Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled legislation to require all voters across the country to prove their citizenship. Efforts to pass the bill fizzled earlier in September amid disunity within the Republican caucus.

Further fanning the flames, billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk has championed the conspiracy theory that Democrats are ""importing voters"" so they can create a ""one-party state."" At the presidential debate earlier this month, Trump similarly accused Harris and Democrats of plotting to tip the election with illegal voters.

""Our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,"" Trump said. ""They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote.""

Facts First: This specific Trump claim is false, and it's also generally untrue to claim that voting by non-citizens is a widespread problem plaguing US elections. There is simply no evidence to back up that claim; it's already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections, and the various safeguards already in place are working effectively to stop it from happening en masse.

Both liberal and conservative think tanks have found only a tiny number of examples of non-citizens voting in elections where they are ineligible. The right-wing Heritage Foundation's database of confirmed fraud cases lists less than 100 examples of non-citizens voting between 2002 and 2022, amid more than one billion lawfully cast ballots.

Further, nonpartisan experts on election law say such cases are almost always caught, thanks to layers of identity verification built into the registration and voting process.

Here is CNN's previous fact-check debunking false claims about non-citizens voting widely in federal elections. And here is CNN's breakdown of the underlying data in key states, showing how Republicans have massively inflated the size of this problem.

Trump has a long history of blaming electoral losses on undocumented immigrants. When he won the presidency in 2016, he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million -- and to explain this away, he concocted the lie that ""millions"" of non-citizens had voted illegally.

False claim: The US Postal Service admitted it is 'a poorly run mess'

In a social media post in mid-September, Trump claimed that the US Postal Service ""admitted that it is a poorly run mess that is experiencing mail loss and delays at a level never seen before"" and asked ""how can we possibly be expected to allow or trust the U.S. Postal Service to run the 2024 Presidential Election?""

Facts First: Trump's claim is false. There's no evidence of the USPS ever admitting that it is a ""poorly run mess."" Reacting to Trump's comments at a September 19 press conference, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said, ""My response is like my response to everyone who says we're not prepared for the election -- it is that they're wrong.""

DeJoy became postmaster general in June 2020 after being selected by the bipartisan USPS Board of Governors, whose members were all appointed by Trump. DeJoy has touted the fact that in 2020, USPS delivered 99% of all mail ballots within one week.

The National Association of Secretaries of State, an umbrella organization that represents election officials from both parties, started raising alarm bells earlier this month with a sharply worded letter to DeJoy expressing ""ongoing concerns"" about the postal service's ""ability to deliver election mail in a timely and accurate manner.""

In response, DeJoy said the USPS was undertaking ""extraordinary measures"" to make sure all mail ballots are delivered on time, including designated lines at post offices for people with ballots, extra deliveries and collections by letter-carriers, ""after-hours"" drop-offs to election offices, and keeping processing facilities open longer.

Asked by CNN for proof of the supposed USPS admission that it was a ""poorly run mess,"" a Trump campaign spokeswoman responded with two news articles that were not evidence.

The articles were about the recent letter that the election officials sent to DeJoy -- which didn't originate from USPS and wasn't an admission of anything.

Trump has continued raising unfounded doubts about mail-in voting, predicting in a recent interview with a right-wing radio host that USPS ""will lose hundreds of thousands of ballots, maybe purposely.""

There is no evidence of the USPS ever losing ballots on this scale, though isolated mishaps have occurred and been remedied in past election cycles. Furthermore, most mail-in ballots are trackable these days, with tracking tools offered in almost every state.

False claim: There is no identity verification for overseas and military voters

Trump rolled out a new lie in late September about military and overseas voting.

For this tiny slice of the national electorate, voters can receive and submit ballots over email, because they are civilians who live abroad or servicemembers that are stationed overseas.

These are often called ""UOCAVA voters,"" from the acronym for the federal law that set up this system: the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which passed with bipartisan backing and was signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

The deadline for states to send out UOCAVA ballots was September 21. In a social media post two days later, Trump baselessly accused Democrats of using this program ""to CHEAT"" in the election. ""They are going to use UOCAVA to get ballots, a program that emails ballots overseas without any citizenship check or verification of identity, whatsoever,"" Trump claimed.

Facts First: It's not true that UOCAVA ballots are sent to people with no verification ""whatsoever"" of their identity. These special ballots are only sent to registered voters who request them, and states require people to verify their identity when registering.

David Becker, founder and executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research, who regularly advises state and local election officials from both parties, blasted Trump on social media for ""actively spreading false information about a bipartisan program.""

""Military and overseas ballots have gone out to registered, verified voters (as required by law) and they are secure,"" Becker wrote the day after Trump's claim. ""I can tell you election officials of both parties take great pride in giving military and overseas voters a secure voice in our election, and it's unfortunate to see a candidate spread lies about that process.""

Democrats Abroad, an arm of the Democratic Party, condemned Trump's ""absurd rant"" in a statement to CNN, and said UOCAVA ballots ""are only sent to people whose registration have been confirmed and validated by their local elections office.""

False claim: Harris spied on Trump's campaign

Trump launched a new attack on Harris after news broke over the summer that Iranian hackers breached some Trump campaign email accounts and sent some of the stolen materials to journalists and Democratic campaign operatives.

""THE FBI CAUGHT IRAN SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GIVING ALL OF THE INFORMATION TO THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN. THEREFORE SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN WERE ILLEGALLY SPYING ON ME,"" Trump posted on Truth Social in mid-September.

Facts First: Trump's claim that the Harris campaign spied on him is baseless. Iran did breach the Trump campaign, but there's no evidence anyone from the Harris campaign was involved in the breach, solicited hacked materials, or weaponized these materials in any way. The Harris campaign condemned Iran's ""unwelcome and unacceptable"" election interference.

The federal government announced in August that Iranian hackers successfully targeted the Trump campaign, and that they also attempted to breach the Biden-Harris campaigns.

US intelligence agencies later disclosed that the Iranian hackers sent unsolicited messages containing some of stolen Trump materials to some people associated with the Biden campaign. This included ""a few individuals"" who are currently involved with Harris' campaign, her team told CNN.

Despite Trump's claims, there is no evidence the Iranian hackers provided the Harris campaign with ""all of the information"" they stole. The US spy agencies said ""an excerpt"" of some stolen material was provided. More importantly, the US spy agencies said ""there is currently no information indicating those recipients replied"" to the hackers.

The Harris campaign's condemnation of Iran and refusal to use the stolen material is a stark contrast to how Trump embraced Russia's hack-and-leak against his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Even after the US announced that the leaks were part of a Kremlin plot to interfere with the US election, Trump and his campaign built a strategy to capitalize off Russia's illegal actions and used the emails to attack Clinton on a near-daily basis.

False claim: California's vote counts are dishonest

Trump has wrongly claimed for years that US vote counts are plagued by major fraud. In the last month, he has even declared that he would win Democratic-dominated California if there was an ""honest"" vote count. (California's large population means that a candidate's vote totals there have a significant influence on the national popular vote -- which Trump has baselessly cast doubt on for years, even when he won the presidency in 2016.)

Trump said in September that ""if I ran with an honest vote counter in California I would win California, but the votes are not counted honestly."" In late August, he said, ""If Jesus came down and was the vote counter, I would win California, okay?""

Facts First: This is fiction. The votes are counted honestly in California, as they are in every other state. Trump loses California because it is an overwhelmingly Democratic state that no Republican presidential candidate has carried since 1988.

Trump lost the state in 2020, fair and square, by more 5 million votes and more than 29 percentage points. It's ridiculous to suggest that fraudulent vote-counting was responsible for a margin that large.

Like several other states, California conducts post-election audits to verify the accuracy of the vote count. These audits use mathematical models and statistics to access the accuracy of the overall tally based on random samples of ballots.

False claim: Election officials use early voting to commit fraud

Trump has encouraged his supporters this year to make use of early voting. But at a rally in Pennsylvania last week, he suggested that the lag time between when an early ballot is cast and Election Day is used by nefarious actors to fraudulently manipulate the count.

""Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45 -- 'Let's move the ... see these votes, we've got about a million votes in there, let's move them, we're fixing the air conditioner in the room,' right? No, it's terrible. What happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we're not going to let it happen again,"" Trump said.

Facts First: This is another phony narrative. There is no indication that there was any counting fraud involving early ballots in 2020, in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. Early ballots are securely stored in election offices until they are counted. People who interfere with ballots during this period are subject to prosecution.

False claim: Trump won Minnesota in 2020

Trump declared in March and May that he won Minnesota in the 2020 election.

At a Minnesota rally in July, he claimed, ""If they don't cheat, we win this state easily, Okay? They cheat."" He added, ""They're the most crooked. They cheat. They cheated in the last election, and they're going to cheat in this election, but we're going to get them.""

Facts First: Trump's claims are false.

He lost Minnesota by more than 7 percentage points in the 2020 election, fair and square, and he can certainly lose the state legitimately in 2024.

The state hasn't chosen a Republican for president since 1972, and Trump has consistently trailed in opinion polls against Harris -- whose running mate is the sitting Minnesota governor, Tim Walz.

False claim: A large percentage of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are fraudulent

Pennsylvania is one of the most important swing states in the 2024 election. Trump claimed in a social media post in September that an ""election expert"" interviewed by right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson had suggested a large percentage of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are fraudulent.

""An interview by Tucker Carlson of an election expert indicates that 20% of the Mail-In Ballots in Pennsylvania are fraudulent. Here we go again! Where is the U.S. Attorney General and FBI to INVESTIGATE? Where is the Pennsylvania Republican Party? We will WIN Pennsylvania by a lot, unless the Dems are allowed to CHEAT,"" he wrote.

Facts First: There is no valid basis for the claim that 20% of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania -- or any other state -- are fraudulent. This claim appears to be based on a flawed 2023 poll by a right-wing pollster, not the discovery of any actual problems with ballots in Pennsylvania or anywhere else from 2020, 2022 or this year.

The 2020 election was fair and secure in Pennsylvania, as it was in the rest of the country, according to officials from both parties who affirmed the results. There was a tiny smattering of voter fraud in the state in 2020 -- - some of it committed by Trump supporters -- but not even close to enough to have affected the outcome.

Pennsylvania's Department of State said in a September email to CNN: ""Voting by mail is safe and secure, and no evidence exists of widespread mail voting fraud in Pennsylvania.

Mail ballot fraud has been proven to be exceptionally rare. Claims of systemic voter fraud are devoid of any supporting evidence and have consistently been rejected by judges, government agencies, and election experts across the political spectrum.""

So what was Trump referring to?

Trump and his campaign didn't specify what interview he was talking about. But in April, Carlson interviewed someone who spoke of a 2023 poll conducted by a right-wing firm, Rasmussen Reports, that has itself promoted false election claims. Among likely voters in that poll who said they had been absentee or mail-in voters in 2020, 21% claimed to have filled out a ballot for a friend or family member and 17% claimed they had voted in a state where they were no longer a permanent resident.

There are lots of reasons not to treat this poll as evidence of mass fraud in Pennsylvania.

First, this was a national poll, not a Pennsylvania poll. Second, the pollster is viewed skeptically by many polling experts. Third, people making claims to a pollster about their past behavior does not prove that they actually did what they said.

Fourth, as FactCheck.org pointed out earlier this month, it's legal to fill out a ballot for a voter with disabilities who has asked for the assistance -- so someone saying they filled out someone else's ballot isn't necessarily a confession of fraud. Fifth, as FactCheck.org also noted, the wording of the residency question was ambiguous enough that people could have thought it was asking about legal behavior -- such as having voted in 2020 in a different state from the one they currently lived in three years later.

False claim: Harris fabricated an image to inflate her crowd size

Since 2020, various Trump supporters have claimed that Biden's unimpressive crowd sizes are proof that Biden's 2020 vote total, about 81 million, was fraudulently inflated. (Trump earned about 74 million votes in 2020.)

In August, Trump launched an attack on Harris' crowd sizes. He claimed on social media that Harris should be disqualified from the race because, he claimed, she had faked an image of a large crowd at her rally at a Michigan airport. He wrote: ""There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN'T EXIST!""

He also wrote, ""This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING - And they're even worse at the Ballot Box. She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!""

Facts First: Trump's claims are false. Harris did not create a fake image of the Michigan crowd using artificial intelligence or anything else. As genuine photos and videos showed, and reporters on scene confirmed, she had a real crowd of thousands of people at the airport event.

The false claim that the Harris campaign was pushing fake images of this Michigan crowd had been circulated by some far-right influencers before Trump adopted it.

Asked by CNN in August why he made the false claim, Trump said he ""can't say what was there, who was there"" and could only speak about his own large crowds. But he made another false claim about Harris' crowds at the presidential debate against Harris in September, wrongly saying, ""People don't go to her rallies.""

False claim: Biden or Harris orchestrated Trump's legal cases

Trump has repeatedly claimed this year that ""all"" of the legal cases against him, including local and state cases, were all orchestrated by Biden for the purpose of ""election interference,"" to help Democrats win the election.

In July, when Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became the Democratic candidate, Trump began claiming she was the one behind the cases.

Facts First: These claims are false. There is no evidence that Biden personally orchestrated any of these cases. Trump never presented any evidence for that claim, let alone for suddenly making the vice president the target of the claim after months of directing it at the president.

There is no sign that either Biden or Harris had any role in bringing charges against Trump in Manhattan, New York (where Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records) or Fulton County, Georgia (where an election subversion case against Trump is on hold over a battle about whether the district attorney should be disqualified). Those prosecutions have been led by elected local prosecutors, both Democrats, who do not even report to the federal government.

Trump's two federal criminal cases, one about election subversion and one about Trump's retention of classified documents after his presidency, were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. A judge dismissed the classified documents case in July, but Smith is appealing.

Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is far from proof that Biden orchestrated the prosecutions - and certainly not proof that Harris did. Garland has said he would resign if Biden ever asked him to take action against Trump, but expressed confidence that Biden would never put him in that position."
402,Man who claimed he had explosives at Trump rally in Michigan is charged,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/man-charged-trump-michigan-explosives/index.html,2024-09-30T21:08:38Z,"Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Walker, Michigan, on Friday.

The man who allegedly claimed he had C4 explosives in his car and sped through a security checkpoint at Donald Trump's rally in Michigan over the weekend pleaded not guilty to charges against him on Monday.

Steven William Nauta has been charged with four state counts, including making a false threat of terrorism and being in possession of bomb-making materials. He has pleaded not guilty to each count, according to a court official.

A bond of $1 million was set for Nauta during his arraignment Monday, according to a court official, and was placed under house arrest.

In the complaint against Nauta, prosecutors allege that he ""approached a traffic point"" and ""held a bottle to police and stated that it was 'C4' explosive and that it was the 'real deal.'""

The complaint says he sped past the traffic point, disobeyed commands by officers to stop and, when he finally stopped after being chased by police, ""removed bags of fertilizer from his vehicle and threw them on the ground to make it appear that they were explosives.""

Nauta told law enforcement, the complaint says, that ""he intended to make officers, and others, believe that he had explosives.""

A federal source familiar with the incident told CNN that no explosives were found in Nauta's vehicle. The charges against Nauta note that the fertilizer he allegedly removed from his vehicle can be used to make explosives.

Nauta's plea of not guilty comes on the same day that Ryan Wesley Routh, who allegedly sat outside of Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, with a rifle while Trump was golfing, pleaded not guilty to charges against him, including attempting to assassinate a political candidate."
403,Power outage doesn't slow down Vance prep for Tuesday's VP debate with Walz,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-outage-doesnt-slow-down-vance-prep-tuesdays-vp-debate-walz,2024-09-30T20:53:03Z,"EXCLUSIVE - Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance didn't let a power outage derail his preparations for Tuesday's debate with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic Party's running mate.

A source familiar with the senator's debate prep tells Fox News Digital that over the last month, former President Trump's running mate took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team.

For those not familiar with the term, a murder board is a group of people who ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Emmer, who steered the House Republicans' campaign committee in the 2020 and 2022 cycles, said last week in a Fox News Digital interview that ""it's an honor to be asked to play a very small part in helping JD and President Trump expose the failures of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.""

Emmer and Walz overlapped for four years in the House before Walz won election in 2018 as Minnesota's governor. ""I do know him probably as well or better than most on the Republican side,"" he said.

And Emmer, taking a shot at his fellow Minnesotan, argued ""the hardest part of playing Walz... is trying to tell lies with a straight face, because that's what he does. He's good at the debate game, but there isn't substance there. There's a lot of air.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW

Former President Trump, asked Monday if he's given his running mate any advice, told reporters, ""No, he doesn't need it.""

But he added that he and Vance have ""been speaking a little bit back and forth"" and that he thought the senator was in ""good shape.""

Part of the Trump campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

Vance, his family, and top aides and advisers arrived in New York City on the eve of the debate.

Fox News confirmed that Vance will speak to a conference of major Republican donors Monday evening in Manhattan.

According to a source familiar with the GOP vice presidential nominee's plans, Vance will address the American Opportunity Alliance behind closed doors.

A man who shot two Jewish men outside a pair of Los Angeles synagogues last year was sentenced Monday to 35 years in prison, federal prosecutors said.

Jaime Tran, 30, pleaded guilty on June 3 to two counts of hate crimes with intent to kill and two counts of using, carrying, and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, the Justice Department said.

""After years of spewing antisemitic vitriol, the defendant planned and carried out a two-day attack attempting to murder Jews leaving synagogue in Los Angeles,"" said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. ""Vile acts of antisemitic hatred endanger the safety of individuals and entire communities, and allowing such crimes to go unchecked endangers the foundation of our democracy itself.""

JEWISH DEMOCRAT SUING HARVARD OVER ANTISEMITISM CHASTISES HIS PARTY FOR INACTION, ENDORSES TRUMP

Tran was accused of shooting both men at close range from moving cars as they were leaving religious services at synagogues in Los Angeles' Pico-Robertson neighborhood, which is predominantly Jewish.

He told investigators that he looked for a ""kosher market"" and decided to shoot someone nearby because he believed there would be Jewish people around the area.

On Feb. 15, 2023, he shot a man wearing a yarmulke as he was leaving religious services at a synagogue before fleeing in his car. The next morning, he shot a second Jewish victim, also wearing a yarmulke, as he was leaving a synagogue.

Tran was arrested a day later after a witness reported seeing someone shooting a firearm behind a motel. He told investigators that the shootings would have continued had he not been arrested, prosecutors said.

The shooting raised fears among the city's Jewish community after authorities said the victims were targeted because of their religious clothing.

HARVARD SLAMMED FOR 'SMOKE AND MIRRORS' ANTISEMITISM RESPONSE: 'THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS WORSE'

At the time, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the ""terror"" of the two shootings was ""felt all across Los Angeles."" She noted that antisemitism was on the rise in L.A. and across the country, saying fighting hate crimes ""in all forms"" is a priority in her administration.

In a statement, the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles said it ""appreciates today's sentencing"" of Tran while thanking law enforcement and prosecutors.

Prosecutors said Tran became obsessed over his ""antisemitic hatred"" for years leading up to the February 2023 attacks.

In 2018, Tran left graduate school after making antisemitic comments about other students. From August 2022 to December 2022, his antisemitic statements included messages to former classmates such as ""I want you dead, Jew,"" and ""Someone is going to kill you, Jew."" Tran described himself as a ""ticking time bomb"" and maintained social media accounts with the handle ""k1llalljews.""

In November 2022, Tran emailed two dozen former classmates a flyer that stated ""EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THE COVID AGENDA IS JEWISH.""

Tran was prohibited from purchasing firearms because of previous mental health holds, authorities said. In January 2023, Tran asked someone in Phoenix to buy two firearms for him.

Tran selected the firearms he wanted and paid approximately $1,500 in cash to the third party, who then purchased them.

Law enforcement identified the person, who has now pleaded guilty to illegally selling Tran the firearm used in the shootings. Messages retrieved from his phone revealed that Tran had asked multiple people to purchase firearms for him and had offered to pay more if no background check was performed, prosecutors said."
405,Migrant crossings at the US' southern border drop again amid campaign year scrutiny,CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/migrant-crossing-numbers-drop/index.html,2024-09-30T20:45:09Z,"Migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border remain at their lowest levels since 2020, according to new federal data obtained by CNN, as Republicans and Democrats spar over border security.

Immigration remains among the top issues for voters and former President Donald Trump has made it a cornerstone of his campaign, pinning blame on Vice President Kamala Harris over the handling of the US-Mexico border and frequently turning to the issue on the campaign trail.

Harris' visit to the US-Mexico border Friday was the clearest example yet of the campaign doubling down on border security by embracing strict rules that have been condemned by some corners of the Democratic party. The Democratic nominee tried to cast herself as the solutions-oriented candidate when addressing the US southern border, taking on a tougher stance while also pursuing broader immigration reform, in remarks Friday - an attempt at trying to close the gap with Trump on the issue.

But numbers have fallen drastically following executive action taken by the Biden administration over the summer. And the administration took new steps Monday to cement those restrictions and keep them in place for the foreseeable future.

In September, US Border Patrol recorded around 54,000 encounters along the US southern border, according to federal data -- marking an overall decline since the executive action went into effect.

It's a notable shift from only months ago when Homeland Security officials wrestled with record numbers of border crossers and comes at a heated moment in the election cycle where border security has featured prominently.

Administration officials cite the executive action that President Joe Biden announced in June, which largely bars migrants from seeking asylum at the US southern border and levies harsh consequences on those illegally crossing, for the dramatic decline in crossings.

Migrants are still allowed to apply to legally migrate through other avenues, including a mobile app known as CBP One. US Customs and Border Protection processes 1,450 appointments daily.

""When you've seen previous things like this, they have been only enforcement at the border, and you have to have enforcement at the border, plus international collaboration, plus affirmative pathways for people to be able to come the right way,"" a senior CBP official told CNN.

The June measure can be turned on and off and lifted when there's a daily average of fewer than 1,500 encounters between ports of entry, among other criteria. Daily encounters currently hover around 1,700.

But changes to that measure will make it harder for officials to lift it - a proposal that Harris floated while at the US southern border Friday, but campaign officials described it as different to what the administration has already been working on.

The administration updated Biden's June proclamation so that lifting the measure could only occur after crossings fall below an average of 1,500 encounters per day for 28 consecutive days, broadening the window. That's then followed by a two-week period, which remains the same.

Homeland Security officials argued the modification is to account for short-term changes, like holiday downturns or extreme weather events.

There are some exceptions to the rule, including unaccompanied migrant children. Homeland Security officials have described the change as the next step in the rulemaking process.

""It's deeply troubling that this administration is taking steps to further cement an illegal rule that is sending credible asylum seekers back to danger. We are now left for the courts to strike it down,"" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, who's leading the lawsuit against the administration's asylum restrictions.

During her border trip, Harris described policies that would bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US southern border unless at a legal port of entry - marking a departure from decades-long protocol - and detailing harsh penalties for repeat border crossers.

""As president, I won't only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry,"" she said. ""We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators.""

""While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure,"" Harris added.

CORRECTION: This story and its headline have been updated to correctly characterize the drop in border crossings this summer."
406,"Trump leads, and his party follows, on vaccine skepticism",CNN,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/health/trump-vaccine-skepticism-partner-kff-health-news/index.html,2024-09-30T20:45:07Z,"On at least 17 occasions this year, former President Donald Trump has promised to cut funding to schools that mandate vaccines.

More than four years ago, former President Donald Trump's administration accelerated the development and rollout of the covid-19 vaccine. The project, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, likely saved millions of lives. But a substantial number of Republican voters now identify as vaccine skeptics -- and Trump rarely mentions what's considered one of the great public health accomplishments in recent memory.

""The Republicans don't want to claim it,"" Trump told an interviewer in late September.

Instead, on at least 17 occasions this year, Trump has promised to cut funding to schools that mandate vaccines. Campaign spokespeople have previously said that pledge would apply only to schools with covid mandates. But speeches reviewed by KFF Health News included no such distinction -- raising the possibility Trump would also target vaccination rules for common, potentially lethal childhood diseases like polio and measles.

The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on this article.

Trump has presided over a landslide shift in his party's views on vaccines, reflected this campaign season in false claims by Republican candidates during the primaries and puzzling conspiracies from prominent conservative voices. Republicans increasingly express worry about the risks of vaccines. A September 2023 poll from Politico and Morning Consult showed a narrow majority of those voters cared more about the risks than the benefits of getting inoculated.

A surge in anti-vaccine policy in statehouses has followed the rhetoric. Boston University political scientist Matt Motta, who tracks public health policy, said preliminary data shows that states enacted at least 42 anti-vaccine bills in 2023 -- nearly a ninefold surge since 2019.

In some states, it has the look of a crusade: The 2024 Texas GOP platform, for example, proposes a ban on mRNA technology, the innovation behind some covid-19 vaccines that scientists believe could have significant applications for cancer care.

Last month, Trump made an appeal to anti-vaccine voters by landing the endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the nation's most prominent vaccine skeptics -- and appointing him to his transition team. In a recent tour with former Fox News broadcaster Tucker Carlson, Kennedy said he was ""going to be deeply involved in helping to choose the people who run FDA, NIH, and CDC.""

Trump's outreach can be more discreet: He recently met with a delegation of vaccine-skeptical activists -- including one group pushing an end to mandates and certain types of vaccines -- at his New Jersey golf club; the discussion was publicized by the conservative blog ""Gateway Pundit.""

Trump has options in advancing anti-vaccine goals as president, such as by sowing further doubt and undermining the federal government's ability to make vaccine recommendations. He has promised to appoint Kennedy, along with ""top experts,"" to a panel exploring chronic diseases, some of which Kennedy's nonprofit has linked to inoculations. ""Nobody's done more"" to advocate for ""the health of our families and our children,"" Trump declared at a rally accepting Kennedy's endorsement.

Still, it's hard to tell how Trump's most frequently made proposal -- defunding schools that mandate vaccinations -- would translate into action, said Judith Winston, former general counsel of the Department of Education during the Obama administration.

Currently, the Department of Education lacks the power to turn off public school funding all at once, she said -- meaning a second Trump administration would have to take away money program by program.

And the legal basis for such a move isn't clear. ""I am unaware of any federal law that mandates school districts either provide or not provide a vaccine,"" Winston said, adding it would probably require congressional action.

All 50 states have a vaccine requirement tied to school attendance.

Trump's outreach to anti-vaccine constituencies comes as vaccine hesitancy increases and preventable disease surges. This summer, Oregon experienced its worst outbreak of measles since 1991.

The situation could get worse, said Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: In the Nineties, during a time when vaccine skepticism also proliferated, the U.S. saw thousands of measles cases. According to the CDC, we haven't yet returned to those bad old days -- but the number of measles cases recorded this year is already quadruple that of last year.

""It was highly disruptive,"" he said. ""Many children who had measles ended up with hearing problems or cognitive problems that were lifelong. A small number died in this country.""

Worldwide, the disease killed over 100,000 in 2022, mostly among children under age 5, according to the World Health Organization.

Polling shows a substantial minority of Americans, concentrated in the Republican Party, hold vaccine-skeptical positions, said Harvard professor and health politics expert Robert Blendon.

And skepticism about covid vaccines is blossoming into suspicion of vaccines generally among that group, he said. ""It follows from this rebellion against the covid vaccine mandates.""

Vaccine opposition has divided the GOP. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made opposition to vaccines a core part of his ill-fated campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. In states such as Wyoming and Missouri, pitched primary campaigns centered on anti-vaccine themes this year.

Bob Onder, a physician and Republican candidate for Congress in Missouri, was accused in Facebook ads placed by his top opponent of taking millions from pharmaceutical companies to test vaccines. ""He profited from our pain,"" one ad said. ""You suffered the consequences.""

Onder ""has never done covid vaccine research"" and opposes covid vaccine mandates, his campaign manager, Charley Lovett, told KFF Health News. (Lovett said Onder ""conducted"" one study sponsored by AstraZeneca on preventing covid in high-risk patients using monoclonal antibodies, not vaccines.)

Onder won the Republican primary, but his vaccine-disparaging opponent still scored just over 37% of the vote.

Anti-vaccine candidates typically become anti-vaccine policymakers. The impact can be seen in Texas, where vaccine politics were once a bipartisan matter. According to researchers, from 2009 to 2019, legislators there passed 19 pro-vaccine bills, such as a measure allowing pharmacists to administer immunizations.

But that consensus began to shift toward the end of the decade. Small groups, often nurtured on Facebook, made their influence felt. One such group, Texans for Vaccine Choice, spurred testimony before the state legislature in 2021 and targeted pro-immunization legislators, some of whom fell in their GOP primaries.

Misinformation has fueled the anti-vaccine turn in Texas, alongside traditional conservative attitudes about individual autonomy, said Summer Wise, a former executive committee member of the state's Republican Party -- particularly misconceptions about the use of fetal cells in vaccine development; falsified research about a link between vaccines and autism; and conspiracy theories about Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist who has championed vaccination.

""Politicians see vaccines as an easy foil to propagate fear among the electorate, which can then be leveraged and directed to control a voting bloc,"" Wise said.

In addition to calling for a ban on mRNA technology, the Texas GOP's 2024 platform features a laundry list of policies that could undermine vaccination, including allowing medical residents and physicians the ability to opt out of administering shots for religious reasons. It also calls for enshrining a patient's ability to opt out of vaccine mandates in the state's Bill of Rights.

Nationally, anti-immunization policies could take an aggressive turn under a second Trump administration.

Roger Severino, formerly head of the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Civil Rights and now with the Heritage Foundation, penned the health agency section of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation-led initiative to plan for a Republican administration.

Among other ideas, the document proposes clipping CDC authority to issue vaccine or quarantine guidance of a ""prescriptive"" nature, targeted at schools or elsewhere.

A spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation noted Severino has said the agency's credibility has been hurt, and it has a burden to explain ""all the vaccines on the schedule being taken in combination.""

The proposal misunderstands CDC's history and powers, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University. The agency ""rarely if ever"" makes binding recommendations, he said.

""When the next pandemic hits, we will look to CDC to offer guidance based on the best-known evidence,"" he said. ""We don't want a disempowered agency in a public health emergency.""

Some Republican intellectuals have spun dystopian visions surrounding vaccines. Take ""Dawn's Early Light,"" a yet-to-be-published book by Heritage president Kevin Roberts. The tome -- which earned a glowing foreword by Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance -- reserves especially sharp words for vaccines.

In one section of the book, Roberts imagines that the federal government would somehow use alleged new capabilities to ""deplatform drivers"" of cars for ""failing to follow the latest vaccine mandate.""

""Yet another powerful tool of social control falls into place,"" he wrote.

The man who allegedly claimed he had C4 explosives in his car and sped through a security checkpoint at Donald Trump's rally in Michigan over the weekend pleaded not guilty to charges against him on Monday.

Steven William Nauta has been charged with four state counts, including making a false threat of terrorism and being in possession of bomb-making materials. He has pleaded not guilty to each count, according to a court official.

A bond of $1 million was set for Nauta during his arraignment Monday, according to a court official, and was placed under house arrest.

In the complaint against Nauta, prosecutors allege that he ""approached a traffic point"" and ""held a bottle to police and stated that it was 'C4' explosive and that it was the 'real deal.'""

The complaint says he sped past the traffic point, disobeyed commands by officers to stop and, when he finally stopped after being chased by police, ""removed bags of fertilizer from his vehicle and threw them on the ground to make it appear that they were explosives.""

Nauta told law enforcement, the complaint says, that ""he intended to make officers, and others, believe that he had explosives.""

A federal source familiar with the incident told CNN that no explosives were found in Nauta's vehicle. The charges against Nauta note that the fertilizer he allegedly removed from his vehicle can be used to make explosives."

CNN data reporter Harry Enten warned on Monday that Vice President Kamala Harris was on track to have the ""worst"" Democratic performance among union voters in a generation.

""Sometimes there are data points that just jump off the screen, should set off sirens. Alright, this is union households. This is the Democratic margin in the presidential election. It ain't what it used to be,"" Enten began. ""Bill Clinton won that union vote by 30 points. Hillary Clinton only won it by 12 points back in 2016. That was the lowest mark for a Democrat since 1984, Mondale vs. Reagan. But look at where Kamala Harris is today. She is only leading by nine points.""

President Biden, according to Enten, was at +19 among union household voters in November 2020.

""That would be the worst Democratic performance in a generation. Ten points off the mark of Joe Biden, who of course won four years ago, was sort of that union guy, union Joe, right?"" he said of Harris' numbers.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

Enten also spoke about voters who have gone to trade school or vocational school.

""Look at this margin, this to me, oh boy, does this tell you about the state of our politics now vs. back in the early 1990s, margin among vocational and trade school grads in pre-election polling. Bill Clinton was leading that vote over George H.W. Bush by seven points. Look at where Donald Trump is today, over Kamala Harris, a 31-point advantage,"" Enten said.

The Teamsters labor union announced recently that they would not be endorsing a presidential candidate. The labor union has endorsed Democratic candidates in almost every election since 1988, when they endorsed George H.W. Bush. The union also chose not to endorse a candidate in the 1996 election.

""When I think people think of the working class, they think of people who use their hands. And we know that Donald Trump has been going after that vote, and he is in a very, very strong position, more so perhaps than any other bloc. The folks who go to trade school, vocational school, that has moved from being a core Democratic group to now being a core group of Donald Trump's massive amount of support among the working class,"" Enten said.

The data reporter also noted that Trump had gained among non-college voters of color, despite Harris still leading among the group overall.

""So this is the margin among non-college graduates, all right, the voters of color. You go back four years ago, look at that, Joe Biden won that group by 45 points. Look at where Kamala Harris' support is today, she's still leading amongst that group, but that lead is down 17 points to just 28 points,"" he said.

""The reason Donald Trump is doing so well amongst voters of color, is because he has really gone in and grabbed a lot of voters that he didn't previously have among those who didn't graduate college. And this is part of a larger trend that we're seeing throughout our politics era in which Republicans, specifically Donald Trump, is doing very, very well among working-class voters, whether they're in unions, whether they went to trade school, or whether they're voters of color,"" Enten added."
409,Biden's old backyard now a key Pennsylvania battleground filled with 'purple' votes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-old-backyard-now-key-pa-battleground-filled-purple-votes,2024-09-30T20:05:23Z,"SCRANTON, Pa. -- While northeastern Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County has been a Democratic stronghold in state and federal elections, voters on the streets of the old coal mining region say the area runs ""purple"" and will likely be a nail-bitter of an election.

""It's not as blue as people think. It's more purple underneath because people are afraid to say anything around here because they think that there's going to be retaliation. That's an old thing that goes back generations around here,"" David Kveragas told Fox News Digital from a pizza shop on the main drag of Scranton as a storm sloshed rain across the Wyoming Valley last week.

Lackawanna County is home to cities and towns such as Scranton, Carbondale and Throop, mixing cityscapes backdropped by factories of a bygone era, and dotted with suburbs and expansive farms. The county has long voted blue in state and national elections, last throwing its support behind a Republican in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan's blowout election when he won each state except Washington, D.C., and Minnesota -- the home state of Reagan's competitor that year, Walter Mondale.

The county has trended right in recent elections, however, teeing up a heightened election battle that will likely help determine how the key battleground state will swing come Nov. 5.

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AS SCRANTON LOOKS BACK ON NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Between 2000 and 2012, Democratic presidential nominees earned between 56% and 63% of the vote, U.S. News and World Report found. That standard fell below 50% in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unsuccessfully ran against former President Donald Trump, but still carried a win for the Democratic Party's ticket even with the lessened support.

President Biden was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware. Biden's hometown status likely helped boost his popularity among locals in the 2020 election, winning 53.58% of the vote to Trump's 45.23% that year.

As the election cycle comes down to its final five weeks, Fox News Digital spoke to voters on the streets of Scranton to ask about their top election concerns and who they will cast their ballot for come November. Fox News Digital received a mixed bag of responses, with some voters proudly declaring Vice President Kamala Harris' support of abortion access earned their vote, while Trump supporters said voters only need to look at their pay stubs from the 2016-2020 era compared to today to determine their ballot choice.

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice? I'm not here to knock Trump or any candidate. But as a woman of Puerto Rican descent, I feel it's really important for us to really sit and discuss the pros and cons of each candidate. But especially as a woman,"" a local mom named Adrianna, who is supporting Harris in the election, told Fox News Digital.

BIDEN CLAIMS TO SEE THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE EYES OF SCRANTON, NOT WALL STREET

Adrianna is a mom to a young boy and said that inflation issues and childcare issues have rocked her day-to-day life as she has tried to find a daycare for her son for more than a year. When asked if she believes Harris will correct inflation if elected as president after serving as vice president for three and a half years, she responded, ""I hope so.""

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice?"" - Pennsylvania mom Adrianna

Adrianna said that while inflation concerns her, abortion is her top voting issue.

""I believe nobody should tell a woman what to do with her body, especially -- not to sound sexist -- but a man. I think that should be an individual decision that a woman should make,"" she said.

For Trump supporters, the economy, inflation, national security and immigration came in as top concerns for voters.

""The price of gas is a big issue with me. I do a lot of driving. And I remember back in the day, you know, when you got $20, it'd fill up your gas tank. It's just going up and up,"" Trump supporter John Soentgerath told Fox News Digital.

""With all due respect to my Democratic friends, I have a lot of them, [under] this previous administration there has been less take-home pay. The prices of gas [is] up, food. And I like to eat like anybody else. You tell me any mother or father that doesn't want to put food on the table for their kids, give them treats, ice cream, goodies and things of that nature,"" Soentgerath added.

Larry West of Scranton told Fox News Digital from a bus stop near The Marketplace at Steamtown that Trump earned his vote for his national security platform as wars continue raging in Ukraine and Israel, saying Harris appears ""weak"" on foreign affairs.

Kveragas told Fox News Digital that he is an independent who ""voted against Hillary"" in 2016, before becoming a Trump supporter while evaluating the 45th president's record in office.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA SAY WORKING CLASS WILL SUPPORT HER

""He straightened out the economy. He got the border under control. He cut regulations. He did pretty much everything you would want a -- a realistic person would want -- a president to do. So with this election, it's primarily the economy, obviously. My retirement was up 40% under Trump. I lost the 40%, plus another 20% under Biden. So things are terrible there. The border, which we're being overrun. Obviously, it's not just a matter of jobs. It's a matter of housing and crime fighting, fentanyl, which has run rampant. Fentanyl is killing more people than guns,"" Kveragas said.

On the flip side, a Harris supporter who identified himself as Michael told Fox Digital that ""women's rights"" is his top priority this election cycle.

""I believe that every woman should have a choice to make their own decision,"" he said.

Michael explained that the economy and inflation have also affected his life, saying that he works two jobs to pay the bills and that expenses were much cheaper a decade ago. When asked if he feels Harris is better equipped to handle the economy over Trump, Michael argued that while Trump is a ""businessman,"" he will ""ruin the country.""

""Donald Trump, he is a businessman, yes. But he's going to ruin the country. He's going to ruin it. And Kamala Harris, you know, she is more steady-handed. She doesn't think with an iron fist, and we don't need that. We're not trying to go to war with China. [We're trying to] actually progress in this life. That's the only thing that we do in this life is to share information and progress,"" Michael said.

GOP GAINS VOTER ADVANTAGE IN PENNSYLVANIA SWING COUNTY NEAR BIDEN'S BIRTHPLACE

Trump's and Harris' campaigns have respectively heaped loads of attention on the Keystone State this year, with both candidates repeatedly visiting the massive state, from its rural areas in the rolling hills to industrial cities in the coal and rust belts that run across the state.

Fox News Digital spoke to both a Trump campaign volunteer and a Harris campaign volunteer, who both work to register Lackawanna voters, door knock and motivate residents to cast a ballot.

Susanne Green is a Trump campaign volunteer and former Democratic voter who began supporting Trump and Republicans in the last decade.

BIDEN'S HOMETOWN SPEAKS OUT ON BIDENOMICS

""I grew up in a Democrat household. Here in the valley in Lackawanna County, we believed in 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you could do for your country,'"" Green told Fox Digital, quoting President Kennedy's powerful inaugural address in 1961. ""And it really does choke me up some because it's truthful.""

Green said that her politics have not changed, but that the Democratic Party has morphed into something she can no longer identify with.

""I haven't changed. The Democrat Party changed. I was a Democrat. I registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and I voted Democrat in every election until 2016, when I really saw that that wasn't the direction that our country needed. Our country really needs to really get back to patriotism and believing that our country is great,"" she said.

Green said that when she speaks to locals about the election to motivate them to vote, many Democratic voters will balk at the GOP's abortion platform. Green said she explains to such voters, most notably suburban women, that Republicans for Choice has long been a powerful vote in the party and that the GOP is not working to place a wholesale ban on abortion.

""I think we can all agree, or most of us can agree, that it should be legal and rare,"" Green said in a hat tip to the famous Bill Clinton formulation that abortions be ""safe, legal and rare,"" a sentiment that has since been purged from the party's platform in favor of more lax abortion access.

""That's how most women that I talk to in my experience over my whole lifetime have said that we wanted abortion to stay legal, but rare.""

Andrew Cutillo, a Harris campaign volunteer in Lackawanna County, spoke to Fox News Digital via a phone call this week and said that he has supported Harris since her campaign launch this summer and touted the VP as someone who can ""intuitively"" connect with Northeastern Pennsylvania voters based on her middle class upbringing.

""Kamala Harris is someone who, you know, intuitively understands what it's like to grow up or live in Northeast Pennsylvania and Scranton, Pennsylvania, as she grew up middle class. Her kind of focus has been on building a strong middle class,"" Cutillo said. ""Her focus is on supporting families and understanding what families and communities need, that they can live their lives, that they can not worry about paying grocery bills, not worry about paying all the expenses that come with just trying to raise your family.""

Cutillo added that when he's out door-knocking or speaking with traditionally Republican voters, including his own dad, people have pulled away from Trump because they are ""concerned for democracy,"" and view Harris as a potential president who would ""govern for the people who don't agree with her, too.""

He said despite the fevered political focus on Scranton and Pennsylvania at large this election cycle, Republican and Democratic neighbors in Northeastern Pennsylvania have and will remain friends no matter how the election shakes out despite any portrayal of ""divisiveness"" in the battleground state.

Voters in the area remarked that they have been inundated with campaign efforts, with West saying he's ignored some of the door knockers.

""I'm flooded with ads, flooded. They have knocked on the door. But I didn't answer the door because I saw what it was. But we are definitely bombarded with ads,"" West said.

Soentgerath said that he's seen ""a big push from both sides. And again, with all due respect to either side, the bottom line is, if you want change, get up, go to work and pull that lever on Nov. 5.""

While Michael remarked that while he hasn't seen ""too much out here yet,"" he noted he has seen more Trump ads than Harris ads.

""So that just means we need to work harder,"" Michael said.

Tony Monopoli is a Scranton native who has since moved to another key battleground state, Georgia, and told Fox News Digital that he is supporting Harris in the election. Monopoli was visiting Scranton with his brothers and spoke to Fox News Digital outside of the Lackawanna County Courthouse, where there is a veterans memorial.

""I think her plans to support small businesses by offering a $50,000 tax credit for small business owners is a big deal. I think her plan to offer $25,000 in first-time homebuyers' assistance is a big deal, given the cost of homes today. And also, the $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a child's life is a big deal,"" he explained of his support of Harris.

Fox Digital asked Monopoli if he's seen more or less campaigning efforts from either candidate in Pennsylvania vs. Georgia, where both candidates are also heavily campaigning for votes.

""I'd say it's about the same,"" he said. Remarking that he hasn't ""really seen any different"" in either area.

Pennsylvania will again serve as a key battleground state this election cycle as former President Donald Trump and President Biden are anticipated to face a rematch in a state that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016, and elected Biden in 2020 at a 1.17% margin.

For Soentgerath, he encouraged voters to do their own homework before casting their ballots, leaning on his concerns over the economy, he said voters should simply review their pay stubs from just a few years ago to help determine their vote.

CNN host Dana Bash told the co-hosts of ""The View"" on Monday that she and her co-moderator Jake Tapper prepped much more for how former President Trump would act during their debate in June than they did for President Biden.

""The View"" co-host Ana Navarro asked Bash if anything surprised her anymore after the president ended up dropping out, noting that Bash has been at the ""center"" of the election cycle because of her interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and viral clash with Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate.

""I still sort of can't believe that we are where we are for so many reasons. I mean, the debate, if you would have told me beforehand when we were prepping, and the prep is very intense, that we would have ended up without Joe Biden in the race, I would have told you you'd lost your mind. I never would have believed that. We were prepping much more on how Donald Trump was going to act and react, and sort of tried to game that out, than on the Joe Biden side of things,"" Bash responded.

Biden's halting, frail showing at the CNN debate led directly to his departure in July, following weeks of pressure from Democrats.

Trump and Harris faced off in early September for a debate moderated by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis.

Davis and Muir fact-checked Trump several times during the debate and failed to fact-check the vice president at all.

Davis admitted in a post-debate interview that her fact-checking of Trump was influenced by the CNN debate.

""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" Davis told the Los Angeles Times.

Latest polling shows former President Donald Trump closing in on Harris in the key battleground states of both Michigan and neighboring Wisconsin.

Michigan is once again a key battleground state this year, as Harris and Trump zigzag campaign events across the state, as well as in other key states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin.

The Axios article noted that if Trump secures votes from the Sunbelt States across the southern portion of the U.S., he would only need to win either Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to declare victory. While Harris' easiest path to victory is locking down Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Trump won Michigan in his 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by a 0.23% margin. President Biden won by 2.78% in the state in 2020 when he faced off against Trump.

Six third-party candidates will also appear on the Michigan ballot, including independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign last month and endorsed Trump. Though each polled under one percent, any of them could play spoiler if the margin between the two major party candidates tightens, according to David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center.

However, some polling experts, like director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, David Paleologos, say that Harris must maintain a strong enough lead in Michigan or risk political disaster.

""If the Kamala Harris margin shrinks to a 1-point lead, the entire state hinges on the fringes of the Michigan ballot,"" he told USA Today.

Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump, pleaded not guilty to new charges in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida on Monday.

Through his public defenders, the alleged would-be assassin pleaded not guilty to five counts, including the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate and assault on a federal officer.

Routh's attorneys also asked for a jury trial. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart accepted the plea and noted that the defense requested a jury trial.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT WROTE CHILLING LETTER MONTHS BEFORE GOLF COURSE PLOT

Reinhart had Routh and his public defenders stand at the lectern.

The defense team declined to have the indictment read in court and Routh replied, ""Yes, your honor,"" when Reinhart asked him if he understood the charges.

Routh was shackled and wore a tan prison jumpsuit. He seemed to motion with his handcuffed hands that he wanted something to write on, and appeared to notice the court sketch artist and nod at him.

These new charges are in addition to the federal gun charges he appeared in court for last Monday.

Routh had been previously charged federally with possessing a gun with a scratched-out number and with possessing a gun illegally as a felon. He was ordered by a federal judge last Monday to remain in custody.

At least a dozen staffers at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs improperly accessed the medical records of both vice presidential nominees, Republican Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, over the summer, according to a report.

Those employees are under criminal investigation for potentially violating federal health privacy laws, The Washington Post reported. The unauthorized views came from staffers within the Veterans Health Administration and were uncovered by Veterans Affairs investigators, who notified the Vance and Walz campaigns, sources familiar with the probe told the Post.

It's the first time veterans were both parties' vice presidential nominees since Democrat Al Gore and Republican Jack Kemp during the 1996 election.

Law enforcement officials told the Post that VA Inspector General Michael Missal's office shared evidence with federal prosecutors related to several health system employees, including a physician and a contractor who ""spent extended time"" viewing the medical files of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris' running mates.

FOX NEWS MEDIA WILL PRESENT SPECIAL LIVE PROGRAMMING OF VANCE-WALZ DEBATE

The potential motive for accessing the medical records is under investigation, and investigators are still trying to determine if Vance and Walz's information was shared as a result of the breaches, the Post reported.

""We reported to law enforcement allegations that VA personnel may have improperly accessed Veteran records,"" VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said in a statement to Fox News Digital, regarding the report. ""We take the privacy of the Veterans we serve very seriously and have strict policies in place to protect their records. Any attempt to improperly access Veteran records by VA personnel is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.""

Hayes referred Fox News Digital to the Department of Justice for further queries.

The VA employees under investigation, including the physician and contractor, accessed the medical records using their VA computers and did so mostly from their government offices, the Post reported. Some of the staffers in question reportedly told investigators they were simply curious to see the files of Vance and Walz given both candidates have defended their military records on the campaign trail.

JD VANCE ACCUSES TIM WALZ OF 'LYING' ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE: 'STOLEN VALOR GARBAGE'

Walz in particular faced criticism for ending his 24-year career in the Army National Guard to run for Congress months before his unit would deploy to Iraq.

Vance, who served four years in the U.S. Marines and deployed to Iraq for about six months in 2005, has accused Walz of being ""dishonest"" about having served in combat zones.

Law enforcement officials told the Post that the VA staffers under investigation did not access any disability compensation records, which have more security protocols than health information.

A source at VA shared with Fox News Digital an internal memo sent out Aug. 30, 2024, by VA Secretary Denis McDonough ""upholding our commitment to protect privacy.""

The message reminded VA staffers that veteran information ""should only be accessed when necessary to accomplish officially authorized and assigned duties as an employee, contractor, volunteer, or other personnel."" The secretary said ""viewing a Veteran's records out of curiosity or concern - or for any purpose that is not directly related to officially authorized and assigned duties - is strictly prohibited.""

The memo also warned VA employees that ""failure to comply with these requirements may result in disciplinary action, including removal, as well as referral to law enforcement for civil penalties and criminal prosecution."""

As the death toll and devastation from Hurricane Helene soars in the southeast, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will be briefed by officials on Monday, as the destructive storm is smack in the middle of the White House race with just over five weeks until Election Day.

Trump will make a stop in Valdosta, Georgia, to receive a briefing on the devastation, assist with relief distribution and ""deliver remarks to the press,"" according to his campaign.

Harris headed back to Washington, D.C., on Monday morning, cutting short a western campaign swing. The White House said the vice president would travel to Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters once she arrives in the nation's capital, where she will be briefed on the impact of the hurricane and the federal response to support rescue and recovery efforts.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON HELENE'S HAVOC

Over 100 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast. The storm sparked millions of power outages and billions of dollars in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

SCENES FROM THE STORM'S PATH OF DESTRUCTION

Among the hardest hit states were North Carolina and Georgia, two of the seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and are expected to determine the outcome of the 2024 showdown between Harris and Trump.

Trump at a Sunday rally in battleground Pennsylvania took aim at the administration and Harris over the storm, accusing the president of ""sleeping"" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.

Biden returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor federal relief efforts.

The White House noted that over 3,300 federal workers have been deployed to support storm response efforts in the impacted states, and at least 50,000 personnel from across the country and Canada are responding to the massive power outages in affected areas.

Biden told reporters the federal government is giving states ""everything we have"" to assist with their response to the storm.

Biden said he would tour the storm-damaged areas later this week as long as his presence on the ground would not hamper rescue and recovery efforts.

Trump, at his Sunday rally, attacked Harris for attending ""fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors"" in California this weekend. He argued that Harris ""ought to be down in the area"" where the storm caused destruction.

The White House said Harris spoke Sunday with the governors of Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina and that ""the Vice President intends to visit impacted communities as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.""

In a Saturday statement, Harris said that she and the president ""remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.""

The response by elected officials to natural disasters can vastly impact their political fortunes on the campaign trail.

Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The then-president was criticized for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island."
416,'Whoever gets elected': Vulnerable Dem Tester digs in heels on not endorsing Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whoever-gets-elected-vulnerable-dem-tester-digs-heels-not-endorsing-harris,2024-09-30T16:02:54Z,"Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance of the race and what issues matter most to voters as he fights to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., is continuing to defend his decision not to endorse in the 2024 presidential race ahead of his tough re-election, but the Democrat's opponent suggests his ""record"" signals support for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Tester recently revealed that he would not be making an endorsement in the presidential race in order to focus on his re-election, despite being a key player in Harris' recruitment to the Senate.

Tester served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) from 2015 to 2017, leading the efforts of the campaign arm to elect Democrats to the chamber when Harris first announced her senatorial aspirations. And after Harris launched her California Senate bid, the Los Angeles Times reported in January 2015 that, according to an adviser, Tester was one of the players who encouraged her to run.

Asked again about withholding an endorsement, Tester's response was that he would work with or hold accountable whichever presidential candidate gets elected.

KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONE

""Unfortunately, my opponent would rather talk about a national race that will be decided by the people of Montana. Whoever gets elected to the U.S. president, I can guarantee you one thing, just like all previous ones, I'll work with them when they're doing good things for Montana, and I'll hold them accountable when they're not,"" Tester told MTN News in an interview.

NEW YORKER SPENDS LARGE PART OF KAMALA HARRIS ENDORSEMENT REBUKING BIDEN: HE 'STOOD IN THE WAY'

Tester endorsed Harris when she was selected as President Biden's 2020 running mate. ""My friend @KamalaHarris is a proven fighter and an excellent pick for Vice President. As VP, I'm confident she will continue to fight for working families across this country. Looking forward to supporting her and @JoeBiden in November,"" Tester wrote in an August 2020 post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Montana Republican nominee and Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who endorsed former President Trump in the presidential race, suggested that Tester's voting record is his endorsement for Harris.

""Jon Tester votes with Kamala Harris 95% of the time. His voting record is his endorsement of the failed Harris agenda, and every time Montanans needed him to stop the insanity in Washington, he was the deciding vote to further her progressive liberal agenda,"" a spokesperson for Sheehy for Montana told Fox News Digital.

""That same agenda has made costs for things like groceries and gas skyrocket, it's brought us record high inflation, and has given us a wide-open southern border that has brought crime and deadly drugs into our communities. Tester also voted to allow benefits for illegal immigrants paid for by the American taxpayer - a hallmark of the Harris agenda. We can't afford to re-elect Jon Tester because his voting record in Washington proves he's changed and is and will continue to support the radical America Last agenda.""

Tester is running for re-election in red state Montana, a race that could likely determine which party controls the chamber, and recent polling and political forecaster predictions suggest that Sheehy is currently leading the race just weeks before Election Day.

A recent AARP survey found that Sheehy is leading by six percentage points in a head-to-head matchup against Tester. His lead against Tester widened to eight points in a multi-candidate field that included the state's Green Party and Libertarian candidates.

MSNBC guest Maria Hinojosa, founder of Futoro Media, claimed on Sunday that Latino voters want to be White while discussing the voting bloc's shift towards the Republican Party over the last few years.

""She has a 14-point lead but it has been shrinking after each consecutive presidential election from 2016. Why is that? Why is the Democratic share of the Latino vote shrinking?"" MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart asked of Vice President Kamala Harris' lead among Latino voters.

A NBC-Telemundo poll released Sunday found that while Harris was leading Trump among Latino voters, the Democratic advantage has sunk to its lowest level in the past four election cycles.

""And what I said to you when we asked a question was, Latinos want to be White. They want to be with the cool kids,"" she said, adding that Latinos she's spoken with say Trump is a good businessman.

""No he's not, he had bankruptcies,"" she added. ""But they don't want to be identified with all of those other immigrants that Donald Trump speaks so badly of, including me as a Mexican immigrant.""

Hinojosa went on to say that those voters could cost Harris the election.

""But those numbers? They could cost Kamala Harris the election. Everything that I've been saying that Latinos could push her over the top, these are the numbers that could also take her down,"" she said.

According to the NBC poll, Harris had 54% support among Latino voters, compared to Trump, who had 40%.

Another 6% said they weren't sure or would not vote, according to the poll.

CNN's Harry Enten recently warned that Harris was struggling among voters of color.

""Hispanic voters, four years ago, Joe Biden won that vote 66% in the Sun Belt,"" he said. ""Look at where we are now, Kamala Harris at just 52%, so Kamala Harris struggling among Hispanic voters. Donald Trump doing considerably better than he did four years ago.""

Enten said on Tuesday that Harris was getting 82% of the Black vote, but that it was down from President Biden, who had gotten 92%.

""We will choose a secretary-general for the party at the earliest opportunity... and we will fill the leadership and positions on a permanent basis,"" Qassem said while speaking in front of a trio of wooden panels from an undisclosed location.

He added that Hezbollah is ready to fight back against any Israeli ground operation in Lebanon.

""We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement,"" Qassem reportedly said.

Elissa Slotkin, claiming that Vice President Harris is 'underwater' in Michigan.

The New York Times continued its 64-year streak of supporting Democrats for president over Republicans by endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris this week.

""Kamala Harris is the only choice,"" The New York Times editorial board wrote in an article from Monday headlined, ""The only patriotic choice for president.""

This is the 17th straight election that the outlet has supported a Democratic candidate for president over a Republican, with the outlet's continuous blue streak beginning in 1960 with John F. Kennedy. The last time Republican it backed was President Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he successfully ran for re-election in 1956.

NEW YORK TIMES REPORT RIPS VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS' 'FRIENDLY' MSNBC INTERVIEW: 'ROUNDABOUT RESPONSES'

""This unequivocal, dispiriting truth -- Donald Trump is not fit to be president -- should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election,"" the editorial board wrote.

""For this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president,"" The Times wrote.

Harris, The Times continued, is not a ""perfect candidate"" but is a ""more than necessary alternative"" to Trump on issues like the economy, immigration, and America's international alliances.

The Times acknowledged that some voters are concerned over Harris' press avoidance strategy.

""Many voters have said they want more details about the vice president's plans, as well as more unscripted encounters in which she explains her vision and policies,"" The Times wrote. ""They are right to ask. Given the stakes of this election, Ms. Harris may think that she is running a campaign designed to minimize the risks of an unforced error -- answering journalists' questions and offering greater policy detail could court controversy, after all -- under the belief that being the only viable alternative to Mr. Trump may be enough to bring her to victory.""

NEW YORK TIMES REPORT ADMITS 'INTERVIEWS ARE A WEAKNESS' FOR KAMALA HARRIS

""That strategy may ultimately prove winning, but it's a disservice to the American people and to her own record,"" the editorial board continued. ""And leaving the public with a sense that she is being shielded from tough questions, as Mr. Biden has been, could backfire by undermining her core argument that a capable new generation stands ready to take the reins of power.""

The endorsement doesn't come as a surprise. In 2016, the Times' liberal board declared Trump to be the worst major party nominee in the nation's history and has continued to speak out vehemently against him since then. It endorsed Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden against him in the past two elections.

During its lengthy streak of supporting Democrats, the Times has endorsed such candidates as George McGovern in 1972, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988, who all were defeated in electoral landslides.

The Trump campaign was unconcerned.

""An endorsement from the New York Times is about as useful as a moldy old dishrag that hasn't been cleaned in years,"" Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""They had to apologize in 2016 for misleading their readers and completely misreading President Trump's historic victory, but it seems like they still haven't learned their lesson. Kamala Harris is endorsed by the Fake News because she is fake, a phony, and unfit for office.""

The nation just heard competing economic speeches from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, both with a focus on manufacturing. This is not a surprise as we believe that whoever has the better plan for the rebuilding and revitalizing of industrial America will win the election.

Of course, we are big supporters of the Harris-Walz campaign, but we write this as two clear-eyed moderates and capitalists who know the stakes in this election. And, we believe Harris has a significantly more persuasive and credible argument to make to the American people.

Why is that? Because the Biden-Harris administration's bold, and mostly bipartisan legislative victories, have stemmed the tide of 40 years of deindustrialization. Their administration has added nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs and is rebuilding America's rotting infrastructure with over $1 trillion of investment in the modernization of our roads, bridges, broadband and ports. There is no better investment of America's hard-earned tax dollars than public infrastructure.

FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS 'STARK CHOICE'

We both publicly applauded and supported the Biden-Harris bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as well as the CHIPS and Science Act, and view them as two of the most consequential legislative accomplishments in our lifetime.

These acts have overwhelming broad-based support from unions, small and large business, Republicans, Democrats and independents (and co-author and former Rep. Ryan voted for both). And this is quite a contrast to Trump's failures. He talked about infrastructure week continually throughout his term but never even put up a bill (and still talking about it now).

Not only does a rebuilding America plan resonate strongly with the American people, but the American Society of Civil Engineers also gave America's infrastructure a grade of D+ in 2017 when Trump took office and a C- when he left, which was almost zero progress.

Currently, U.S. infrastructure investment spending is under 5% of GDP annually, which is at the low end versus other countries; with over a $1 trillion funding shortfall over the next five years with an ever-increasing deficit as we maintain, upgrade or modernize structures and systems. Infrastructure investment remains one of the best ways to bolster our economy!

A ""Modeling the Impact of Public Infrastructure"" study in 2023 found two major impacts on the GDP: short term (during construction phase) and long term (both directly and indirectly which can translate into consumer spending). These investments also have a huge multiplier effect because the new, high-paying jobs pay, on average, over 20% higher than the median income nationally.

So, while Trump has been doing the talking, Biden-Harris has been doing the walking. Since August 2024, approximately $564 billion has been deployed for 56,000 projects in 4,500 communities in all 50 states and territories. The initial investment is being deployed. Now it is time to double down.

The yin to infrastructure's yang is manufacturing. In the first quarter of 2024, the White House published the Future Made in America fact sheet showing incredible momentum:

During the Trump years, manufacturing got torched with a net loss of 75,000 manufacturing jobs versus hundreds of thousands of gains under Biden-Harris. It is worth noting that the Alliance for American Manufacturing (a non-partisan nonprofit) attributes Trump's decline mainly to erratic trade policies that he enacted, not the pandemic.

The king of chaos' policies were anti-business and anti-worker. And if you listened to the former president's speech in Georgia, you will understand why. He randomly pitched onerous across-the-board tariffs and old world, protectionist-style ideas targeted primarily at an iconic American company, John Deere.

This led to the Wall Street Journal editorial board writing that, ""A Deere in Trump's Political Headlights"" stating that ""Mr. Trump thinks he can bully Deere as he did Carrier ... Meantime, his threats help Democrats argue that Ms. Harris would be friendlier to business.""

Harris is friendlier to business. In her recent speech in Pittsburgh, she said one of her pillars for her ""opportunity economy"" was ""leading the world in the industries of the future."" Her goal is to out compete China with smart, pragmatic public investments and policies, all while working with business to strengthen our economic, national and energy security.

These kinds of capital-intensive projects in artificial intelligence and clean energy take time to build, which is why we are seeing a construction employment boom. Manufacturing jobs are coming back, and because of these policies huge growth is on the way. Look at what's already happening:

These successes are even winning over Republicans. Recently, a large group of House Republicans wrote a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson asking him not to repeal the IRA clean energy tax credits because they were creating jobs and factories in their districts. The administration needs to brag about this bipartisan support for their plan and build on it.

During the Trump years, manufacturing got torched with a net loss of 75,000 manufacturing jobs versus hundreds of thousands of gains under Biden-Harris.

As we look to the future, our recommendation to the next president would be to focus on a balanced, ""all of the above"" energy policy that includes natural gas, nuclear and renewables to help power this resurgence of manufacturing. And the creation of a National Infrastructure Financing Authority (NIFA) to promote continued public-private partnerships in transportation, energy, climate, AI and more.

Kamala Harris has the vision and experience to build on the initiatives that are already revitalizing industrial America. The choice is clear in this election. One candidate has a fresh vision for our future. And one has plans that are way more dangerous to our economic well-being than our failing infrastructure."

Former President Trump has narrowed Vice President Kamala Harris' small lead in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, new polling by the New York Times/Siena College finds.

Among likely voters in Michigan, Harris received 48% support, while Trump garnered 47%, locking the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an essential tie well within the poll's margin of error. Harris polled at 49% among likely voters in Wisconsin, while Trump received 47% support in the same state where polls usually overestimate backing for Democrats, according to the Times.

The Times pointed to the economy, which remains the most important issue for voters, as Trump's strength on economic issues helps him edge away at Harris' slim lead in the two northern battlegrounds.

The new poll contrasts with August's New York Times/Siena College survey, which has Harris leading Trump by four percentage points, 50% to 46% among likely voters, in the battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as well. That poll was the first conducted as the race reshaped with Harris becoming the presidential nominee following President Biden's July departure from the contest.

Now with less than 40 days until the Nov. 5 election, New York Times/Siena College polling places Harris ahead of Trump by nine percentage points in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, whose sole electoral vote could be critical in the Electoral College. The Times says Harris could receive exactly 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House if she picks up that district - given the vice president also wins Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Trump is victorious in the Sun Belt battleground states.

Though Ohio does not fall into the battleground state category for the presidential race, it's home to one of the nation's most competitive Senate contests between Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown and GOP challenger Bernie Moreno. New York Times/Siena College polling has Trump six points ahead of Harris in Ohio, whereas Brown leads Moreno by four points.

Yes, the conventional wisdom is that vice presidential candidates rarely matter. But vice presidential debates have both produced memorable gaffes and moments - and sometimes actually changed the direction of the campaign. I'd argue that three of the six presidential elections in recent elections were transformed by the V.P. debate, and even if you go back to the ancient history of the last 50 years, they turned out to be important, even if not decisive. Let's take a look at six memorable examples.

1976: Mondale vs. Dole on 'Democrat Wars': The first vice presidential debate of the modern era took place in 1976. Coming out of the divided Republican convention, President Gerald Ford had picked Kansas Senator Bob Dole, as a way of uniting the Conservative and Moderate wings of the GOP, following their divided convention. Dole faced Jimmy Carter's vice presidential candidate, Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota.

In that debate, Mondale responded to a line that Dole had been using in all his speeches - that the Democrats were the party in power when all the wars of the century had started - notably both World Wars, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In an obviously scripted moment, Mondale responded, ""Senator Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight, by implying, and stating, that World War II and the Korean War were Democratic wars. Does he really mean to suggest to the American people that there was a partisan difference over our involvement in the war to fight Nazi Germany?""

EXPERTS PREVIEW VANCE-WALZ DEBATE, SAY USUALLY 'FORGETTABLE' VP BOUT 'MIGHT BE DIFFERENT' THIS TIME

Unfair, absolutely - within the bounds of typical pollical sparring, of course. In a close election decided by less than 20,000 votes, it might have been decisive - and it certainly damaged Dole, preventing him from mounting an effective campaign for the nomination in 1980, even though he was able to recover and become the GOP standard-bearer in 1996.

1984: Bush vs. Ferraro -- Bush Recovers for Reagan: President Ronald Reagan - then the oldest president in history - clearly performed poorly against former Vice President Walter Mondale during their first debate. On several occasions he seemed to have a ""Senior Moment"" - in one case taking almost 17 seconds to find a word. People started talking about whether he was exhibiting ""cognitive decline."" Most folks knew Reagan was favored for reelection - especially after Mondale ""promised"" to raise taxes. In a clear move of desperation Mondale had named a little-known New York Congresswoman, Geraldine Ferraro, as his running mate.

A week after that dismal performance in the first presidential debate, Vice President George H.W. Bush faced off against Ferraro. While there were no real ""viral moments"" in the debate - the folks who were looking at the internal daily tracking polls of the campaigns say that that night marked a turning point - where Reagan had been slowly bleeding voter support, it immediately stopped and turned around - and barely a month later, Reagan wound up winning the largest popular vote margin in history.

1988: ""You're No Jack Kennedy."" Vice President George H. W. Bush, nominated to succeed Ronald Reagan (then the oldest man to serve as president), chose Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, in part, to represent a ""new generation."" Quayle was 42 but he looked even younger. Shortly after the announcement that Quayle had been chosen as V.P. nominee a firestorm ignited over whether his service in the National Guard had been designed to avoid military service in Vietnam. While Quayle survived an attempt to drop him from the ticket, he was dogged by questions about his experience. He would point out, frequently, that he had served in the House and Senate as long as John F. Kennedy, when he was elected president.

JD VANCE DEBATE PREP STRATEGY INCLUDES TAPPING PROMINENT LAWMAKER TO PLAY WALZ

The Democratic V.P. nominee, Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen, came prepared for the debate. When Quayle repeated his widely-expected - and true - statement ""I've got just as much experience as John Kennedy,"" the tall Bentsen, with his slow, deliberate Texas drawl, said, ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy.""

In televised debated, practiced off-the-cuff ad lib barbs are the most effective ad lib barbs. Especially when the Democratic half of the audience erupts in cheers, and makes the target look like the punch landed.

While Bush-Quayle went on to win - and one could argue that the debate didn't really matter, Quayle's political future - even though he did serve as vice president - was sorely damaged.

More recently, the V.P. debates were decisive in three of the six presidential elections since 2000.

2000: Cheney vs. Lieberman-the Policy wonk wins: George W. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate in large part to compensate for his lack of experience in foreign affairs, and his limited experience in office (he'd served in elective office for half as long as even Dan Quayle. Soon after being named, it seemed Cheney was going to be a drag on the ticket. He had to change his residence from Texas back to Wyoming. It turned out he had barely voted in any election since leaving public office.

NOT MINNESOTA NICE: GOP CONGRESSMAN PLAYING TIM WALZ IN DEBATE PREP WITH JD VANCE ARGUES HE'S AN 'EMPTY SUIT'

He walked into the debate with the Gallup poll showing Bush roughly 10 points behind Al Gore. The two candidates (Lieberman and Cheney) were seated and engaged in an apparently friendly debate. Cheney parried attacks on his record and how many millions he'd made in private life but demonstrated a facile ability to discuss all elements of public policy. The instant polls were clear. Forty-two percent of viewers thought Cheney won while only 24% thought Lieberman had. Soon afterwards, the Gallup poll found the race had turned upside down. Bush was now ahead of Gore by 8 points. One doesn't need to think that all of that shift was due to the debate, to believe it made a difference.

2012: The Interrupter Beats the Policy Wonk- VP Joe Biden vs. Paul Ryan: The VP debate came roughly a week after the first presidential debate between Incumbent Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney. Romney had used that debate to make a clear argument against Obama's first term. Romney was well-rehearsed and made cogent arguments, but worse for Obama, the Democratic nominee appeared totally unprepared.

Obama supporters were apoplectic at how badly he'd done. The polls told the same story. Obama went from a 4-point advantage, walking into the debate, to a 1 point deficit against Romney.

A week later came the V.P. debate. Biden deployed his more youthful ability to talk (it was 12 years ago). You can argue that all he did was scream over the sedate Ryan. But you can't argue with the results. Democratic viewers were energized - and the polls showed it - moving the Obama-Biden ticket to a tie.

2016: Mike Pence Stays on Message...Tim Kaine Interrupts: The debate between the two men occurred a week after the first Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton debate, where Trump had been argumentative and seemingly ill-prepared - and after numerous news cycles focused on Trump getting into a fight with a former Miss Universe whom Trump had forced to lose weight. At the same time he was continuing his fight with a Gold Star family and a judge of Mexican heritage. Pence had a clear objective: focus on the probable policies of a Trump administration - rather than specific statements Trump had made --- and make Trump acceptable to both evangelical voters as well as more moderate Republicans who had opposed Trump's nomination.

Pence proved himself to be the eloquent former radio talk show host who had built a career out of conservative positions. His opponent, Sen. Tim Kaine tried to interrupt him over 70 times and appeared ill-at ease. By contrast a focus group watching the debate found ""Pence looked the most presidential. He was calm, reassuring - I would want him in a crisis, not the other guy.""

While the debate didn't arrest Trump's fall in the polls, it presented the Trump-Pence ticket as a less risky choice. And that is how, precisely a month later, they were able to get voters who disliked both Clinton and Trump to vote for Trump - and help him win the election.

In the other three elections this century, the V.P. debate mattered very little (2004, 2008, and 2020).

Tuesday night, Republican V.P. nominee JD Vance will debate against Democratic nominee, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Vance made his name writing about his Appalachian heritage, being raised by a hard-charging, gun-owning grandmother (Mamaw), and talking about the part of America that had been forgotten by globalization and the ""neoliberal"" policies. His opponent, Walz, also hails from more rural and small-town Midwest - and made his name winning in a Republican Congressional district and going on to being elected - and pursuing progressive policies -- as Minnesota Governor.

While they are similar in background - and both nominations are targeted at helping their ticket carry the industrial swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin--their campaign personas are very different.

Vance is an articulate Yale Law School graduate - who has done well in most interviews, but who struggled to maintain personal favorability in most polling.

Walz does well off-the-cuff, and has created many viral moments, especially when he called Trump and Vance ""weird."" At the same time, it's less clear how well he can talk about specific policies - and do well on a specific argument about different approaches to governance.

The big question on Tuesday night will be what is the public looking for? Will they opt for a 2016-Pence like figure who appears capable of translating Trump's Make America Great Again movement into a set of achievable policies? Or do they want someone more in the mold of 2012 Joe Biden, who made his Republican opponent look like a policy wonk who didn't have sufficient energy?

Just remember: JD Vance may look like a deliberate Yale-educated lawyer, but he knows how to wield the Appalachian aggression of his late Mawma. And, Tim Walz may personify the former assistant high school football coach, what folks in the upper Midwest refer to as ""Minnesota Nice"" - by which they mean the ability to knife their opponent, albeit politely."

424,Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff 'reshaped the perception of masculinity': MSNBC host,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff-reshaped-perception-masculinity-msnbc-host,2024-09-30T10:39:10Z,"MSNBC host Jen Psaki asked Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff about redefining the view of masculinity by openly supporting his wife Vice President Kamala Harris.

Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff has ""reshaped the perception of masculinity"" with his support for Vice President Kamala Harris, MSNBC host Jen Psaki suggested Sunday.

""There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,"" Psaki remarked with a slight laugh. ""I'm not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that's part of the role you might play as First Gentleman?""

""It's funny. I've started to think a lot about this. I've always been like this. My dad's always been like this. To me, it's the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other's back,"" Emhoff said.

He added, ""I've said many times when we lift up women, we support women whether it's pay equity, childcare, family leave, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That's not the American way.""

MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: TRUMP APPEALS TO MEN WITH 'RETRO, MACHO' VIEWS, WHILE EMHOFF EMBODIES 'SUPPORTIVE' MEN

Psaki continued, ""There is a pop-culture phrase, 'wife guy,' which you've kind of been known as. Are you familiar with this?""

""I have heard about it,"" Emhoff said.

""A 'wife guy,' a 'proud wife guy.' How do you feel about it?"" she asked.

Emhoff joked, ""If I do something annoying to Kamala, and she gets upset, I'll just show her that article.""

Various media outlets and commentators have painted Emhoff and Harris' running mate Gov. Tim Walz to be different examples of masculinity to combat former President Trump's hold on the male vote. A Washington Post columnist went as far as to refer to Emhoff as a ""progressive sex symbol.""

""Move over, Ryan Gosling. The modern female fantasy is embodied by the man who might soon become our first First Gentleman,"" Catherine Rampell wrote.

CNN's Dana Bash suggested during the DNC that Emhoff and Walz appealed to voters who were not as masculine as Republican candidates.

""But they are doing so in trying to put forward male figures, Tim Walz being one of them, Doug Emhoff last night, who can speak to men out there who might not be the sort of testosterone-laden, y'know, gun-toting kind of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and the kind of players that came out at the RNC or might want to listen to that,"" she said.

""But also, in addition, understand that it's okay in 2024 to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman, and that is something they are really trying to work on with male voters beyond the base,"" she added."
425,Liberal author urges Biden to 'dissolve' Supreme Court before leaving office: 'It's Trump's harem',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-author-urges-biden-dissolve-supreme-court-before-leaving-office-its-trumps-harem,2024-09-30T10:06:10Z,"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch responds to President Biden's proposed radical changes for the U.S. Supreme Court during an appearance on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Liberal author Fran Lebowitz called on President Biden to ""dissolve"" the Supreme Court during a discussion with ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher.

In an interview Saturday, Lebowitz, 73, railed against the high court, calling it ""Trump's harem"" while blasting the presidential immunity ruling in the case involving the former president.

""It's so disgraceful, this court, that it shouldn't even be allowed to be called the Supreme Court,"" she said. ""It isn't. It's an insult to Motown to call it the Supreme Court. It's not even a court...basically, it's a harem. It's Trump's harem.

DEMOCRAT FLOATS THEORY BIDEN COULD DISPATCH MILITARY TO 'TAKE OUT' CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES UNDER IMMUNITY RULING

""When they passed that law, that ruling, where they said 'you're not the president, you're the king,' which is what that ruling is, you can do whatever you want, you can never be held responsible, I thought, 'You know, Biden is still the president. No one seems to notice,'"" she said. ""But I think Biden should dissolve the Supreme Court.""

Maher pushed back, ""dissolve the Supreme Court? Come on.""

""I'm the president, I'm the king now, like you said, and go home,'"" Lebowitz replied.

""Okay. Good to see you're centrist,"" Maher retorted sarcastically before changing the topic.

The Supreme Court issued a pivotal ruling in the presidential immunity case against former President Trump in July, declaring that a former president has substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts committed while in office, but not for unofficial acts. The move by the conservative-dominated court - including three justices nominated by Trump - means that the trial judge in the lower court case against Trump will now have to hold hearings on whether the charges against Trump were based on official acts by the then-president or unofficial ones.

Trump celebrated the ruling as ""brilliantly written and wise"" at the time, calling it a ""big win for our Constitution and for democracy.""

MAHER RIPS RAPPER'S PROFANITY LACED TIRADE AGAINST USA: 'SURE IT WAS A BIG HIT WITH THE QUEERS FOR GAZA CROWD'

President Biden labeled it a ""dangerous precedent"" while calling for new reforms to the Supreme Court, including term limits and a new code of conduct, and to draft a new constitutional amendment that limits presidential immunity.

Lebowitz, an author and speaker best known for her appearances on ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" has a history of making extreme statements against Trump.

In 2019, she suggested on ""Real Time"" that impeachment wasn't enough to discipline Trump.

""Certainly, he deserves to be impeached. I mean, impeachment is just the beginning of what he deserves. Not even scratching the surface of what he deserves,"" Lebowitz said. ""Whenever I think about this and what he really deserves, I think, 'We should turn him over to the Saudis, you know, his buddies. The same Saudis who got rid of that reporter, you know. Maybe they can do the same for him.'""

Her remark was in reference to the 2018 murder of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi, who is believed to have been tortured and dismembered with a bone saw, purportedly under the orders of the Saudi government.

She later apologized for the comments after facing widespread backlash.

""I saw your face when I said it. I didn't even realize that I said it. I had twelve cups of coffee,"" Lebowitz told Maher. ""I regret saying it.""

""You know, everyone's too, too, too, too ... "" Maher told the panel. ""I mean, it's a live show. You really don't want to see the president dismembered by the Saudis. I don't like Donald Trump either. ... but no matter who the president is, we don't want physical harm,"" Maher said at the time."
426,"Early voting begins in Nebraska and Washington, DC",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/early-voting-begins-nebraska-washington-dc,2024-09-30T09:18:26Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Nebraska and Washington, D.C., began early voting on Monday. Here is the information you need to register and vote in both.

Nebraska is red territory. Former President Trump won the state by 19 points in the last presidential election and 25 points in 2016.

But the state has long allocated its electoral votes differently than most other states, and that could give Harris an opportunity.

The scenario goes like this: Vice President Harris wins Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and the less competitive states that President Biden won in 2020 (i.e. excluding Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina).

That gives her 269 electoral votes, resulting in a tie that would, in the end, very likely hand Trump the election.

To win with the majority of the electoral college, either Harris or Trump needs 270 votes.

Nebraska's 2nd district would provide that one extra vote.

(Maine and Nebraska are the only states that award electoral college votes both to the winner of the statewide vote, and the winner of the same vote but separated by congressional district.)

The district has voted for two Democrats and two Republicans in the last four elections:

Omaha and its suburbs make up a significant part of the district's population, and the city has a disproportionately high percentage of people with a college education. That gives Harris the edge. Nebraska's 2nd district is ranked Lean D on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Nebraska's 2nd district is also, of course, home to a U.S. House race. Center-right Republican Rep. Don Bacon has held the seat since 2017, but as last week's Power Rankings revealed, he is locked in a close battle with second-time rival and Democratic State Sen. Tony Vargas. The district is ranked a Toss Up.

Finally, Nebraskans will also vote in two U.S. Senate races this year. The one to watch is the regular election between incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer, who has won the seat twice beginning in 2012, and independent challenger Dan Osborn, a Navy veteran and local union leader. Fischer has a clear advantage, but the race moved to Likely R last week.

This is a guide to registration and early voting. For comprehensive and up-to-date information on voter eligibility, processes and deadlines, please go to Vote.gov and the election website for Nebraska.

Nebraska began absentee voting on Monday. Applicants do not need to provide an excuse to receive a ballot. The state must receive a ballot application by Oct. 25, and that ballot must be delivered to state officials by Nov. 5.

Nebraska will begin early in-person voting on Oct. 7, and it will run through Nov. 4.

Nebraska residents can register to vote online or by mail through Oct. 18. They can register in-person through Oct. 25.

This is a guide to registration and early voting. For comprehensive and up-to-date information on voter eligibility, processes and deadlines, please go to Vote.gov and the election website for Washington, D.C.

Washington, D.C., began absentee voting on Monday. Registered voters do not need to apply for a ballot, as the district will begin sending ballots to all active registered voters this week. Ballots can be returned by mail or in person through election day.

Washington, D.C. will begin early in-person voting on Oct. 28, and it will run through Nov. 3.

Residents of the nation's capital can register to vote online or by mail through Oct. 15. They can also register in-person during early voting (Oct. 28-Nov. 3) and on election day."

CBS News is the latest network under the spotlight as it prepares to host the vice-presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The debate on Tuesday, being led by outgoing ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan, will face intense scrutiny, particularly after the fury sparked by ABC News for its partisan handling of the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The network's past coverage suggests Vance, like Trump, may enter a one-against-three political showdown.

CBS' '60 MINUTES' ACCUSED OF EDITING EXCHANGE BETWEEN DESANTIS, REPORTER PUSHING 'PAY FOR PLAY' NARRATIVE

Perhaps the greatest example of CBS News' liberal bias was in 2020 when Trump famously sparred with ""60 Minutes"" veteran Lesley Stahl over the Hunter Biden laptop scandal just days before the election.

Trump insisted at the time that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal.""

""He's not,"" Stahl gleefully replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually went on and verified the infamous laptop in 2022.

CBS TARRED AND FEATHERED FOR ADMITTING EXISTENCE OF HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP TWO YEARS AFTER NEW YORK POST REPORT

When Hunter Biden initially accepted the plea deal with his father's DOJ, Brennan suggested that Republicans ""move on"" from the growing controversy tainting the president, who at the time was seeking reelection.

""The deal has infuriated many congressional Republicans who were holding their own hearings. And I wonder after this plea happens if you would advise your party to move on?"" Brennan asked then-2024 presidential candidate Chris Christie.

Christie flatly responded ""No, I wouldn't.""

""The conduct here by the U.S. Attorney in Delaware and by the Justice Department, just can't be justified,"" Christie told Brennan. ""It does not take five years to investigate two misdemeanor tax counts and to dismiss a gun charge, and we need to know what they were investigating, and why these are the charges they concluded to. This is not just any person. This is the son of the President of the United States. When justice needs to be equal, it needs to be equal, and it doesn't appear to me that this is the way to do it.""

NORAH O'DONNELL EXITING 'CBS EVENING NEWS'

Brennan attempted to push back by pointing out that the prosecutor, U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware David Weiss. was a Trump appointee, but Christie insisted it ""doesn't matter,"" adding it was ""incompetent and inexplicable.""

That plea deal was ultimately tossed by the judge overseeing the case after it crumbled under scrutiny.

For the past several years, among the biggest stars at CBS News has been Gayle King, co-host of ""CBS Mornings.""

However, before joining the network, she donated a combined $9,000 to Harris' 2010 bid for California attorney general, according to Open Secrets.

King's past support for the VP hasn't stopped CBS News from not only allowing her to repeatedly interview Harris over the 2024 presidential campaign despite the apparent conflict of interest, but also singing Harris' praises.

""When I hear people say I will vote for Kamala Harris because she is a Black woman, she is so much more than that. She's so uniquely qualified to be president of this country,"" King said during CBS News' coverage of the DNC convention last month.

King did not disclose to viewers that she was a Harris donor.

In September 2023, CBS News was caught editing an unflattering exchange Harris had with Brennan during an interview.

In a preview clip that aired on ""CBS Mornings,"" Brennan was seen asking Harris about age being a factor in the upcoming election with her then-elderly running mate.

""You're 58 now. If you win the second term, as you and the president are running to do, he would be 86 at the end of it,"" Brennan said before the camera quickly cut to Harris' facial expression.

Brennan immediately continued, ""The Wall Street Journal had a poll showing two-thirds of Democrats say Joe Biden is too old to run again. Are you prepared to be commander in chief?""

""Yes I am, if necessary,"" Harris responded before defending Biden's fitness as president.

However, what aired on ""CBS Mornings"" was actually not how the conversation unfolded between Brennan and Harris, as the network acknowledged later in the day.

CBS ADMITS TO 'INCORRECTLY' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW CLIP, OMITTING GOP ATTACKS ON HER

Initially left on the cutting room floor was Brennan grilling Harris about the criticism she received from GOP presidential candidates.

""You're 58 now. If you win the second term, as you and the president are running to do, he would be 86 at the end of it. And we are seeing Republican candidates hone in on you, in particular, as the next up for that job,"" Brennan told the vice president. ""Nikki Haley says 'a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Harris.' Chris Christie, 'I want to be clear that I pray every night for Joe Biden's good health, not only because he's our president, but because of who our vice president is.' Ron DeSantis, 'Harris is Biden's impeachment insurance. People know if she were president, batter the doors. As bad as Biden did, it would get worse.' How do you respond to all of that?""

While the incorrect version of their exchange was seen by the millions of ""CBS Morning"" viewers, the corrected version was featured on CBS' little-watched streaming network and on social media. The interview later aired in full on ""Face the Nation.""

""A previous version of this clip was edited incorrectly,"" CBS News acknowledged on both platforms.

Both Brennan and O'Donnell appeared to chastise Trump following July's assassination attempt, suggesting his own rhetoric led to the fatal shooting in Butler, PA.

""He is recovering from these injuries now, this was a traumatic event, no doubt, for him,"" Brennan said during CBS News' breaking news coverage after Trump released a statement on social media. ""But I did notice there was no call for lowering the temperature, condemning all political violence, and really trying to signal to his supporters as well not to retaliate or have any kind of escalation here.""

Brennan later clarified that the statement was ""not meant as a critique, but rather an observation.""

However, O'Donnell struck a similar tone during an interview with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the RNC Convention the following week, as the two of them discussed how ""hot"" political rhetoric has gotten in recent years.

""Does Donald Trump bear some responsibility for that? Does he need to change his rhetoric?"" O'Donnell asked.

""This is a man that came less than an inch from losing his life and the question is you're worried about him?"" an astonished McCarthy reacted.

Last month, Brennan ran cover for Harris after Trump began accusing his Democratic rival of being a ""communist.""

""And a new line of false attack on Vice President Harris,"" Brennan told viewers in her ""Face the Nation"" intro before playing a clip of Trump telling rallygoers ""Kamala went full communist.""

In what might be a preview of what to expect at Tuesday's debate, Brennan got testy with Vance during his late June appearance on ""Face the Nation."" He was yet to be tapped as Trump's running mate.

Vance took a swipe at the media for not fact-checking Biden following the June 27 presidential debate, something Brennan took immediate offense to.

""You know, I lost track, sir,"" Brennan interjected. ""I've been told the media is on every single side of this and everything's our fault, but let's get back to the candidate you're here to talk about.""

Fox News Digital reached out to CBS News for comment, but did not immediately hear back."
428,"Most Americans are hesitant to share their honest opinions on key political issues, Social Pressure Index says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/most-americans-hesitant-share-honest-opinions-key-political-issues-social-pressure-index,2024-09-30T09:11:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A shocking new study shows a dramatic difference between what Americans publicly claim they believe on key issues compared to how they really feel when discussing polarizing political topics in private.

Populace, a Massachusetts-based think tank focused on understanding people's private views and values rather than what they'll say publicly, recently unveiled its first Social Pressure Index. The findings indicate that Americans don't trust the government or the media and are hesitant to publicly admit their true feelings on a variety of key issues. This could be critical with the presidential election looming, as many Americans feel pressure to support a specific candidate or issues publicly but wouldn't necessarily vote that way in private.

""I think it's going to be really fascinating to see what happens on election night. I will also say I think people are going to be surprised not just about presidential elections, but about some of the ballot initiatives and things like that are going to play out very different than public opinion might suggest,"" Populace CEO Todd Rose told Fox News Digital.

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Rose said polling ""isn't bad,"" but it's flawed because Americans aren't honest about their personal views.

""Polling assumes you're telling the truth, and we're not,"" Rose said, noting that he began private opinion research after former President Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton stunned pollsters.

A staggering 61% of Americans admitted to self-silencing their true beliefs, and 58% of Americans believe most people cannot share their honest opinions about sensitive topics even if they believe they are correct, according to the study.

Rose said the Social Pressure Index was the largest private opinion study ever conducted, and it both acknowledges societal pressures to have the ""right"" opinion and also where that pressure impacts what Americans are willing to say out loud. He said the study spanned 64 of the most controversial issues in American society and included a massive sample of over 19,000 respondents and upwards of two dozen demographic groups.

""Across these 64 issues, every single demographic group in the country, every one of them, is outright lying about multiple issues to the point where what they say publicly is not what they believe privately, as a group,"" Rose said.

Rose called it ""frightening"" that some of the public dishonesty can lead to policy implications.

For example, he noted that the study found that for a while, the ""Defund the Police"" appeared to be supported by the majority of Democrats, but only 3% of Democrats supported it in private.

""I don't think we would have gone down the road of some of the stuff in Seattle and other things had we known it was just 3%. And we're seeing similar things like that right now. For example, Americans writ large publicly say they think unions are good for the economy. In private they don't believe it,"" Rose said.

""The good news is this -- when you get past what we're saying publicly, to what we privately believe. I was shocked at the extent of the common ground we have as Americans,"" Rose continued. ""On two thirds of those issues, almost every single demographic in the country agrees -- is on the same side of it.""

Rose found it ""wild"" that so many Americans agreed on significant issues, at least privately, when the nation feels so divided.

""What I'm most excited about is not just that we agree, but it's what we agree on. There is an incredible private preference for meritocracy in America, whether we're talking about college admissions, hiring decisions, promotion decisions, who gets to be in the C-suite, to the way we treat different groups,"" Rose said.

""Three fourths of Americans across all demographics prefer to live in a meritocracy than the things we've been doing recently,"" he continued. ""And I think that's really good news for the future of the country.""

However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows as many respondents are deeply concerned about the economy.

""One of the things that we found that cut across a bunch of different issues was deep-seeded pessimism about the economy and the direction of the country,"" Rose said.

The study found that Democrats are the most likely to privately suggest the economy is flourishing.

""Consistently, upwards of three out of four Americans say the economy is not good. And we asked a lot of different ways. We asked about their personal finances as they are now. We asked about the state of the economy as it is now. We asked it about whether the economy was better now or worse now than it was five years ago. We asked whether their personal finances were better or worse. We asked in a bunch of ways,"" Rise said.

""Without fail, what you see is that most people recognize in private that the economy's not doing very well. Not surprisingly, the only group that privately will say something different are registered Democrats,"" he continued. ""They pretty consistently are like, 'I think the economy's great.'""

CNN STUDY FINDS DEMOCRAT-LEANING KIDS 5 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SAY THEY WOULDN'T VISIT PRO-TRUMP FAMILY'S HOUSE

Rose said that many of the Democrats who insist the economy is thriving under the Biden-Harris administration admit their personal finances are ""not so good.""

""When we asked about the country headed in the wrong direction, you're getting an overwhelming super majority of Americans, across all demographics, acknowledging that things aren't good for the country,"" Rose said.

The other thing that surprised Rose is how Americans feel about institutions overall.

""So, we all know when it comes to the government, that even in public opinion there's lot there's a lot of distrust of the government, even publicly. We asked the statement about whether you trusted the government to tell you the truth. And that's a kind of low bar, right? Not like, to do everything right, just to tell me the truth. In private, only 4% of Americans trust the government to tell them the truth,"" Rose said.

""What's really funny about that is, Democrats in public have the highest rate of saying they trust the government, 36%. In private, it's only 5%. Even they don't trust the government to tell the truth,"" Rose continued. ""When you extend that to the media, we see something similar. Only 7% of the public privately trusts the media to tell the truth.""

The Social Pressure Index can be seen here.

As to how the data was determined, the abstract for the study explains: ""The primary methodology of the study was a list experiment (also known as the item count technique), a survey technique designed to maximize respondents' privacy. Rather than directly asking respondents their opinion on a series of sensitive topics, list experiments conceal respondents' answers as part of the methodological design by aggregating responses to sensitive items with other items, minimizing the biases introduced by social desirability and nonresponse.""

""If tolerance of dissenting views and the courage to participate in the open, free exchange of ideas are markers of a healthy democracy, then America's epidemic of self-silencing should be seen as a five-alarm fire engulfing the key pillars of representative governance. Most Americans are hesitant to share their honest opinions, not because they're afraid of disagreement, but because they're afraid of judgment,"" Rose said in a statement prior to his Fox News Digital interview.

""When nearly two in three Americans admit that they don't feel comfortable sharing their opinions, that collective silence can create a dangerous illusion of a country more fractured and polarized than it truly is,"" Rose added. ""The truth is we are not as divided as we seem. We're increasingly just too afraid to speak up.""

According to Populace, ""The survey was conducted from May 16, 2024, to June 24, 2024, and was fielded by YouGov."""
429,Critical battles loom as Congress looks to avoid crippling 'shutdown crisis' for next president,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critical-battles-loom-congress-looks-avoid-crippling-shutdown-crisis-next-president,2024-09-30T08:16:33Z,"'America's Newsroom' co-anchor Bill Hemmer breaks down the latest Fox News Power Rankings for the 2024 congressional elections.

The halls of Congress will be empty the next six weeks as lawmakers brace for a very different situation in Washington -- and potentially in the United States -- when lawmakers return after Election Day.

The House and Senate are in recess until Nov. 11.

The break gives vulnerable legislators ample time to campaign before voters head to the polls on the first Tuesday of November. Leaders on both sides of the aisle, meanwhile, are busy making plans for the final weeks of the 118th Congress, known as the ""lame duck"" session.

When lawmakers file back in, it will be on the cusp of a new presidential administration and possibly a new balance of power in Congress.

DOES IRAN'S HACKING OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PROVE THEY WANT KAMALA HARRIS TO WIN THE ELECTION? EXPERTS WEIGH IN

They'll also spend the bulk of their time during the five weeks in session between Election Day and the end-of-year holidays wrestling with at least three deadlines.

Federal funding for discretionary government programs -- those controlled by Congress' annual appropriations process, unlike mandatory programs including Social Security, Medicare and certain state and local government payments -- will dry up by Dec. 20 if lawmakers fail to reach an agreement before then.

The deadline originally lined up with the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30, but Congress punted that fight with a short-term extension of the current year's federal funding levels.

The way that battle plays out will depend heavily on which party controls Congress and the White House next year.

IRAN TRIED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION BY SENDING STOLEN MATERIAL FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO BIDEN'S CAMP, FBI SAYS

""I want to win the election overwhelmingly so we're in a position to negotiate for all the stuff that has to be done, and winning sets us up for a successful negotiation,"" House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis., told Fox News Digital.

It's likely that if former President Trump wins, Republicans will push for another extension into the new year to give the incoming commander-in-chief control over fiscal year 2025 federal spending.

The House GOP majority will likely be more inclined to take an active role regarding government funding if Vice President Kamala Harris wins, though it's unclear how successful any effort will be considering it's likely to meet significant resistance in the current Democrat-controlled Senate.

Congress will also have to wrestle with a new National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets military and national security policy annually.

Steil contends defense spending and policy, in particular, should take priority when lawmakers return.

""Our adversaries are working against U.S. interests across the globe, and they're doing that because they see the weakness of the Biden administration's foreign policy,"" Steil said. ""So, our need to come back with a strong defense bill to protect our troops, in the interest of national security, is going to be absolutely essential.""

Another key battle on the horizon is the annual farm bill, a broad piece of legislation setting American food and agricultural policy that must be renewed every five years.

The farm bill affects federal food benefits, crop prices and forestry conservation, among other issues.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

Congress last year extended the 2018 farm bill through the end of December 2024.

Steil said he was optimistic Congress could authorize a new farm bill, noting its importance to the agriculture industry in his state and others.

Meanwhile, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Digital he wanted to see his chamber prioritize the fiscal year 2025 funding process.

""We've got to recommit to going through the appropriations process, go ahead and get all that moving so we can be successful next year,"" he said.

Ogles added, however, that he wants House Republicans to avoid putting their 12 annual appropriations bills into a massive ""omnibus"" spending bill in December, which the GOP argues furthers government bloat while reducing transparency.

House GOP leaders have insisted they will not advance an omnibus spending bill.

But some senior Republicans said they would rather finish the appropriations process this year to leave a clean slate for a new administration.

""I would hope whoever the next president is, whether it's Vice President Harris or, as I expect, former President Trump, that person decides to make this administration and this Congress do their job,"" House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters. ""I don't think we should, because we can't do our job in this Congress, give them a government shutdown crisis [in the first] couple of months. It's just irresponsible."""

College football fans were treated to a great couple of days on Friday and Saturday nights.

The Miami Hurricanes picked up a dramatic and controversial win over Virginia Tech, Rutgers wowed the home crowd in New Jersey with a victory over Washington, Kentucky upset Ole Miss, and Georgia and Alabama played an instant classic.

Those were just a handful of amazing matchups that took place.

After the dust cleared, there were clear winners and losers of the week.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

Donald Trump: The former president and current Republican presidential candidate got a taste of SEC football on Saturday night as he took in Alabama vs. Georgia. Trump was greeted with ""USA"" chants and talked to OutKick's Clay Travis about his experience at the stadium among other things.

UNLV: After quarterback Matthew Sluka decided to leave the Rebels football program after a dispute over NIL money, UNLV didn't lose a step on offense. Hajj-Malik Williams had a fantastic game, helping the Rebels destroy Fresno State on Saturday afternoon. It seems like UNLV has moved on, and they've got themselves a QB that's ready to lead them the rest of the way.

Indiana: Head coach Curt Cignetti has himself a squad, now sitting at 5-0 on the season after beating Maryland on Saturday, 42-28. The Hoosiers have a great chance at staying undefeated before a matchup with Ohio State next month. The Indiana offense is rolling, out-scoring opponents by almost 27 points per game. Watch out, this team could cause some problems in the Big Ten for the rest of the season.

Alabama: What can you say about the game on Saturday against Georgia that hasn't already been mentioned numerous times? Jalen Milroe punished the Bulldogs defense in the first half and came up clutch late in the game with a touchdown pass to Ryan Williams that turned out to be the game-winning score. This was a massive win for Kalen DeBoer as he led Alabama to another win over Georgia with Nick Saban watching from the sidelines. If they play like this, the Crimson Tide will be making a run in the college football playoffs in December.

Monmouth: The Hawks are back on the winners list for the second consecutive week after routing the Fordham Rams in a 63-21 beatdown. Saturday's win marked Monmouth's third straight win and set a program record for points scored in a half (49), topping the previous record set in 2005. It also set a program record for points scored in a quarter (35), beating the previous mark set in 1998. Running back Sone Ntoh led the offense with 136 rushing yards and five touchdowns. The Hawks have now scored at least 42 points in their last seven wins.

Notre Dame: Just when everyone thought their CFP hopes were over due to their tough loss against Northern Illinois, they're pulling themselves back in after yesterday's win against No. 15 Louisville. They're probably not a threat, but maybe they can win out and sneak into a playoff game.

Travis Hunter: Hunter has become a legitimate Heisman candidate as he's helped lead Colorado to a surprising 4-1 start, and Deion Sanders and company are proving they can contend for an expanded playoff spot. There is no player in college football, and really not even in the NFL, who provides the impact Hunter does. It's more appropriate to compare his impact to that of Shohei Ohtani than any active football player, college or pro.

Boise State: With a dominant win over unbeaten Washington State, Boise State has proven it belongs in the AP Top 25, and it is likely to stay there over at least the next two games with winnable matchups against Utah State and Hawaii. Then it has another prove-it game against UNLV. Running back Ashton Jeanty has four career games with over 200 yards rushing, which is tied for a Boise State school record. Jeanty currently leads the nation in rushing yards per game with an average of 195.33.

Ryan Williams: If you didn't know about the 17-year-old phenom for the Crimson Tide entering this weekend, there's no way you haven't heard him name after what he was able to do in the win over Georgia.Williams is simply a star, catching just six passes for 1777 yards and a touchdown, a score that included an acrobatic catch, followed by a nifty spin move that saw two Bulldogs defenders hitting each other as he streaked down the right sideline.He's not even 18 years old yet, but Williams is making noise as a true freshman star as he's leading the country with yards per reception (28.9).

Kentucky: Perhaps the biggest upset of the week is the Wildcats taking down No. 5 Ole Miss, and it came after getting blown out by South Carolina and just losing to Georgia two weeks ago as well.The 20-17 came after Kentucky went 83 yards in just six plays as they trailed 17-13. Then, the Wildcats were able to get a huge stop on Jaxson Dart's offense with the Rebels. This is just the win the Wildcats needed, as they have a tough schedule with Vanderbilt, Florida and Auburn moving forward before the No. 1 offense in the country, Tennessee, is on the schedule next month.

Jalen Milroe: Kirk Herbstreit said it best during the Alabama-Georgia broadcast: There are SEC-caliber players on the field, and the Crimson Tide quarterback was simply having his way running and throwing all over them.Milroe is a frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy and it shows why after what he was able to do against the Bulldogs. He threw for 374 yards, ran for 117 yards and was responsible for four total touchdowns against a team that didn't allow a single touchdown through three weeks to start the season.Because of his efforts, the Crimson Tide are now the No. 1 team on the AP Top 25 rankings.

Tim Walz: The Minnesota governor and one half of the Harris-Walz ticket took in Michigan's victory over Minnesota over the weekend. Unfortunately, the Golden Gophers couldn't pick up the upset victory. But to add insult to injury, Walz was booed by some fans at the stadium. He shared a suit with Beto O'Rourke.

Replay officials: How replay review overturned Virginia Tech's walk-off Hail Mary touchdown is quite unbelievable. It took way too long to make the call on the field (Miami began celebrating and then had to stop), and just about everyone was surprised at the final ruling. An incredible college football moment was snatched from us.

UCF: All of that hype coming into the game against Colorado was gone by halftime. The Gus Malzahn offense fell apart, and Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter took full advantage of a broken Knights offense. Also, Travis Hunter should be in the Heisman Trophy conversation, but that's a story for another day.

Ole Miss: So much for blowing out competitive competition. Kentucky stormed into Oxford and ripped out the hearts of Rebel fans, along with head coach Lane Kiffin. The loss to the Wildcats doesn't hurt the playoff chances for the Rebels, but if they continue to play like this, they will catch a few more losses before the regular season ends. Good day to be Kentucky, but a worse day for Ole Miss.

Hugh Freeze: Auburn is in a free fall after losing once again, this time to Oklahoma in Michael Hawkins Jr.'s first start at quarterback after replacing Jackson Arnold. The Sooners were down 21-10 in the fourth quarter but forced a few turnovers with a pick-six from Payton Thorne. Now the Tigers are in a tailspin, and I don't know how they recover. This was another bad look for the Tigers, especially since Oklahoma was without five wide receivers. Things are getting bad on the Plains and for Hugh Freeze.

Florida State: A week removed from their first win of the season, the Seminoles were back in the loss column after a brutal 42-16 loss to SMU. Florida State opened in the preseason top 10, but after Saturday, the Seminoles hardly look like contenders in the ACC. For the third time in coach Mike Norvell's five seasons, Florida State has lost three of its first four games.

Carson Beck: Sure, Beck amassed 400 yards, but that's awfully skewed due to trailing all game (339 in second half). You cannot turn the ball over four times against Alabama and expect to win. These big games is where draft stock goes up and down, especially for someone like Beck who could be among the first-round talent in next year's draft class. But this game isn't one to add to the highlight tape, as Beck wasn't on his best game.

Washington: For years, Rutgers had been the ""pledging"" program of the Big Ten as one of the conference's more recent additions, paying its dues with less revenue sharing, overmatched by opponents and a basement-dwelling record. But now, Washington is a newcomer in the Big 10 and, even though it's the national runner-up, losing the first conference game against a historically weak program like Rutgers has to be embarrassing for first-year head coach Jed Fisch and doesn't set a promising tone about the program's future in the conference.

North Carolina: Mack Brown is officially on the hot seat, as the Tar Heels were unable to take down its rival, Duke, after getting demolished by James Madison a week ago.It was a much closer game this time around, but UNC was on the losing end of the 21-20 finish. When you have to respond to rumors that you might be stepping down after a blowout, things are definitely not going well.Brown could very well be in his last season leading the Tar Heels if things don't start going in their favor soon.

Payton Thorne: The Tigers had all the momentum on their side at home against the Oklahoma Sooners, but that all changed in the fourth quarter when Thorne, the country's leader in interceptions, threw a pick-six that changed the course of the game.Through four games, Thorne, the fifth-year senior, has six interceptions to 10 touchdowns and the Tigers are now 2-3 and 0-2 in conference play with Georgia looking for it's get-right game against Auburn this week.Things are not looking good for Thorne and the Tigers right now"
431,Trump assassination attempt: Secret Service to face new lawsuit over DEI quota,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-assassination-attempt-secret-service-face-new-lawsuit-over-dei-quota,2024-09-30T08:06:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A nonprofit defending women's issues plans to sue the U.S. Secret Service for what it alleges is an ""arbitrary"" diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiative that harms female employees.

The proposed lawsuit comes more than two months after some pointed fingers at female USSS agents assigned to former President Trump's detail at his July 13 presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old shooter gained access to a nearby rooftop and shot at Trump with an automatic rifle.

""In our country, it is illegal for the government to discriminate on the basis of sex. That is the Constitution's 14th Amendment,"" May Mailman, director of the Independent Women's Forum, told Fox News Digital. ""But also Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex. And yet you have the Secret Service, of all agencies, saying that they want to have a 30% female quota.""

A Secret Service spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the agency does not comment on pending litigation matters.

SECRET SERVICE RIPPED FOR PLAN TO SEND AGENTS TO DISNEY WORLD LGBTQ SUMMIT AMID FAILURES PROTECTING TRUMP

Mailman added that there is a ""30x30"" pledge that various law enforcement agencies have taken with a goal to reach a 30% female workforce.

""And we know that Kim Cheatle took this very seriously. We know that she made hiring decisions based on this,"" Mailman said.

TRUMP ASSASSAINTION ATTEMPT SPARKS INVESTIGATION OF SECRET SERVICE DEI POLICIES: 'COMPROMISED ITS MISSION'

In 2022, President Biden appointed former USSS Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned after the July assassination attempt, making her only the second woman to lead the agency.

Cheatle previously served as senior director of global security at PepsiCo, where she was responsible for directing and implementing security protocols for the company's facilities in North America.

Critics have accused Cheatle of prioritizing ideologies rooted in DEI instead of only focusing on hiring the best for the agency. While at the Secret Service, Cheatle has stressed the importance of increasing diversity in the Secret Service. The ""30%"" female quota stems from a 2023 CBS report stating that the agency was looking to increase women recruits to make up 30% of the USSS workforce.

TOP SECRET SERVICE AGENT IN PITTSBURGH SAYS HE WAS KEPT IN DARK ON 'CREDIBLE' THREAT AHEAD OF BUTLER RALLY

""I'm very conscious as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,"" Cheatle told the outlet.

WATCH:

Women currently make up 24% of the USSS workforce, according to the agency's website.

The Diplomatic Security Service -- which is the protective arm of the State Department, whereas the Secret Service is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security -- has a similar pledge ""to increase the representation of women in its recruit classes to 30 percent by 2030,"" as an April press release states.

SECRET SERVICE STRUGGLE TO PROTECT PRESIDENTS WON'T SEE 'IMMEDIATE' END EVEN WITH MORE MANPOWER: RETIRED AGENT

Mailman pointed to three reasons IWF takes issue with the 30% pledge: first, ""it's illegal, and you shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex,"" she said. Second, ""it's particularly dangerous in the Secret Service"" to hire on the basis of sex or other identifying factors rather than solely on expertise and qualifications for the job. Third, ""it's particularly harmful to women,"" Mailman said.

""[W]hen the pictures of that day came out, it was immediately like these women are all cops, and they can't find their holster.""

-- May Mailman

""I am sure it is not easy to be a woman in any male-dominated field, including the Secret Service. But as we all remember, when the pictures of that day came out, it was immediately like these women are all cops, and they can't find their holster,"" Mailman explained. ""All of the blame seems to be on women, including Kim Cheatle, all the way down. That's what happens when you have quota systems . . . you turn women into tokens. That makes it really hard for women who are trying to be respected and earn their way into male-dominated fields.""

Agents received criticism for their handling of the assassination attempt on X from conservative voices including Matt Walsh, Dinesh D'Souza and even Elon Musk.

""It is an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender.""

-- Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi

""As an elite law enforcement agency, all of our agents and officers are highly trained and fully capable of performing our missions. It is an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender. Such baseless assertions undermine the professionalism, dedication and expertise of our workforce,"" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to Politico following the criticism. ""We stand united against any attempt to discredit our personnel and their invaluable contributions to our mission and are appalled by the disparaging and disgusting comments against any of our personnel.""

President Trump has defended the female agents who shielded him on July 13.

""Every one of them - there wasn't one that was slow. A woman who was on my right, she was shielding me,"" he said at a rally at St. Cloud, Minnesota, two weeks after the assassination attempt. ""Beautiful person - she was shielding me, everything she could. And she got crushed. And she got criticized by the fake news because she wasn't tall enough.""

IWF is joining Mountain States Legal Foundation's investigation into what they describe at the Secret Service's reliance on DEI policies for hiring, retention and promotion.

LOCAL OFFICER'S BULLET STOPPED TRUMP SHOOTER'S GUNFIRE BEFORE SECRET SERVICE SHOT, WITNESS TESTIFIES

""Protecting candidates for President of the United States is imperative to the functioning of our Republic, and the catastrophic results of an assassination simply can't be understated. Yet it appears that the Secret Service is prioritizing its DEI agenda over the need to hire the best person for the job, regardless of sex. If it takes a lawsuit to change that, so be it,"" Will Trachman, general counsel of Mountain States Legal Foundation, said in a statement.

IWF and Mountain States Legal also believe the 30% quota is ""arbitrary."" ""Why not 31%? Why not 29%?"" Mailman asked.

""We want for women to be seen and treated as the hardcore, bada-- women that they might be,"" she said. ""We just don't know because the whole thing has been tainted by quota system.""

(X/@TulsiGabbard)

A Hollywood actor is throwing his support behind former President Trump as Election Day is a little more than five weeks away.

""Shazam!"" star Zachary Levi revealed his pick for president while moderating an event with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democrat congresswoman from Hawaii, in Michigan on Saturday.

Levi opened the event by explaining that he initially was backing RFK Jr. in the 2024 presidential election, and when Kennedy suspended his campaign, Levi knew to whom he was sending his support.

""In a perfect world, in whatever that would look like, perhaps I would have voted for Bobby,"" Levi said. ""But we don't live in a perfect world. In fact, we live in a very broken one. We live in a country that has been hijacked by a lot of people who want to take this place way off the cliff, and we're here to stop that.""

RFK JR JOINS TRUMP ON STAGE IN BATTLEGROUND ARIZONA RALLY FOLLOWING ENDORSEMENT

Levi added that he grew up in a Christian conservative family and his parents taught him to ""have a healthy level of distrust of the government,"" adding that Kennedy is the ""real deal"" and the kind of politician he wanted to support for president.

""We are going to take back this country. We are going to make it great again, we're going to make it healthy again. And so I stand with Bobby and I stand with everyone else who is standing with President Trump. ... Of the two choices that we have, and we only have two, President Trump is the man that can get us there,"" Levi said.

TRUMP ACCEPTS LARGEST POLICE UNION ENDORSEMENT, BLASTS HARRIS AS A 'DEFUNDER': 'KAMALA'S CRIME WAVE'

Levi starred as the superhero Shazam in two DC movies in 2019 and 2023. The movies are about a young boy who transforms into an adult man after saying the catchphrase. He also starred in the TV series ""Chuck"" and voiced Flynn Rider in the animated Disney movie ""Tangled.""

The actor also brewed a social media storm after expressing his distrust of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in a post on X in 2023.

'SHAZAM' STAR ZACHARY LEVI RIPS HOLLYWOOD FOR MAKING 'GARBAGE' MOVIES: 'THEY DON'T CARE ENOUGH'

The controversy began when Levi retweeted a question from Moorhouse Group founder Lyndon Wood, who questioned his followers, ""Do you agree or not, that Pfizer is a real danger to the world?""

The brief comment stirred intense backlash from left-leaning X accounts, attacking the actor for ""disappointing"" them after supporting ""antivax propaganda.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump campaign and Levi for comment on the endorsement and did not immediately receive a response.

The New Yorker magazine issued a scathing rebuke of President Biden in its official endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris published Sunday.

The magazine heaped praise on Harris for displaying ""the basic values and political skills"" to defeat former President Trump in a lengthy endorsement, but not before scolding President Biden for standing in her way.

""It was hardly a secret that Biden has aged, growing markedly less robust, particularly in the past eighteen months or so. If he got through an interview or a (rare) press conference without incident, staff and supporters exhaled and treated it as a victory,"" the editors wrote.

FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS 'STARK CHOICE'

""But, rather than open the gate to a younger generation of Democratic candidates, Biden, his advisers, and the Party leadership stood in the way. They made it plain that a challenger would inevitably be defeated. Meanwhile, through spin and deft scheduling, the White House staff protected the President and hoped for the best. Tens of millions of voters, fearing another Trump Presidency, had little choice but to close their eyes and think of America,"" the endorsement reads.

The editors wrote that the infamous debate, which led to the end of Biden's re-election bid, broadcast to the world the extent of his ""disintegration.""

""Viewed more coldly, it was a gift. Had it taken place, say, after the Conventions, it might have been too late to force a reassessment,"" the article reads.

""Trump said... 'I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either.' By Trumpian standards, this was a kindness. It was also the end of the Biden candidacy,"" the editors continue.

The endorsement also spends a significant portion attacking Trump, calling him a ""menacing presence in American life.""

""There's every reason to think that Trump II would be far worse than Trump I,"" they wrote.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

Harris, they wrote, has ""got the 'vibes,' as this year's cliché has it. But the race remains very close.

""In both 2016 and 2020, Trump outperformed the polls. No responsible assessment of the contest has the luxury of focussing only on the imperatives for a Harris Administration and gliding past the ramifications of another Trump Administration,"" the editors continue.

The New Yorker was among the first left-leaning publications to urge Biden to step aside after his disastrous debate performance in June.

""Watching Thursday's debate, observing Biden wander into senselessness onstage, was an agonizing experience, and it is bound to obliterate forever all those vague and qualified descriptions from White House insiders about good days and bad days,"" The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, wrote at the time.

JD Vance was seen talking to an employee at Primanti Bros. in North Versailles, Pa., on Saturday.

Vice President Kamala Harris is fond of saying that Donald Trump is only in it for himself, not the American people. Well, this weekend we saw, in a picture-perfect example of psychological projection, Harris throwing a small business under the bus for her own supposed political gain.

On Saturday, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance tried to drop in on Pittsburgh's famed Primanti Bros. sandwich shop, only to be barred entry. This came much to the disappointment of waiting voters, some of whom angrily recorded the events on their phones.

VANCE NOT ALLOWED TO CAMPAIGN IN PITTSBURGH CULINARY LANDMARK - DESPITE HARRIS EVENT AT SAME RESTAURANT CHAIN

Ire was raised on the right, threats of boycotts abounded, and Vance had cause to be a little miffed.

But Trump's running mate graciously forgave the snub, while greeting fans in the parking lot, paying for the crowd's meals with a generous tip. The store released a statement saying he was welcome and that their employee had just been surprised by the cameras.

As the Bard once pointed out, all's well that ends well, until Kamala Harris gets involved, and it's very telling.

On Sunday, Harris' campaign posted a video on X showing Harris being welcomed as a hero in Primanti Bros. back in August. The message was as clear as it was ugly - unlike Republicans, Democrats are welcome in polite society.

Let's set to one side the fact that Harris' appearance at the Steel City staple this summer was met by widespread mockery when it was discovered her campaign had kicked out actual diners and bused in supporters to set the fraudulent scene. That's bad enough.

But what Harris has wrought here isn't just the disingenuous papering of the house at a political event. She is doing real harm to Primanti Bros.' effort to walk this situation back and make clear that everyone, of every political stripe, is welcome there.

That was the point Vance was trying to make when he spoke after being denied entry, saying of the manager, ""Don't hold it against her, she just got a little nervous, but it's a great local business.""

That is the classy way to handle such a thing. It is what generations of Americans have expected from our leaders.

Primanti Bros. confirmed that was what happened and that really should have been the end of it. But no, not for Kamala Harris, the 'me' girl, around whom all things must revolve.

It didn't matter to Harris that the matter had been settled, that calls to boycott the restaurant were dying down, or that people were ready to move on to more serious matters.

No, the vice president of the United States had to spike the football on X over her astroturf event at the greasy spoon, even if it meant hurting the business. You see, Harris winning is more important than any individual small business.

And it was done in such an obnoxious way. Does Harris really want all of our businesses segregated by the politics of the customers? How ghastly.

It brought me back to a conversation I had with a woman in San Francisco recently. She was a lifelong resident who had followed Harris' rise.

""She doesn't seem to believe in much, and the word is she isn't very nice,"" she told me.

This echoes similar voices in Pennsylvania who told me they ""just don't know who she is,"" or, commonly, ""I think she'll say anything to get elected.""

Harris keeps insisting that she is the candidate who is selflessly in the race for the sake of the American people, while Trump only cares about Trump, but when has Harris ever done anything selflessly, or not on the public dime?

When in her career has she taken a back seat for the good of the people?

She certainly isn't doing so by extending the controversy and misery surrounding Primanti Bros., which wants nothing more than for this whole story to go away.

The brutal fact is that the only moral compass Harris and her campaign have is set squarely on a north star of victory, not helping actual people, even if they think they might get around to that part eventually.

In the meantime, much like the bused-in participants at her event at Primanti Bros., we are all just extras in Kamala's Excellent Adventure."

(Caroline Hitesman via Storyful, Kayla Roseman via Storyful)

As the death toll continues to rise across the Southern states, first aid and assistance to those suffering from Hurricane Helene are rolling in across the country.

As of Sunday morning, the North Carolina National Guard (NCNG) activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen and more than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets as well as high-water response vehicles.

The NCNG reported that it completed 16 air missions, resulting in the rescue of 119 citizens and 11 pets.

""Our National Guard air assets have identified people on the ground, and utilized social media and emergency calls to locate, identify, and evacuate citizens in Western North Carolina,"" the NCNG wrote in an update on X.

RESCUE MISSIONS UNDERWAY IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE BRINGS 'HISTORIC' FLOODING, LANDSLIDES

The NCNG said the largest single mission saw the rescue of 41 people north of Asheville in Bumcombe County.

""Our air assets have moved more than 34,000 pounds of cargo, including food, water, and medical supplies to distribute. In the past 48 hours, we have been augmented by personnel and air assets from Connecticut, Maryland, Ohio, Iowa, Florida, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania,"" the post continued from NCNG.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper gave an update during a morning press briefing, thanking everyone for their hard work.

""North Carolina is strong, and our first responders are the best in the nation. I am thankful for their hard work and for risking their lives to protect all North Carolinians. This is an unprecedented tragedy that requires an unprecedented response,"" Cooper wrote on X.

During his rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, former President Trump opened with a prayer to everyone suffering from Hurricane Helene.

""Before we begin, I'd like to send my love and prayers to the families of those who have died, a lot of death, and all of those who are displaced and suffering in the wake of the hurricanes' destruction in the South, especially in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and in particular western North Carolina, took a tremendous hit,"" Trump said.

""It's been absolutely devastating. And God be with you all. It's been a rough one. That was a big monster hurricane and was a lot ... harder than anyone even thought possible. So, we want to just extend our best wishes to everybody,"" he continued.

A salon owner in Asheville shared an update on the damage done to her salon.

""It's with the heaviest hearts and sickest stomachs that I make this post...Balm salon was completely destroyed by the flooding from the French broad,"" the owner of Balm Salon wrote.

""This haven and sanctuary that was my business and place of work will have to be completely rebuilt. I started a GoFundMe to help support myself and my stylists since we've lost our place to work and income while we try to rebuild and replace what's been lost,"" the post continued.

The Balm Salon owner thanked everyone for their support and asked for continued prayers for their community.

""Anything helps, I know our whole community is hurting, and we all have a lot to replace. So so many people were impacted by this completely devastating storm. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and soul. I hope everyone is safe, and that our community will come together to see everything put back for everyone impacted. I love you all,"" the salon owner wrote.

On Sunday, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra declared a public health emergency (PHE) for North Carolina to address the health impacts of Hurricane Helene.

""We will do all we can to help North Carolina officials respond to the health impacts of Hurricane Helene,"" Becerra said. ""We are working closely with state and local health authorities, as well as with our partners across the federal government, and stand ready to provide additional public health and medical support.""

The public health emergency declarations followed President Biden's emergency declarations for Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. Public health emergency declarations give the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting the emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.

""ASPR will continue to deploy teams to assist the combined federal and multi-state response to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and other impacted states,"" said Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O'Connell. ""We are evaluating the impacts of the storm and requests for federal assistance as they come in.""

Country music star Luke Combs also sent his condolences to everyone in the path of the storm and said he had ""something special lined up"" to help.

""Absolutely heartbroken for everyone impacted by Hurricane Helene. Especially my folks in Western North Carolina. Me and my team have been making some calls and I think we've got something really special lined up to help the Carolinas as much as we can. More details to come ASAP,"" Combs wrote in a post on X.

Fellow country music artist Chase Rice echoed Combs and offered assistance to those in the Carolinas.

ABC News' Martha Raddatz and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., clashed on Sunday over recent comments former President Trump made about Vice President Kamala Harris as the lawmaker argued repeatedly they should ""stick to the issues.""

""Do you think Kamala Harris is mentally disabled, do you approve of that kind of language?"" Raddatz said, repeating Trump's comments at a recent rally.

Trump told a crowd at a recent Wisconsin rally, ""Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.""

Emmer argued that Harris was the ""wrong choice"" for America.

""Congressman, do you approve of that language?"" Raddatz interrupted, ""do you approve of that language, Donald Trump calling her mentally disabled, mentally impaired?""

""I think we should stick to the issues,"" Emmer responded.

Raddatz then turned the conversation to Trump and Vance's unsubstantiated claim about Haitian migrants eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio.

""One of the issues is of course, migrants. I can't believe we're still talking about this, but the baseless claims elevated by Vance and Trump that Haitian migrants were eating their pets,"" Raddatz said. ""If the moderators in the debate ask Vance about this, should he finally make clear it is not true?""

Emmer said the question was ""such a distraction.""

""The people in the mainstream media want to put up these shiny objects to distract people from what they see happen every day,"" Emmer continued, before Raddatz pushed back and argued that Trump and Vance brought up the issue.

""I think they've got to focus on the issues. The issues are very clear. The economy works under Donald Trump. It doesn't work under Kamala Harris. The border is sealed under Donald Trump and crime is under control. And the border is wide open and Kamala Harris is going into Minnesota trying to bail out rioters and people who are attacking policemen with a bail fund. The list goes on and on. It will be a very clear contrast between JD Vance and Donald Trump's agenda versus what Kamala Harris is talking about. I don't know why you guys don't ask her about her price controls, I mean, she's been way to the left,"" Emmer said.

Raddatz argued that ABC does ask Harris about ""price controls,"" and asked if Emmer would support the policies Harris proposed during her border visit.

""Do we believe her now after she's had almost four years to solve the border crisis and all she did was made sure that it was wide open?"" Emmer responded. ""This is too little, too late. Nobody can believe her because her actions have said something completely different for four years."""

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker became the latest Democrat to defend Kamala Harris' ever-evolving position on immigration, arguing it is ""natural"" for the vice president to change her mind over time.

""It's natural, of course, that you adapt your policies to meet the moment,"" Pritzker said during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday.

The comments come as Harris has faced accusations of ""flip-flopping"" on several former policy positions by Republicans, including on illegal immigration and the border.

""Kamala Harris continues to flip-flop on policy issues, the latest being the border wall,"" Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind., said after Harris signaled her support for a bipartisan border bill that includes funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall. ""Too bad we have the receipts. Don't fall for her false promises; she welcomed this invasion, and if she had any real plans to address the border crisis, she would do it now.""

Other Republicans, such as Trump senior adviser Jason Miller, have argued that Harris has not changed her position on the wall, arguing that she would still stop construction of the barrier if elected.

""Harris opposes the wall, has always opposed the wall, and stopped wall construction as VP,"" Miller told Fox News last month.

Nevertheless, Harris' allies have continued to defend the vice president's evolving views.

""You develop your policies based on what you see happening in the world around you and what you're able to accomplish in Washington,"" Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said when asked about Harris' shifting policies during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" earlier this month. ""Every election is about the future and not the past.""

On immigration, Pritizker argued that Harris has supported action on the border, noting her support for President Biden's bipartisan border deal that failed to make its way through the Senate.

Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, has been ""hidden away"" from the press, Atlantic staff writer Mark Leibovich wrote in a piece published on Saturday, questioning why her running mate stopped giving prominent interviews.

""It's a bit of a mystery why Walz has largely stopped doing national media, especially given how effective he was over the summer,"" Leibovich wrote.

Walz appeared alongside Harris in her first interview since becoming the Democratic candidate. He sat down with ABC News and MSNBC after the Harris-Donald Trump debate, and has done a handful of local news interviews.

""The campaign seems to have trapped him in the same hyper-protective Bubble Wrap it has placed around Harris, and that was placed around Biden before her. This strikes me as a massive waste of Walz's talent, but what do I know?"" Leibovich wrote.

The Atlantic writer argued that Walz was a good messenger for the campaign, and said he spent time observing him at rallies and more ahead of the vice presidential debate with GOP vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance.

Leibovich noted that his team didn't make the Minnesota governor available for an interview, but said he spoke to several of his close allies.

""If you drive by someone who's stuck on the road,"" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., told Leibovich, describing Walz. ""They might need a lift or a phone call or a tire change. I wouldn't be able to change the tire, but I could make the phone call or give them a lift. Tim could do all three.""

""Oddly, since Harris picked him, Walz has been largely hidden away from the national media.

439,Fear grips idyllic Nantucket amid migrant crime spike: 'A lot of bad people',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nantucket-residents-say-feel-unsafe-after-ice-arrests-island,2024-09-29T19:20:36Z,"NANTUCKET, Mass. - After a slew of illegal immigrants were nabbed on this idyllic island by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for sex crimes and assault over the course of a month, many residents fear their home has changed forever.

Five migrants from Guatemala and El Salvador were picked up by Enforcement and Removal Operations of Boston in separate actions this month. Elmer Sola and Bryan Daniel Aldana-Arevalo were charged for sex crimes against children, per the agency; Felix Alberto Perez-Gomez and Gean Do Amaral Belafronte were charged with sex crimes against adults; and Angel Gabriel Deras-Mejia was a documented member of the notorious gang MS-13.

Immigrants - many who have obtained H2B visas for seasonal work - are a vital part of Nantucket's tourism industry and make up a large portion of the summer vacation spot's year-round population. Multiple local bars, like The Muse, host packed Latino nights each week; 41.5% of students in Nantucket's public schools speak a language other than English at home, per online school district data.

NANTUCKET PARENTS FEAR FOR CHILDREN AMID SPIKE IN MIGRANT CRIME: 'AS A FATHER, IT TRULY SCARES ME'

While residents told Fox News Digital they embrace the legal immigrants in their community, many expressed deep concerns about those here illegally. It's those unwelcome newcomers, they say, who have brought the nation's border debate to the tiny island off Cape Cod.

""I've lived here for 53 years - I've seen a large uptick in crime. I've never seen this kind of child abuse that I've seen in the last several years,"" a man in his 70s, who asked not to be named, said outside one of two Nantucket grocery stores. ""I never knew where the keys to our house were. Now, I have security cameras.""

""When I moved here in the '70s, Nantucket was a very conservative spot. [Now], most of the U.S.-born people are entirely liberal here. We have good friends that we cannot talk politics with,"" the man said.

""They don't want to face the realities - the reality is that the open border has created an influx of undocumented people. As the statistics came out, there is a rampant amount of crime,"" he said, referring to ICE data released to lawmakers this week.

""The response is 'What can we do about it?' When I said 'Send them back,' it was scoffed at,"" he said.

Several residents told Fox News Digital that in the past, the worst incidents that took place involved drunken tourists accidentally walking into the wrong grey-shingled house. But the local newspaper's crime blotter has grown darker and more voluminous, they said.

John Klatt, who works with Toscana Excavation, told Fox News Digital that he was glad ICE made the arrests earlier this month.

WEALTHY, LIBERAL NANTUCKET, MARTHA'S VINEYARD SEE 6 ICE ARRESTS IN ONE MONTH, INCLUDING MS-13 GANG MEMBER

""My company, we're one of the largest excavating companies on the island,"" he said. ""It doesn't affect us a whole lot because we wouldn't hire [undocumented people]. But I'm sure it affects plenty of other people [here].""

""I hear from minorities like, 'Oh, they're beating up on us' and all that,"" he said. ""But looking at their crimes, I'm not upset about it.""

Fox News Digital has spoken to about a dozen illegal immigrants on the island, primarily Salvadorans, who said the targeted arrests of repeat criminals last month have left them frightened for their livelihoods.

""It's frightening for so many,"" Esmeralda Martinez, who is serving her second term on the Nantucket School Committee and is the only Latina to ever hold elected office on the island, told the Nantucket Current. ""People are hiding in fear that they might be here for them even though most don't have a criminal record, but for the mere fact that they are not legally here. It has caused panic for many.""

Martinez did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

""We're not trying to round up all the illegals - just the ones who are violent members of MS-13,"" another resident who asked not to be named told Fox News Digital outside the Chicken Box, an event venue on the island where locals often pass time during the daylight hours.

Island resident Roland Voyage said the ICE arrests hadn't impacted his sense of safety.

But 61-year-old Jack Faria, a Brazilian who lives on Nantucket and legally immigrated to the United States when he was 20, said other immigrants who ""aren't on the right path"" bring ""trouble.""

""There was a burglary in my neighborhood. These people leave their keys on their car,"" Faria said. ""These guys, they happened to be Brazilians. I know - I'm Brazilian.""

""I don't discriminate - I'm one of them. But I do discriminate against people who just want to take advantage of the system,"" he said. ""I'm a Republican - I totally agree with Trump and mass deportation of immigrants.""

Fresh off headlines that the Democrats' Senate nominee in Maryland received an improper tax credit, new documents indicate that Angela Alsobrooks also was late in paying thousands of dollars in homeowners association fees.

According to documents obtained by Fox News, Alsobrooks failed to pay $8,121 in homeowners association fees on time in seven cases from 2008 through 2021.

The fees, known as HOA fees, are usually assessed monthly or quarterly by a homeowners' association to pay for the services it provides.

Alsobrooks, the chief executive of Prince George's County - Maryland's second-largest county - faces former two-term Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in a competitive race to succeed Democrat Sen. Ben Cardin, who is retiring this year after serving nearly two decades in the Senate and nearly six decades as a state and then federal lawmaker.

BLUE-STATE REPUBLICAN TOUTS HIS ANTI-TRUMP CREDENTIALS

The Senate contest in the overwhelmingly blue state is one of a handful that may decide if the GOP wins back the chamber's majority in the November elections.

Polling in the summer indicated a close contest, but the most recent survey released last week by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland pointed to an 11-point lead by Alsosbrooks. But this month's acknowledgment of an improper tax credit received by Alsobrooks handed Hogan some political ammunition.

SENATE DEMOCRATS CAMPAIGN CHAIR GOES ONE-ON-ONE WITH FOX NEWS

The Alsobrooks' campaign said the candidate would pay back taxes after improperly taking advantage of property tax breaks.

The tax credits, which Alsobrooks did not qualify for, included one meant for low-income senior citizens and a homestead tax break, which is restricted to homes listed as an owner's primary residence.

Alsobrooks' campaign noted that Hogan in 2016 also received a tax break on his Maryland home while he was living in the governor's mansion in Annapolis. But governors are exempt from residency requirements.

Democrats control the Senate by a razor-thin 51-49 margin, and Republicans are looking at a favorable election map this year with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs.

One of those seats is in West Virginia, a deep-red state that former President Trump carried by nearly 40 points in 2020. With moderate Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin, a former governor, not seeking re-election, flipping the seat is nearly a sure thing for the GOP.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SENATE MAJORITY SHOW

Republicans are also aiming to flip seats in Ohio and Montana, two states Trump comfortably carried four years ago. And five more Democrat-held seats up for grabs this year are in crucial presidential election battleground states.

With Democrats trying to protect their fragile Senate majority, Hogan's late entry into the race in February gave them an unexpected headache in a state previously considered safe territory. Hogan left the governor's office at the beginning of 2023 with very positive approval and favorable ratings.

Vice President Kamala Harris' recent border visit came under fire from a list of critics, and Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake has added herself to that list.

""I find it despicable,"" the Trump ally told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""She spent 20 minutes on the border. She's been the border czar for almost four years now, and she came down, I think, to make her friends in the mainstream media happy so that they could finally say she visited the border, spent 20 minutes staring down at her feet, standing next to the wall, and I was surprised she didn't call Joe Biden and say, 'We did it, Joe. We destroyed America,' because that's exactly what they're attempting to do,"" she continued.

Lake appeared on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this week along with National Border Patrol Council Vice President Art Del Cueto.

HARRIS VISITS CRUCIAL BORDER STATE AS IMMIGRATION RECORD SPARKS SCRUTINY: A TIMELINE

There, the two highlighted heightened concerns that criminal illegal immigrant offenders are roaming free inside the United States, including over 425,000 who have reportedly been convicted of a crime, more than 13,000 who have been convicted of homicide and more than 15,000 who have been convicted of sexual assault, according to a letter Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner penned to Texas Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales.

Del Cueto, commenting on the ongoing southern border crisis that continues to affect communities nationwide, warned viewers of what would come if current immigration policies continue.

""If we have four more years of this, I do not believe we'll ever recuperate. It's going to be devastating, and we will not recuperate in this country for many, many decades to come,"" he said.

""And certainly we will never recuperate within our own lifetime.""

The Biden-Harris administration has come under scrutiny over the past four years for allegedly perpetuating the crisis with reluctance to enact tougher border restrictions.

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

Illegal immigration has also emerged as a central issue in the 2024 election, with Trump and his allies dinging Harris on her record as ""border czar"" multiple times, though the White House rejects the ""border czar"" narrative.

Harris has since toughened her stance on the border, calling for increased protections.

She recently urged the need for a ""comprehensive plan"" to mitigate the problem, telling MSNBC, ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

Harris also made her visit to the border town of Douglas, Arizona, which came under scrutiny as an alleged ""photo op"" by some Republicans.

When previously reached for comment over criticism about her border visit, the Harris campaign pointed Fox News Digital to a statement on her visit that said Harris will ""outline her plan to deliver real solutions on border security and the fentanyl crisis - unlike Donald Trump, who did nothing to fix our broken immigration system, made things worse, and killed bipartisan border solutions to play politics.""

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August earlier this month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey earlier this month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

443,DOJ charges Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's former Florida primary opponent with threatening to kill political rival,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-charges-rep-anna-paulina-lunas-former-florida-primary-opponent-threatening-kill-political-rival,2024-09-29T16:11:46Z,"Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., says Americans want a leader like former President Trump on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

The Justice Department charged a former primary opponent of Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., with threatening to send a ""Russian-Ukrainian hit squad"" to kill his political rival.

William Robert Braddock III, 41, of St. Petersburg, Florida, was charged with threatening to kill his primary opponent in the 2021 election for the 13th Congressional District of Florida, and a private citizen and acquaintance of his opponent, the Justice Department announced Friday. The indictment, unsealed in the Middle District of Florida on Thursday, describes the targeted individuals as only ""Victim 1"" and ""Victim 2.""

On June 8, 2021, prosecutors say Braddock allegedly made several threats to injure and kill his primary opponent during a phone call with the second victim, specifically stating that he would ""call up my Russian-Ukrainian hit squad"" to make the rival candidate disappear. The DOJ said Braddock left the United States after making the alleged threats and was later found to be residing in the Philippines.

Braddock was recently deported from the Philippines to the United States and made his first court appearance in Los Angeles on Thursday.

DEM OPERATIVE FISHED FOR OPPO RESEARCH IN ANTISEMITIC, LEWD TEXT MESSAGES, HOUSE REPUBLICAN CHARGES

Luna, an Air Force veteran and former media consultant, was not named in the indictment. While she was running for Congress, however, Luna contended in 2021 civil court documents that Braddock, a fellow GOP challenger and former Marine, was stalking her and wanted her dead.

A judge granted Luna and a conservative activist and friend of hers, Erin Olszewski, a temporary restraining order against Braddock. He subsequently dropped out of the race, denying the allegations and citing publicity from the case.

Politico reported at the time that Olszewski had secretly recorded a phone call with Braddock in which he said an alleged ""Russian and Ukrainian hit squad"" could kill Luna within 24 hours. ""Luna's going to go down and I hope it's by herself,"" Braddock allegedly said in the recording, according to Politico, which said it had obtained the recording in June 2021. ""For the better or the good of the majority of the people, we've got to sacrifice the few.""

In court proceedings regarding whether the restraining order would be made permanent, Luna, who was endorsed by former President Trump twice, testified that she had only brief in-person contact with Braddock at a political event, but heard from several acquaintances that he was allegedly making threats to have her killed.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA TO FORCE VOTE ON GARLAND'S ARREST THIS WEEK AFTER DOJ REFUSES CRIMINAL REFERRAL

""Mr. Braddock clearly hated my guts and wanted to hurt me,"" Luna said in court, according to The Associated Press. ""I started getting very afraid of him. It was horrifying, and it still is.""

""I think he's an evil person,"" she said in September 2021. ""I think he has definitely emotionally terrorized me.""

Olszewski testified that she secretly recorded a phone call she initiated with Braddock in which he allegedly claimed the purported Russian-Ukrainian hit squad would respond quickly if he made a single phone call - and also allegedly made veiled threats against her three children if she repeated what he said. Olszewski said she shared the contents of the Braddock call she recorded on an iPad with Luna, and both women called police.

In the new indictment unsealed last week, Braddock is charged with one count of interstate transmission of a true threat to injure another person.

He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said.

The case was brought in relation to the Justice Department's Election Threats Task Force, which was announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2021 to address violent threats against election workers.

Fox News Digital reached out to Luna's office for comment on Sunday but did not immediately hear back. A spokesperson for the GOP congresswoman declined to comment to NBC News about the indictment but said Luna has ""faced a growing number of death threats"" in the last month, signaling a ""broader and more disturbing issue of violence in the political arena."""

The Trump campaign's social media account pushed back on ""Saturday Night Live"" (SNL) on Saturday after the season premiere featured a skit about assassination attempts against former President Trump.

James Austin Johnson played Trump in the cold open and referenced the first assassination attempt that occurred July 13 in Butler, Pa., as he depicted the former president at one of his rallies.

""Where the hell is everyone going? Where are you going? I see you trying to leave, but the doors are locked. Come on back -- we're having fun. We love my rallies, except when someone does the 'bing, bong, bing, bing, bing' right at me. You know that happened because of the rhetoric of the radical left? They say that me blaming the Democrats for inciting violence is the pot calling the kettle black,"" Johnson said.

The Trump campaign posted to social media, ""There were two assassination attempts against President Trump within a span of seven weeks. @nbcsnl apparently finds that funny. Disgusting.""

""SNL"" referenced the assassination attempts during the ""Weekend Update"" segment as well, during which Colin Jost quipped that he was ""starting to worry that bullet got a little more than just the ear,"" after playing a clip of Trump saying he had a better ""body"" than President Biden at a recent rally.

Jost brought it up again after, noting former first lady Melania Trump's recent interview.

""Speaking of, Melania Trump gave a rare TV interview this week in which she blamed Democrats for creating conditions that led to Trump's assassination attempts, which is ridiculous. When Democrats want to take out a presidential candidate, they get the job done,"" Jost said.

Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt against him at a Butler, Pa., rally in July. A bullet grazed the president's ear and the shooter killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore -- a husband, father and former fire chief at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also critically wounded two other rally-goers.

On Sept. 15, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested after allegedly pushing the muzzle of an AK-47 through the chainlink fence outside of where Trump was golfing in Florida.

445,Is Iran's new president presenting a moderating image to lure the West back into a nuclear deal?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/weekend-has-irans-new-president-shown-any-sign-moderation,2024-09-29T15:44:45Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran's new president, Massoud Pezeshkian, traveled to the U.S. last week to present a moderate, rational face of the regime to the world.

He claimed in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) that Iran did not want to be a source of instability in the Middle East, and only wanted peace. The president spoke of a ""new era of cooperation"" with the West and made an overture to engage in nuclear talks.

He scored a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of UNGA.

His new government appears eager to improve its relations with European countries. U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi said after meeting with Iran's foreign minister that he saw an openness from Iran to have meaningful discussions on its nuclear program.

But is it all for show, or is Pezeshkian steering Iran on a path to peace?

Experts say Iran is sending Pezeshkian out to project a moderate front on the global stage - but behind the scenes he holds little power. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini pulls all the strings.

""[Pezeshkian] is a moderate by the standards of Iran... and the fact that the supreme leader let him run and win signals they want a different relationship with the West,"" Ambassador James Jeffrey, who led U.S. diplomacy in countries across the Middle East in the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, told Fox News Digital.

Iran's last president, Ebrahim Raisi, a member of the conservative popular Front party, died in a helicopter crash on May 19. Pezeshkian, an independent, was elected in July.

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDDLE EAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN A 'BLESSING AND A CURSE'

""Economically, they're in dire straits, despite the fact we're not enforcing our sanctions on exporting several millions of barrels of oil a day. He's been tasked to fix this by calming things with Western states. The problem is he's not the real leader of Iran.""

Pezeshkian's visit to the U.S. came as former President Trump revealed he'd been briefed about Iranian plots to kill him after Iran hacked information from his campaign and tried to peddle it to Democrats and the media.

Earlier in the month it was confirmed that Iran shipped ballistic missiles to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine.

While Iran has long looked to re-engage on a nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), it's now closer than ever to a nuclear weapon. The nation is enriching uranium at 60% - close to the 90% threshold it needs for a weapon - and reports suggest renewed activity at two nuclear weapon test sites - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

""Iran can't really reverse some of its knowledge that it's gained by working with advanced centrifuges and higher levels of enrichment,"" said Nicole Grajewski, Iran nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Still, Iran is sure to try to lure the U.S. into lifting sanctions and pursuing diplomatic negotiations.

""We went into this logic hook, line and sinker... in the Obama, and to some degree in the Trump administration, until [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo took over in mid-2018. We allow these guys to eat our lunch all over the region - in Yemen, in Lebanon and Iraq and Syria.""

""A new president will be tempted in Harris or Trump to try to do a deal with the Iranians, because nobody wants them to get a nuclear weapon, and nobody wants to go to war,"" said Jeffrey, who now chairs the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center.

""Pezeshkian might be able to advance and put a smiley face on the Iranian offer, just like the 2015 offer, but it will be one-sided.""

WHITE HOUSE DECLINES TO SAY IF KILLING TRUMP WOULD BE AN 'ACT OF WAR'

Vice President Kamala Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

It's not clear how actively Trump would pursue a deal with Tehran. Just one day apart, Trump said he would threaten to blow Iran ""to smithereens"" and would be open to negotiating a nuclear deal.

""As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of, and they may or may not involve - but possibly do - Iran,"" Trump said at a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday.

""If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, in this case Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens,"" he added.

But speaking to reporters Thursday in New York City, he said talks are necessary because of the threat of a nuclear Iran.

""Sure, I would do that,"" the former president said when asked if he would make a deal with Iran. ""We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.""

""Trump certainly scares the Iranians more, because he's unpredictable, but I think one way Trump is predictable is he will not be able to pass up the opportunity to negotiate a deal. It's what he loves to do. It's sort of how he brands himself,"" said Jonathan Ruhe, director of Foreign Policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA).

""The same thing always happens - we come in and say, 'You know, Iran, you better negotiate in good faith this time. We really mean it.' And then Iran drags out the talks, continues to expand its nuclear program and basically buys time for them to get closer to the bomb."""
446,Residents in key North Carolina district reveal how they think their county will vote in November,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/residents-key-north-carolina-district-reveal-how-think-county-vote-november,2024-09-29T15:15:43Z,"Wake County, N.C. - Residents in a key North Carolina district revealed what they are hearing on the ground in the battleground state from both Republican and Democratic parties just weeks before the 2024 presidential election.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents in Wake County, North Carolina, a highly populated district that could decide how the state votes in the presidential election. The district voted for the Democratic nominee in the past four presidential elections, but voted Republican in both 2004 and 2000.

Upon speaking with voters, it appeared they were approached through phone calls and text messages more by whichever party they were registered with, but overall, each resident recalled receiving some form of outreach from a political campaign this cycle.

Cameron Wilson, a senior at North Carolina State University, said he believes the Harris campaign has a stronger presence in Raleigh, North Carolina, but added that ""among the college students, Trump is definitely kicking her a--.""

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND TO HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

Asked how they think their district will vote in November, the residents were torn, but most said they expect it to vote for the Democratic candidate.

""I'm gonna go leans blue, but definitely not the same margin as the last election,"" Wilson said of the district's vote.

""I think around here, with Chapel Hill, Duke, and NC State, not as liberal. But I'd say its probably leaning more one way than the other,"" Zack Karagias told Fox News Digital. ""I think Kamala is gonna tax the hell out of us. I think Trump's gonna try and help us.""

Another individual, Julia, said that ""based on all my friends and all my peers, definitely Democratic, but it is hard.""

Republicans and Democrats have been campaigning heavily to get out the vote in North Carolina, a historical battleground state. Fox News Digital interviewed the Republican and Democratic parties in North Carolina, with both saying that they expect to reach over a million voters through get-out-the-vote efforts such as canvassing, phone calls and text messaging.

""I've been getting a ton of texts on a daily basis, automated messages to vote for Trump,"" a resident, Evan Davis, said. ""It's nonstop.""

""I've signed up for some emails for Trump, but that's about it,"" Karagias said.

""I saw a bunch of Mark Robinson signs all up through here the other day, but then I saw a few Kamala ones."" Wilson added. He said most messages are from the Trump campaign, but that he still gets ""some of the left-leaning stuff.""

""I've been getting some text messaging from Kamala Harris herself. And I haven't gotten any more phone calls yet,"" Julia Smith told Fox.

""It's hard to say,"" she said when asked about which campaign appears to have a stronger presence in the district. ""What I consume is more Democratic.""

447,"Gen Z men pour into church pews more often than women, flipping the trend on faith: 'What's the Lord doing?'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/gen-z-men-pour-church-pews-women-flipping-trend-faith-lord-doing,2024-09-29T12:05:16Z,"'Fire and Freedom' podcast host Caroline Joyous joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' with her take on a survey showing a growing number of Americans are 'religiously unaffiliated.'

The larger-than-usual supply of young men seated in the pews at Grace Church in Waco, Texas, might be a little surprising to some, especially as reports swirl that Gen Z's faith is dwindling, leaving religious leaders to figure out what to do to bring youngsters back into the fold.

A piece recently published in The New York Times offered a glimpse inside the church - a Southern Baptist congregation - where four of the five musicians on stage and the majority of the college students seated in the pews were young men.

The scene depicts an emerging trend, the piece says: ""For the first time in modern American history, young men are now more religious than their female peers. They attend services more often and are more likely to identify as religious.""

Compare that to the number of young women reportedly leaving in droves.

OPINION: I WENT BACK TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY. HERE'S WHY WE SHOULD ALL CONSIDER GETTING BACK TO RELIGION

Earlier this year, the Survey Center on American Life reported much of the same. Men had, for ages, been the group considered less religiously affiliated.

""A new survey reveals that the pattern has now reversed,"" a post on the site read.

Though the trend of men leaving religion more often than women was true for older age groups like baby boomers, Gen Z flipped the trend.

""Fifty-four percent of Gen Z adults who left their formative religion are women; 46 percent are men,"" it read, adding possible explanations like the larger number of feminists and the focus on equality among Zoomers, which could translate into suspicion of more traditional values or settings (such as churches) where they might be touted.

The Times made a similar case, pointing to the time period in which these women came of age - the #MeToo movement that homed in on sexual abuse and harassment, additionally inspiring people to come forward to raise awareness about church abuse as well.

CHRISTIAN GROUPS SEE NEED IN CHANGING APPROACH TO DEAL WITH HISTORIC DECLINE IN AMERICANS' CHURCH ATTENDANCE

Phil Barnes, a pastor at the Hope Church congregation, marveled at the number of young men present, however, wondering what their purpose might be.

""We've been talking about it from the beginning,"" he said in the NYT piece.

""What's the Lord doing? Why is he sending us all of these young men?""

GROWING NUMBER OF GEN Z MEN SUPPORTING TRUMP REPRESENTS 'ONGOING CULTURE SHOCK' IN US POLITICS, VOTER SAYS

One 28-year-old member of the congregation spoke about how grateful he was to be there as he was baptized.

The Times also added that, when Grace Church opened a ""small outpost"" in a nearby town last year, the majority of young attendees - 12 out of 16 - were men.

But the divide between Gen Z men and Gen Z women doesn't end with faith.

Gen Z men are more likely to consider themselves ""conservative"" while Gen Z women are more likely to call themselves ""liberal.""

The same shows up in a New York Times/Siena poll from August, indicating that young male voters across six swing states favored Trump by 13 points while young women favored Harris by 38 points."

As 2024 looms on the horizon, an unprecedented 41 million Gen Z individuals are gearing up to cast their votes -- a transformative wave, with eight million fresh voices since the last election set to shape the political landscape like never before.

With this backdrop of change, the question arises: where do young, socially-conscious, and technologically fluent voters find themselves in a political arena often divided by rigid bipartisan lines?

One issue might keep a number of these would-be voters at home this November, one Zoomer says.

""Something I did want to touch on was the avoidance of this election and getting involved from our generation because of the Israel-Hamas war,"" Claudia Conway, daughter of former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, said on the latest episode of Fox Nation's ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne.""

GEN Z INFLUENCERS RAVE ABOUT TRUMP VP PICK JD VANCE: 'HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN OVER MY GENERATION'

""A lot of people don't like Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and Joe Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.""

Gen Z-aged anti-Israel protesters rally in groups, many of them angry with the Biden-Harris administration for how they have handled the conflict.

At the same time, such progressive mentalities steer clear of Trump.

To peel back the layers of Gen Z's political discontent, Kellyanne Conway invited Claudia for an eye-opening conversation to discuss the generation that's breaking the mold.

In the latest episode, Claudia shared her own disillusionment with what both Trump and Harris have to offer.

""I think that we have a very binary view of politics just as a whole in our society,"" she said.

GEN Z VOTERS URGE REPUBLICANS NOT TO 'SLEEP ON' THE YOUNG VOTE: 'WE'RE STILL UP FOR THE PICKINGS'

""I think when I always talk about the political spectrum, [I talk about] the extremes on both sides. That's why I'm a registered Independent, because I'm told if you don't fit X, Y and Z, you can't be a Republican. If you don't fit X, Y and Z, you can't be a Democrat. And I don't believe in that. I don't think things are black and white, and these choices should not be binary.""

According to Claudia, she is far from the only Gen Z voter who feels this way, and it's evident by the number of students participating in protests on college campuses across the nation.

But her political independence varies sharply from her mother, who once served during the Trump administration and remains a Harris critic.

Still, they agree that love is more valuable than politics.

""I can look at you and love you even though you have a different political opinion than I do, and we can be humans at the end of the day. The divisiveness and lack of unity in our political atmosphere right now is what is going to drive us further apart,"" Claudia warned.

""And we always talk about the fall of our democracy, the fall of our nation... that is the fall of our nation. By furthering the gap between Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals, we are creating that divide ourselves.""

This week's episode also introduces viewers to Alabama teen Brilyn Hollyhand, who has already found his political home among the two parties and is advising the RNC on how to beat Kamala Harris.

""I don't think we have to fit neatly [into either party] as Gen Z, but I think that it's time to go off the sidelines. Time to get involved,"" Hollyhand said."

During September's presidential debate, Harris said, ""World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you, and they say you're a disgrace.""

When asked about this quote, foreign ministers in attendance at the United Nations High-Level Week stressed they have no view one way or the other on the U.S. election and will work with whomever wins.

""We are friends of America,"" Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said, noting Italy and the U.S. are ""two sides of the same coin."" ""If Trump will be the new president of America, we will work with him as we worked with him when he was president of America.""

Foreign ministers of Lithuania and the Czech Republic stressed that they will not interfere in the election by stating a preference, instead saying they ""leave it to the American citizens to decide.""

""My role is not to comment on such a political statement,"" Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said.

However, Lipavsky praised Trump's ""strong"" message of defense spending, which he hoped Europe would continue to embrace in the face of Russian aggression against Ukraine.

""The point is that Donald Trump had, at his time, one strong message for Europe, and that message was quite resonating and is resonating more now because he was saying spend more on your defense,"" Lipavsky said.

""My government is spending more on our defense,"" he added. ""We want to reach those 2% of GDP, will be reaching them this year, and we will continue next year. So, (if) Donald Trump would be a president with this message, 'Please spend 2%,"" we would be OK.""

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis highlighted the ""very long history"" between the two countries, saying that the relationship is ""more than politics.""

Instead, he reiterated the message that whoever wins the election will need to focus on the same message of defense spending that Trump pushed during his first administration.

Prior to the Trump administration, only a few members of NATO had upheld their commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defense, but that number rose sharply due to Trump's insistence and hard-line stance over the issue.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in June reported that 23 of the 32 member states have hit the minimum spending requirement, which helped improve the bloc's ability to support Ukraine and, potentially, deter Russian aggression beyond its current ambitions.

No European nation, though, has touted the success of Trump's first term and expressed hopes for a strong second term as has Hungary. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó revealed his government would have ""huge expectations"" for a new Trump administration.

""We have huge expectations because we do believe that many of the major crises which give us a lot of concern can be resolved by an administration of President Trump,"" Szijjártó said, noting he speaks as the longest-serving foreign minister in NATO with 10 years under his belt.

HUNGARIAN FM RECALLS STRONG TRUMP ADMIN 'EXPERIENCE,' CLAIMS 'OUR HOPE IS ALL' ON FORMER PRESIDENT

""I didn't really see anyone laughing at Trump,"" Szijjártó said. ""What I've seen many having fear. I've seen many being afraid of a U.S. president being honest, not a hostage by the liberal mainstream, representing a patriotic position, speaking clearly about America first.""

Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have done little to hide their rosy friendship, with Trump invoking the Hungarian leader as a ""strong man of Europe"" who speaks well of the former president.

Orbán proved this is a mutual dynamic when he chose to leave the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., earlier this year to instead meet with Trump in Mar-a-Lago in Florida to discuss foreign relations.

""Under President Trump, everything was under control,"" Szijjártó said. ""Since President Trump has left office, the whole global security situation is deteriorating. So, I mean, these are experiences.""

""If we base it on our experience, we say yes, from a perspective of U.S.-Hungary relations, I think President Trump would bring another impetus, freshness, dynamism to this relationship.

Pennsylvania Republican leaders said they are optimistic about their chances to make the Keystone State the one that puts former President Donald Trump over the finish line, while a top Democrat suggested otherwise, laying out how his party is on a path to victory.

State Sen. Cris Dush, a Brookville Republican, who noted he represents seven of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, was asked about the one big blue swath in his district - Centre County, home to Penn State University.

Dush's district covers all-or-parts-of Jefferson, Elk, Cameron, Centre, Clinton, McKean and Potter counties in Pennsylvania's lush northwestern forests.

With Republican activist Scott Presler targeting Centre as part of his statewide GOP voter registration push, Dush said the prospect of flipping Centre County is ""actually getting very exciting.""

Dush noted neighboring Clinton County, home to Lock Haven, was solidly Democratic until the Trump era. ""They just went over 3-to-1 Republican.""

CRISS-CROSSING PA TO REGISTER VOTERS, SCOTT PRESLER SAYS HE'S MOVING THE NEEDLE TO FLIP KEY COUNTIES RED

""This is a massive shift that's coming in rural Pennsylvania... and part of it is that my working class, middle-age and senior constituents are seeing what's happening to their jobs and with inflation and this craziness,"" he said.

""With a man now being able to be called a woman: that kind of stuff too. They've just finally had enough.""

At a recent fair in his district, Dush said he was heckled by a young Democrat while speaking to a crowd that included many Gen-Z people. Instead of engaging, he told the crowd the reason the man was upset was that he is one of many who cannot afford to own a home, a car or other ""American Dream"" mainstays.

""And I'm getting applause from the kids,"" he remarked.

In several of Dush's redder counties, Democrats like Sen. John Fetterman performed better than most last cycle - while GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz still won the areas outright.

In that regard, Dush was asked if that was an aberration or if the areas are truly trending toward the Democrats.

""The fact that they're putting such restrictions on the development of businesses in the northern tier and western Pennsylvania: There's not a state in the United States that doesn't have a Steelers bar in it, and that's because working-class kids have become our best export. I want them back,"" he said.

Since then, the area has been through several years of transition after the mills and some shopping districts closed. Slowly, it has regained some footing as a warehousing hub, with its vicinity to New York and Philadelphia.

State Sen. Jarrett Coleman, R-Parkland, represents the western half of the Valley, centered around Lehigh County - where Republicans have come within a razor's edge several times of flipping the congressional seat currently held by Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa.

For many years, the seat was held by anti-Trump moderate Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., and before that, then-Rep. Pat Toomey, and before him, moderate Democrats.

Coleman said he predicts a good year for Republicans in Lehigh County, noting how neighboring Bucks County - part of which he also represents - flipped to majority-GOP registrants through the work of people like Presler.

The economy is a major issue in the district, he noted, as Fox News Digital discussed its industrial past.

""I think that's because I believe the GOP has done a better job connecting with folks over those kitchen table issues,"" Coleman said.

""The one that's kind of come up a lot lately has been homeownership,"" he said.

He noted Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed assistance for homebuyers, while at the same time floating taxation on unrealized gains.

""So on one hand, she'll help you buy the house, and of course, that will just be [via] tax dollars to help subsidize the down payment... then the administration will tax you out of [it] as the house grows in value.""

""That's not a solution. That's another example of the government creating a problem and then trying to swoop in and say they've saved the day.""

In a statement, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella added that the GOP is ""on offense in Pennsylvania.""

""The Keystone State is a deep GOP well of flippable seats and ground zero to grow our House majority,"" he said, adding several vulnerable Democrats running for re-election do not speak truthfully of their records on the border, inflation and crime.

While he believes Philadelphia and Pittsburgh will ""play well"" for Harris, Coleman said he has never seen such enthusiasm for the GOP ticket in areas like the Lehigh Valley and key mid-state areas.

""Can the rural vote come back, and can we make up for the votes of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh -- and will there be enough folks in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia who are waking up? But I think it's going to be a question of whether everywhere else can get motivated enough.""

One man who believed otherwise is Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street.

Street, a state senator and son of popular former Philadelphia Mayor John Street, suggested Democrats are the ones whose ground game has been unmatched.

""We've had over 40,000 volunteers signed up since Kamala became our nominee for president. Vice President Harris has inspired people. We've had we've had people knocking on doors, canvass launches, over 50 offices opened [in PA],"" Street said.

""People are just super excited about supporting Vice President Harris. So yeah, we're seeing lots of energy, lots of engagement, and the vice president has sort of set the world on fire,"" he quipped.

When asked about the candidates appearing to focus in recent weeks on key areas of the state, Street said Harris has been all over the Commonwealth.

When asked about both candidates frequenting Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Street noted there is a key congressional race there between Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., and Republican Rob Bresnahan.

""It's also hometown territory for Senator Casey,"" he added.

When asked about Republicans claiming they are making inroads in Centre, Bucks, Luzerne and the Lehigh Valley, Street said he has not seen such evidence.

He noted that in Centre - the Penn State county - Democrats added a second state representative in Paul Takac, and that Northampton County is now as Democratically-controlled as its bluer-counterpart, Lehigh.

However, Street said that shift may not be because there are more Democrats in those areas, but because the Republicans have departed from their longtime moderation.

He contrasted Trump-type politicians with past Republicans who have performed well statewide, like Sen. Arlen Specter and Gov. Tom Ridge.

Pennsylvanians of both stripes also largely supported moderate Democratic Govs. Ed Rendell and Robert Casey - the incumbent U.S. senator's father, he said.

""Our Republicans and Democrats statewide have never been that far apart from each other. Democrats are still pretty much where we always were,"" Street said.

451,"Trump, Harris blasted for ignoring exploding budget deficit, as economists plead with both to 'get real'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-blasted-ignoring-exploding-budget-deficit-economists-plead-both-get-real,2024-09-29T08:13:48Z,"Vice President Harris discusses her tax plan with MSNBC host noting how she rarely directly answers questions.

Economists told Fox News Digital that the economic proposals former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have put forward would continue to increase the nation's already ballooning budget deficit, noting that neither candidate seems particularly concerned with fiscal responsibility.

Neither Trump nor Harris has released dedicated policy plans for addressing the nation's deficit. Trump's 16-point policy plan on his website mentions the word ""deficit"" once.

Meanwhile, Harris' economic platform does mention the deficit several times and says Harris is ""committed"" to fiscal responsibility, but only suggests increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations as a solution.

""I think the reason neither candidate is really talking about fiscal responsibility is because neither candidate is fiscally responsible,"" said Tax Foundation senior economist Erica York. ""Both have left a lot of details unspecified, so there's questions still about how Harris's spending policies would stack up. Would Trump really repeal all of the green energy tax credits? Would he really impose all of the tariffs he's promised?""

When asked what message York had for Trump and Harris when it comes to the deficit, she told them to ""get real.""

HARRIS CALLS TRUMP 'ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSERS EVER' DURING ECONOMY SPEECH IN KEY BATTLEGROUND

""We face several challenges on the fiscal policy front, from debt and deficits to the need to compete with China, to the need to encourage entrepreneurship and work, and neither of the tax policy visions being outlined right now really come close to providing an answer to those challenges,"" York said.

Meanwhile, Kimberly Clausing, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, echoed York's concerns, adding that she ""does not think there's been enough attention on the deficit this campaign season.""

""I don't know whether to blame the candidates or the American attention span,"" Clausing said. ""Candidates have an incentive to cater to what the population wants to listen to, but there doesn't seem to be a big drumbeat in favor of fiscal responsibility. And that's a big contrast from some prior elections in at least my lifetime, where that issue was much more prominent.""

So far, in fiscal year 2024, the government is running a cumulative deficit of $1.9 trillion, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center's ""Deficit Tracker.""

Revenues, meanwhile, have increased 11% through last month. The revenue increase, according to the deficit tracker, is largely the result of an increase in individual and corporate taxes, higher interest rates and a 20% decrease in individual income tax refunds. Trump's economic proposals include extending tax cuts, reducing the corporate tax rate and exempting tips, overtime pay and social security benefits from one's taxable income. Despite his plan to generate revenue through tariffs and repealing green energy tax credits, economists say it will not be enough to balance out the lost revenues from Trump's tax cuts and other economic proposals.

Research from the Tax Foundation, a tax policy nonprofit in the nation's capital, estimated that Trump's deficit impact would be roughly a $4 trillion increase over ten years.

TRUMP, HARRIS SPENDING PLANS COULD WEIGH ON THE US ECONOMY, ANALYSIS SHOWS

However, according to Heritage Foundation economist Richard Stern, it is government spending and not tax cuts that are the real culprit when it comes to the ballooning deficit.

""Though tax cuts can increase the deficit, it returns that money to the people that earned it. Deficit increases from more spending, on the other hand, means that the government is stealing even more and suppressing growth even more intensely,"" Stern said. ""Deficits created by way of tax cuts and spending increases are not the same. Tax cuts grow the economy and shrink deficits as a share of the economy, whereas more spending strangles the economy and stunts growth.""

The Biden-Harris administration's fiscal year 2024 budget proposed the highest sustained levels of spending in U.S. history, according to Republicans on the House Budget Committee. The committee also pointed out that the administration's plan to add $82.2 trillion in spending over ten years, is 18% more than the historical average of the past half century.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold. She has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

Overall, the Tax Foundation calculated that Harris would grow the deficit by roughly $1.5 trillion over ten years.

BIDEN PLEDGES $7.3B IN 'CLEAN ENERGY' SPENDING WITH NATIONAL DEBT AT $35T

Among the deleterious downstream effects of an ever-growing deficit, according to Clausing, are increased interest rates and reduced creditworthiness for the country, which can be problematic at a time when global tensions are on edge.

""If a new crisis comes along, whether it's a pandemic or a national security crisis or a big recession, which are sometimes caused by things beyond our control. You know, those kinds of crises are really difficult to respond to without fiscal space,"" Clausing said. ""If you're starting from a point where you're kind of maxing out the credit card, it's a little harder to respond to these emergencies.""

Currently, China and Japan are the United States' two largest foreign creditors.

When reached by Fox News Digital, the Harris campaign declined to comment.

The vice president was endorsed this week by more than 400 left-leaning economists and former policymakers who served under Democrats. Additionally, Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist with the New York Times, insisted this week that Harris will be able to get much closer to balancing the national budget than Trump.

When it comes to the electorate, voters have usually told pollsters they have more confidence in Trump than Harris when it comes to the economy, but reports have indicated Harris is gaining some of that ground back more recently. Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only five points in a recent Fox News poll, and just two points in an AP/NORC survey.

""Dangerously Liberal Kamala Harris' budget would add $17 trillion to the national debt by 2034 and also includes a $4.9 trillion tax hike -- the largest in history -- which would cost every American family nearly $40,000 per year, on top of the costs of record-high inflation,"" Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. ""Thanks to Kamalanomics, families are already struggling to afford gas and groceries, and President Trump will continue to highlight how Harris' budget will compound these difficulties on hardworking Americans."""

In an exclusive OutKick interview with Clay Travis, Trump highlighted the ""energy"" from the Alabama vs. Georgia game on Saturday night.

When asked about his appeal with the younger voter demographic, Trump said that his campaign was ""way up.""

""We're way up with young people. It's an honor. They're very smart. And she [Kamala Harris] berated them, saying that 'they aren't smart' and, I'll be honest, they're a lot smarter than her,"" he said.

""There has never been energy like there is now. And I guess it's me, but it's also when they look at our country and what has happened. Our country is going bad, and it's in a very dangerous place right now. But we love our country, and we're going to make it great again.

The changes to the NFL's kickoff caught Trump's attention, with the Republican nominee praising college football with sticking with the previous rules.

""Big time college football is as big as the NFL,"" he said. ""I don't know what they're doing with the kickoff return in the NFL. And I don't want to get involved in controversy, of course, but it looks so bad.

""And I noticed that they hadn't' done that in college, and they shouldn't do it,"" he said. ""And I think the NFL should go back. And maybe it is a little bit more dangerous, but I doubt that it's any more dangerous. It's football.""

""I think they made a terrible mistake in doing that,"" he said.

Trump turned his attention to Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, who attended Saturday's game between Minnesota and Michigan in Ann Arbor.

""He got booed out of the stadium,"" he said. ""And you saw the hand that we got - it was a little bit different.""

The game everyone had circled on their calendars lived up to the hype, and some.

Saturday's Alabama-Georgia contest was a rematch of last season's SEC title game, which Bama won as the eighth-ranked team in the country - Georgia had been ranked No. 1 after winning 42 of their previous 43 games, but Bama's victory propelled them into the College Football Playoff, and knocked Georgia out.

Well, it was simply epic.

After squandering their own four-touchdown lead, No. 4 Alabama scored a late touchdown to come away with a 41-34 win over No. 2 Georgia in an instant classic.

Alabama scored four touchdowns in the first 18 minutes of the game to take a commanding 28-0 lead, but Georgia fought all the way back. Trailing 33-15, Georgia found the end zone when they desperately needed it, but failed the two-point attempt. However, after forcing a punt, the Bulldogs scored again, and all of a sudden, Bama's lead shrunk to just four points. Georgia then forced another punt, all while Bama did not waste the clock, getting the ball back for a shot at the lead with 2:42 to go and all their timeouts.

Well, it only took one play for Georgia to take the lead, as Carson Beck found Dillon Bell for a 67-yard score to go up, 34-33. Beck's rush on the two-point conversion was short, but nonetheless, the comeback was complete, and Bama, who had dominated early, suddenly was in desperation mode.

No worries - it was the 17-year-old, Ryan Williams, who took a 75-yard pass from Jalen Milroe to the house, and after a successful two-point conversion, Bama was back up seven points.

The Bulldogs faced a 4th and 2 with 1:22 to go at the Bama 47, and Beck found Colbie Young for the first down, and three plays later, the Bulldogs were in the red zone. But, Beck was intercepted after going in the end zone, and with the touchback, Bama was able to knee out the clock to get the victory.

Georgia finally scored a touchdown midway through the second quarter. However, Beck was called for an intentional grounding in his own end zone, resulting in a safety later on. But apparently, despite trailing 30-7, all Georgia needed was halftime.

Beck found Arian Smith for a 12-yard touchdown for the first score of the third quarter. They took a big risk in going for two, but it was successful. A Bama field goal, though, made it a three-possession game late in the third. On Georgia's ensuing drive, Beck lost a fumble. But they weren't dead, and the comeback began on their next drive. However, they couldn't get a stop when they needed it most, and Beck's final turnover came at the worst time.

The game is Georgia's first loss of the season, and after losing just one in a 43-game stretch, they've now lost two in their last five. They are 45-3 in their last 48 games, but all three losses have come to Alabama (although, one of those victories is the national championship in 2022 against the Crimson Tide). Bama, meanwhile, improved to 4-0.

Milroe finished with 373 yards on 27-for-33 passing, throwing two touchdowns and running for another two. The 17-year-old Williams made sx catches for 177 yards and a touchdown. Beck turned the ball over four times, but still managed to throw for 439 yards. Smith went for 132 yards, while Bell added 100.

The game was also headlined by Donald Trump's appearance. The former president, and current Republican nominee, received an ovation from fans while walking in the halls and when he was shown on the jumbotron.

Vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance missed out on a Pittsburgh culinary landmark after he was apparently kicked out from meeting with supporters inside -- despite the same restaurant chain allowing the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign to meet its supporters there.

A source familiar with the campaign told Fox News Digital that when the vice presidential campaign stopped by Primanti Bros.

The source noted that Primanti Bros. management was aware that the Trump-Vance campaign was planning on stopping by.

An employee told the campaign that this was ""not a campaign stop"" and that ""JD's not allowed in,"" the source said, adding that the manager threatened to call the police if they didn't leave.

Trump-Vance supporters shot back, booing the employees as they were ushered to the exit, the source said.

Despite the Vance campaign being kicked out of the local establishment on Saturday, the campaign met with supporters outside the restaurant.

Former President Trump campaigned in the Wisconsin town of Prairie du Chien on Saturday, making migrant crime a core part of his speech after a rape suspect was arrested in the small, rural community.

The rally, which was supposed to take place outside, but was moved indoors due to a Secret Service staffing shortage, focused on migrant crime. During the speech, Trump referenced the arrest of assault suspect Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, 26, who is an alleged member of Venezuela's violent Tren de Aragua migrant gang.

Earlier this month, Zarate was charged with sexual assault, battery, strangulation and suffocation, in addition to false imprisonment, child abuse and disorderly conduct, according to WXOW.

The suspect, who is accused of sexually assaulting a mother and abusing her daughter ""under particularly brutal circumstances,"" was arrested in Prairie du Chien on Sept. 6.

This vile monster was charged with holding a mother and daughter captive against their will and sexually assaulting them again and again and again.""

The Republican presidential candidate also took aim at his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been criticized for her border policies.

""This animal crossed Kamala's wide open border, along with hundreds of thousands of others that are worse than him, that are worse than him,"" Trump continued. ""He was arrested and released in the sanctuary city of Minneapolis.""

""Why should a town of 5,500 people... be afraid of letting their kids play in their front yard?"" the politician said. ""It wasn't like this three years ago.""

A newly opened politics-themed bar in Washington, D.C., was forced to remove a GOP political symbol from its building after facing community backlash.

The bar, called ""Political Pattie's,"" reportedly angered some locals by featuring a GOP elephant, along with a Democratic donkey, as part of its logo painted on the front of the building. Locals attacked the bar on social media, saying a business with the GOP symbol wouldn't be welcome in an area surrounded by gay bars, according to The Washingtonian.

Just before its grand opening on Tuesday, ""Political Pattie's"" removed both party symbols, saying they realized the ""red elephant"" symbol ""was hurtful to the community.""

The co-owners said in the statement they intend to keep the bar's original name and repaint the word ""Political"" in larger blue letters ""to balance out"" the red door and window. They also defended the bar's bipartisan theme and said they had been unfairly judged by critics.

""Political Pattie's aims to be a fun, inclusive space that pokes fun at politics, not the pain politics often causes,"" the couple said.

Tammy Baldwin, and Secret Service staffing shortages forcing Trump to move his rally inside.

""NBC Nightly News"" was the only prime time network news program on Friday night to report on bombshell new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data revealing that over 400,000 illegals immigrants convicted of crimes are currently free in the United States.

Both ABC's ""World News Tonight,"" and the ""CBS Evening News"" failed to mention any of the findings that ICE presented in a letter to Congress this week that was reported by a variety of other outlets on Friday. They simply covered Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to Arizona's border with Mexico and touted her policy proposals for immigration.

Only NBC News' evening newscast mentioned the letter, though it didn't cover the entire scope of the findings - only reporting that ""more than 13,000 migrants previously convicted of homicide are currently free inside the U.S.""

Fox News Digital reported on Friday that ICE sent a letter to Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, and other members of Congress this week, showing that as of July 2024, there are 425,431 convicted criminal migrants - and 222,141 with pending criminal charges - who have crossed the U.S. southern border illegally and who are awaiting removal from the country.

According to the report, none of these criminal migrants are being held in detention, even those who have received their final orders of removal or those undergoing removal procedures.

Of these 425,431 convicted criminals, 62,231 have been convicted of assault, 14,301 convicted of burglary, 56,533 have drug convictions and 13,099 have been convicted of homicide. An additional 2,521 have kidnapping convictions and 15,811 have sexual assault convictions.

""NBC Nightly News"" briefly pointed out the existence of the letter and the more than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder still free in the country, though it did mention the nearly half a million other criminal migrants aren't currently detained in the U.S.

The other two networks failed to mention the bombshell findings in their prime time nightly news segments on Friday altogether.

ICE NON-DETAINED DOCKET EXPLODES TO 7.4M CASES

""CBS Evening News"" made no mention of the letter but focused on the dueling immigration rhetoric of the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns.

The network noted that Harris has ""promoted herself as tough on cross-border crime,"" and reported that ""foot traffic across the entire U.S.-Mexico border is down in recent months"" thanks to both Mexico's immigration crackdowns and the Biden-Harris' administration's policies.

ABC's ""World News Tonight"" took the same approach to covering the border issue, noting Harris' trip to Arizona this week and how she is trying to offer his vision of border security against former President Trump's.

The network reported that asylum restrictions enacted by the Biden-Harris administration in June has led to a ""drastic decrease in the encounters across the border."" It also noted Harris' border policy mantra that ""we can be a nation of laws and also a nation of immigrants.""

Trump slammed Harris' border policies following the release of ICE's data, telling supporters at a campaign event in Michigan on Friday, ""We're like a dumping ground. Non-citizens, convicted criminals from all over the world are right now at-large in the United States of America."""

Bird said the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) ""is involved in children's healthcare in Iowa and all around the country, and we want them to update their policies right now.""

""They say that puberty blockers are safe for kids and that it's reversible, and the science doesn't support that irreversible and causes permanent changes to children should they change their mind later,"" Bird, who joined a letter signed by 20 state attorneys general this week to the AAP, said.

Bird, along with AGs from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Utah, as well as the president of the Arizona Senate and the speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, signed the letter.

""That halt on what is fairly described as medical experimentation on children is long overdue - particularly since the majority of children initially diagnosed with gender dysphoria desist and 'grow out' of the condition by the time they are adolescents or adults,"" the letter reads. ""It is abusive to treat a child with biologically altering drugs that have an unknown physiological trajectory and end point. It is also inhumane to endorse such experimentation without a confident safety profile, especially if more times than not, it proves to be medically unnecessary.""

BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY

As procedures for transgender youth have become a hot button issue in the culture wars, it's an issue that former President Trump has vowed to address by restricting the accessibility of procedures to minors. Meanwhile, VP Kamala Harris' stance is unclear, but the Biden-Harris administration backtracked earlier this year and said it supports overturning bans on sex change surgeries for children.

According to unsealed documents published over the summer, health officials in the Biden administration successfully pressured the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) to omit the age limit in its guidelines for transgender surgical procedures for adolescents.

""I think there's a clear difference between the candidates,"" Bird said. ""And here is just another example of Vice President Harris blindly following the liberal, progressive party line. And here, President Trump has the science, he has the facts and is supportive of the science here.""

BIDEN OFFICIALS PUSHED TO DROP AGE LIMIT ON TRANS SURGERIES FOR MINORS: REPORT

Last year, the AAP recommitted its pledge to support ""gender-affirming care"" and expanded its guidelines for pediatricians to ""ensure young people get the reproductive and gender-affirming care they need and are seen, heard and valued as they are,"" AAP CEO Mark Del Monte said at the time.

AAP has published several reports on reaffirming transgender youth in their preferred gender identities.

Kennedy, Jr. reacts to the Trump-Harris ABC News Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: ABC News)

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. involved a rally audience in a call-and-response joke at his Michigan rally this week.

Kennedy spoke at the Falk Productions manufacturing facility in Walker, Michigan on Friday -- participating in a campaign event hosted by Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump.

During the rally, Kennedy mocked Vice President Kamala Harris for her frequent references to having been born in the ""middle class"" when asked to respond to a difficult question.

""All you have to know is seven words, and you never have to admit to doing anything wrong again,"" Kennedy told the Michigan audience. ""And you know what those seven words are? 'I was born in the middle class.'""

Kennedy instructed the rally-goers to repeat after him in a series of back-and-forths.

""The next time your boss asks you why you were late for work, what are you gonna say?"" Kennedy asked.

""I was born in the middle class!"" the audience responded.

""I was born in the middle class!"" the audience responded.

""That's all you have to know and you don't have to answer any questions!"" Kennedy joked.

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance also referenced the vice president's tendency to bring up her middle class roots during a rally earlier this week.

""They ask Kamala, of course, because she's the vice president and she is the reason why we have sky-high inflation and a wide open border, 'What are you going to do? What is your specific plan to solve the inflation crisis that's making it unaffordable to buy groceries and housing?' And Kamala will say, 'Well, did you know that I grew up in a middle-class family? I had a very nice lawn back there in Berkeley, California,'"" he continued. ""It's like, 'Well, that might be true. What the hell does that have to do with lower inflation?'"""
462,Inside Democrats' campaign to redefine the word 'freedom',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/inside-democrats-campaign-redefine-word-freedom,2024-09-28T12:07:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic presidential candidate current Vice President Kamala Harris used the word ""freedom"" 11 times in a campaign speech this week, emphasizing, as she does repeatedly, the ""freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body.""

It's the latest example of how, according to ABC News and The New Yorker, Democrats are attempting to take ownership of the word ""freedom."" The New Yorker explains: ""Democrats' years-long efforts to reclaim the word are cresting in this year's Presidential race.""

It really takes some nerve for Democrats to try to revamp as ""freedom"" their usual proposals on not just abortion and voting, but also gun control, climate and LGBT issues. In reality, Democrats aim to restrict our First and Second Amendment rights and more.

CNN HOST KASIE HUNT SAYS HARRIS IS 'REPUBLICAN' AND TRUMP IS 'LIBERAL' ON THEIR ECONOMIC POLICIES

Harris has made ""freedom"" the theme of her campaign. She says the word frequently in her speeches. Her campaign's song is ""Freedom"" by Beyoncé. The word ""freedom"" appears 24 times in her campaign website's issues section. Freedom was emphasized in her first campaign video and in her speech at the Democrats' convention.

""In this election, many fundamental freedoms are at stake,"" Harris's campaign website says. Harris and running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""will always fight for the freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis,"" according to their campaign website.

Harris's presidential campaign website's policy section makes no mention of our most important freedoms, enshrined in the First Amendment -- the ""free exercise"" of religion, ""freedom of speech, or of the press"" (former President Donald Trump's campaign does). Someone should tell the Democrats that those are first in the Bill of Rights for a reason.

Walz has said he sees ""no guarantee for free speech"" related to misinformation and hate speech. But such speech is constitutionally protected, otherwise the government would be in the position of regulating what is acceptable speech and it could suppress dissent or label information it doesn't like as ""misinformation.""

The better approach is to allow for free speech, but to have open debate and condemn hateful speech. We've seen the alternative play out: The Biden-Harris White House pressured Big Tech companies to censor Americans because of their views on COVID-19. In 2019, Harris called on then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump's account.

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

For Democrats, ""reproductive freedom"" is the freedom they most want to defend. The verbal forced marriage of ""reproductive"" and ""freedom"" is another stretch. Try as they might, reproduction, including via in-vitro fertilization, can't be divorced from its many consequences -- such as producing children. That's just science.

In the presidential debate, Harris used the word ""freedom"" only in reference to abortion. ""I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,"" Harris said (she's fine with the government telling you what to do on a host of other issues).

But the freedom to abort an unborn child is not real freedom. In a truly free society, one person cannot be free to take another's liberty. An unborn child is not part of a woman's body or her property -- it is a separate human being with its own rights. In taking the life of an unborn child, a woman is taking away the most basic of all rights.

Twisting the word further, Harris says she wants to defend the ""freedom to vote."" But that's no more true of Democrats than Republicans. Both sides want to enact election laws that favor their party. But Republicans want to make our election system more secure.

In fact, Democrats have taken their own voters' freedom this presidential election. It's the Democratic Party that ousted its incumbent, prevented a real primary challenge, and has fought any independent challenger. Nor have Democrats given Republicans the freedom to vote. Democrats, along with other lawfare, have pushed claims to kick Trump off the ballot.

Harris says she'll also defend ""the freedom to love who you love openly."" The reality is she'll take parents' rights.

Her first campaign video shows crowds waving pride flags as Harris says ""we choose freedom."" But the LGBT community is far from closeted - pride parades often feature half-naked adults in public in front of children.

Conservatives want the freedom to protect their children from ideologies that are counter to their beliefs, including sexually explicit books that are inappropriate for children. Democrats misleadingly call these efforts ""book bans,"" but by this logic, movie ratings are ""movie bans"" because young children aren't supposed to see R-rated movies.

Women won't be free under a Harris administration. She won't defend women's rights to keep biological men out of their bathrooms, locker rooms, sports or sororities.

Harris would restrict the Second Amendment, yet her campaign casts gun control in the light of freedom: ""As President, she won't stop fighting so that Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship.""

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

Harris's promises of freedom and joy (another of her themes) sound as vacuous as former President Barack Obama's campaign of ""hope and change."" The Democrats want to impose more government control on Americans, including with expensive and ineffective economic and environmental policies.

Republicans also want clean air, but acknowledge that more environmental regulation costs Americans money in higher energy, housing and other costs. Being energy-independent prevents funding foreign authoritarian governments.

Yes, Democrats believe in the ""freedoms"" of abortion, being LGBT, and voting without ID -- but they don't believe in First and Second Amendment rights, a woman's right to not have men in female-only spaces, parents' rights or energy independence."
463,Four celebrities who have rejected conservative fans: 'I have no respect for you',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/four-celebrities-have-rejected-conservative-fans-i-have-no-respect-you,2024-09-28T10:12:58Z,"Former President Trump discusses how several celebrities and talk show hosts, like Howard Stern, have gone 'anti-Trump' on 'Gutfeld!'

The November presidential election is less than 40 days away and liberal celebrities are increasingly speaking out. Howard Stern drew controversy recently after he attacked Donald Trump voters as ""stupid"" and said he didn't care if he lost them as listeners. But Stern wasn't the first liberal celebrity to tell conservatives not to listen or watch.

Here are four prominent celebrities from radio, television and music, who've bluntly told conservative fans that they are unwelcome.

Earlier this month, SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern said that he hates supporters of former President Trump.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" he said on ""The Howard Stern Show.""

The liberal shock jock said he doesn't mind losing ""half [his] listeners"" who disagree with his politics and fully expects ""hate mail"" from Trump supporters, after delivering that polarizing statement.

It isn't the first time Stern has lashed out at Trump supporters. Ahead of the 2020 election, he said, ""I don't hate Donald. I hate you for voting for him, for not having intelligence. For not being able to see what's going on with the coronavirus, for not being able to see what the Justice Department is doing. I hate you. I don't want you here.""

HOWARD STERN SAYS HE 'HATES' ANYONE THAT VOTES FOR TRUMP: 'THEY ARE STUPID, I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEM'

In 2017, ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was asked if he was concerned he was driving away his audience with his increasing turn to the left after former President Trump entered the White House.

""I saw -- I don't know if it was a study or a poll or some combination of those two things -- that, like, three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats, and then Republican numbers went way down, like, 30% or whatever,"" Kimmel told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in the 2017 interview.

""And, you know, as a talk-show host, that's not ideal, but I would do it again in a heartbeat,"" he continued.

A January 2024 study by the Media Research Center found that 81% of all political jokes told on major late night comedy shows in 2023 targeted conservatives. Kimmel's show had the highest rate of anti-conservative jokes for a single show out of the six. Of the 2,215 political jokes made on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" 1,960, or 88% were directed at conservatives.

During a concert in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 2023, the rock singer cursed out those in the audience who were thinking of voting for then-presidential candidate DeSantis in the 2024 presidential race.

""And if you vote for Ron DeSantis, you're f---ing dead to me,"" she said.

This past week during her band's iHeartRadio Music Festival, Williams lectured listeners to vote against Trump unless they wanted to ""live in a dictatorship.""

""Project 2025 is Donald Trump's playbook for controlling and punishing women, poor people, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community. It is time for all Americans to band together and to finally defeat the Trump agenda,"" she said directly to the camera. ""And the only way to do that is by confronting him at the polls.""

AND ALSO F--- RIGHT OFF. We good?"" the singer wrote on X (then Twitter), according to People Magazine and other outlets. The social media post has since been deleted.

Conservative film critic Christian Toto, host of The Hollywood in Toto podcast, told Fox News Digital these celebrities should be ""careful of what they wish for.""

""Today's stars live in bubble-like communities where they don't get to see, meet or be challenged by those with opposing viewpoints. They read only a select number of news outlets and have mentally demonized 'the other.'

During a swing through Central Pennsylvania, Fox News Digital spoke with several voters in urban and rural areas, and got their take on the effects of charged political rhetoric among other topics.

In Wakefield, the rural community just north of the Maryland line, Marsha Peterson co-owns Peterson's Grocery Outlet with her husband.

Asked about the level of political rhetoric, Peterson said the left has spent years on a drumbeat of telling Americans former President Trump ""is a danger and he must be stopped.""

""Then, you see people on social media laughing and saying they wouldn't have missed [shooting] him,"" she said. ""They want words to matter - but only the right's words.""

Closer to home, Peterson said the affordability crisis has been a major issue for both her and her customers.

""We run a little mom-and-pop little grocery store, and we absolutely see the difference in price increases from one administration to the next, even with COVID [considerations], things were not this high,"" she said.

Outside a large flea market off US-222, Eric Beezer said the issues at hand have driven him to run for state office in Lancaster City.

The Republican said he originally was facing off with 34-year incumbent State Rep. Mike Sturla, but noted the senior Democrat suddenly withdrew from the race in August.

He said he hopes his top issues of affordability, housing and keeping taxes low will resonate with voters in the otherwise heavily-Democratic stronghold.

""Lancaster's issues are the same as most of the country,"" Beezer said.

Sam and Kate Mylin of Willow Street, Pa. offered their take while visiting Quarryville, saying the negativity in politics has to stop.

""Especially people and politicians saying [Trump] is a threat and he needs to be taken out and stuff like that,"" said Sam, a retired artist. ""That's is wrong. That's just totally wrong. That's not American.""

Meanwhile, Kate Mylin questioned the veracity of claims inflation is going down. She noted disparities in costs as of late.

CRISS-CROSSING PA TO REGISTER VOTERS, SCOTT PRESLER SAYS HE'S 'MOVING THE NEEDLE' TO FLIP COUNTIES RED

""Gas goes down. But then your eggs are $5 for a dozen? Give me a break.""

Sam Mylin added he wants to hear the truth from politicians as to whether our troops truly are not at war.

""We have more wars right now than we ever had. And supposedly the troops aren't in a combat zone, but I see that they are. And it's all lies, man. It is. It's all lies coming from the left. And it's really dishonest itself,"" he said.

""The other thing is the affordability of housing for people is ridiculous. So something's got to change,"" he added, noting he and his wife are supporting Trump.

Tim Gochenaur and Michelle Williams of rural Christiana traveled west into East Drumore Township to visit the Solanco fairgrounds.

Both believed political rhetoric played a part in Trump being targeted twice for assassination.

""They're inciting these people,"" Gochenaur said. ""Somebody might be off a little bit to start with and that pushes them in that directions.""

Asked about electoral fairness, Williams said the tabulations will be ""as fair as they allow it to be - the system should be fair.""

""The way that the laws are put in place, it's meant for integrity. And that's a founding principle of our of our country -- for there to be an appropriate and proper vote. But if that is not carried out, then it will not be a fair election.""

On the other end of Harrisburg Pike, in the namesake capital city, a man who goes by ""Minister Fifty"" spoke out while waiting for a bus by the Hilton hotel downtown.

""Is that a rhetorical question?"" Minister Fifty responded when asked about political rhetoric inciting malign behavior.

""Common sense tells us, of course, it's having an effect - any type of unsavory communication is never going to be helpful,"" he said.

""So when we resort to things other than the issues and then we get animated in a dark way toward other people or non-issues, then things get clouded and things get deflected and then we lose sight of what the true goal is.""

""We also have an opportunity to show the world and everyone else that America is built on decency..."" Minister Fifty countered.

He added he believes the election will indeed be fair, calling the national structure ""too big to fail.""

Lisa, of Harrisburg, said she is a proud ""Black lady for Donald J. Trump,"" in her words, said that when it comes to political rhetoric, it is important to ""maintain a blessed attitude"" and remember ""the golden rule - do unto others as they would do unto you.""

""Both sides can really use just more tolerance towards the other side,"" said Lisa, who declined to appear on camera but agreed to have her comments recorded audially.

""I'm rooting for the best candidate to win,"" she said.

Pam Hower, a former Republican who was out enjoying a twilight trip along the Susquehanna River trail, said she became disaffected with the GOP over its ""crazy rhetoric"" but added there may be something to be said on that front on both sides.

She said Trump has ""hurt a lot of people"" with claims of migrants eating pets in Ohio, and - as a person with a disability - was horrified at a situation from Trump's first bid wherein he was accused of mocking a New York Times reporter who suffered from a congenital skeletal condition.

Trump, however, denied the claim, saying he didn't know of Serge Kovaleski's disability, and only effected his ""groveling"" manner in the situation he had been describing.

Hower said disability issues as well as Medicare and Medicaid solvency are key to her vote.

She added that while she has gone hunting with family members and grew up around legal firearms, she disagrees with the availability of semiautomatic rifles given the amount of school and public shootings in recent years.

""My daughter is a speech therapist in an elementary school. I'm terrified for her. And I know that that has an impact on the way she thinks going into the schools. And I don't want her to have to be afraid every day,"" she said.

""I don't have a problem with guns because I grew up with them. I have a problem with assault rifles. I have a problem with access to them,"" she said.

When asked about the housing crisis, Hower said one aspect of it is being missed by the media and the candidates. As a person with a disability, only about 5% of new housing is required to be wheelchair accessible, she said.

""So we are in a critical stage of lack of housing in this country. In Pennsylvania, it's really terrible. But across the country for people with disabilities [as well].""

""I'm hoping for Kamala. I'm doing everything I can because [Trump] scares the heck out of me,"" she said.

Rudolph of Harrisburg said virulent political rhetoric is ""typical.""

""I think each year that the antics get dirtier. And so what are we fighting for? And I really don't understand the whole process because everybody knows -- the smart people know anyway -- that the popular vote don't elect the president. It's the electoral college,"" he said.

As for some of the threats on Trump, Rudolph suggested some aspects may have been ""staged"" because the Republican is a ""good marketer.""

However, Rudolph also praised some of Trump's work in his first term:

""He made us stand up to China. And so he has some good ideas. But his rhetoric is causing division among the people. And that's not a good thing because, you know, I've got White friends. I got Black friends, I got Green friends, I mean,"" he riffed."
465,Harris-Trump cash dash: Former president looks to flip script with fundraising swing in oil country,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-cash-dash-former-president-flip-script-fundraising-swing-oil-country,2024-09-28T08:09:23Z,"Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley expressed confidence to Fox News Digital about having resources to get the GOP message to voters.

Trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 cash dash, former President Trump heads next week to Texas, a state that's long served as an ATM for Republican White House candidates.

Aiming to narrow the fundraising gap with Harris, the former president will headline a luncheon Oct. 2 in Midland, Texas, as he courts donors in oil country. That luncheon will be followed by a cocktail reception in Houston, sources in Trump's political orbit confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Trump will also headline a fundraiser in Dallas during his Texas swing.

According to the latest figures available from the Federal Election Commission, Harris hauled in nearly $190 million in fundraising for her 2024 campaign in August, more than quadrupling the $44.5 million that Trump's team reported bringing into his principal campaign account last month.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION

And the vice president's campaign entered September with $235 million cash on hand, well ahead of the $135 million in Trump's coffers, according to the FEC filings.

The latest cash figures are another sign of the vice president's surge in fundraising since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket over two months ago.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

This isn't the first time Trump's faced a fundraising deficit. He raised less than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in his White House victory and by President Biden four years ago in his re-election defeat.

""The Democrats' small-dollar fundraising machine is just better,"" acknowledged Dan Eberhart, an oil drilling CEO and prominent Republican donor and bundler who raised big bucks for Trump in the 2020 and 2024 cycles.

Eberhart pointed to Trump's surge in grassroots fundraising earlier this year, after he made history as the first former or current president convicted in a criminal trial, and noted that ""Trump is the best small-dollar fundraiser the Republicans have ever had. But I still think, just overall, the Democrats' small-dollar fundraising machine is just better.""

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: WHICH CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THIS CRUCIAL ISSUE

The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.

Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.

But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in fundraising didn't last and, by early July, began to significantly slow down.

Biden bowed out of the 2024 race July 21, and the party quickly consolidated around Harris, who instantly saw her fundraising soar, spurred by small-dollar donations.

And the Harris campaign spotlighted that the vice president hauled in $47 million in the 24 hours after her first and likely only debate with Trump earlier this month.

""We've been playing catch-up ever since Act Blue first started, figuring out an effective way to mine the low-dollar, small-dollar fundraising,"" Republican Jewish Coalition CEO Matt Brooks told Fox News, pointing to the Democrats' on-line fundraising platform.

Brooks, who has close ties to the GOP's donor class, said while ""there's no question that the Democrats have perfected"" their small-dollar fundraising, ""I think we're doing better and better. I like the trajectory we're on.""

But a source in Trump's political orbit said ""the max-out donors have already given. There's not a lot of juice left from that. Any juice left would be in the small-dollar on-line fundraising, and the moments for that are kind of passed in terms of debates, making the running mate pick, the conventions. All that stuff is past.""

Fundraising, along with polling, is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's popularity and a campaign's strength. The money raised can be used -- among other things -- to hire staff, expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, pay to produce and run ads on TV, radio, digital and mailers and for candidate travel.

""We're going to be outspent, and that's going to lead to a better ground game for Harris,"" a veteran Republican operative who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, told Fox News.

But Brooks emphasized that ""the saving grace is that we have strong support among major donors and big dollar donors going into the super PACs, which you have to take into consideration.""

""I think you have to look at the totality of the pro-Trump money out there, and I think the super PACs help level the playing field significantly,"" he added.

When asked about the fundraising deficit, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital earlier this month ""the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money.""

However, he emphasized that ""we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message out to all the voters that we're talking to and feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to see this campaign through, and we're going to win on Nov. 5."""

North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson was hospitalized following an ""incident"" at a campaign event on Friday evening, Fox News Digital has confirmed.

""Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is currently being treated for burns following an incident at a campaign event in Mt. Airy. He is in good spirits,"" Mike Lonergan, Robinson's campaign communications director told Fox News Digital.

The extent of Robinson's injuries is unknown, and it's unclear exactly how Robinson was burned.

Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor running against Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein to replace Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in the battleground state, was recently accused of making controversial comments on a porn website.

NC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE MARK ROBINSON HIRES TRUMP-FRIENDLY LAWYER TO INVESTIGATE PORN WEBSITE ALLEGATIONS

Robinson denies the allegations. He hired an attorney who previously worked for former President Trump. The Binnall Law Group from northern Virginia is investigating claims raised in a CNN report published earlier this week.

""Normally, something like this, an investigation, you know, run by the Department of Justice and the FBI would take months or years,"" Binnall previously told Fox News Digital. ""We can't do that in this case because the voters need an answer before the election. And so we are going to move very quickly and still give them a very fulsome report.""

""He absolutely denies saying any of the things that are in the CNN piece,"" Binnall said of Robinson. ""What my investigation is going to do is we are going to follow the facts. We are going to investigate this strenuously. We are going to leave no stone unturned. We're going to be very, very aggressive. And the citizens of North Carolina deserve nothing less than a full investigation of this matter, which is what we are going to do.""

BATTLEGROUND STATE REPUBLICAN DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN PORN SCANDAL, DISMISSES IT AS 'TABLOID TRASH'

The CNN report surfaced comments Robinson allegedly made more than a decade ago on a porn site messaging board, including describing himself as a ""black NAZI;"" saying he enjoyed transgender pornography; saying that he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama in 2012; and criticizing the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as ""worse than a maggot.""

Robinson has denied saying those words, but Republicans have begun to distance themselves from the candidate, who, if elected, would be North Carolina's first Black governor. Trump did not mention Robinson, who he endorsed before the March primary and has spoken at other Trump events, during the Republican presidential nominee's campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Saturday.

""The allegations against me are outright lies, fabricated to distract voters from Josh Stein's disastrous record,"" Robinson previously said in a statement to Fox News Digital regarding the investigation. ""The great people of North Carolina deserve the truth, and I am fully committed to ensuring they get it with complete transparency.""

""Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years,"" Harris told an enthusiastic crowd inside the gymnasium of the Cochise County College Douglas Campus located roughly two miles from the southern border.

""We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators and if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States. Our system must be orderly and secure.""

HARRIS VISITS CRUCIAL BORDER STATE AS IMMIGRATION RECORD SPARKS SCRUTINY: A TIMELINE

Harris, who touted her record as a border state attorney general, claimed that Trump ""tanked"" the ""strongest border security bill we have seen in decades"" earlier this year and argued that if it were law today, it would be producing ""results"" for the country.

""It is my pledge to you that as President of the United States I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law,"" she said.

Harris also pledged to ""understand how solutions get formed"" and to ""reach across the aisle and I will embrace common sense approaches and new techniques to get the job done.""

""Because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could[n't] care less who somebody voted for in the last election,"" she said.

Harris added, ""I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles.""

Fentanyl was a common message in Harris' speech, which she delivered after being introduced by Theresa Guerrero, whose son, Jacob, was killed by fentanyl poisoning at age 31.

""We will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it,"" Harris said. ""I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels.""

Harris added, ""The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story.""

MARK CUBAN SPARS WITH RILEY GAINES OVER HARRIS' HANDLING OF THE BORDER CRISIS

Harris claimed during her speech that Trump did ""nothing"" to fix our ""broken immigration"" system during his four years as president.

""He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges,"" Harris said. ""He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.

""He separated families. He ripped toddlers out of their mothers arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he is still. And he is still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.""

Harris signaled that she will find a pathway to citizenship for ""Dreamers"" who she said are ""American in every way.""

Harris told the crowd she will work with Democrats and Republicans to fix the border issue and said she rejects the ""false choice"" between securing the border and ""creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly, and humane.""

""We can, and we must do both. We must do both.""

Shortly before the speech, Harris walked the southern border with two border patrol officials who the White House says briefed her on ""their efforts to combat traffickers and transnational criminal organizations.""

Following that briefing, Harris traveled by motorcade to the Raul H. Castro Port of Entry in Douglas where she was briefed on efforts to stem the flow of fentanyl at the border.

Harris' speech outlining how she will tackle illegal immigration comes under the backdrop of millions of illegal immigrants overwhelming the southern border during her tenure as vice president, which has sparked frequent criticism from Trump, Republicans, and the Border Patrol union.

""After years of not just ignoring the problem, but helping create it, Vice President Kamala is finally headed down to the border,"" the National Border Patrol Council said in a statement leading up to Harris' visit. ""This is nothing more than for her to check the box, but what it is in reality, is a slap in the face towards the men and women that put their lives on the line every day, and also a slap in the face to the American public. Where has she been?""

BORDER-DISTRICT REPUBLICANS HAMMER HARRIS, DEMAND 'AN APOLOGY' OVER 'PHOTO OP' CAMPAIGN STOP IN ARIZONA

Fox News Digital reported earlier this year that at least 7.2 million illegal immigrants entered the United States under President Biden, an amount greater than the populations of 36 states.

Harris faced criticism just hours before her speech after Immigration and Customs Enforcement released data showing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions are currently loose on the streets in the U.S.

Fox News polling released this week showed Trump with a 3 point lead in Arizona after Harris was in the lead by a point last month.

The 3-point shift among registered voters is mainly due to movement among young voters, women and Hispanics.

Polling has also shown that the vast majority of Americans believe the southern border is a ""problem"" after almost four years of the Biden-Harris administration and recent Fox News polling shows Americans trust Trump on the economy over Harris by 10 points."

It was George Orwell, in his seminal book ""1984,"" which turned out to be about 40 years off, who wrote that eventually the state would make us believe that 2 + 2 = 5. Vice President Kamala Harris' incomprehensibly shameless photo op on the southern border might have dialed it up to a 6.

WHITE HOUSE MUM AMID OUTRAGE OVER DATA SHOWING HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMINALS FREED IN US

This is like Oedipus saying, ""Who did all this?"" And we all point at the TV and say, ""It was you!""

It's Herbert Hoover taking a selfie with thumbs up at the Museum of the Great Depression.

I could go on.

It's truly mind-bending, there is no question that Trump's policies lowered the number of illegal immigrants and that now they pour into America in the millions, including thousands upon thousands of murderers and rapists, according to new Fox News reporting.

And we know that the Biden Harris administration has done nothing about it, excepting a few Hail Mary band-aids a few months ago, so how dare she lecture anyone on the border?

What is her argument? How does she try to duck blame for our badly cracked spaghetti strainer of a southern border? She says Trump stopped the bipartisan immigration bill.

First of all, he didn't. There was no appetite for a great white whale of an immigration bill among House Republicans, ever.

Second, and more important, it was a questionable bill, good arguments on both sides maybe, but Biden and Harris, as Trump is fond of pointing out, can fix a lot of this with the stroke of a single pen.

What is her argument? How does she try to duck blame for our badly cracked spaghetti strainer of a southern border?

Literally, it is just go back to what Trump was doing before you messed it up, it isn't complicated, but for some reason, even the new centrist Kamala Harris, gun-toting former McDonald's employee can't bring herself to just tell Grandpa Joe to reinstate the remain in Mexico policy.

That alone paints the lie in glowing neon font.

But can she really pull it off? Can she so shamelessly parade before the border and pretend to be the one who can clamp down on it?

Before COVID, I would have said no. I would have said, the American people will see through this, there's no way they can accept such an obvious lie. Much less let it impact their lives.

I was wrong. In fact, too many of us simply bought in, we bought into the masks and social distancing, and school closures while we now know a New York COVID Czar were having weird sex parties. It's that bad.

Kamala Harris is on the record calling Trump's border policies inhumane, Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez used to cry dressed in white in front of migrant detention facilities, but suddenly Harris is tough on the border?

And that's what it's really about, the bridge between Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, and Del Rio, Texas. And if you think Harris is going to stop the flow of migrants there, then George Orwell was right, and I was wrong."

The White House has yet to comment on new data released to lawmakers showing the number of illegal immigrants with convictions for sex offenses and homicide convictions and who are not in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.

The agency provided data to Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, about national data for illegal immigrants with criminal charges or convictions. The data, as of July 2024, is broken down by those in detention, and those who are not in detention -- known as the non-detained docket. The non-detained docket includes noncitizens who have final orders of removal or are going through removal proceedings, but are not detained in ICE custody.

There are currently more than 7.4 million people on that docket, up from around 3.7 million when former President Trump left office.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT, MURDER CONVICTIONS ROAMING US STREETS: ICE DATA

The data says that, among those not in detention, there are currently 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges. The data does not reveal how many of those criminals are recent arrivals.

For comparison, in August 2016, towards the end of the Obama administration, ICE said there were about 2.2 million noncitizens on the non-detained docket and about 368,574 were convicted criminals.

In the latest data, the convicted criminals include 62,231 convicted of assault, 14,301 convicted of burglary, 56,533 with drug convictions and 13,099 convicted of homicide. An additional 2,521 have kidnapping convictions and 15,811 have sexual assault convictions. There are an additional 1,845 with pending homicide charges, 42,915 with assault charges, 3,266 with burglary charges and 4,250 with assault charges.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the data and whether it had been aware of the numbers. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign also did not comment -- Harris is currently at the southern border in Arizona.

Fox News Digital has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security.

The news sparked outrage from Republicans, who tied the numbers to the policies of the Biden administration and those sanctuary jurisdictions who refuse to co-operate with ICE.

'POLITICAL STUNT': CRITICS DISMISS HARRIS' EXPECTED ARIZONA BORDER VISIT AS IMMIGRATION REMAINS TOP ISSUE

Rep. Tony Gonzalez, R-Texas, called the data ""beyond disturbing"" and said ""it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies.""

""It's time for Washington to move past rhetoric and toward results. Americans deserve to feel safe in their communities. As an Appropriator, I will do everything in my power to ensure ICE has the resources necessary to deport noncitizens with a criminal record -- this must be a priority,"" he said in a statement. ""The Biden-Harris administration also plays a part in cleaning up the mess their failed policies have created. They have the ear of sanctuary city mayors -- it's time to encourage them to reverse course and put the safety of American citizens first.""

Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green said the release of illegal immigrants into the U.S. ""defies all common sense.""

""This is madness. It is something no civilized, well-functioning society should tolerate,"" he said.

In the letter to Gonzalez, ICE took aim at so-called ""sanctuary"" cities, which refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement in deporting illegal immigrant criminals.

""ICE recognizes that some jurisdictions are concerned that cooperating with federal immigration officials will erode trust with immigrant communities and make it harder for local law enforcement to serve those populations. However, 'sanctuary' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,"" it said.

It also stressed DHS' efforts to remove illegal immigrants: ""From mid-May 2023 through the end of July 2024, DHS removed or returned more than 893,600 individuals, including more than 138,300 individuals in family units. The majority of all individuals encountered at the Southwest Border over the past three years have been removed, returned, or expelled.""

The Biden administration has prioritized the removal of public safety and national security threats in narrowed priorities it released in 2021, but critics have linked those priorities with a drop in ICE removals.

Republicans have blamed the border crisis on the policies of the administration, including rolling back Trump policies that limited ""catch and release.""

The administration has said it needs more funding and reforms from Congress, including via a bipartisan Senate bill introduced this year. That bill would increase the number of ICE detention beds, but critics of the administration have pointed to numbers showing not all beds are being filled currently.

Asked about the increase in the non-detained docket this summer, a White House spokesperson pointed to that bill.

""Congressional Republicans had an opportunity to support the fairest and toughest set of reforms in decades, and they chose to put partisan political interests ahead of fixing our immigration system and securing our borders,"" the spokesperson said. ""Congressional Republicans have proven that they do not care about securing our border because, frankly, if they did, they would have supported the bipartisan agreement.""

The data's release comes as Harris visits the southern border in Arizona, as she seeks to present herself as tougher on the border than former President Trump, who she blames for the border bill not passing.

""Donald Trump tanked a bill to improve border security -- just so he can win this election,"" she said on Friday. ""As I have shown throughout my career, I won't back down from my plan to make our border more secure."""
470,Mark Cuban spars with Riley Gaines over Harris' handling of the border crisis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mark-cuban-spars-riley-gaines-over-harris-handling-border-crisis,2024-09-27T23:59:56Z,"Billionaire investor Mark Cuban unpacks the dueling economic plans pitched by Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump on 'Your World.'

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban used his X platform Friday to respond to 24-year-old former college swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines over criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the southern border.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released data to lawmakers Friday revealing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions have crossed the border into the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration. These include 13,099 convicted of homicide and 15,811 of sexual assault.

Cuban, who has been a staunch advocate for Harris, Joe Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has defended the VP's record on the border. Cuban even said he thinks the actions she has taken to reduce the flow of illegal migrants across the southern border ""have actually worked"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Gaines called out Cuban for his praise of the vice president in a post on X Friday.

""We might have different standards for what qualifies as a 'good job,' but I don't think the illegal entrance of 15,000+ rapists, 13,000+ murderers, and 320,000 missing children fits the bill,"" Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast wrote.

Gaines' reference to the 320,000 missing children is from another report from the Department of Homeland Security released Aug. 21 that revealed the Biden-Harris administration has lost track of that number of migrant children who crossed the border without parents.

Cuban responded to Gaines in his own X post just 90 minutes later. Cuban admitted the current administration ""waited too long to fix the border."" But he then criticized Trump for his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation in American history if elected.

""I have said many times they waited too long to fix the border. The good news is that the latest crossing numbers are lower than Jan 21 and staying near 1,500 a day,"" Cuban wrote, along with screenshots of two articles covering a statistical reduction in illegal border crossings.

""And the VP has been clear she will sign the bi-partisan border bill. It's a fair argument to criticize them for waiting too long. But you also have to acknowledge that they are now having success. Which leads to the question of deportations. The Republican nominee says he is going to deport the 21 million people here illegally. He hasn't said how he will do it.""

TRUMP'S MEAL FOR ALABAMA-GEORGIA FOOTBALL GAME INCLUDES NEARLY 800 CALORIES FROM MCDONALD'S ALONE

Cuban referenced a border bill that Senate Democrats failed to pass through Congress in May when all but one Republican senator, along with six Democrats, voted to block it.

Democrats argued the bill was intended to reduce border crossings, raise the standard for migrants to qualify for asylum and empower officials to rapidly send away those who fail to meet that standard. It would give the president power to shut down the border if migration levels exceed certain thresholds. But concerns about the bill were raised with earlier drafts having the border provisions attached to funding for Ukraine and Israel.

Gaines responded to Cuban's defense of his praise for Harris in another X post Friday evening, discrediting the statistics Cuban offered and slamming the border bill.

""They're flying in illegal immigrants and dropping them into the heartland of America, often in places we don't even know about,"" Gaines wrote. ""The bi-partisan border bill is a Trojan horse. The first time it was voted on it included funding for Ukraine. She campaigns on securing the border acknowledging (indirectly) the problems that have been created under the Biden Harris Admin. she's been in the White House for 3.5 years. Why not take action now?""

Gaines also called out Cuban for not addressing the 320,000 missing children statistic she mentioned in her first post.

Cuban had not responded to Gaines again at the time of publication.

Cuban's defense of Harris and Democrats has ramped up in recent weeks. He has done several interviews endorsing the VP in the upcoming election, making statements that have raised eyebrows from conservative voters. Cuban has suggested Trump is ""a socialist"" and even said he believes the mainstream media ""leans right"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Earlier this year, when Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban went so far as to say he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden was ""being given his last rites.""

""If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,"" Cuban told Bloomberg News in March.

However, Cuban has also said he supported Trump at the outset of his first candidacy in 2015.

""In 2015, I was like, 'He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,"" Cuban told Vivek Ramaswamy in an interview on X Aug. 7.

Gaines has been an advocate for Trump in this election cycle. Gaines even spoke at one of Trump's rallies in Glendale, Arizona, Aug. 23. There, Gaines made a speech in which she claimed she was voting for Trump ""because I'm a woman.""

""They don't believe in school choice; they don't believe in parental rights or the safeguarding of children; they don't believe in freedom unless it's the freedom to have an abortion or chemically and surgically castrate children,"" she said.

""You have one ticket that knows what a woman is and has vowed to take decisive action at protecting our sex-based rights, compared to the other ticket that thinks men can become pregnant, and that tampons belong in boys' bathrooms.""

Harris will make a rare visit to the southern border in Arizona as she seeks to blunt criticism from former President Trump on the matter and renews her call for the bipartisan border bill. Conservatives were not swayed by the visit.

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has had nearly four years to protect America and failed,"" RJ Hauman, president of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE), told Fox News Digital in response to the data. ""She is allowing tens of thousands of murderers and rapists to roam free. She puts criminals first and the safety and security of you and your family last."""

After months of being criticized for a lack of unscripted media appearances, Harris did a solo interview with Ruhle on MSNBC on Wednesday. The interview was slammed by a variety of sources, including the New York Times, which said, ""Ms. Harris responded to the fairly basic and predictable questions with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer.""

Ruhle defended her interview and Harris' performance in it when she appeared on ""Morning Joe.""

""Obviously, for anybody who watched the interview I did with Vice President Harris, we sat down for 25 minutes and we talked about one single topic: the economy,"" she said. ""It is the number one issue for voters.""

MSNBC HOST DEFENDS HARRIS AVOIDING POLICY QUESTIONS: SHE'S 'NOT RUNNING FOR PERFECT'

""I think it's hugely important, and it's a vulnerability for both candidates, but it's really tricky, Joe, because, you know, you obviously want to cover all of these topics, but to just do it with one candidate, it's hard, because many people feel like she's speaking in platitudes,"" Ruhle said. ""She's speaking about an economic vision, and she's not giving details - She's got an 80-page detailed policy proposal.""

While she admitted Harris is dodging questions with ""platitudes,"" Ruhle explained it away as simply being the typical behavior of a politician.

""And do I think that she answers every single question and gives people exactly what they want? She doesn't. You know why? Because she's a politician, and none of them do. They all speak in platitudes,"" she said.

Ruhle also criticized former President Trump, and expressed shock that he is favored over the Biden-Harris administration's economic record.

Former President Trump called the U.S. a ""dumping ground"" Friday, hours after newly released data revealed that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions are roaming American streets.

The data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says that, among those not in detention, there are 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges.

The figures include 62,231 people convicted of assault, 14,301 convicted of burglary, 56,533 with drug convictions and 13,099 convicted of homicide. An additional 2,521 have kidnapping convictions and 15,811 have sexual assault convictions.

""Non-citizens, convicted criminals from all over the world are right now at-large in the United States of America.""

ICE blamed the figures on ""sanctuary"" cities, which refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement in deporting illegal immigrant criminals.

""ICE recognizes that some jurisdictions are concerned that cooperating with federal immigration officials will erode trust with immigrant communities and make it harder for local law enforcement to serve those populations. However, 'sanctuary' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,"" the agency said.

Trump blamed Harris, who Republicans argue is weak on border security and who was slated to visit the southern border in Arizona on Friday, saying she ignored the problem despite migrant crime becoming a top issue among voters.

""It's a killing machine, and they're killing people all over our country. And Kamala said, she said, 'oh, well, those people really don't kill like our criminals,'"" Trump said. ""No, no.

""Four years ago, Kamala Harris inherited the most secure border in U.S. history,"" he added. ""And as borders are, she then set the all-time record for illegal immigration into our country.

Vice President Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over former President Trump in the latest Fox News survey of North Carolina registered voters (50% Harris, 48% Trump). Last month, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

Among likely voters, the race flips with Trump on top by just a single point, 50% to 49%.

When third-party candidates are included, Harris is up 1 point among registered voters (3% support third party), while Trump is up 2 points among likely voters (3% to others).

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

The results among both registered and likely voters are within the margin of error.

Harris's strongest support comes from Black voters, urban voters, and college-educated women, while for Trump it is Whites without a college degree (particularly men without degrees), rural voters, and White evangelicals.

Most Democrats (98%) and Republicans (96%) back their party's candidate, while the small group of independents favors Harris by 7 points.

Slightly more Harris supporters (92%) than Trump supporters (89%) are certain of their choice.

Harris is viewed more positively than Trump among Tar Heel voters -- 50% have a favorable view of her vs. 49% unfavorable for a +1 net positive rating. Trump's rating is negative by 7 points (46% favorable, 53% unfavorable).

Just 30% say the economy is in either excellent (7%) or good (23%) condition, while another 70% say either fair (30%) or poor (40%). This negativity is a far cry from November 2019 (late into Trump's term as president) when 54% were positive and 44% negative.

By 7 points, voters are more likely to think Trump can better handle the economy and about the same number give him the edge on making the country safe (+6). He does best on immigration and border security, where he leads Harris by 15 points, down from a 19-point lead in August.

4 MARK ROBINSON CAMPAIGN STAFFERS RESIGN IN WAKE OF REPORT ON PORN WEBSITE POSTS

Harris does best on the issue of abortion, where she is preferred by 16 points. Voters also give her the edge on helping the middle class (+7), protecting democracy (+6), and fighting for people like you (+5).

The candidates tie on who can bring needed change.

""The race here will be close, but Trump still holds the edge on the issues that matter most to North Carolina voters,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""So long as they think Trump is more likely to make the country more prosperous and safer, he's the odds-on favorite.""

At least 8 in 10 Black voters think Harris is better equipped to handle these issues and actions, except when it comes to immigration, where Trump eats into Harris' lead with 25% saying he would better handle immigration vs. 73% for Harris.

The survey also finds the gap in the gubernatorial race in North Carolina has widened. Democrat Josh Stein (56%) has a 16-point lead over Republican Mark Robinson (40%), a 5-point increase since last month (54% Stein, 43% Robinson).

The survey was conducted after news of alleged inflammatory comments Robinson made on a porn website.

""It is unlikely the toxic nature of the Republican gubernatorial candidate will cause Trump voters to switch to Harris, but it could affect turnout,"" says Anderson. ""It complicates things for the Trump campaign to have to actively avoid the GOP candidate, and there could be some Trump-leaning independents who are so turned off by Robinson they decide it's not worth voting.""

Trump endorsed Robinson in March but has yet to comment on whether he'll pull his support.

Some 14% of Stein supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race, while just 4% of Robinson supporters back Harris.

A few more things...

-- By 17 points, those who say they will vote early in North Carolina back Harris. Among the smaller group of Election Day voters, Trump leads by 20 points.

--The views of the vice-presidential candidates play out the same as the presidential, with Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz receiving a net positive rating of 5 (46% favorable vs. 41% unfavorable) and Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance net negative by 6 (41-47%).

--Views of President Joe Biden are net negative by 15 points (42% favorable, 57% unfavorable).

474,"Fox News Poll: Harris, Trump locked in tight race in battleground Pennsylvania",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-locked-tight-race-battleground-pennsylvania,2024-09-27T22:07:19Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha on the media pressing Vice President Harris on her lack of interviews and Sen. Joe Manchin refusing to endorse Harris due to her support for ending the filibuster.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump are locked in a tight race in Pennsylvania, mostly unchanged since July. This despite the array of newsworthy events since then, including the Democratic National Convention, a presidential debate, and a second Trump assassination attempt.

The new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters.

The July results, conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, but before she was conclusively the nominee, were deadlocked at 49% each. But even in March, when Biden was the presumed nominee, the contest was close to even.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

Since July, Harris has widened her lead among women (by 9 points), nonwhite voters (+8), and voters under age 30 (+17). Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength: college graduates and urban voters.

Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters.

Trump's best groups include men, Whites without a college degree, independents, and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Another reason the race is close is Trump has minimized Harris' edge among suburban voters (+2). This is mostly due to the large gender gap among suburban voters: suburban men support Trump by 14 points (suburban women go for Harris by 17). Meanwhile, Harris has successfully peeled off disaffected Republicans: she has 1 in 4 non-MAGA Republicans backing her.

In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by less than a point in the Keystone State, while Biden's victory was by just over a point in 2020.

In the expanded ballot (includes third-party candidates) Harris has a 2-point edge among registered voters while Trump is ahead by 1 point among likely voters.

All results for the Harris-Trump head-to-heads and expanded ballot are within the error margin .

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

The economy is the top issue for voters this election and most Pennsylvanians have a negative view of the economy (71%).

More voters think Trump can better handle the economy than Harris by 6 points. Still, that's half the advantage he had on the issue in April (+12 points over Biden).

Trump does best on immigration and border security (+17) and is also more trusted to make the country safer (+5).

Harris is seen as better able to handle abortion by 21 points. She also gets the nod on helping the middle class (by 8 points), protecting Democracy (+7), and fighting for people like you (+5).

Neither has a clear edge in bringing needed change (Harris +3)

Harris enjoys better favorable ratings than the former president -- 48% favorable vs. 51% unfavorable for a 3-point net negative rating. Trump is underwater by 9 points (45% vs. 54%). It plays out the same way among the vice-presidential candidates: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's rating is even (44% vs. 44%) while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is in negative territory by 13 points (39% vs. 52%).

Biden's favorable rating is underwater by 16 points (42% vs. 58%).

In the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democratic candidate Bob Casey has a 9-point lead over Republican challenger David McCormick (53% to 44% among both registered and likely voters). McCormick has narrowed the gap by 4 points since July when he was down by 13 (55-42%).

The reversal can mostly be attributed to a 13-point shift among men and a decrease in support for Casey among independents. In July, men supported Casey by 6 points while today they back McCormick by 7 points, while independents supported Casey by 18 points in the summer and it's a 5-point spread now.

Some 10% of Casey backers split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race while just 4% of McCormick supporters go for Harris.

A few more things...

-- Gov. Josh Shapiro is popular, as 62% approve of the job he's doing while a third disapprove (36%). Most Democrats (92%) and over half of independents (53%) approve of him while two-thirds of Republicans (65%) disapprove.

-- A majority of Pennsylvanians favor the use of fracking for oil and gas production, including 8 in 10 Republicans, 6 in 10 independents, and 4 in 10 Democrats.

A new poll in the race for a crucial electoral vote that could potentially determine whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Trump wins the 2024 White House race suggests that Harris holds a sizable lead.

Harris stands at 53% support, and Trump at 42% among likely voters in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, according to a new CNN poll conducted Sept. 20 to 25 and released on Friday.

Nebraska and Maine are the only two states in the nation that divide their electoral votes by congressional district. A competitive district in each of the states could help decide whether Harris or Trump succeeds President Biden in the White House.

Nebraska is solidly red in presidential elections. Trump carried the state by 25 points in his 2016 White House victory and by 19 points in his 2020 re-election defeat.

But Nebraska's 2nd District, an urban-suburban area anchored by the city of Omaha, has a history of being competitive.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW

In 2008, then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama narrowly won the district, capturing its single electoral vote. In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney won the district by single digits. Trump narrowly carried the district in 2016, but Biden won it four years ago.

The poll indicates Harris grabbing the support of 96% of Democrats, 61% of independents and even 10% support among Republicans.

According to the survey, Harris also holds a 24-point lead among female voters, while Trump's advantage among men is just five points.

Six in ten of those questioned in the poll said that Nebraska should keep its current system of rewarding electoral votes in a presidential election, with 40% saying it should switch to the system employed in 48 states, where the statewide winner grabs all the electoral votes.

Trump and national Republicans made a full-court press in recent weeks to urge Nebraska Republican lawmakers to change the law and switch to a winner-take-all system, but their lobbying effort fell short."

The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a bid by independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to restore his name to New York's election ballot.

The appeal was denied by the country's highest court without comment and without any noted dissents.

Kennedy has been trying to get his name off ballots in key battleground states since he suspended his campaign in August and endorsed former President Trump.

The candidate has simultaneously tried to stay on the ballot in states like New York, where his presence is unlikely to make a difference in the battle between Trump and Vice President Harris.

When he suspended his campaign, Kennedy said he planned to keep his name on the ballot in safe Democratic and Republican states, but didn't want to be a spoiler in the battleground states.

RFK, JR.: WE'RE TRYING TO GET OFF THE BALLOT IN ALL THE STATES I MIGHT BE A SPOILER

""In about 10 battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler, I'm going to remove my name, and I've already started that process and urge voters not to vote for me,"" Kennedy said.

- NYC Mayor Eric Adams turns himself in to face charges in federal corruption case

North Carolina has removed over 700,000 individuals from its registered voter list, officials say.

The State Board of Elections announced Thursday that 747,000 people have been removed from voter rolls in the last 20 months due to ineligibility.

""The county boards follow careful policies to ensure that only ineligible records are removed, not those of eligible voters,"" the Board of Elections said in a press release.

""Meanwhile, newly eligible voters are constantly being added to the registration rolls in our growing state,"" the board added. ""Currently, North Carolina has nearly 7.7 million registered voters.""

A common reason for removal from voter rolls was moving residences -- either within the state without notifying election officials or to another state altogether. ...Read more

Vice President Kamala Harris' battleground border state visit on Friday is being panned by House Republicans whose districts represent the front lines of the current migrant crisis.

At issue is Harris' campaign stop in Douglas, a border town in the key state of Arizona, that comes less than six weeks before voters head to the polls to pick the next president.

""I have been consistent in my willingness to work with anyone - on either side of the aisle - to address the crisis at the border,"" Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., told Fox News Digital. ""However, Vice President Harris' visit to the border smells like nothing more than a photo opportunity to try and score political points.""

Ciscomani is just one of several GOP lawmakers from border districts who are accusing Harris of caring more about optics than results. They have long blamed the Biden administration for the record number of illegal border crossings since Democrats took office, and Harris' handling of the border is one of Republicans' most significant political cudgels against her.

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

""For three and a half years, the Vice President has been in a position to address this crisis, but instead she has ignored it,"" Ciscomani said. ""As a result, border districts, like mine, have suffered under her lack of leadership.""

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., whose San Diego-anchored district includes about 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, suggested the border crisis is a ""feature, not a flaw"" of the administration's policies.

""What followed? America's deadliest drug crisis ever, the unprecedented trafficking of women and girls, and 10 million illegals allowed to enter the country and stay,"" Issa said. ""Kamala owes America an apology, not a photo op.""

Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital that she believes Harris' trip is purely about playing politics.

""It's no coincidence that this last-minute visit comes as polls show Harris struggling in Arizona,"" she said. ""Despite the photo ops, the fact remains [that] under Harris's watch, we've faced an unprecedented border crisis, a stark contrast to the secure border we had under President Trump.""

The 2024 election has seen a paradigm shift in how Democrats are discussing the border. Candidates on the left who need to appeal to moderate and independent voters - a contingent that includes Harris - have emphasized the need for border security.

Democrats have also pointed to President Biden's executive actions on asylum that preceded a drop-off in the number of illegal border crossings between ports of entry in recent months. Encounters at the southwestern border were lower in July than during former President Trump's final month in office.

On an annual basis, however, Biden's tenure has seen more illegal crossings - with 2022 seeing a record 2.2 million border encounters.

CLUB FOR GROWTH POURS $5M INTO TIGHT HOUSE RACES AS GOP BRACES FOR TOUGH ELECTION

Crossings also soared between 2020 and 2021 when Biden took office and rolled back several of Trump's more restrictive border policies.

But rather than the issue uniting both parties, it has split Democrats and Republicans on how best to approach that goal.

Harris has frequently touted her support for a border security plan that was tanked earlier this year by Republican lawmakers, who said it did not do enough to secure the border and also codified policies they opposed. Democrats accuse the GOP of killing the legislation because it was opposed by former President Trump.

Asked for comment on Republicans' attacks against Harris visit, a campaign spokesperson pointed Fox News Digital to a senior Harris campaign official's comments that previewed the vice president's Friday remarks.

She's expected to accuse Trump of blocking progress on border security for political gain and advocate for tougher border security measures.

The Harris campaign also pointed Fox News Digital to a statement on her visit that said Harris will ""outline her plan to deliver real solutions on border security and the fentanyl crisis - unlike Donald Trump, who did nothing to fix our broken immigration system, made things worse, and killed bipartisan border solutions to play politics.""

Harris has not visited the border since 2021, a trip that came shortly after she was tasked with spearheading a solution to the root causes of mass migration, which earned her the informal title of ""border czar.""

The Trump campaign said in its own statement on Harris' Friday trip: ""Kamala's last-minute trip to the border and empty calls for more security 39 days before the election will not rewrite the past 44 months of chaos, crime, and bloodshed caused by her open border policy."""
479,Heritage flips script on fired director of Project 2025 after 'disconcerting' revelations surface,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heritage-flips-script-fired-director-project-2025-after-disconcerting-revelations-surface,2024-09-27T19:52:05Z,"The Heritage Foundation's Kevin Roberts explains what Project 2025 stands for as former President Trump distances himself from the conservative blueprint on 'Special Report.'

The former director of Project 2025 did not step down in July, as was initially reported, but was fired due to ""dismissive and unprofessional"" workplace behavior, the conservative think tank revealed Friday. The man at the center of the controversy says he's being made a ""scapegoat.""

Project 2025 is only the latest iteration of a longstanding Heritage Foundation initiative to establish a conservative governing blueprint. But incessant attacks by Democrats focusing on Project 2025 have led to intense scrutiny and frequent misrepresentations of the plan's details.

Still, Paul Dans' departure from the institution had little to do with that firestorm, according to Heritage.

""Paul Dans was terminated from the Heritage Foundation due to a number of related issues, including his dismissive and unprofessional approach to interacting with a number of his colleagues,"" Kelly Adams, director of people operations at Heritage, told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP HITS BACK AT HARRIS WITH 'KAMALA'S PROJECT 2025'

""After some specific disconcerting interactions were brought to the attention of senior management, an internal review was conducted, and a decision was made to separate Mr. Dans' employment as amicably as possible.""

At the time, Dans was said to be stepping down as the Project 2025 head.

But Heritage soon reportedly received multiple communications from Dans that accused the think tank of terminating him on false grounds.

""I was made a scapegoat by The Heritage Foundation to cover up for their own mishandling of the public relations fiasco over Project 2025,"" Dans told Real Clear Politics. ""It appears that the Heritage Foundation continues to trash my good name and professional reputation for their benefit.""

The Heritage Foundation defended its decision and said it was Dans' workplace behavior that led to his firing.

HERITAGE FOUNDATION PRESIDENT CONFIRMS TRUMP HAD NO INVOLVEMENT IN PROJECT 2025

""The Heritage Foundation deeply values all of our staff and is committed in both practice and principle to maintaining a positive work environment where abusive or demeaning behavior is not welcome,"" Adams said.

""We are deeply disappointed that Mr. Dans is using the liberal media to attack Heritage's decision to terminate him, thereby making the rationale behind his dismissal public. We will not allow him to falsely attack Heritage and its people, without defending the difficult decision to terminate Paul's employment based on facts. We will continue to defend our staff and our institution from false narratives and disgruntled former employees.""

New reports have surfaced detailing Dans' behavior leading up to the termination, specifically allegations about his conduct at the Republican National Convention in July, when he reportedly cursed at colleagues while critiquing their performance and was issued a warning by Heritage President Kevin Roberts.

""He was being so demeaning,"" a source told Real Clear Politics. ""It was constant, and he refused to listen.""

After he was fired, Dans, through his legal counsel, reportedly sought $3.1 million from Heritage and wanted the funds delivered in two days, according to documents reviewed by RCP. Heritage rejected the request.

Soon after he was fired, Dans became a vocal critic of the Trump campaign, telling The New York Times in September the former president should replace two of his senior advisers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. Dans claimed their mismanagement had prevented Trump from surging ahead of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is downplaying past disagreements with former President Donald Trump following a meeting in New York City.

Zelenskyy visited Trump Tower on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee, then sat down with Fox News' Griff Jenkins to discuss what seems to have been a good-spirited conversation.

""We understand that even in any kind of future negotiations, Ukraine has to be strong. That's what it's about,"" Zelenskyy told Jenkins when asked why he met with Trump. ""We spoke with Biden, Kamala Harris, Donald Trump and the Congress of the United States.""

TRUMP MEETS UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY AT TRUMP TOWER, SAYS RUSSIA'S WAR MUST END WITH 'FAIR DEAL'

Jenkins pressed Zelenskyy about his comments that appeared in a New Yorker article earlier this week -- in which he was quoted saying that he believes Trump ""doesn't really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how"" -- and whether Trump had said anything to change Zelenskyy's mind.

""No, I said that I think that we understand much more better than everybody, really, including Donald Trump, what's going on in Ukraine and how to stop him. It's difficult to understand,"" Zelenskyy responded.

The Ukrainian president said his country is now a completely different nation from the one that was first invaded in 2022.

ZELESNKYY SAYS 'TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW PUTIN,' RUSSIAN DICTATOR WILL 'NEVER STOP'

""Ukraine, during the war in Ukraine before the full-scale invasion -- two different countries. So without this experience, you can't really understand how to stop [Russian President Vladimir Putin],"" Zelenskyy continued. ""And that's what I wanted to share to president . . . and the price of this tragedy of bloody invasion of Putin.""

At one point during their meeting, Trump told the press that he had a ""good relationship"" with both Zelenskyy and Putin. Zelenskyy then interjected to say he hopes the U.S. has a better relationship with Ukraine than Russia.

Jenkins asked the Ukrainian president whether Trump's comment about maintaining a good relationship with Putin concerned him.

Zelenskyy said he was not necessarily concerned, acknowledging that ""Trump has relations and had relations when he was the president, during his term"" and maintains ""relations with a lot of countries and a lot of UN leaders.""

During the exclusive interview, Zelenskyy lamented the lack of response Putin received from the rest of the world when Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2014 with the taking of Crimea.

""Nobody kicked him, and that meant he understood that he can occupy it and go further. He can occupy new territories of Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. ""He began to prepare to do this -- his plan -- and he did it."""
481,US warships come under attack in Red Sea as nearly two dozen incoming missiles and drones shot down,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-warships-under-attack-red-sea-nearly-2-dozen-incoming-missiles-drones-shot-down,2024-09-27T19:42:40Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst provides details on Israel's latest attack on Hezbollah, as it remains unclear whether Hassan Nasrallah was killed.

Three U.S. warships came under attack Friday off the coast of Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have disrupted commercial shipping in the region, but no one was hurt, officials said.

The warships shot down nearly two dozen incoming missiles and drones while transiting a narrow entrance into the Red Sea. None of the vessels was hit, and no sailors on board were hurt, a U.S. official told Fox News.

The USS Stockdale and USS Spruance, along with a littoral combat ship, the USS Indianapolis, were transiting the Bab al-Mandab Strait when the naval warships came under attack from a barrage of incoming ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones, the officials said.

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""We did see a complex attack launched from the Houthis that ranged from cruise missiles and waves,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday. ""My understanding is that those were either engaged in, shot down or failed.""

The Stockdale and Spruance are part of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group that recently arrived in the Middle East from the Pacific.

U.S. forces have struck back at Houthi militants on multiple occasions for nearly a year. The rebel group has routinely attacked commercial and military vessels at sea over Israel's war against Hamas.

The number of commercial ships passing through the Red Sea has dropped by 90% since the attacks began after the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. Since then, U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack dozens of times. In January, three American soldiers were killed in Jordan.

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

The Houthis recently attacked a Greek-flagged oil tanker, which carried four times the amount of oil that spilled from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. No major oil spill occurred, and officials said the fires on board the vessel were contained.

The ship was towed into port after being adrift in the Red Sea for days with flames visible on deck.

During her debate with former President Trump, Vice President Harris claimed, ""As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.""

At the time of Harris's comments, elite American commandos had just conducted a raid into western Iraq, days prior, to kill ISIS leaders. A number of soldiers were wounded, including one who took shrapnel to his leg, which required surgery.

MSNBC contributor Katty Kay said Vice President Kamala Harris' and former President Trump's campaigns were appealing to voters with ""different"" ideas about masculinity.

During a segment on ""Morning Joe"" on Friday, Kay teased her interview with second gentleman Doug Emhoff on her ""The Rest Is Politics: US"" podcast with Anthony Scaramucci. In the interview, Emhoff talked about giving up his career as an attorney when Harris was tapped as President Biden's running mate in 2020.

""What would you say to young men who the Trump campaign is appealing to with a kind of slightly retro, macho view of what masculinity is?"" Kay asked him. ""Young men who might want to be in a position one day of supporting their spouse but are worried that it would diminish their own masculinity? Do you think now that you're in a position to reach those young men?""

""It's something I think about all the time,"" Emhoff responded. ""For me, it just came very naturally. I think it's the era we kind of grew up in...For me it was very normal...and I think that's why Kamala and I really bonded.""

""I've also learned I can't lecture, I can't be a scold. I can't tell people what to do, especially in this area, I just have to say, 'Look, here's what I do, here's why I do it, here's why it's important to me.'...Women succeeding doesn't hurt men. It actually helps all of us...the economics prove it out.""

Emhoff added that men can be strong and defend their families while also being supportive of their wives' careers.

""Both things can exist at the same time,"" he said.

""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski reacted to the interview on Friday's MSNBC show, saying, ""Boy, a contrast in many ways, between the two campaigns.""

There seems to be ""two different views of masculinity,"" Kay said, about the GOP and Democratic presidential campaigns.

""There's this kind of alpha, retro view of masculinity we're seeing from the Trump campaign, and then you got Tim Walz and Doug Emhoff, who are both professional men but are in sort of supportive roles of a woman who's the principal candidate,"" she continued.

Earlier in the program, Kay said that the Harris-Walz campaign was making efforts to reach male voters, as some polls show Harris' support is being driven by likely female voters.

Kay said that Emhoff is hoping to ""lead by example"" with his own representation of masculinity to attract more male supporters to the campaign.

""But he hopes that, leading by example, by talking about the fact that he loves his wife, that you can make space for women to the rise to the top and it wont diminish your masculinity. That's really what he's trying to do...and he's authentic about it,"" she said.

During the Democratic National Convention, CNN's Dana Bash made a similar argument, saying that Democrats want to win over men who ""understand that it's OK in 2024 to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman.""

""They are doing so in trying to put forward male figures, Tim Walz being one of them, Doug Emhoff last night, who can speak to men out there who might not be the sort of testosterone-laden, you know, gun-toting kind of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and the kind of players that came out at the RNC,"" she said."

Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff agreed with MSNBC host Jen Psaki that former President Trump was ""putting a target on the backs of Jewish Americans.""

In a preview for an interview airing on MSNBC on Sunday, Emhoff told the former Biden White House press secretary that he was bothered by Trump's recent remarks at a Jewish event in Washington, where the Republican nominee warned Jewish American voters against supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, Emhoff's wife, in the upcoming election.

In those comments, Trump told Jewish voters, who've traditionally supported the Democratic Party, that they would be partly responsible if he lost in November.

""What really bothered me a week or so ago was when Trump got up at an event, an event purporting to fight antisemitism, and he said vile antisemitic things,"" Emhoff told Psaki. ""Tropes that are just terrible. We have to speak out every single time when something like that happens.""

TRUMP SUGGESTS HE COULD WIN 50% OF JEWISH VOTE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SHOWDOWN AGAINST HARRIS

""When you hear him say things like that, and he said that if he doesn't win it will be essentially the fault of Jewish Americans,"" Psaki said.

""Blame the Jews. One of the oldest tropes,"" Emhoff lamented.

Psaki followed up by asking him if he was worried that Trump was ""putting a target on the backs of Jewish Americans,"" to which Emhoff agreed.

""He is. I mean, take him at his word,"" he said.

""[Trump] lies about a lot of things, but you have got to take him at his word on things like this. So yeah. This is a disgusting trope. The so-called dual loyalties. It is an outrage and it is not just Jewish people who should be outraged,"" the Second Gentleman continued before arguing that every American needed to fight back against ""antisemitism and hate.""

""Do you think he's antisemitic when he says things like that?"" Psaki asked. ""You look at him and see the repetition of this type of words and language as antisemitic?""

""Of course it is, and I said that publicly,"" Emhoff replied. ""Definitely.""

DOUG EMHOFF ONLY ONE OF FOUR WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPALS TO CALL JEWISH STUDENTS INTIMIDATED BY PROTESTS: REPORT

Emhoff was referring to Trump's comments at the Israeli-American Council National Summit last week, in which he honored victims of the October 7 attacks and warned Jewish Americans there would be grave consequences if they didn't support him in the November election.

""My promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House,"" Trump said. ""But in all fairness, I already am,"" he added, Fox5 reported.

The former president also warned Jewish voters that Israel would ""cease to exist"" in two years if Harris won the November election and said that Jewish voters who support Democrats need to get ""[their] head examined.""

""If I don't win this election - and Jewish people would have a lot to do with that, 60 percent are voting for the enemy - Israel will cease to exist in two years,"" Trump said, according to The Hill. ""I believe I'm 100 percent right.... If I do win, Israel will be safe and secure, and we'll stop the toxic poison of antisemitism.""

Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded with this statement to Fox News Digital:

""This is another example of inflammatory rhetoric coming from the Harris campaign that could result in more violence against Jewish people when antisemitism is already on the rise in America, as evidenced by the disgraceful anti-Semitic protests that erupted on college campuses on Kamala Harris' watch.

Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions are loose on the streets, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data provided to lawmakers this week.

The agency provided data to Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, about national data for illegal immigrants with criminal charges or convictions. The data, as of July 2024, is broken down by those in detention, and those who are not in detention -- known as the non-detained docket. The non-detained docket includes illegal immigrants who have final orders of removal or are going through removal proceedings but are not detained in ICE custody. There are currently more than 7 million people on that docket.

The data says that, among those not in detention, there are 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges.

ICE NON-DETAINED DOCKET EXPLODES TO 7.4M CASES

Those include 62,231 convicted of assault, 14,301 convicted of burglary, 56,533 with drug convictions and 13,099 convicted of homicide. An additional 2,521 have kidnapping convictions and 15,811 have sexual assault convictions.

There are an additional 1,845 with pending homicide charges, 42,915 with assault charges, 3,266 with burglary charges and 4,250 with assault charges.

""As of July 21, 2024, there were 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on ICE's national docket -- 13,099 criminally convicted MURDERS!"" Gonzales said in a statement. ""Americans deserve to be SAFE in our own communities.""

In a statement accompanying the latter, ICE took aim at so-called ""sanctuary"" cities, which refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement in deporting illegal immigrant criminals.

""ICE recognizes that some jurisdictions are concerned that cooperating with federal immigration officials will erode trust with immigrant communities and make it harder for local law enforcement to serve those populations. However, 'sanctuary' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,"" it said.

It also stressed DHS' efforts to remove illegal immigrants: ""From mid-May 2023 through the end of July 2024, DHS removed or returned more than 893,600 individuals, including more than 138,300 individuals in family units. The majority of all individuals encountered at the Southwest Border over the past three years have been removed, returned, or expelled.""

'POLITICAL STUNT': CRITICS DISMISS HARRIS' EXPECTED ARIZONA BORDER VISIT AS IMMIGRATION REMAINS TOP ISSUE

However, the Biden administration came under fire for releasing many migrants who came to the U.S. border into the interior, which coincided with a sharp drop in deportations as it focused on prioritizing public safety and national security threats. There were 142,580 removals in FY 23, up considerably from 72,177 in FY 22 and 59,011 in FY 21, but still down from the highs of 267,258 under the Trump administration in FY 19.

The number of illegal immigrants on the non-detained docket, meanwhile, has soared from 3.7 million in FY 2021 to nearly 4.8 million in FY 2022 to over 7 million in FY 2023.

Republicans have blamed the border crisis on the policies of the administration, including rolling back Trump policies that limited ""catch and release.""

""It may be shocking to hear that the Biden-Harris administration is actively releasing tens of thousands of criminal illegal aliens into our communities, but their own numbers conclusively prove this to be the case. This defies all common sense,"" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green told Fox News Digital. ""Under President Biden and his 'border czar,' Vice President Harris, DHS law enforcement has been directed to mass-release illegal aliens whom they know have criminal convictions or are facing charges for serious crimes -- and these dangerous, destructive individuals are making their way into every city and state in this country. How many more Americans need to die or be victimized before this administration is forced to abide by the laws they swore to uphold? This is madness. It is something no civilized, well-functioning society should tolerate.""

The administration has said it needs more funding and reforms from Congress, including via a bipartisan Senate bill introduced this year - which has been rejected by Republicans.

""Despite the challenges of operating within a broken immigration system, and in the face of an enormous workload and consistently limited funding, DHS continues to enforce the law to secure our borders.

That bill would increase the number of ICE detention beds, but critics of the administration have pointed to numbers showing not all beds are being filled currently.

The data's release comes as Vice President Kamala Harris visits the southern border in Arizona as she seeks to blunt criticism from former President Trump on the matter. Conservatives were not swayed by the visit.

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has had nearly four years to protect America and failed,"" RJ Hauman, president of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE), told Fox News Digital in response to the data.

Janelle King react to VP Harris' border trip in three years and compare border policy of Trump versus Harris.

Vice President Kamala Harris heads to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona on Friday, the first time she has been to the border since a visit to El Paso in 2021 and coming on the heels of her campaign being dogged by her past on the subject of illegal immigration.

Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and the Border Patrol Union who argue that she is weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel.

""After years of not just ignoring the problem, but helping create it, Vice President Kamala is finally headed down to the border,"" the National Border Patrol Council said in a statement. ""This is nothing more than for her to check the box, but what it is in reality, is a slap in the face towards the men and women that put their lives on the line every day, and also a slap in the face to the American public. Where has she been?""

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

Harris' campaign has pointed to her past as a prosecutor, taking on transnational criminal gangs, and says she is the candidate to secure the border as she backs a bipartisan funding bill.

But Harris has a lengthy history on immigration at the national level.

Harris, as a California senator, was on the far-left of the Democratic Party on immigration, and in 2018 she pushed her colleagues in the Senate to reject a request by the Trump administration for more funding for immigration detention beds and Border Patrol agents.

In a letter to senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee in 2018, Harris and other senators called for them to ""reject President Trump's FY 19 funding request for a costly and ineffective border wall, new Border Patrol agents, and a large increase in U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and detention beds.""

""We urge you to reduce funding for the administration's reckless immigration enforcement operations that are tearing families apart and harming our economy.""

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

She also grilled Ronald Vitiello, who was former President Trump's nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whether he was ""aware of the perception"" of parallels between ICE and the KKK.

""Are you aware that there is a perception that ICE is administering its power in a way that is causing fear and intimidation, particularly among immigrants and specifically among immigrants coming from Mexico and Central America?"" she asked again.

In recently revealed footage, Harris is seen at a rally chanting ""Up, up with education, down, down with deportation"" at a rally which also featured now-disgraced actor Jussie Smollett.

Harris launched a bid for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2019. Her campaign included a promise to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) by executive order, which gives protection to illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors.

She said that she would eliminate age requirements on applications and use parole authority to create a ""parole in place"" program to put those illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship.

Also she promised to shield illegal immigrant parents of American citizens and green card holders from deportation by executive order. Overall, her plan was predicted to protect over six million illegal immigrants from deportation.

Harris became vice president in 2021 and the administration immediately rolled back a number of Trump-era initiatives and attempted to place a moratorium on deportations.

Migrant numbers skyrocketed, and Biden told reporters in March that Harris would be put in charge of tackling root causes, issues like climate change, poverty and violence that the administration believes was driving migrants north.

It quickly led to Harris being dubbed by media outlets and Republicans as the ""border czar."" The White House rejected that title, but it has stuck with her ever since and made her a figurehead along with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the crisis.

After the assignment by Biden, and with numbers skyrocketing through subsequent months to record highs, Harris immediately came under pressure to visit the border as the White House said her role was more diplomatic than related to the border directly. She instead went to Mexico and Guatemala and had a stern message for migrants that upset immigrant activists.

""Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders,"" she said. ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back.""

The pressure kept rising for her to go to the U.S. border.

""You haven't been to the border,"" NBC's Lester Holt told her, after she claimed she had been to the border.

""And I haven't been to Europe,"" Harris quipped.

Later that month, she went to the border in El Paso, Texas, where she received a briefing and toured a processing center while meeting with advocates and providers.

Harris would largely be unseen through the rest of 2021 and 2022 on the root causes strategy, although a private sector initiative to draw investment to tackle those root causes would continue.

In June 2022, she traveled to the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles and met with other leaders to discuss ways to handle the crisis. During that summit, she announced that $3.2 billion in commitments from private sector companies had been secured.

She also came under fire for declaring the border was secure despite the ongoing crisis and mass releases into the interior.

""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed,"" Harris said on NBC.

Harris made few appearances in 2023 relating to the border crisis, although her private investment strategy continued to bring in additional commitments from companies.

But the crisis did not stay out of the news, and 2023 broke new records for enormous amounts of migrant encounters and a number of chaotic scenes at the border.

Fiscal year 2023 broke the record for encounters with over 2.4 million, while December had nearly 250,000 encounters in a single month.

While the White House continued to reject the ""border czar"" narrative, Harris put her support behind a bipartisan Senate agreement to provide more funding to the border and reduce migrant crossings when they reach a certain level.

She also backed a number of executive orders by President Biden, who would implement a limit on asylum and efforts to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are spouses of U.S. citizens.

She has sought to portray herself as tougher on the border than former President Trump.

Now, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, she aims to show that she is better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.

""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

Along with the border stop, the Harris campaign is launching a new ad that will play in Arizona and other battleground states that spotlights her past border efforts and plans.

""She put cartel members and drug traffickers behind bars, and she will secure our border,"" the narrator in the commercial says.

The meeting at Trump Tower comes just after Zelenskyy met with Harris in Washington, D.C.

As fracking continues to be a key issue in many of the Rust Belt swing states that could decide the 2024 presidential election, incumbent Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing increased criticism from his GOP opponent for previously held positions on the matter.

In 2021, Brown was one of 43 senators to vote against a bill to ""establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to prohibiting the Council on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating rules or guidance that bans hydraulic fracturing in the United States.""

Brown also voted no on a motion in the Senate in 2022 giving states ""sole authority"" to permit and enforce fracking regulations.

While speaking to CNN in 2020, Brown suggested that most of the fracking jobs in Ohio go to ""out of state"" workers and that ""there just aren't that many jobs in fracking or, unfortunately, even coal in Ohio now"" when answering a question about his level of concern about Ohio workers losing their jobs in the fracking industry.

VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR RIPPED FOR IGNORING QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S PUSH TO 'BAN' GAS-POWERED CARS

Some estimates have suggested that fracking supports over 300,000 jobs in Ohio and contributed $55 billion to the state's economy in 2021.

When confronted by Fox News reporter Hillary Vaughn on the issue of fracking and VP Harris backing away from her position to ban fracking, Brown declined to call Harris out for changing positions and said he believes in an ""all of the above strategy.""

However, his critics say he is more in line with the progressive ""Green New Deal,"" than he is the oil and gas industry in Ohio.

""Sherrod Brown is in lockstep with San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris on all of her radical policies, including a complete ban on fracking. Brown and Harris would rather rely on our adversaries for energy instead of using our resources here at home,"" Brown's GOP opponent, businessman Bernie Moreno, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""In November, Ohioans will reject their radical, anti-energy agenda.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a Brown campaign spokesperson said the senator ""supports fracking"" when it's ""done right.""

""Bernie Moreno is lying and trying to distract from his long record only looking out for himself -- from refusing to pay his employees the overtime they were owed and shredding the evidence to get out of it to selling the Chinese-made Buick Envision, which shipped Ohio jobs overseas,"" the spokesperson said.

""Sherrod has been clear that he supports fracking and shale development when it's done right and supports Ohio workers, has led legislation to connect Ohio workers with jobs in the shale and fracking industry, and has stood up to his own party to protect Ohio jobs.""

The Police Leaders for Community Safety said Monday that it is endorsing Harris, in an announcement shared first with Fox News.

The organization - which says it is led by a diverse group of prominent police professionals who have been at the helm of numerous major national law enforcement leadership groups - highlights that its mission is to champion ""policies to make communities and the people in them safer, improve and evolve policing, and safeguard the rule of law.""

The backing by the group, which was formed in June, gives Harris support from a major law enforcement group following the endorsement earlier this month of Trump by the National Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest police union.

And earlier this year, Trump also landed the endorsement of another major law enforcement union - the International Union of Police Associations - as well as the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO).

NATION'S LARGEST AND OLDEST POLICE UNION MAKES AN ENDORSEMENT IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

""This endorsement reflects Vice President Harris' track record and unwavering commitment to public safety and the rule of law,"" Sue Riseling, chair of Police Leaders for Community Safety, said.

Police Leaders for Community Safety board member David Mahoney, a former Dane County, Wisconsin, sheriff and past president of the National Sheriffs' Association, said that Harris ""spent her prosecutorial career protecting people, supporting victims and holding accountable those who have harmed others and betrayed the public trust. As a lawmaker, she has fought hard for the critical law enforcement-backed policies needed to fight crime and protect the public.""

CASH DASH: THIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HOLDS A SUBSTANTIAL FUNDRAISING LEAD

Additionally, Board Vice Chair Rick Myers, a former police chief in eight communities in multiple states, said that ""too many politicians call themselves tough on crime and say they support law enforcement but then don't have the courage to do what is right to keep us safe...We need a leader who will protect both the 2nd Amendment and our nation from the scourge of gun violence, and that leader is Kamala Harris.""

Regardless of downward trends in many crime categories nationally, crime remains a leading issue on the minds of American voters.

Trump has argued that Harris, a former prosecutor, San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, is soft on crime and anti-police and has blamed her for persistent crime issues in San Francisco.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN

The former president and GOP nominee has called for more aggressive policing, less oversight by the federal government, and more military equipment for local police departments.

Harris has spotlighted Trump's legal controversies - he made history earlier this year as the first former or current president convicted of a felony - and argues he has been hostile to law enforcement that has investigated him.

The vice president and Democratic Party nominee spotlights the Biden-Harris administration's record on law enforcement funding through pandemic relief funds. She advocates for stronger federal oversight and less military equipment for local police departments.

Harris campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, in a statement following the endorsement, noted that ""as a prosecutor who has stood with law enforcement throughout her entire career, Vice President Harris took a tough and smart approach on crime: increasing conviction rates, holding violent criminals accountable, and keeping communities safe. She also worked tirelessly to make the criminal justice system more fair - especially for communities of color.""

She argued that ""this November, Americans will choose between someone who spent her career enforcing the rule of law and someone who has been convicted of breaking them.""

489,Democrats skip testimony from GOP lawmakers with sniper experience at Trump assassination attempt hearing,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/democrats-skip-testimony-from-gop-lawmakers-sniper-experience-trump-assassination-attempt-hearing,2024-09-27T12:39:01Z,"Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the investigation into the Butler, Pa., shooting on Special Report.

Democratic lawmakers on the House task force investigating the attempted assassinations of former President Donald Trump skipped the final portion of the panel's first hearing Thursday, which featured the two Republicans who have been conducting their own ""parallel"" investigation into the shooting.

Reps. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., and Cory Mills, R-Fla., two Republicans and both military veterans, took part in the second portion of the hearing, but the Democratic minority fumed behind the scenes that their leadership was not informed of their testimony until late Wednesday afternoon, Fox News sources said. Some Democratic lawmakers were not informed until Thursday morning, however.

The move was seen as the first bipartisan split in what has been a united effort to investigate the incident thus far.

SECRET SERVICE BOSS SAYS VITAL INFO NOT RELAYED OVER RADIO, DELAYING RESPONSE TO WOULD-BE RALLY ASSASSIN

""We did not receive notice of the second panel until late yesterday. We didn't have an opportunity to present our own witnesses,"" Crow said when asked about Mills and Crane. ""[Task Force Chairman Mike Kelly, R-Pa.] and I are still very committed to having this be bipartisan, consensus-based, and it's my hope that we can return to that ... approach going forward.""

Kelly similarly told reporters that this would not impede the task force's bipartisan mission and said that he invited Mills and Crane to testify because of their expertise, welcoming their assessment of the security perimeter for the rally.

He brushed off Democrats' absence during their portion of the hearing, suggesting that some members may have had flights out of Washington, D.C., per KTLA.

""If you want to participate, you can participate. If you decide not to, you can make that decision too,"" Kelly said of the members.

Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., the ranking Democrat on the panel, said lawmakers were frustrated, but he made clear that it was not aimed at Thursday's witnesses.

""We did not receive notice of the second panel until late yesterday,"" Crow said. ""It's unclear to us what testimony will be provided by these witnesses that relates to today's hearing.""

The first portion of the hearing, the panel heard from a former Secret Service agent, as well as local and state law enforcement officials who were present at the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where one attendee was killed and Trump himself was shot in the ear.

TRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW GUNMAN EVADED SECURITY

Witnesses and lawmakers repeatedly signaled that a lack of clear communication of security plans from the Secret Service helped lead to a 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, being able to open fire on the rally from a rooftop just outside the security perimeter.

""In the days leading up to the rally, it was not a single mistake that allowed Crooks to outmaneuver one of our country's most elite group of security professionals. There were security failures on multiple fronts,"" Kelly said.

""The communication between the Secret Service and local and state partners was disjointed and unclear,"" Crow said. ""It was the fault of the Secret Service, because the Secret Service is ultimately responsible for the protection at events like that. They did not do their job. They did not provide the clarity and the guidance to local law enforcement. That was pretty clear to me,"" Crow told reporters.

One bullet grazed Trump's right ear, while firefighter Corey Comperatore was fatally struck. Rally-goers James Copenhaver and David Dutch were also shot and injured.

One key question has been why there were no law enforcement personnel on top of the AGR building where Crooks eventually climbed up and took his shots, considering that it was so close to the rally stage and afforded a clear line of sight to Trump.

""A 10-year-old looking at that satellite image could have seen that the greatest threat posed to the president that day"" was the building near the stage, said Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas.

The panel -- comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats -- has spent the last two months analyzing the security failures at the rally, conducting nearly two dozen interviews with law enforcement and receiving more than 2,800 pages of documents from the Secret Service.

An interim report released Wednesday from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is also conducting an investigation, said the Secret Service failed to give clear instructions on how state and local officials should cover the building where the gunman eventually took up position. The report also said the agency didn't make sure it could share information with local partners in real-time.

Multiple lawmakers indicated that they are looking to hear from Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe again, particularly after Congress recently allocated $230 million in additional funding for the agency."

Muffet McGraw, a two-time NCAA women's basketball champion head coach with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, blamed former President Donald Trump for the hateful messages WNBA players have received.

McGraw posted a lengthy statement and pointed to Trump giving ""permission"" for people to use social media to direct nasty messages to people who do not look like them. She also urged her followers to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris for president.

""Sports are a microcosm of society. We showcase how a group of diverse people, White, Black, straight, gay, religious or not, can come together united by something bigger than ourselves,"" McGraw's statement read. ""We are teammates, who are striving for the same goals, sacrificing personal accolades for the good of the group. We role model how to put 'we' before 'me.' But we are starting to lose the joy in team celebrations because we are being overrun by trolls who never played or coached the game at a high level but are suddenly self-proclaimed experts on what we do.

""The current climate in our country is one of division and hate. Anyone who doesn't look like us or believe what we do is now the enemy. The hates are trolling with alarming rage & escalated violent threats. How did we get here?

""Short answer: Donald Trump got us here. He gave permission for people to be outwardly racist, homophobic, misogynistic and cruel (not that it was OK to be any of those inwardly). His complete lack of civility, decorum, and his pension for infantile name calling, blaming & blatant lying have made it OK for others to do the same.

STRANGEST, HARDEST AND MOST PAINFUL THINGS CAITLIN CLARK HAD TO ENDURE AS A WNBA ROOKIE

""Cowards who hide behind a fake name on social media are not just hurting our game, they are destroying our country. So what are we gonna do about it? It's not the league office or the Fever who control the posts of these petulant, churlish cream puffs. Yes, they could prob do more but it's on all of us to fight back.

""Let's take Kamala Harris' advice and choose hope. IF you really want to see change you have to vote for it! Meanwhile, Let's focus on what's good about our game. Let's come together and start supporting and encouraging women. Let's stand up and have the courage to use our voice to let people know that we have their back.

""There's an old saying that if you aren't part of the solution, you are part of the problem. So, what are YOU doing to combat hate? Be a spark and maybe we can ignite the world.""

McGraw's statement came after Connecticut Sun star Alyssa Thomas called out Indiana Fever fans over ""racial comments"" and guard DiJonai Carrington receiving racist emails.

The WNBA condemned racism against players in a statement.

""The WNBA is a competitive league with some of the most elite athletes in the world,"" the league said. ""While we welcome a growing fan base, the WNBA will not tolerate racist, derogatory, or threatening comments made about players, teams and anyone affiliated with the league.

The State Board of Elections announced Thursday that 747,000 people have been removed from voter rolls in the last 20 months due to ineligibility.

""The county boards follow careful policies to ensure that only ineligible records are removed, not those of eligible voters,"" the Board of Elections said in a press release.

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

""Meanwhile, newly eligible voters are constantly being added to the registration rolls in our growing state,"" the board added. ""Currently, North Carolina has nearly 7.7 million registered voters.""

A common reason for removal from voter rolls was moving residences -- either within the state without notifying election officials or to another state altogether.

Other removed individuals failed to vote in the last two federal elections and did not respond to follow-up notifications from the government seeking to confirm their registration.

Death, felony conviction, requests to be removed, and lack of U.S. citizenship were also listed as reasons for dropping individuals from voter rolls.

The Marist Poll released Thursday finds that Harris and Trump are tied at 49% among likely voters in North Carolina who were asked which candidate they were leaning toward. Of those polled who have made up their minds, 91% said they strongly support their choice.

North Carolina last voted for a Democratic president in 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama won the state by 0.3 points, or 14,177 votes.

North Carolina began absentee voting for registered voters on Tuesday, having begun sending absentee ballots to military and overseas voters on Friday. Applicants do not need to provide an excuse to receive a ballot.

The state must receive a ballot application by Oct. 29, and that ballot must be delivered to county officials by Nov. 5.

President Biden is resisting Republican demands to warn Iran in no uncertain terms that killing former President Trump would be an act of war.

The White House declined to comment on the specific demands but referred to a statement on the recent Iranian threats to Trump's life.

""We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,"" National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savitt said.

Savitt said Iran has long sought revenge against Trump and his officials for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.

""We have ensured that appropriate agencies are continuously and promptly providing the former president's security detail with evolving threat information. Additionally, President Biden has reiterated his directive that the United States Secret Service should receive every resource, capability and protective measure required to address those evolving threats to the former president.""

TRUMP BRIEFED ON 'REAL AND SPECIFIC' THREATS TO ASSASSINATE HIM

On Tuesday, top U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump about threats from Iran to assassinate him, his campaign said.

On Wednesday, Trump prodded Biden to warn Iran it was risking hot war with the U.S. with such threats.

""As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of, and they may or may not involve - but possibly do - Iran,"" Trump said at a campaign event in North Carolina.

""If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, in this case Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens,"" he added.

Trump said he and the nation had been ""threatened very directly by Iran"" and the regime needed to know the consequences of harming a U.S. political candidate.

""The best way to do it is through the office of the president, that [if] you do any attacks on former presidents or candidates for president, your country gets blown to smithereens, as we say.""

House Intelligence Chair Mike Turner also demanded Biden warn Iran.

""President Biden and Vice President Harris must make it clear to Iran that any attempt on President Trump's life would be an act of war,"" the Ohio Republican said in a statement Thursday.

But it comes as Middle East watchers believe Iran could be weeks to months away from the capacity to build a nuclear weapon - fast approaching the capability to enrich uranium to the 90% threshold and with renewed activity at two nuclear weapons test sites.

Trump also called it ""strange"" to see that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was in New York this week and was offered substantial protection as he attended the United Nations General Assembly.

DOES IRAN WANT KAMALA HARRIS TO WIN? EXPERTS WEIGH IN

""We have large security forces guarding him, and yet they're threatening our former president and the leading candidate to become the next president of the United States,"" Trump said, referring to himself.

Against the backdrop of Israel's four-front war for its very existence, the United Nations, with the support of anti-Israel elected officials in the U.S. and elsewhere, are circling the wagons to ensure that UNRWA will continue to brainwash generations of Palestinian children to deny the 3,500-year link of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and the Jewish state's legitimacy.

A new bill launched by anti-Israel members in Congress demands that the U.S. resume its funding of UNRWA, which is currently blocked under U.S. law. This initiative comes as the United Nations insists that all UNRWA employees are legally immune from any prosecution.

This presumably includes UNRWA employees who were members of Hamas and who participated in the Oct 7 Hamas crimes against humanity in southern Israel, where 1,200 Israelis, among them entire Jewish families, were mass murdered and mutilated. Young Israeli women in peaceful communities and at the Nova Peace concert raped, with hundreds kidnapped - dead and alive - to be brutalized and bartered by Hamas for the release of thousands of Palestinian terrorists held by Israel.

The audacity and hypocrisy of a renewed pro-UNRWA campaign is breathtaking. The United Nations has done less than zero to gain the release of innocent hostages taken by Hamas on Oct 7. In fact, U.N. officials and special rapporteurs were eerily silent or, worse, excused Hamas' brutal pogrom.

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT. 7

And when it comes to the United Nations, words - spoken and unspoken - do count.

Top U.N. officials we recently met with refused to label Hamas a terrorist organization. That policy allows UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini to insist that, for the U.N., ""Hamas is not a terrorist group... it is a political movement"".

Lazzarini has refused to say whether UNRWA even considers Hamas a ""militant or armed group."" He hasn't said that membership in an armed group is a sufficient cause for not hiring a person by UNRWA or terminating his or her employment.

Lazzarini has not taken any action to enforce the prohibition on membership in armed groups, let alone take steps to ensure to its donor states that it will identify and dismiss employees who are members of armed groups.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

He has neither investigated, suspended nor fired 100 UNRWA staff whom Israel submits are Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad's military operatives.

The bottom line is that the day after the war in Gaza ends, unless there is strong opposition from the United States, Hamas is still well-positioned to take back the reins of power over the lives of the people of Gaza and over the minds and hearts of Palestinian children.

Some months ago, I had the opportunity to speak directly to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department. I told him that UNRWA cannot be part of the solution for ""the day after"" in Gaza when it has been a core problem for decades.

As of now, the plans of the U.S. for the day after in Gaza remain unclear.

Events on the ground, and the blood-curdling indifference to Jewish lives and Jewish life by the United Nations only reinforces our fears about the future for Palestinian children and the children of Israel - from Sderot to the Golan Heights.

Vice President Harris stops in battleground Arizona on Friday to hold a campaign event along the U.S. southern border with Mexico as the Democrat presidential nominee works to turn the issue of immigration and border security from a negative into a positive.

Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and his allies who argue she's weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel. Harris has faced intense criticism over the surge of migrants across the nation's southern border during the first three years of President Biden's administration.

The Trump campaign, on the eve of Harris' first border visit as a presidential nominee, called it a ""political ploy.""

But Harris, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, aims to show that she's better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

The vice president is expected to speak about how she is pushing what she describes as the toughest bipartisan border security plan in a generation, a measure that includes new border agents and technologies to stop fentanyl trafficking.

And she's expected to reiterate her argument that Trump ""has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.""

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

She has repeatedly pointed to a border security bill with some bipartisan support that had been making its way through Congress this year before Republicans turned against the measure after prompting from Trump.

Harris has said that the former president ""tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election"" and has pledged that ""as the president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.""

Since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket more than two months ago, Harris has described herself as a former ""border state prosecutor"" who took on international gangs and criminal organizations behind illegal drug, gun and human trafficking across the border.

The description comes as Harris and her campaign have also spotlighted a tougher stance on border security while still pushing for a pathway to citizenship for some migrants.

""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the ""border czar"" both by the media and some Republicans, although the White House has rejected that description. And the vice president has been pilloried over her role as ""Biden's border czar"" by Trump and his allies.

Trump, as he runs to win back his old job in the White House, is calling for a major crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border and has suggested using police and the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

Speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Harris was traveling to the southern border for ""political reasons.""

""When Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero,"" Trump said. ""I hope you're going to remember that on Friday. When she tells you about the border, ask her just one simple question: 'Why didn't you do it four years ago?'""

And Trump has said the policies of the Biden-Harris administration have allowed millions of people to enter the U.S. illegally.

In June, after the collapse of the bipartisan border security bill, Biden announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials say the U.S.-Mexico border is overwhelmed. Following the implementation of the new rules through executive orders, arrests for illegal border crossings have plummeted.

Polls indicate that immigration and abortion are two of the top issues on the minds of American voters, following the economy and inflation.

And public opinion surveys, including those from Fox News, indicate that by double digits Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris handling the issue.

Trump last visited the border during a stop last month in Arizona, which is one of the seven crucial battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the presidential election.

""Events, dear boy, events."" That's what the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan said remain the greatest challenge facing a political campaign. Back in January 2023, I wrote that the 2024 campaign would likely hinge less on the actual campaigns than on a set of ""Known-Unknowns,"" - the economy, Ukraine, and the Middle East wind up playing out.

At the time, it seemed that President Joe Biden would be running and the GOP nominee wasn't known. Two years later, Biden has been replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump easily sailed to the nomination - but those Known-Unknowns remain, even as polls show minimal shifts in public opinion.

There are four that are likely to change voter's behavior - or not - in the coming weeks.

THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE: TEAMSTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS SUPPORT TRUMP OVER HARRIS

Will further actions by the Federal Reserve change views of the economy? The Fed just announced a 0.5% cut in interest rates, which helped cause Wall Street to achieve an all-time high, and suggested that the economy has done better than many thought just a few months ago. Polls that had recently given Trump the edge in who the voters trust more on the economy now suggest that Harris and Trump are at parity.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

Does Israel's multi-front war further deteriorate and make the Biden-Harris administration look feckless? Following the October 7th massacre of 1,200 Israelis, the Biden administration has sought to facilitate a deal to free the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza - and prevent the war from fully engulfing Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iran, which funds both Hamas and Hezbollah.

Despite multiple trips by U.S. representatives in the region, the U.S. has failed to achieve a ceasefire, nor has it been able to achieve the release of the remaining hostages. A negotiated end to the current war would possibly help Harris, but that seems highly unlikely at this late date. Conversely, if the conflict expands to a full-scale war with Hezbollah, it would give Trump an opportunity to highlight the incumbent administration's inability to control the situation.

Does the Ukraine War look to be better than a stalemate and a war of attrition with Russia? In recent weeks, Ukraine's decision - without the U.S. blessing - to invade and capture territory in Russia seems to have allowed Ukraine to appear more like the plucky successful defenders that initially pushed Russia back in 2022. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been visiting Biden and Harris at the White House.

Given that Trump has claimed that he could end the war quickly, and given that he pointedly chooses not to say that he wants Ukraine to win the war, and given that polls continue to show that most Americans support the Ukrainian war effort, any signs that the Biden-Harris administration is having an impact in helping them achieve that could redound to Harris's benefit.

Republican Dick Cheney (2000) decisively won his debate against Democrat Joe Lieberman; then-vice President Joe Biden (2012) was able to arrest Obama's falls after his bad first debate; and similarly, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence was able to change Trump's polling trajectory after his bad performance in the first debate against Hillary Clinton.

This year, while GOP Candidate JD Vance seems to be polling poorly, he's proven himself highly effective in many interviews, his legal background may help him make the case against Democrat Tim Walz, and he knows how to embody the grievances that have fueled the MAGA movement.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

That said, Walz may appear folksy, but he knows how to throw a populist punch as well (How often does he mention Vance and Yale in the same sentence?). Both these Midwesterners are shrewd - and they'll be armed to try to affect the trajectory of the race.

Those are just the Four ""Known-Unknowns."" Then there's always the possibility of ""Unknown-Unknowns"" - for example a terrorist act that might bring into focus the sense of the different approaches to terrorism that Trump and Harris appear to represent. One has no idea how it - or something else - may play out.

Political analysts like to focus on the dynamics of campaigns: fundraising, digital and television ad spending, press conferences, and so-called ""Get-Out-The-Vote"" efforts. But, if one really wants to know what's going to happen in an election, it's usually worth looking outside the campaign and study what the voters are experiencing."

Sherrod Brown supported sex changes for minors and biological men in women's sports -- but the Cleveland-based station doesn't appear concerned.

The Senate Leadership Fund, which is aligned with Sen. Mitch McConnell and was created to help build a Republican Senate majority, concluded that Brown, who is being challenged by Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno, is ""too liberal for Ohio.""

""A child's health care decisions are between them, their parents, their families, their doctors, not politicians,"" a clip of Brown said. ""I will never agree with anybody that wants to bring politics into the family situation with health care. Period.""

Haney then read a statement from Brown's campaign team: ""Sherrod's comments cited in the ad were not in support of puberty blockers or gender reassignment surgeries, but instead a call to keep politicians out of decisions that should be made between families and doctors.""

Haney told viewers she could ""verify"" the Senate Leadership Fund claims were ""false.""

Haney, who has called former President Trump ""racist"" and fawned over former President Obama on her X account, then moved on to the claim about women's sports.

""When making the claim, the ad refers to a vote in the U.S. Senate from March of 2021. When we pull up this vote on the U.S. Senate website, we see the amendment that was the subject of the vote had nothing to do with allowing transgender people to participate in women's sports. It was actually only about money,"" Haney told viewers.

""Sen. Brown voted against including an amendment in the American Rescue Plan that would have stripped federal funding from Ohio schools if those schools allowed transgender people to participate in women's sports,"" she continued. ""So, we can verify, the claim that Brown voted to let transgender biological men participate in women's sports is false.""

Haney ultimately ruled that two claims made in the ad were verified as ""false,"" essentially telling viewers the Senate Leadership Fund commercial was misleading on its face.

When the Senate Leadership Fund caught wind of the fact-checking segment, it emailed Haney to suggest the ""story is missing some key pieces of information and is misleading voters"" and pointed out that she never asked the Senate Leadership Fund for comment before airing the segment.

In emails obtained by Fox News Digital, Haney pushed back, insisting the ad was a public comment itself and ""that statement"" was included.

""I went on to fact check the sources cited in the statement, including the WSYX interview and the roll call vote from 2021. Please let me know what you believe to be missing from the piece,"" Haney wrote.

The Senate Leadership Fund's communications team responded with a scathing email.

""I work with fact checkers all the time. Not once has a journalist, or fact checker, not reached out to me for additional information, context or comment,"" the Senate Leadership Fund communications director wrote.

""What you did here is not industry practice and it's unethical. You allowed Sherrod Brown the opportunity to respond. Sherrod Brown's interview with WSYX and his votes to allow men to play in women's sports are both 'public statements.' Yet, you allowed him to clarify, but did not give us the opportunity to provide more information,"" the communications director continued. ""Also, I'm not sure why you think the ad being a 'public statement' makes a difference here.""

The Senate Leadership Fund then informed Haney that the fact-check was missing ""key information,"" but the Super Pac preferred to share it with her editor or news director.

Haney obliged and added the station's news director to the email chain, prompting the Senate Leadership Fund to send another scathing takedown.

""I just want to again reiterate that I have never had a fact checker not reach out before publishing a piece. I think it does a disservice to your viewers and the station's credibility to not reach out for more information. Frankly, I think this 'fact check' was more opinion than fact, and a correction needs to be issued,"" the communications director wrote.

""Sherrod Brown voted twice (March 2021 and March 2024) to allow transgender biological men to participate in women's sports. You're correct that both these votes involve funding, but men are still allowed to participate in women's sports at schools that received federal funding because Brown voted against the amendment. If the amendment had passed, men would NOT be allowed to participate in women's sports at schools that receive federal funding,"" Senate Leadership Fund's communications director continued. ""Can you point to the portion of Brown's interview with WSYX where he states he's against puberty blockers and sex changes for minors? I couldn't find it.""

The Senate Leadership Fund and Haney continued to bicker over email and never came to any sort of agreement, with the pro-GOP group insisting the fact-check was inaccurate, represented ""an opinion"" and needed to be ""updated.""

""What this boils down to is the fact that not denouncing something does not equate to voting for it, or supporting it,"" Haney wrote.

Brown's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Brown voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act last year. The bill ""generally prohibits school athletic programs from allowing individuals whose biological sex at birth was male to participate in programs that are for women or girls.""

In 2021, Brown sponsored an LGBTQ Pride Month resolution that included language about transgender youth participating in sports and their ability to access health care. Brown has long supported legislation that protects the well-being of transgender individuals.

WKYC and Haney did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.

The Senate Leadership Fund stands by the ad.

""Sherrod Brown fully supports allowing minors to receive puberty blockers and sex changes. He also supports allowing biological men to play in women's sports. These facts are indisputable, and those who claim otherwise are looking through a partisan lens,"" a spokesperson for the Senate Leadership Fund told Fox News Digital.

Haney's social media history suggests she's reliably liberal.

""I believe that Trump is racist and I do not support his policies,"" she tweeted in 2016.

""Trump was right. Mexico will build a wall. And will pay for it. To keep Trump out. God help us all. I'm not being dramatic,"" she wrote in another 2016 tweet.

Haney tweeted in 2012, ""I love you #Ohio! I'm happy both of my ""home states"" went Blue tonight! #California #Election2012 #Obama #TeamObama."""
499,'He has a way of connecting with our people': Southside Chicago resident believes Trump is gaining support,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/he-has-way-connecting-our-people-southside-chicago-native-says-about-trump-gaining-support,2024-09-27T09:06:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A resident from the south side of Chicago told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that a lot of voters from his neighborhood are supporting former President Trump.

""I think a lot of people from my neighborhood are riding with Trump honestly,"" said Eric Boyds, a native of South Side Chicago and Trump supporter.

""I think he has just a way of connecting with our people,"" he added.

Chicago's South Side is predominantly made up of Black residents. Approximately 75% of the community is Black and 19% is hispanic, according to data from the city's census figures.

Another resident from the South Side of Chicago echoed Boyd's sentiments.

""A lot of the people that I do talk to on the South Side are kind of sort of leaning ... toward Trump,"" Demetrius told Fox News Digital.

Demetrius explained that the growing support for Trump from South Side Chicago residents is due to the former president's aid of ""people living in poverty.""

""To those people-his contributions I guess really helped them out a bit in their minds ... he helped change the economy for them in the moment,"" he said before revealing that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris.

""In my opinion, I can't agree with it,"" he said.

On the other hand, other natives of Chicago's South Side said that everyone she knows is ""going for Kamala.""

""I don't think nobody I know going for Trump,"" Brittany said.

Trump lost Illinois to President Biden by a 17 point margin in the 2020 election. Chicago overwhelmingly went for Biden, with him winning over 90% in some wards.

The latest Fox News national survey shows Harris beating Trump by two points.

The new Fox News national survey finds a 3 percentage-point shift among registered voters in the 2024 presidential contest since mid-August. Trump had a 1-point advantage last month, while Harris is ahead by 2 points today: 50%-48%. For reference, in July, Trump was ahead by 1 point over President Biden. Each of those differences falls within the margin of error.

Quentin, a Harris supporter, said that the Democratic nominee has ""gained a lot of ground over the last week"" with residents of Chicago's suburbs and its South Side neighborhood.

""I think right now, she's looking a little more stronger-just how she answers the questions-how she responds to people ... she's showing she can be a trusted candidate.""

""Trump helped the people the most when he was in office,"" he said. ""That's just the honest truth.""

Ben, who lived in Chicago for four years, said he's leaning toward Kamala. He added that Trump seemed too old.

""Just not someone I feel too crazy about or too excited about being in office,"" Ben said."
