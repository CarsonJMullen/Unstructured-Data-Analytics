What's happening...

-North Carolina residents will see changes to early voting after Hurricane Helene

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program...Read more

3 Top Stocks To Buy Now After The Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-stocks-to-buy-now-after-fed-rate-cut/,2024-10-08T21:13:42Z,"The Federal Reserve committee inaugurated the much-anticipated interest rate cut cycle in mid-September, slashing half-a-percentage point off its benchmark rates without waiting to hit its actual 2% inflation target. The objective of the bigger-than-expected rate cut was to avert a recession, when a weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm Rule-a historical recession indicator that has a consistent 100% (well, almost) accuracy rate for every recession since the early 1970s. This gives rise to a few questions like:

The Federal Reserve launched its interest rate cut cycle on September 18, by aggressively slashing 50 basis points off benchmark rates, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill their reserve requirements. Banks are mandated by law to hold a reserve equal to a specific percentage of their deposits, referred to as the reserve requirement to ensure that bank is capable of meeting sudden withdrawals.

This is the first rate cut in four years since the Fed's emergency response to pandemic shutdowns in March 2020. Another half-percentage point reduction before this year-end is likely in the cards with an additional percentage-point cut anticipated in 2025.

The Fed raised interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023, to ease inflation that surged to the highest levels in more than four decades. In June 2022, inflation in the U.S. reached a whopping 9.1%, as prices and demand soared amid pandemic-disrupted supply constraints and unprecedented government stimulus programs that pumped about $5 trillion into the economy. When inflation shoots up, the Fed Reserve typically steps in to cool the inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing more expensive. This brings down spending and demand thereby inflation.

The corollary to rising interest rates is an increase in borrowing costs for businesses as well, which in turn triggers cost-cutting, slowdown in expansion initiatives, layoffs and lesser new hires. This leads to an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in September, up from 3.8% in the same month last year. A rise in unemployment rate alongside a slowdown in hiring has renewed recession concerns.

With the half-a-percentage cut, the Fed is hoping for a soft landing, a scenario in which the economy slows sufficiently to reduce inflation without entering a recession. The Fed's mandate is to restore price stability, while trying not to increase unemployment, even as its 2% inflation target appears within reach. Experts opine that a soft landing is plausible but far from guaranteed.

The current inflation rate is 2.5%, the lowest since February 2021, and lower than the long-term average of 3.28%. The fact that the Fed did not wait until the 2% inflation target was hit clearly shows where its priorities lie now-to avoid a recession.

Historically accurate and reliable recession indicators like the Sahm Rule are now facing skepticism because the pandemic has disrupted normal business activity and complicated forecasting efforts. The Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, states that a recession may happen when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more when compared to its low during the previous 12 months. The Sahm Rule has maintained an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 100% for every recession since the early 1970s. The only exception occurred in November 1976, when the rule was triggered without a corresponding or subsequent recession.

The Sahm Rule reading was 0.53% for July when the unemployment rate hit 4.3%. However, the rule's inventor Sahm herself rebutted the surge of catastrophic narratives, stating that ""I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession."" in an interview with Fortune. However, she also added later ""I think the recession odds, given what we're seeing in the labor market, are increasing."" While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was slightly dismissive of the Sahm Rule as more of a ""statistical regularity"" than an ""economic rule."" Sahm believes the rule shouldn't be dismissed as it's been very accurate over time and noted that ""recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.""

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped from 4.3% in July to 4.2% in August and 4.1% in September showing improvements ahead of the upcoming elections in November. In September, the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs exceeding estimates for 150,000 new jobs. The upbeat September jobs report should silence concerns about an impending disaster at least for now.

Nevertheless, unemployment rates will be a key data point to watch going forward. Any material rise in unemployment and fall in hiring may likely hit consumer spending, which has thus far been resilient because of strong wage gains. It is natural for people to cut back on spending when facing unemployment or the threat of losing a job.

High interest rates incentivize the consumer to save money, while lower interest rates tend to influence the consumer to borrow, spend and invest. Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Fed rate cuts are expected to be most impactful for credit cards that have variable interest rates. The previous Fed rate hike cycle has pushed the variable interest rates on credit cards close to all-time highs of above 21% currently, from around 14.6% in March 2022 when the rate hikes began. As the rate cut cycle unfolds, credit card rates will likely ease below 20%, offering some degree of relief for borrowers.

Mortgage rates for both 15-year and 30-year fixed loans are typically linked to Treasury yields and the overall economy, are likely to decrease slightly but are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the last decade. Currently, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovers around 6.2%. Experts predict these rates will remain between 6% and 6.5%, with the possibility of dipping below 6%. However, elevated home prices may still deter potential home buyers.

Auto loans are fixed with the average rate on a five-year new car loan being 6.8% in the second quarter, sharply higher than the 4% levels at the beginning of rate hikes. While the easing of rates may encourage car buyers who have pushed-out on purchases, the limiting factor could still be higher vehicle prices and lack of incentives for buyers.

The fixed nature of Federal student loan rates also means that a rate cut may have no impact on these borrowers, because these interest rates don't change over the loan term.

Savings rates have benefitted from the rate hike cycle. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers nearly 5% interest, while top interest rates from certificate of deposit (CD) instruments range from 4.00% to 5%. While these interest rates could decline, the opportunity still exists to secure a HYSA or CD before rates drop further.

A research study by Hartford Funds shows that 7 of the 11 Fed rate cutting periods from 1980 to 2024 were accompanied by recessions. While recession is not a desirable condition, how does it impact the stock market? Here are some interesting observations.

An analysis by Hartford Funds of 22 Fed rate-cutting cycles since 1928 revealed that the S&P 500 benchmark index on average outperformed government bonds and corporate bonds in the 12 months after the Fed started cutting interest rates. The average 12-month real return (after adjusting for inflation) from the date of first rate cut for U.S. stocks (represented by the S&P 500 index) has been 11% vs. 5% returns for government bonds and 6% returns for corporate bonds and 2% returns for cash.

The average returns of the stock market in the 22 rate cut cycles is even more impressive considering that in 16 out of 22 cycles the U.S. economy was already in a recession when the rate cuts were initiated or entered a recession within a 12 month period.

During the non-recessionary, rate-cut cycles the stock market returned a solid 17% on average (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut) vs. 2% for government bonds, 4% for corporate bonds and 3% for cash. In the event of a recessionary, rate-cut period, the stock market still returned a positive 8% on average vs. 7% for government and corporate bonds and 2 % for cash (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut.)

While these stock market returns seem solid, investors should remember that this is an average value for 22 rate cut cycles. The stock market suffered heavy losses too during recessionary periods. In 6 out of 22 rate cut cycles, stock market returns fluctuated widely between a negative 10% to negative 45%.

After the much touted ""great rotation"" into small-cap stocks, the focus is shifting to mid-cap stocks, because investors may be looking at a situation where small-caps may still be risky and large caps still too expensive. Until the Fed achieves the targeted soft landing, recession worries will continue to linger at the backdrop. Besides, the longer-for-higher interest rates have also triggered concerns about a slower-than-anticipated Fed rate easing cycle.

With stronger fundamentals (higher profitability and solid balance sheet) vs. small-caps and attractive valuations vs. large-caps, mid-caps seem better positioned to benefit from the present Fed rate cuts. Yet another solid reason for the pivot to mid-caps is the historical outperformance of mid-caps vs. large caps and small caps in the first 3 and 12 months subsequent to the first Fed rate cut. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 mid-cap index has been an outperformer since 1984 vs. the S&P 500 (large-caps) and Russell 2000 (small-caps) in the 3 and 12 months following the first Fed first rate cut. Presently, Goldman Sachs projects a 13% return for the S&P 400 index over the next 12 months.

Elf Beauty qualifies as a high growth beauty company, having grown sales and market share for 22 straight quarters, and averaging at least 20% sales growth per quarter. Over the past five years, Elf has expanded its top one/two positions from across eight segments in the color cosmetics category to 18 segments, which now account for over 80% of its Elf cosmetics sales. The company's ""Holy Grail"" approach centers on creating value versions of prestige products to align with consumer preferences. For reference, the average price point for Elf is about $6.50 vs. around $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetics brands and more than $20 for prestige brands. Elf's recent Bronzing Drops is comparable to a prestige product in the market at a third of the price. This strategy has helped solidify Elf's outperformance in the cosmetics category.

Solid market share gains: Elf Beauty's color cosmetics business continues to be a category outperformer. A 26% growth across track channels in the first quarter vs. a 1% decline for the category, has helped ELF grow its cosmetics market share to 12.3% presently. This represents a more than 2x increase from 5.7% market share in the same quarter three years ago. ELF expects to double its cosmetics market share again in a few years.

Shelf-space gains with Walmart, top share with Target, Opportunities at groceries, drug stores: With Target, a long-standing customer, Elf Cosmetics is the number one brand for six quarters in a row with its share rising from 13% to 21%. A 50% shelf space gain from 8 feet to 12 feet at Walmart is commendable, but still underpenetrated vs. legacy brands that have a 16 feet to 20 feet shelf space. The opportunities for expansion are attractive at Target, Walmart and Alta, alongside growth at grocery and drug stores, where ELF currently has a much smaller footprint.

Maximizing Brand Performance with Retail Partners: Elf proactively refreshes up to 20% of its retail assortment annually, leveraging insights from its digital business and beauty squad loyalty programs. This strategy has doubled its average sales per SKU over the past five years, making it a highly productive brand in terms of dollar sales per foot basis with retailers.

Growing Skincare business: Elf Beauty hopes to replicate the success in its cosmetics business across its skincare segment. For the latest first quarter, Elf SKIN grew 45% in track channels, vs. category growth of 1.4%. Elf SKIN has roughly 2% market share as of the first quarter vs. 14% share for the leading skin care brand. ELF's Naturium acquisition from last year should also help unlock growth in the skin category.

International expansion opportunities: International sales accounted for 16% of ELF's total first-quarter sales, up from 13% a year ago, but is still underpenetrated vs. global peers that have a 70% exposure to international sales. International expansion represents a key growth runway for ELF.

Upbeat Guidance: ELF recently raised guidance for fiscal 2025 (ending on March 31, 2025), now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.36 to $3.41, on sales of $1.28 billion to $1.30 billion, from prior expectations of $3.20 to $3.25 EPS on sales of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. The revised guidance compares more favorably with year-ago EPS of $3.18 on revenues of $1.02 billion.

ELF Stock Sell-off presents opportunity: Despite these positive developments, ELF stock trades way off its 52-week intra-day high of $221.83 reached in early March. After a couple of attempts in late June and mid July to recapture the highs of the year, the stock has fallen sharply amid concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth rates above 20%. However, it still has a Strong Buy rating from 16 Wall Street analysts.

Medpace is a full-service clinical contract research organization providing Phase I-IV clinical development services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Medpace calls itself as a CRO trusted by biotechs with a focus on small to mid-sized biopharma customers that represented more than 95% of its 2023 revenues. With an estimated 5% market share in the small and mid-sized biopharma space, Medpace sees an estimated core addressable biopharma CRO market of $28 billion.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profit: Top line has grown at a nearly 22% CAGR from $704.6 million in 2018 to $1.89 billion in 2023, while net income has grown four-fold from $73.2 million or $1.97/share in 2018 to $282.8 million or $8.88 per share in 2023.

Attractive Free Cash Flow characteristics: Medpace has attractive free cash flow (FCF) characteristics with FCF growing from $138.7 million in 2018 to $396.7 million in 2023. Ebitda-FCF conversion has remained above 100% since 2019.

Upbeat outlook: For 2024, revenue is expected to be between $2.125 billion and $2.175 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 12.7% to 15.3%. Net income is expected to be $361 million to $383 million or $11.24 per share to $11.93 per share and Ebitda to be $430.0 million to $460.0 million.

Concerns over cancellation appear baked into stock price now: While announcing second-quarter earnings results, the company cited some order cancellations that brought its book-to-bill ratio to 1.04 for the quarter vs. prior expectations for 1.2. Medpace also cautioned that the book-to-bill numbers could be flat to slightly higher sequentially in the third quarter. Some analysts downgraded the stock to a Hold/Neutral rating in late September citing weaker bookings growth coupled with cancellations as one of the reasons.

Are the concerns overrated? In the earnings call, Medpace said it does not see a prolonged pullback, or does not view the cancellations as a pattern that's going to continue. Besides, a book-to-bill of 1.04 for one quarter is not earth shattering, because it is still above 1, implying strong demand. Medpace sees the third quarter book-to-bill to be at 1.04 or slightly higher and in the first quarter the number was at 1.2. Also, Backlog as of June 30, 2024 was a solid $2.9 billion, up 13.7% year-on-year, and Medpace expects to convert about $1.585 billion of this backlog to revenue over the next twelve months. Medpace even raised its profit guidance for 2024 to show that it continues to anticipate industry-leading organic revenue growth and profitability despite the challenges in backlog growth. The backlog concerns appear to be priced into the MEDP stock that is already trading well below its mid-July highs of $459.77.

Upcoming catalyst: A key catalyst for the Medpace stock is the upcoming third-quarter earnings report, slated for release on October 21, after market close. Overall the MEDP stock has a moderate buy rating from analysts.

Skechers, dubbed as the comfort footwear giant, is a Fortune 500 company that makes lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. International sales represented more than 60% of its 2023 top line. The comfort footwear maker operates via wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) business segments, with wholesale representing 56% of sales in 2023, and the rest coming from DTC.

Record second-quarter sales: Despite currency and supply chain headwinds, regulatory obstacles in India, and a lackluster 6/18 holiday in China, Skechers delivered record second-quarter sales of $2.16 billion, up 7.2% year over year driven by continued strength in its international DTC business and significant improvement in its domestic wholesale business.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profits: Skechers has grown sales from $5.2 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2023, and earnings per share from $2.25 to $3.49. Fiscal 2024 outlook is even better with sales expected between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion and EPS expected to be $4.08 to $4.18.

Expanding margins: Skechers sells at affordable price points, yet gross margins have remained above 47% since 2019 exceeding 50% in 2023, while operating margins have been mostly in the mid-to-high single digits, with the exception of a drop to 2.9% in 2020. The margin story gets even better in the first half of 2024, with gross margins at 53.7% and operating margin at 11.5%.

One shoe does not fit all but Skechers fits all into one shoe: Considerable thought goes into the design of Skechers footwear to meet the needs of every walk of life. Under a partnership with John Deere, Skechers recently launched a footwear line for agricultural professionals, construction workers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Made of waterproof materials, the footwear line has interesting features like composite toe protection, nano carbon safety and Poron XRD metatarsal protection-Poron XRD being a flexible, lightweight, breathing foam, which hardens when impacted and forms a protective shell around the foot, absorbing up to 90% of the impact energy. Skechers has also integrated its slip-resistant and electrical hazard-rated technologies into the new offering.

Reasonably attractive valuation: Skechers stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 16.2x based on $4.08 eps guidance for 2024 (at the low end of the range). This is lower than its own five-year historical average of 21.2x. If the multiple re-rates to a conservative 19x (at the midpoint of the multiple range), it would still represent about 17% upside from current price levels. The footwear maker's expectations to achieve $10 billion in sales by 2026, also implies 13% upside potential from current stock levels, upon applying the current forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.13x. The stock may have 13%-17% upside potential from current levels.

The U.S. economy is currently not in a recession. The Fed rate easing cycle may likely achieve a soft landing of the economy, although there are no guarantees and historical evidence points otherwise, at least most of the time. Monthly Jobs data will continue to be a critical watch point. Even as recession fears linger, mid-cap stocks could be a preferred investment over large-cap or small-cap stocks, as mid-caps are at the confluence of reasonable valuations and stronger fundamentals. The mid-cap stocks highlighted in the article enjoy profitable growth with upbeat future prospects."
A Legacy Of Patient-Centered Transformation - A Conversation With Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Toby Cosgrove,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrist/2024/10/08/a-legacy-of-patient-centered-transformation--a-conversation-with-cleveland-clinics-dr-toby-cosgrove/,2024-10-08T20:53:32Z,"This week, my longtime friend Dr. Toby Cosgrove and I had the fun of kicking off the Nashville Healthcare Sessions Conference, hosted by the Nashville Health Care Council. Our opening panel was titled, ""Leading the Charge: A Legacy of Patient-Centered Transformation,"" a title we both took issue with since it implied that if we'd already left a legacy - we were old!

Despite this slight, it did give us the opportunity to reminisce on when we first met - 42 years ago at Massachusetts General Hospital when I was Chief Resident in cardiac surgery and Dr. Cosgrove was already an exceptionally talented cardiac surgeon visiting from the Cleveland Clinic. I remember watching in awe from the other side of the operating room table as he deftly sewed the new coronary artery grafts in our heart patient with perfect textbook precision.

Our paths continued to cross over the years as we each took our own journeys to transform healthcare in ways that better served the patient - Toby as the cardiac surgeon turned innovative, data-driven, genius CEO behind the Cleveland Clinic, setting the global standard for quality care in many specialties; me as the transplant surgeon turned national policymaker and now healthcare company innovator. In recent years, we've come together through organizations like the Health Affairs Council on Health Care Spending and Value and the Aspen Institute's Health Strategy Group.

We always have fun picking each other's brains on the healthcare trends we're seeing and our predictions for the future - and this day was no different. In front of a packed audience, I asked Toby, what made the Cleveland Clinic unique when it came to quality?

Without hesitation, Toby shared how, as head of the cardiac surgery department, he and his fellow cardiac surgeons agreed they should let cardiologists know what the outcomes were of the patients referred to them - a feedback loop that often isn't closed in the healthcare continuum. What began as an annual presentation and shared slides progressed to a polished booklet, then to a book of outcomes data across all Clinic departments, which soon became annual outcome and quality data shared with the public. The Cleveland Clinic was committed to being transparent and accountable for their patients' outcomes.

We had a ""tradition of measuring, measuring, measuring,"" Toby explained, because you can't improve without understanding your results.

I completely agreed with Toby. When I stood up the Vanderbilt Multi-Organ Transplant Center over three decades ago, measuring outcomes was absolutely fundamental to our success and survival - it was how we convinced the federal government and later private insurers to cover nascent transplant procedures. We had to demonstrate we had quality outcomes that justified the high cost of the procedures. This relentless commitment to data measurement, quality and innovation is part of the reason Vanderbilt is now the busiest heart transplant center in the world.

But today's healthcare environment has a number of challenges that make commitment to quality hard. Toby pointed to three key issues:

The first is cost: The average hospital margin is 2% and half the hospitals are running in the red. Inflation is hitting our hospital systems hard.

Second is workforce shortage: ""There are two million unfilled healthcare jobs in the United States,"" Toby explained; 500,000 of those are in nursing, while 50,000 are primary care physicians.

The third challenge is the explosion in knowledge: ""There's 1.8 million medical articles written every year,"" he noted, with the total amount of medical knowledge doubling every 73 days. It takes 13 years before empirically proven knowledge becomes the standard of care - so it's nearly impossible for providers to stay at the cutting edge of their field - and for our patients to receive the very latest in care.

Additionally, we touched on cybersecurity, something that we both agreed was top of mind for all health systems. ""I think there were 200 hospitals hacked in the first half of this past year,"" recalled Toby, explaining that most systems wouldn't be prepared for a cyber-attack. ""I don't think you can accomplish cyber security without blockchain,"" I remarked, citing how slow the healthcare industry has been in adopting this technology. ""I don't think you can,"" Toby confirmed.

As we looked to the future and the bright spots in healthcare today - Toby had a few observations.

On the workforce issue, telemedicine has opened up tremendous new capabilities, although its use has backslid too much since Covid. Toby recounted a personal story of being able to quickly diagnose and treat a poison ivy rash on his daughter with an uploaded photo in a telemedicine consult, rather than spending the time and money to take her to an emergency department. ""Hospitals can't be all things to all people,"" Toby remarked, a lesson he said he learned from his service during the Vietnam War. In Saigon, they triaged in a field hospital then moved to the next treatment location based on type of care needed. Today, we should concentrate people with high tech needs in health systems with just that, while less intensive care needs can be met at lower-tech hospitals or outpatient facilities. A poison ivy case, for example, is a great fit for telemedicine instead of a brick-and-mortar facility.

Finally, Toby shared that, ""AI is the salvation for a lot of the things going on in healthcare today."" It will make providers much more efficient. Ambient scribes will reduce physician burnout and improve patient satisfaction as the doctor spends time conversing rather than entering data into a chart. It will also empower healthcare professionals with more knowledge and will be particularly useful with administrative tasks. Globally, AI will be a gamechanger for the health systems of developing countries, helping them leapfrog a long way ahead.

As Bill Gates and others have said, we overestimate technology in the short run and underestimate it in the long run. Toby and I are both excited and optimistic about the future of healthcare in America, and around the world. The opportunity for more high-quality patient-centered care is just beginning."
Pennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Has Less Than 1-Point Lead In Polling Averages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/pennsylvania-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-has-less-than-1-point-lead-in-polling-averages/,2024-10-08T19:37:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in four of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than two points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) to win the White House.

There are places in the world that are vaunted for having an outsized number of long-lived individuals. A lot of attention has been paid to puzzling out how all these people have reached such an advanced age.

A new pre-print study that has yet to be formally peer reviewed proposed these places may have surfaced, at least in part, as a result of clerical error or fraud.

Here's the crux of the problem: to tell how old someone is, people rely on documents. ""There's no way to validate a human age against a physical measure,"" says Saul Justin Newman, a research fellow at Oxford University.

""If you go into a hospital without paperwork, there's no machine in there that says, 'Oh, bing!' and knows your age,"" he says. ""So if you get consistently wrong errors in your paperwork, they're undetectable.""

When Newman examined U.N. data from 236 states and nations, he found errors connected to centenarians -- people ages 100 and above -- all over the world. Certain countries had more detailed accounting than others.

""The best predictor of where 100-year-olds are within Okinawa [Japan] is places that have had their cities bombed by the Americans, burning the birth records,"" he says. ""So the more bombing you have, the more 100 year-olds you have.""

There are other examples. ""Forty-two percent of centenarians in Costa Rica turned out to be lying in the census,"" Newman says. ""At least 72 percent of the centenarians in Greece disappeared when they did an audit.""

On paper, some of these folks were alive. ""But dead in reality,"" Newman says. ""You know, I had a lady reach 103 in a freezer.""

Some of these errors may not actually be errors. Newman says to picture yourself jobless and broke.

""And then your father dies or your mother dies at the age of 95,"" he says ""Their pension check turns up the week after they're dead. All you have to do for that pension check to keep turning up in perpetuity is not register the death. Very easy thing to get away with.""

Newman says this is the reality that he's surfaced. The places on the planet that seem to have residents reaching super advanced age are rife with pension fraud, which obscures how old they were whenever they did pass away.

Not knowing how long people actually live has all sorts of ramifications. ""We're all the time using these old age data to estimate how many old people we're going to have to take care of,"" Newman says, ""and project how many hospitals we need in the future.""

""It really is an important study because it pushes the field to scrutinize the data more rigorously,"" says Raya Kheirbek, who wasn't involved in the research. She's chief of geriatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. ""But the conclusions may overstate the extent of errors.""

While this work doesn't necessarily contradict thinking on longevity, she's concerned it could add complexity to an already nuanced field and that it may cast doubt on what she says is legitimate research, including a set of U.S. studies showing what people who do reach 100 have in common -- that they age more slowly, as do their kids.

""This robust data does not depend on birth certificates from areas of unreliable records,"" she says, ""highlighting the significant role of genetic and environmental factors in longevity."" Kherirbek says these factors might include exercise, social engagement, mental resilience, and diet -- ""moderation in all areas.""

Kheirbek says there are other explanations for age inflation, like the inevitable loss of documents. Take Spain, for instance.

""During the civil war,"" she says, ""many birth records were kept in government agencies and churches and they were all destroyed. So that is a complicating factor in age verifications.""

Newman agrees. He says these errors, and bad record keeping arise for all sorts of reasons, from war to fraud to bureaucracy.

He uses this analogy: ""Imagine you had the Hubble space telescope,"" he says, ""and a percent of the stars turn out to be dust on the lens.""

Newman says his hope is simply to wipe down that lens."
SEE IT: Wisconsin dairy farmer says 'no question' Trump admin was 'much better' than Biden-Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/see-it-wisconsin-dairy-farmer-says-no-question-trump-admin-much-better-than-biden-harris,2024-10-08T17:17:24Z,"WAUKESHA, Wisconsin - At Cozy Nook Farm, they cover three areas: Cows, pumpkins, and Christmas trees.

""We're diversified here,"" laughed dairy farmer Tom Oberhaus in an interview with Fox News Digital.

He explained that he and his wife are conservative Republicans who have been sure of who they were supporting in the 2024 election for a long time.

""There's no question in our mind that our four years under Trump management was much better than the three and a half years under Biden management - or whoever is, you know, that's the great mystery is, who is actually running the government right now?"" he asked.

WISCONSIN SENATE RACE SHIFTS TO 'TOSS UP' BY HANDICAPPER AS TAMMY BALDWIN FIGHTS FOR RE-ELECTION

They previously voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

One issue he has with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee, is that she vouched for President Biden's cognitive ability.

""It bothers the heck out of me that we're thinking about electing a person that just six weeks ago... told us 'Oh, Biden's on top of it. He's really aggressive and really knows what he's doing,'"" Oberhaus said.

""We all seen that in the debate, you know, he's past his time,"" he said of Biden's June debate with former President Trump that preceded his campaign suspension.

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT

Critics have claimed Trump is bad for farmers, pointing to his fondness for tariffs and his past trade conflict with China. But Oberhaus said the tariffs, which ramped up in 2018, ""certainly didn't hurt us.""

""We're much better off with tariffs than having that government printing press printing out money,"" he added.

At Cozy Nook Farm, Oberhaus said their biggest struggle has been inflation. ""We've been [eaten] alive by inflation,"" he claimed.

He explained that they do not set their own prices, and they tend to ""run a couple of years behind everybody else.""

They're now paying ""twice as much for tires and fuel and feed and everything else."" However, ""our milk price stays the same, until just now in the last month that it finally came up.""

He also stressed illegal immigration as a top issue for him, even hundreds of miles from the southern border. But the problem is surfacing even as far north as Wisconsin, he explained.

""Little town of Whitewater 35 minutes away,"" he said. ""It's a town of, what, 15,000 people? And then they got a thousand new immigrants.""

Local Wisconsin outlets reported that last year Whitewater Police Chief Daniel Meyer and City Manager John Weidl penned a letter to Biden, asking for help after the ""rapid increase"" of about 800 to 1,000 immigrants since 2022.

""As a municipal government, our focus is not on legal status, but rather ensuring we are providing the resources expected of a municipality to all residents of the City. Unfortunately, we are increasingly finding it difficult to do that,"" the letter reportedly read.

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

""How do you handle that?"" asked Oberhaus.

As for those who argue that with strict immigration enforcement there would result in fewer people to work on farms, he called it ""baloney.""

On Trump, who recently ventured into Wisconsin's biggest Democratic enclaves in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the farmer said, ""I think that's the sign of a leader - that you're not afraid to go into the other camp and tell them what your ideas are."""
Markets Project Smaller 2024 Interest Rate Cuts On Better Jobs News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/08/markets-project-smaller-2024-interest-rate-cuts-on-better-jobs-news/,2024-10-08T17:17:05Z,"With recent, stronger jobs data, markets expect the remaining anticipated interest rate cuts of 2024 to be 0.25% moves. That's down from expectations that both November and December Federal Open Market Committee meetings could see 0.5% cuts. Fixed income market expectations are tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool.

There was concern that the U.S. unemployment situation could weaken further. However, the Employment Situation Report for September showed clear improvement. Unemployment fell slightly for the second consecutive month to 4.1% and nonfarm payrolls rose 254,000. That's over 200,000 jobs added for the first time since May.

Now, the FOMC will see another jobs report on November 1 before its next meeting on November 6-7 and that data could change things. Inflation numbers will matter too. Nonetheless, for now, U.S. unemployment data is more positive than generally anticipated and inflation continues to trend lower.

This matters because if unemployment were to rise significantly, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates quite rapidly. That would be to try and reduce the risk of a recession. On the most recent data, a steep rise in unemployment is not happening.

Of course, inflation appears to be returning to the FOMC's 2% annual target, so that creates some momentum for less restrictive monetary policy. However, if the jobs market continues to appear robust, then there's perhaps a little less urgency for interest rate cuts.

The remaining scheduled FOMC interest rate decisions of 2024 are on November 7 and December 18. Currently, fixed income markets expect both to result in 0.25% interest rate cuts. That would leave short term interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 or 0.5% lower than current levels. The risk of a slightly larger or smaller interest rate move is balanced, but currently further 0.5% cuts in 2024 are viewed as unlikely just as is the scenario of the FOMC choosing to hold rates steady at either meeting.

In two recent speeches, policymakers have signaled confidence in monetary policy and advocated for a more gradual approach to interest rate cuts.

New York Fed President John Williams said that: ""The current stance of monetary policy is really well positioned to both hopefully keep maintaining the strength that we have in the economy and the labour market, but also continuing to see that inflation comes back to 2 per cent,"" in an interview with the Financial Times on October 7.

St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, said: ""My baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions."" At a speech in New York on October 7.

There is still more key economic data to come before the FOMC's next scheduled meeting on November 6-7. Primarily, that's the jobs report for October and inflation reports for September.

So far, the jobs markets appears to be performing better than expected since the FOMC last met, and inflation continues to trend lower. If that economic outlook continues, then it appears likely the FOMC will cut interest rates at its two remaining meetings of 2024, but only by 0.25% at each, rather than the previously estimated 0.5%."
6 Financial Matters To Discuss With Older Family Members,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cicelyjones/2024/10/08/6-financial-matters-to-discuss-with-older-family-members/,2024-10-08T17:16:50Z,"Discussing money, health, and mortality with loved ones can be incredibly difficult. Despite the discomfort you may feel, these discussions are critical to build trust and ensure the wellbeing of all the generations in your family. These are the six financial matters you should be discussing with your older family members.

Nobody wants to admit that they didn't plan well, but many Americans are ultimately unprepared for retirement. When I speak with young professionals, many express concerns about their aging parents and whether they may need to support them financially, but few understand what that need looks like because they haven't discussed it.

For older family members, particularly ones who may be dependent on you for support if their funds ran out, it's critical to understand their:

Let's say you're looking at an older family member who has $5,000 in monthly expenses, receives a net income of $3,500 from Social Security, and can sustainably take a net income of $1,000 per month from a $300,000 retirement account.

In this case, we're looking at a $500 shortfall every month, which would likely mean they're depleting their retirement account at an unsustainable rate and risking running out of retirement assets altogether. Since it's a smaller issue today, the remaining family may be able to provide that additional $500 per month to extend the life of the retirement assets or work with the older family member to make some budgeting or investment changes today.

Down the road, $1,500 per month in today's dollars might be a much more substantial burden for the family to try to shoulder.

You'll also want to understand if your older family member has any debts, including mortgages, credit card debts, business loans, personal loans, auto loans and student loans. If they do have debts, you'll want to understand their plans for repayment. If the debts are substantial and have high interest rates, they may want to consider debt consolidation or working with a debt specialist.

One of the biggest mistakes I see among the older generations is a failure to invest according to risk tolerance and financial goals. Either investors will hold onto mostly cash and lose substantial purchasing power to inflation, or they will take on way too much risk for someone who needs their assets for income. Inquire about your family member's asset allocation, income goals, and tolerance for risk to determine if their investment portfolios are acting as intended. If there is no coherent plan or things look off, encourage them to speak with a qualified financial professional.

If your loved one is charitably inclined and can easily pay for their own expenses, implementing charitable giving in their plan can create both tax and estate planning efficiencies. Discussing their favorite charities and causes they are passionate about can also lighten the mood and bring you closer during an otherwise heavy conversation.

As we age, our health can often decline, which drives up healthcare expenses. In the United States, individuals become eligible for Medicare when they turn 65 years old. They also have the option to add additional plans beyond the basic coverage to decrease their financial risk if they do become very sick. Inquire about what your family member has in place to be able to plan for potential costs.

Many people over the age of 65 will also have a need for long-term care coverage, which traditional Medicare does not cover. If a person can't do some basic activities of daily living and they need support every day, that care is called long-term care. It can be incredibly expensive, so try to understand if your loved one has insurance to cover this need or sufficient assets to self-insure. Usually, a surplus of about $400,000 in retirement funds will mean they may be able to self-insure.

Lastly, it's good to know if your loved one has any life insurance in place. If it is permanent coverage, the life insurance could be accessible during their life and provide a tax-free benefit to solve for financial issues they may leave behind when they pass, like burial costs, debts, and other expenses.

Lastly, it's critical to understand if your loved one has done estate planning. At a minimum, they need to have a will in place to dictate their final wishes. However, having a will still subjects many assets to probate. Probate is a lengthy and public legal process whereby the courts dictate how assets are dispersed. It can take years. Probate can be avoided by having a trust in place, putting necessary assets in the name of the trust, and correctly designating beneficiaries on all accounts with a direct beneficiary.

As your loved one ages, it may also be necessary to add in healthcare directives to dictate their medical care preferences and even medical or financial powers of attorney to provide support when they may not be able to make decisions for themselves.

Telling you or another trusted member of your family where to find these documents, along with information needed to access accounts, can make a medical or financial crisis easier to endure.

Discussing these financial matters can help ensure that both you and your older family members are better prepared for the future. It can also provide peace of mind knowing that everyone is on the same page regarding financial planning and management."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

Money Market Funds Are Losing Their Luster. Here's What Shines.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeljohnson/2024/10/08/money-market-funds-are-losing-their-luster-heres-what-shines/,2024-10-08T15:38:16Z,"The Fed's September 18th interest rate cut was a long time coming and a symbol of progress on inflation. It's a cause for celebration and a catalyst for re-examining investment strategies you favored during the higher-for-longer interest rate environment. With more rate cuts expected later this year, now's a perfect time to consider changes that could be advantageous to your portfolio.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not an advocate of timing the market, but I am a believer in managing your portfolio to capitalize on changing tradeoffs between risk and reward. Given the declining interest rate environment, it can be a smart move to hold less cash by moving up the risk curve and buying fixed income and equity investments.

With Decreasing Interest Rates, These Investment Options Shine Bright

For example, money is already flowing from money market funds into bond funds, as investors attempt to lock in yields before rates drop further.

Equity funds, particularly those holding dividend paying stocks, are also tempting investors to move out of cash for better returns. If all goes as planned and we avoid a recession, stocks should continue to generate higher returns than bonds over a 5- to-10-year period, and the dividend yields add an element of safety.

Speaking of the stock market, we've seen the dangers of being too growth-oriented over the last few months. Many tech stocks that had a good run-up got hammered - a reminder that the cost of high growth is high volatility. That volatility may be acceptable for younger investors, but I'm encouraging mature clients who want to invest some cash to consider diversifying their tech holdings with consumer staples.

Companies in this sector produce essential products that people use day in and day out. Food producers and manufacturers of household goods may sound like boring investments, especially compared to Nvidia, Alphabet, or Apple, but these large, established companies tend to be far more stable investments. The consumer staples sector provides modest growth, low volatility, reliable profits, and steady dividends, which is why I diversify with them in financial plans for clients in their 50s and 60s.

I can't stress enough the importance of owning a well-diversified portfolio when you've accumulated wealth that you want to preserve. Concentrating your assets amplifies the impact of volatility and changing market conditions, tempting you to move money and trade sectors at the worst possible times.

If you're like most investors, you might think you're well diversified, but you probably aren't, especially if you set up a portfolio two or three years ago. If your portfolio hasn't been rebalanced during that time, it's likely to be dominated by tech stocks. Contrary to popular belief, owning the big index funds doesn't provide enough equity diversification. Think about it: roughly 31% of the value of the S&P 500 Index is composed of stocks in the information technology sector.

At this stage of the economic cycle and in anticipation of more rate decreases, some investors are moving from cash into small and mid-cap stocks. There are two reasons this allocation could be beneficial. First, smaller businesses that want to grow in value will be able to borrow money at lower rates. Second, loans will be more affordable for bigger companies who want to acquire smaller ones.

5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
"Gold ETFs Rise By 18 Tonnes In September, Says World Gold Council",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roystonwild/2024/10/08/gold-etfs-rise-by-18-tonnes-in-september-says-world-gold-council/,2024-10-08T14:29:11Z,"Gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded further net inflows in September, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).

This fresh uplift was thanks to accelerating bullion demand in North America, and meant that funds have enjoyed five straight months of net inflows.

Global ETFs added 18 tonnes of the expensive metal last month, the WGC said, taking total holdings to 3,200 tonnes.

Cumulative inflows were worth $1.4 billion, the council said. This -- combined with a surging gold price -- propelled total assets under administration (AUMs) to $271 billion, a fresh all-time high.

Gold continues to surge as concerns over military action in the Middle East grow and investors prepare for interest rate cuts. The precious metal rose to new record peaks around $2,685 per ounce on September 26.

In North America, ETFs recorded their third successive net monthly inflow. Total holdings rose by 16 tonnes month on month, to 1,624 tonnes.

Fresh inflows were worth around $1.4 billion, which in turn lifted regional AUMs to $137 billion.

The WGC said that ""lower opportunity costs, related to interest rates and the dollar, boosted investor interest in gold ETFs."" It noted that ""the US Fed surprised investors with a cut of 50 basis points at their September gathering, pushing Treasury yields and the dollar down during the month.""

Asia-located funds also enjoyed another monthly net inflow in September to take the streak to 20 months.

ETFs added two tonnes of material, nudging aggregate holdings to 186 tonnes. AUMs rose to $16 billion, a $175 million month-on-month increase.

The WGC said that ""India again saw strong inflows,"" helped in part by strong gold price momentum and elevated geopolitical concerns.

However, ETFs in Europe recorded net outflows last month, the council noted. This was due predominantly to liquidation in the UK as hopes of Bank of England interest cuts receded.

The WGC commented that ""compared to the US Fed's easing efforts, the Bank of England (BoE) was more reserved, leaving rates unchanged at 5% at their September meeting, citing the upside risk of inflation from elevated wage growth.""

European funds lost two tonnes of material, which were worth a total of $245 million. As a consequence, total holdings and AUMs dropped to 1,325 tonnes and $112 billion respectively."
Inflation Reduction Act 2 Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-2-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T14:27:54Z,"In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
Wisconsin Senate race shifts to 'toss up' by handicapper as Tammy Baldwin fights for re-election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-senate-race-shifts-toss-up-handicapper-tammy-baldwin-fights-re-election,2024-10-08T14:09:54Z,"Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Andrew Iverson emphasized the ground game strategy in the battleground that includes turning out Republican voters in deep blue areas.

A top political handicapper shifted its rating for the Wisconsin Senate race on Tuesday to ""Toss Up"" with less than a month until election day.

The race in Wisconsin, a pivotal battleground state in both the presidential and Senate matches, was most recently considered ""Lean Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report.

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT

The handicapper cited changes in polling in recent days, with Hovde appearing to close the gap with Baldwin. But Cook also referred to private polling from both campaigns, which it said each showed the race within the margins of error.

A source familiar confirmed to Fox News Digital that Baldwin's internal polling shows such a race.

VULNERABLE DEM JON TESTER TURNS ON BIDEN ADMIN OVER DEI AFTER MONTANA UNIVERSITIES STRIPPED OF FEDERAL FUNDS

In response to the rating shift, Hovde spokesman Zach Bannon said, ""Sen. Baldwin's radical agenda has sparked record high inflation, created chaos [at] the southern border, and made our communities less safe. Eric Hovde is going to win because the people of Wisconsin are ready for change.""

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

""After 25 years in Washington, Tammy Baldwin has become the typical D.C. politician, voting in lock-step with the failed Biden agenda and hiding her Wall Street partner's stock trades from her constituents. Wisconsinites are ready for change, and Eric Hovde has the momentum,"" said National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesman Tate Mitchell in a statement.

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

The latest Marquette Law School poll showed Baldwin winning the battle, 51% to Hovde's 45%. The survey interviewed 882 registered voters over Sept. 18-26. The poll's margin of error was +/-4.4 percentage points.

With Cook's ratings change, Wisconsin joins other ""Toss Up"" Senate races in Ohio and Michigan."
This $1 Billion Michigan RIA Shuns Alternatives In Favor Of Dividend Stocks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/this-1-billion-michigan-ria-shuns-alternatives-in-favor-of-dividend-stocks/,2024-10-08T13:51:33Z,"Background: Steinberg graduated from Michigan State University in 1984 with a degree in accounting and began his career specializing in tax preparation and planning at Deloitte. He went back to law school at the University of Michigan and then worked for a couple years as an estate-planning attorney for Honigman, Detroit's largest law firm. In 1993, he started as an advisor with many of his early clients being former colleagues from the law firm. Steinberg eventually started Blue Chip Partners in 2004 and brought on his longtime partner, Daniel Seder, a year later. Today the firm has 33 employees servicing roughly 800 clients.

Building Relationships: Blue Chip Partners has positioned itself to do the whole range of planning for clients -- from investments to taxes to estate planning -- all under one roof, with different subsidiaries of the business to help specialize in each segment. The firm also focuses on educating clients through a very active social media presence and even has its own podcast.

Competitive Edge: Steinberg says excellent employee hiring and retention as a pillar of the firm's success. Prospective hires all take the Caliper Profile assessment, a rigorous personality test designed to predict future job performance. This not only allows the team to hire from outside the business, but also to find 'team players' such as former college athletes, for instance, who understand the importance of working together or not winning every game of a match, says Steinberg.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: Blue Chip uses an independent investment department of which the primary equity portfolio strategy is dividend growth. Instead of an ETF- or mutual fund-heavy model, the team's core approach to equities is investing in companies that have a track record of paying and growing dividends. ""Every time a company raises their dividend we will send clients an email... because clients own individual stocks in their portfolio they have higher risk tolerance,"" says Steinberg. ""These companies have a track record, so in down markets clients are still getting positive emails that they raised their dividend and that helps their confidence."" In terms of asset allocation, Blue Chip generally favors a 70/30 allocation of equities with the rest a mix cash and fixed income. ""We tend to be more plain vanilla on fixed income, with some ETFs and lower cost mutual funds,"" says Steinberg. ""Trying to get too smart with bonds just doesn't work -- that portion of a client's portfolio should be defensive."" When it comes to alternatives, the firm has very limited exposure: ""We have chosen to keep things simple from a client standpoint.""

Investment Outlook: ""Unless one party sweeps the election and gets rid of the filibuster, we're unlikely to see dramatic changes that will have an effect on the market,"" says Steinberg. He and his team remain optimistic about the direction of the economy as inflation is likely to continue to moderate, though they don't anticipate interest rates to come down too quickly. ""Personally, I was surprised they did 50 basis points,"" says Steinberg. ""I thought with the presidential election they would maybe be a bit more conservative.""

Best Advice: ""You're going to have snow storms, but snow melts and things will continue to do well,"" Steinberg often tells clients. He recalls early in his career, he once called up a client to congratulate him for his portfolio losing less than the market during a downturn: ""He told me, 'Never tell a client they're doing well when they are losing money.'"""
Why Did JetBlue Stock Rise 15%?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/why-did-jetblue-stock-rise-15/,2024-10-08T12:09:22Z,"JetBlue stock (NASDAQ: JBLU) currently trades at $7 per share, more than 65% below its peak level of $22 seen in March 2021. In comparison, its peer - United Airlines stock (NASDAQ: UAL) saw its stock decline by around 3% over the same period. JBLU stock was up nearly 15% on Friday, Oct 4, after the reports of Spirit Airlines exploring bankruptcy filing emerged.

Spirit Airlines has been struggling to stay afloat amid losses. The company's reported losses increased from $473 million in 2021 to $677 million in the last twelve months. Now, JetBlue and Frontier Airlines are key competitors to Spirit Airlines, and if Spirit were to go bankrupt, JetBlue and Frontier stand to gain. This was reflected in Friday's uptick for these stocks.

But if we look at a slightly longer term, JBLU stock has performed worse than the broader market each year since 2021. Returns for the stock were -2% in 2021, -54% in 2022, and -14% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could JBLU face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery? After its recent rise, we think JBLU stock now looks overvalued. Even if Spirit were to file for bankruptcy, other airlines will need to invest more to capture the market share. With JetBlue's already high debt level, the company may find it difficult to raise additional funds. Moody's downgraded the ratings for JetBlue to B3 in August, after the company raised more money. Also, the company has spent cash for its operations in the last twelve months.

We estimate JetBlue's Valuation to be $6 per share, slightly below the current levels of $7. Our forecast is based on 0.2x sales for JetBlue, compared to its last eight-quarters average of 0.3x. A slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the near-term headwinds.

Our detailed analysis of JetBlue's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how JBLU stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

JBLU stock declined from nearly $9 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to below $4 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying JBLU stock lost almost 60% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $5 in early 2010, rising over 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

JBLU Fundamentals Over Recent Years

JetBlue's revenues increased sharply from $6.0 billion in 2021 to $9.3 billion in the last twelve months, owing to a solid recovery in travel demand post-pandemic. The company has benefited from increased capacity and higher yields in recent years. Despite higher revenue, the company saw its reported loss expand from $0.57 per share to a loss of $2.79 per share, due to a rise in both fuel and non-fuel expenses.

Does JBLU Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

JetBlue's total debt increased from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $6.0 billion now, while its total cash decreased from $2.8 billion to $1.5 billion over the same period. The company utilized cash of $73 million toward its operating activities in the last twelve months. Given that JBLU stock has lost significant value in recent years, its market capitalization now stands at just over $2.5 billion and its total debt of around $6 billion translates into a very high debt to equity ratio of 240%. The high debt burden is a near-term risk that the company faces.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiment, we believe JetBlue stock has the potential for gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, elevated fuel prices, high debt levels, and the impact from engine inspection remain the key near-term risk factors.

While JBLU stock appears to be fully valued, it is helpful to see how JetBlue Airways' Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
Forbes Daily: Nvidia Overtakes Microsoft As Market Cap Hits $3.19 Trillion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/08/forbes-daily-nvidia-overtakes-microsoft-as-market-cap-hits-319-trillion/,2024-10-08T11:57:16Z,"When inflation spiked in the wake of the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve was ""behind the curve"" in its response, one official from the central bank told Forbes.

Forbes recently spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on the target federal funds rate. The Fed began hiking rates in March 2022, and then raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to over 5% -- the fastest interest rate increase in four decades.

Looking ahead to the second half of the decade, Goolsbee is keeping a close eye on growth in productivity, which he said would support an expanding economy without inflation.

Despite losses for its big tech peers, Nvidia's stock rallied Monday, leading it to eclipse Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia registered its highest market cap since August at $3.19 trillion, trailing only Apple, valued at $3.4 trillion.

Influencers are touting egg donation as a cash cow to millions of followers on the internet. But while social media is helping to destigmatize fertility problems and procedures, some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of content that lures donors with big payouts is doing more harm than good.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered their worst days since early September following two new hurdles for investors that threaten to increase the cost of doing business and cut into profit margins. Crude oil prices and government bond yields, which influence borrowing costs as many loans are benchmarked against Treasury notes, both moved to multiweek highs Monday.

Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz tweeted that he and his wife will make a ""significant"" donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, a notable reversal of his previous support for former President Donald Trump. Still, Horowitz said Harris' campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the ""Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry.""

Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with 60 Minutes on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2035, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

One of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, now appears underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million, which is $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to a Forbes analysis.

The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. Prosecutors asked the company, formerly known as Twitter, to sign a non-disclosure agreement barring them from informing Trump or his associates about the warrant.

As Hurricane Milton, now a Category 4 storm, is slated to make landfall in Florida this week, major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference.

The Supreme Court's new term kicked off Monday, and the justices are slated to hear cases on major issues like guns, transgender rights, vaping and environmental impact studies. The nation's highest court is likely to add a number of other key cases to its docket, including former President Donald Trump's criminal cases and challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness relief efforts.

TOPLINE Phoenix Capital Group, founded in 2019, says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently. But its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield-hungry investors.

Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like The Sean Hannity Show and webinars which it holds daily, founder Adam Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, says Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little-known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors.

From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its oil bonds yielding as much as 13%.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The private placement market is booming, offering a fast track for companies to raise capital,"" says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. ""Phoenix Capital Group has tapped into this trend, drawing mom-and-pop investors to its debt with promises of high yields and the opportunity to create 'generational wealth.' Yet, a recent deal between Phoenix and Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street behemoth, suggests that smaller investors might not be getting paid enough interest for the risk they're taking.""

Elon Musk announced his pro-Trump America PAC will pay for each successful referral of a registered swing state voter who signs a petition ""to show support for free speech and the right to bear arms"":

A lack of response, or ""ghosting,"" can be frustrating in the workplace, especially when it comes from your boss. First, assess whether their absence is out of character, and if so, give them leeway. Ensure your communication is concise and prioritized, establish regular check-ins and keep a detailed record of your communication attempts. If the behavior becomes a chronic issue, consider seeking advice on potential solutions from a mentor or senior leader.

During Sunday night's preseason NBA game between the L.A. Lakers and the Phoenix Suns, LeBron James found himself in a situation that left him wondering, ""'Is this The Matrix or something?' It just didn't feel real,"" he told ESPN. What happened during the game?

A. James sustained a concussion

B. He scored zero points for the first time in his career

Inflation Reduction Act Two Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T11:22:17Z,"This is the fourth article in a series exploring the Inflation Reduction Act's impact after two years. The first summarizes its total impact, the second details historic industry investment, the third tracks a clean manufacturing boom.

In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

A New Energy Era

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

Clean Electricity for Everyone

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

A Clean Power Future

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 8, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-08-24/,2024-10-08T10:58:18Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying teensy interest rates. But it's easy to find rates 10x higher if you know where to look. For instance, online banks and credit unions often pay much higher rates than brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
Starbucks Stock: Path To $190,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/starbucks-stock-path-to-190/,2024-10-08T10:09:38Z,"Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is adding a new beverage The Pecan Crunch Oatmilk latte to its lineup, and it has been garnering good reviews. What makes this drink different from other seasonal favorites? This beverage boasts a pecan pie-inspired flavor, evoking the nostalgia of Thanksgiving. It aims to bridge the gap between the everyday routines of the fall season and the festive indulgences of the upcoming holiday season. This beverage has the potential to become a landmark product for the company, illustrating the impact a single, game-changing offering can have on a brand's trajectory. As exemplified by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, etc, have cultivated a devoted following and solidified the company's market position. Starbucks can also replicate this success, establishing a signature offering that resonates with consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and drives business growth.

Could Starbucks stock grow 2x in the next few years from the roughly $97 level it is at currently? Does this sound a bit ridiculous? Consider this - Starbucks' stock was trading at around $126 per share, almost 1.3x the current value in July 2021. We examine a scenario in this note where SBUX stock doubles from current levels, considering three key metrics: revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.

Does SBUX stock look attractive now?

Overall, the performance of SBUX stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and -1% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SBUX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We have revised our Starbucks' Valuation to $97 per share, based on a $3.58 expected EPS and a 27.1x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price.

Snapshot of Current Scenario

Starbucks' Revenues grew from $29 billion in 2021 to $36 billion in 2023 as the company's strength in digital orders helped it rebound quickly from the pandemic setback. The company saw strength in both U.S. business and growth in the International segment during this period. However, the company's sales have been taking a hit in FY 2024 so far. The company's total sales, inclusive of new stores, were down 1% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $9.1 billion in the third quarter (ended June 30), while its global comparable sales declined 3%. Starbucks faced significant external pressures, including eroding consumer confidence, elevated inflation, and disappointing growth in China, which comprises almost one-fifth of the company's business.

How Can An Iconic Product Improve Sales?

A flagship product can potentially boost foot traffic, enhancing comparable sales opportunities. During the recent third quarter ended June, Starbucks' global comparable store sales declined by 3%, primarily driven by a 2% decline in the U.S. and a 7% decline internationally. However, when compared to a similar period before the pandemic (Q3 2019) - when Starbucks was thriving thanks to exponential growth in China, innovation in products, and global coffee alliances with the likes of Nestlé - the company's comparable sales grew 6%, driven by a 7% growth in the Americas and 5% growth in China and Asia Pacific.

An uptick in foot traffic can revitalize customer loyalty for Starbucks, bolstered by its successful rewards program. Starbucks Rewards launched over a decade and a half ago - reported 33.8 million 90-day active rewards members in the U.S. as of June 30, an increase of 7% year-over-year (also up 2% quarter-over-quarter from Q2 2024). Nonetheless, comparative analysis reveals an opportunity for further growth. For perspective, SBUX's peer Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) rewards program, introduced in Q1 2019, has surpassed Starbucks' membership numbers, with 40 million members as of Q2 2024.

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain. It boasts an extensive network of nearly 39,500 global stores, with over 18,000 located in North America. The company's growth momentum remains strong, with 526 net new store openings in Q3 (of which 141 were in North America). For FY 2024, the company has planned a total of 580 new stores added, with renovations planned in more than 800 stores in North America. This strategic expansion is poised to fuel revenue growth, solidifying Starbucks' market position and driving future profitability.

Margins Could Improve Going Forward

Starbucks' net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) fell from levels of over 14% in 2021 to about 10% in 2022 amid increasing operating costs and increased promotional activities. Nevertheless, the company's net margins grew to about 11.5% in 2023 due to sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. At present, the coffee king's Q3 2024 net margins came in at 11.6% (down 90 basis points y-o-y), and earnings per share dropped 6% y-o-y to $0.93. Despite near-term challenges, we remain upbeat on Starbucks' prospects, anticipating a margin rebound to historical levels driven by the company's transformative turnaround strategy. CEO Brian Niccol outlined a US-focused turnaround plan centered on four key areas: barista empowerment for consistent quality, timely delivery of high-quality offerings, revitalizing the community coffee house experience, and highlighting Starbucks' unique story, including its Costa Rican coffee farm and innovation hub.

Consumers are also willing to pay for the products they deem premium, based on Starbucks' high gross margin (~67%) which gives the business room to absorb higher input costs while still being profitable. Starbucks has consistently been able to raise prices throughout the inflationary environment in the U.S. - and most loyal customers still come in despite higher pricing and inflationary pressures - demonstrating the strength of its business.

Impact on Starbucks' Valuation?

The Pecan Crunch latte's financial impact will be directly tied to its availability. While seasonal releases yield quarterly gains, a permanent menu addition would likely foster sustained revenue growth.

If we assume revenue growth of roughly 1.26x between 2023 and 2027 with margins growing from 11.5% in 2023 to about 21% in 2026, a roughly 2x increase, this would mean that its net income could grow from about $4.1 billion in 2023 ($3.58 per share) to about $9.5 billion (about $8.29 per share). Good times make it easier to imagine even better times - and when that happens, investors could begin to see Starbucks in a more favorable light, re-assessing the company's recovery path. For example, if Starbucks' investors assign a multiple of 23x following its stronger growth trajectory, this could translate into a stock price of about $190 per share by the end of 2027, assuming earnings of $8.29 per share. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won't make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, with Starbucks improving its revenues and margins, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. This is a huge business and Starbucks has valuable know-how in a competitive market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand - it just may not be quick and may require patience.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. SBUX Peers shows how Starbucks' stock compares against peers on metrics that matter. You will find other useful comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Mortgage Rates 8 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-08-10-24/,2024-10-08T08:59:49Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.44%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.34% and 4.19% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.39%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.29%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Halifax's latest house price report (published 7 October) reported that the value of the average home was 4.7% higher in September than the previous year, while Nationwide building society's latest report (published 30 September) put annual house price inflation at 3.7%. Both lenders say it's the strongest annual growth they have seen since November 2022.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, also reported five consecutive months of rises. It found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before, although on a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."

The price of gold today, as of 9:10am, was £2,011.26 per ounce. That's down 0.45% on yesterday's closing price of £2,020.35.

Compared to last week, the price of gold is up 2.09%, and it's up 5.74% from one month ago.

The 52-week gold price high is £2,022.40, while the 52-week gold price low is £1,898.58.

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation."
What To Know About Kamala Harris' Economic Agenda As She Claims Congress Will Pay For It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/what-to-know-about-kamala-harris-economic-agenda-as-she-claims-congress-will-pay-for-it/,2024-10-08T01:20:44Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

Harris was asked about how she'd pay for her economic plan in her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Monday, with correspondent Bill Whitaker noting that while she wants to make the richest Americans pay more taxes, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris expressed optimism that Congress will be willing to pass her economic agenda, arguing, ""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about."" The vice president disagreed with Whitaker saying Congress ""has shown no inclination"" to back her economic plans, saying she knows ""the limitations of government"" and claiming, ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

$3.5 trillion. That's how much Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by through 2035, according to an estimate released Monday by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- still far smaller than the $7.5 trillion Trump's plan would cost. The organization noted its estimate is subject to a ""wide range of uncertainty,"" and actual figures could range anywhere from not having any impact on the deficit to costing $8.1 trillion at most.

""I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets,"" Harris declared at a September event hosted by the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, pushing back against her opponent Trump's attacks classifying Harris as a ""communist.""

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."
Trump-supporting billionaires are enabling his white supremacist rantings,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-backing-billionaires-enabling-white-supremacy-rcna174186,2024-10-08T00:54:52Z,"Some of Trump's wealthiest backers say they like his economic policies, so they keep quiet about his racism and xenophobia.

According to polls, the top issue in this year's presidential race is inflation/the economy. But at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, last week, there was just about no applause when he stated, ""We will end inflation and make America affordable again. We're going to get the prices down."" When did his audience explode with energy? When Trump gave them lines targeting immigrants, like ""On day one of my new administration, the invasion ends and the deportations begin. We get them out."" And, speaking of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, ""Do you trust her to stop the invasion?"" In response, the crowd loudly chanted, ""We need Trump! We need Trump!""

Regardless of what the polls say the top issue is, Trump knows that his rallygoers get most excited when he gives voice to white supremacy. Two weeks ago, at another rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Black migrants were destroying the character of Springfield, Ohio, and then declared, ""You have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out!"" In response, the crowd delivered a bone-chilling chant: ""Send them back! Send them back!""

Over the weekend, Trump told Wisconsin voters that he ""will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs."" The facts don't back up Trump's claims of a migrant crime wave. (As Frank Figliuzzi noted in an MSNBC column Sunday, the feds just made a huge bust of a white supremacist gang trafficking in fentanyl.) But Trump doesn't care about facts. He cares about scaring his predominantly white base and then persuading it to see him as the guardian of white America.

We know exactly which immigrants Trump is talking about given his long history of demonizing Latino immigrants and the comments he made when he was president, when he referred to Black nations such as Haiti as ""shithole countries."" His supporters know that when Trump promises ""mass deportation"" -- one of the themes of this year's Republican National Convention -- he means Black and brown people.

Everyone understands what Trump is about. But for too long there has been a tendency to excuse Trump's wealthy supporters -- like Elon Musk, who appeared at Trump's rally on Saturday -- as being on the Trump train only for the tax cuts or other financial gain -- as Trump has explicitly promised them at big-ticket fundraisers. However, these wealthy and often well-educated people see the same headlines we do. They should understand that the most visible part of Trump's campaign is racism, and it's long past time they are called out for enabling Trump's racist agenda.

As Forbes magazine detailed in its article on Trump's top billionaires, some are outspoken, while some support Trump for unspecified reasons.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who posted after Jan. 6 attack that Trump should ""resign and apologize to all Americans,"" changed his tune in July when he announced he would endorse Trump. At the time Ackman wrote on social media, ""We are in the midst of a perilous moment for our democracy."" (Seeing Trump, who is facing criminal charges for attempting a coup and called for the ""termination"" of the Constitution, as a guardian of democracy is laughable.)

New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson said this year on Fox News that he is backing Trump again because ""Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border and inflation and gas prices and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there."" The Winklevoss twins, famously depicted in the film ""The Social Network,"" about the founding of Facebook, donated more than $1 million each to support Trump, citing Trump's ""Pro-Bitcoin Pro-Crypto Pro-Business"" position.

But every one of these billionaires is telling us that in exchange for the policy goals they want, they are on board with or at least comfortable with Trump's bigotry. After all, if racism were a deal-breaker for them, would they still be funding his 2024 campaign?

Others, like Musk, though, appear to be more openly on board with Trump's extremist agenda. Musk has peddled the same types of bigoted attacks Trump has about Black migrants in Ohio, demonized DEI programs while suggesting white people are inherently smarter than Black people. And Ackman has been vocally critical of DEI programs with posts on X such as ""DEI is inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.""

Trump has become the head cheerleader for white victimhood and the defender of symbols of white power. This explains why on Friday he told supporters at an event in North Carolina he would rename the local military base to again honor the slave-owning Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, who, as part of the Confederacy, fought to preserve chattel slavery.

""Should we change the name Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?!"" Trump asked, and the crowd exploded with cheers. (The name of that base, like others that honored Confederates, was changed in 2020 when Congress overrode Trump's veto of the bill.) Trump vowed that if wins, he is ""doing it."" This syncs up perfectly with Trump's defense of monuments honoring white supremacy as ""beautiful"" when he was president.

Those who claim that they're supporting Trump for his promises of tax cuts or deregulation don't get a pass when he's using such racist language and promising to carry out racist policies. If a candidate campaigning on white supremacy is elected to the presidency again, they won't be able to evade accountability with the claim that that's not why they supported him.

""I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country,"" Trump told Time magazine in April. He is reportedly planning a second-term overhaul of anti-discrimination law that his allies say would ""dramatically change the government's interpretation of Civil Rights-era laws to focus on 'anti-white racism' rather than discrimination against people of color."" And as the American Civil Liberties Union has recently warned -- citing the mandates of Project 2025 -- if Trump wins there will be a dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs because he and his supporters have characterized them as ""anti-white racism."" Indeed, 84% of his supporters are worried about ""anti-white"" discrimination.

Trump isn't hiding his bigotry. In fact, it's the cornerstone of his campaign. And if he's returned to office, then everybody who helped him get there is responsible: those who voted for him because of the white supremacy and those who say they had other reasons but didn't treat the white supremacy as disqualifying."
"Travel-Retail Sales Growing At Only Half The Pace Of Passenger Traffic, Says Kearney",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinrozario/2024/10/07/travel-retail-sales-growing-at-only-half-the-pace-of-passenger-traffic-says-kearney/,2024-10-07T23:21:06Z,"In its past glory years, the travel retail channel had it easy: annual passenger traffic grew steadily lifting retail sales at the same, if not higher, growth rates. Domestic retailers looked on in envy. However, in a post-Covid world, this correlation has disappeared.

At last week's Tax Free World Association ((TFWA) exhibition in Cannes, France -- where the movers and shakers in the duty-free world gather annually -- a new report shattered a few industry illusions.

One of them is that China would be a continuous source of high-spending travelers. Post-Covid, this has proved not to be the case despite their numbers rapidly returning to key markets like South Korea. There are several other factors constraining sales.

A new report from Kearney, commissioned by TFWA, shows that last year, passenger volumes grew by 30%, easily outstripping travel retail sales which rose by only 18% (see chart above). According to the global management consulting firm, the retail rise resulted in a global market valued at $72 billion, but last year's numbers also ""broke the mirroring between the two trends (of traffic and sales) for the first time in the industry's history.""

As well as the Chinese spending less, which has hit the Hainan market severely, Kearney says that travel retail's price advantage is facing long-term erosion. ""While enthusiasm for shopping in airports remains strong, behavioral patterns and expectations across generations of customers are evolving under new pressures,"" the firm stated.

Data from m1nd-set, a dedicated travel retail consultancy, indicate an attitudinal evolution from 2019 to 2024 with prices no longer top-of-mind for passengers. Over this period, m1nd-set's traveling consumer surveys show that the relevance of pricing advantage dropped significantly from 30% to just 13%. The same surveys -- using a panel of more than 230,000 shoppers -- point to promotions and value-for-money also decreasing in importance over the same period.

It seems strange that price could become so insignificant that quickly given the cost-of-living crises seen around the world in recent years. However, in July, the IMF left its 2025 growth forecast unchanged at 3.3%, broadly in line with 2024 and last year, which might mean some economic stabilization.

Nevertheless, in airports, price competition is evident. Another travel retail research agency, Pi Insight, ran a price comparison of the gin brand, Bombay Sapphire. Across 14 airports, it found large price variations of between +23% at Istanbul Airport and -29% at London Heathrow using Frankfurt Airport as the index (0%).

Gebr. Heinemann, a retail operator at both Istanbul and Frankfurt airports, told me: ""The price varies across airports as Bombay Sapphire is a global bestseller which is regularly available in promotional offers.""

According to Kearney, price is still a ""crucial concern"" for consumers, especially given ongoing inflationary pressures. In its own survey of 3,700 customers across 10 countries, 30% of respondents cited price as a barrier to purchase and 27% are using price-comparison tools to see if 'deals' are real or not.

As well as challenging price, 29% of respondents cited unsatisfying assortments as a reason not to purchase. The firm's report finds that spending by passengers has been steadily decreasing with average spending in 2023 down to $16 per passenger which is below pre-Covid levels. Between 2009 and 2018 the average was $17.50.

Importantly, younger travelers -- Millennials and Gen Zs -- prioritize unusual experiences over competitive prices and are becoming the largest single demographic. These generations are not being sufficiently addressed by travel retailers according to Kearney which said that they ""continue to place too much of an emphasis on discounted transactions to the detriment of storytelling, innovation, and personalized offers.""

The firm's top solution for greater sales conversion is the rapid adoption of technology, more personalized offers, and collaborative partnerships across the relevant stakeholders in the airport ecosystem.

One of the authors, Vincent Barbat, a partner at Kearney, said: ""The industry needs to move away from being price-centric to being more traveler-centric. The fact that revenues are no longer correlated with air passenger growth is further proof that new consumer dynamics resulting from a rapidly evolving travel retail landscape remain inadequately addressed.

""While technology alone will not guarantee blue skies and future prosperity for the industry, it does hold real promise. Some of its tools will allow for enhanced customer experiences and greater product personalization; the true challenge lies in striking the right balance between high-tech and high-touch, keeping the industry both efficient and human.""

There is consensus around tech: airports have been busy automating and digitalizing every step of the travel journey, for example at Abu Dhabi International. Speeding things up will give passengers more time to shop. More passengers are also tech enthusiasts; 45% say they frequently use in-store tools to enhance their shopping experience. This gives retailers an easy route to drive conversion using AR/VR and eventually AI-powered personal shoppers."
U.S. Equities Surge In Best Election Year Since 1936,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/us-equities-surge-in-best-election-year-since-1936/,2024-10-07T20:24:59Z,"As we approach the final stretch of 2024, much of the nation's focus is on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. But while the political landscape remains uncertain, the markets are painting a different picture. September, traditionally a sluggish month for global equities, delivered an unexpected surge.

The S&P 500 gained 2.02%, marking its strongest September since 2013. This brought its year-to-date return to 22.08%, making 2024 the best presidential election year for stocks in almost 90 years (more on that later).

Bitcoin has been another standout performer. Once viewed with skepticism by traditional investors, the digital currency posted a nearly 8% gain last month, bringing its year-to-date growth to an astonishing 51%. With the Federal Reserve adopting a dovish stance, the U.S. dollar has weakened, prompting investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against inflation and uncertainty.

Election years often bring volatility as markets grapple with the uncertainty surrounding potential changes in leadership, but 2024 has proven to be an outlier. Central bank easing has provided a powerful tailwind, helping to stabilize markets and lift stocks higher, despite lingering concerns over who will occupy the White House next year.

In fact, 2024 is shaping up to be the best presidential election year for stocks in nearly 90 years. By the end of September, the S&P 500 had risen more than 22%, the highest return during an election year since 1936. Investors have embraced the Fed's commitment to looser monetary policy, which has kept market sentiment buoyant despite the political backdrop.

Beneath the surface of these impressive market gains, however, lies a more complex picture of the U.S. economy. It's a tale of two sectors: while services continue to thrive, manufacturing is struggling.

The U.S. services sector -- which accounts for nearly 80% of the country's GDP -- has now expanded for 20 consecutive months. New orders continue to grow, driven by steady consumer demand and a reduction in interest rates, which has made borrowing more affordable for businesses and households alike, according to S&P Global. Despite some moderation from the 14-month high we saw in August, the sector looks strong, providing a foundation for economic stability.

In contrast, the manufacturing sector is showing signs of strain. The end of the third quarter saw manufacturing dip deeper into contraction territory. Slowing demand, both domestically and internationally, has weighed heavily on the sector, and many analysts are pointing to broader economic challenges as the cause. The uncertain outcome of the upcoming election has only added to the unease, as companies hold off on major investments until they have a clearer sense of the country's political direction.

In addition to domestic economic concerns, several external factors threaten to disrupt the positive momentum we've seen in the markets.

Hurricane Helene, for instance, serves as a reminder of the unpredictable risks posed by Mother Nature. The storm caused what could amount to $34 billion in total economic losses, with insured damages expected to exceed $6 billion.

The recent resolution of the dockworker strike at East Coast and Gulf ports -- a potential ""man-made disaster,"" according to President Joe Biden -- is a welcome development, but its impact will likely linger. The strike, which disrupted one of the busiest shipping periods of the year, created a huge backlog of goods waiting to be processed. Major retailers like Walmart, Ikea and Home Depot, which rely heavily on these ports for imported goods, were among the hardest hit.

As operations resume, shipping giants such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have warned that freight costs are likely to rise as a result of the delays. While the strike itself has ended (for now), the fallout could affect supply chains well into the fourth quarter, particularly as retailers ramp up for the holiday season.

Despite these challenges, there's still reason for optimism as we head into the holiday season. Adobe is forecasting a record $240.8 billion in online holiday sales, an 8.4% increase over 2023. Electronics and apparel are expected to be the standout categories, driven by deep discounts as retailers aim to move inventory.

As we move into the final quarter of 2024, there's much to be hopeful about. Central bank easing has provided a strong foundation for market growth, and the holiday season promises to deliver robust consumer spending.

At U.S. Global Investors, we believe in taking a long-term view. While the short-term outlook remains favorable, it's essential to stay diversified and prepared for whatever the future may hold. As always, our focus is on helping investors navigate both the opportunities and challenges ahead."
Dow Suffers Worst Day In A Month As Rising Bond Yields A New Wrench For Investors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/07/dow-suffers-worst-day-in-a-month-as-rising-bond-yields-a-new-wrench-for-investors/,2024-10-07T20:11:19Z,"Stocks tumbled Monday as the market digested new risks complicating the benefits of the much-awaited interest rate cuts on the equity market.

The recent rise in bond yields comes as a relative surprise compared to expectations for the bond market after the Federal Reserve rolled out a big 50 basis-point rate cut Sept. 18. Treasury yields serve as a rough proxy for fixed income investors' expectations for monetary policy, and, considering the consensus view that the Fed will keep bringing interest rates down, climbing government bond yields do not align with that view. The 10-year Treasury yield is often used as the baseline for loans such as mortgages, meaning some borrowing costs are actually higher now than they were prior to the Fed's cut. Bond yields also shot up Friday after the U.S. reported far stronger September job growth than expected. ""The bond market is becoming less skeptical on the soft landing outcome,"" explained Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson in a Monday note to clients.

Though higher bond yields can evoke bad memories for equity investors -- see the 2022 unraveling as the inflation crisis deepened -- it's not necessarily a bad omen for stocks. The 10-year is down a full percentage point over the last year and about 0.4 percentage points over the last six months. And yields are rising because the U.S. economy looks stronger than anticipated, a potential boon for earnings growth, with Wilson noting the increased odds of a soft landing ""should support more cyclical leadership in equities."" Over the weekend, Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin raised their year-end price target for the S&P from 5,600 to 6,000 and its 12-month target from 6,000 to 6,300, indicating 5% and 10% further upside, respectively, citing the ""steady macro outlook.""

""Our job's to be worried about everything,"" Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, told Forbes last week when asked about how new shocks like higher oil prices may impact the trajectory of monetary policy."
Vanguard BrandVoice: 4 Trends Transforming How America Saves For Retirement,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vanguard/2024/10/07/4-trends-transforming-how-america-saves-for-retirement/,2024-10-07T19:03:53Z,"From building your nest egg to navigating financial hurdles, everyone's journey to retirement is unique -- but a clear road map is key to success. This is evident in research conducted by investment management company Vanguard in its comprehensive How America Saves 2024 report, which explores hundreds of retirement contribution plans, thousands of data points and the actions of millions of participants. For the past 23 years, Vanguard has been researching retirement trends and using data to help plan administrators optimize offerings.

The result? Retirement plan designs that are built to weather economic challenges, such as high interest rates and rising inflation. Despite these challenges, 2023 was a year of progress for retirement savings. The report found that 85% of eligible employees were enrolled in a plan, with an average saving rate of 7.4% of income -- an all-time high.

""These trends show the remarkable commitment that sponsors and consultants have made to help employees reach their financial goals,"" says John James, managing director of Vanguard Institutional Investor Group.

Here are four key findings from Vanguard's report that illustrate how thoughtful plan designs built for today's workforce can help employees confidently stay the course while saving for retirement.

Historically, eligible employees had to opt in to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. But now, the report shows more plans are automatically enrolling participants, leading to higher participation rates. Ten years ago, only 35% of plans had a participation rate above 90%, per the report. ""For a variety of reasons -- inertia, procrastination, poor planning -- some employees never enrolled,"" says James. In 2023, 57% of Vanguard plans had a participation rate of 90% or higher.

""With autoenrollment, inertia actually works in employees' favor, because now they're effectively being asked whether they'd like to quit the plan,"" James says.

He adds that plan participants and plan managers are also taking advantage of other automatic options, including automatic increases in deferral rates and investment in target-date funds.

""In the aggregate, these automatic features work well because they reduce the number of decisions that participants must make, decisions that many employees don't feel confident about,"" says James.

Professionally managed allocations, or PMAs, are when participants have their entire account invested in a single target-date fund (TDF), a target-risk fund or a traditional balanced fund, or else managed in an account advisory service. The report shows that in 2023, 66% of participants were invested in a PMA, up from 7% 20 years ago.

James credits this surge to several factors, including the vast majority (96%) of plans offering TDFs. Overall, 64% of all contributions went into TDFs in 2023, an all-time high, says James. The report says an important factor driving the popularity of TDFs is their function as an automatic or default investment strategy, minimizing the need for participants to self-manage their accounts and creating more balanced portfolios for savers. Because allocations are automatically adjusted based on a participant's expected retirement timeline, savers can feel confident while taking a hands-off investing approach.

""TDFs have also done an incredible job of reducing extreme equity allocations, meaning participants with a 0% or 100% equity allocation,"" says James. ""Just 8% of participants had such an extreme allocation in 2023, whereas before TDFs and advice were widely offered, more than a third of participants had a 0% or 100% equity allocation.""

It's a balancing act for employees to manage saving for retirement with other financial goals, says James. Plan participants' holistic financial well-being is now a priority for plan sponsors, and advice is becoming a key component of their efforts.

Recognizing the role advice can play in building financial wellness and confidence, more plan managers included advice opportunities among their offerings. According to the report, 43% of plans offered advice in 2023, providing access to 77% of plan participants.

""A qualified advice program should help participants avoid making investment errors,"" says James. ""For example, behavioral coaching and emotional support, especially during periods of market turmoil, can help participants avoid performance chasing and panic selling.""

Professional guidance included in a plan simplifies investing and helps savers optimize long-term outcomes, he says. Per the report, only 10% of plan participants used advice services in 2023, but James is optimistic this percentage will grow as more plans incorporate advice and more participants know these services are available to them.

An evolving workforce means that retirement plans must meet the needs of all employees, including Gen Z and Millennials, who are becoming a substantial portion of the labor market. ""Our research shows that younger workers are especially benefiting from improved plan designs,"" James says. ""Participation rates of workers ages 25 to 34 have risen from 74% to 83% in the past 10 years.""

The report says plan sponsors are also seeking ways to support retirees within their plans: Sixty-seven percent allowed retirees to take installments and 40% of plans offered partial withdrawals, a significant increase from 27% in 2018.

Not only that, but the deferral rate for workers ages 25 to 34 increased by more than 20%, from 5.5% to 6.7%, between 2014 and 2023. Vanguard plans also provide additional investment avenues, such as making Roth contributions, which younger and higher-income participants tend to use. Over 80% of Vanguard plans had a Roth savings feature and 17% of plan participants took advantage of it, up from 12% in 2019.

Designing Retirement Plans For Success

As retirement plan designs continue to evolve amid a shifting financial landscape and workforce, it's clear that plan sponsors are responding effectively to participants' needs. With tools like automatic enrollment and PMAs, including advice, employees are better positioned to achieve their long-term financial goals.

Plus, plans that contain a robust suite of investment options, such as TDFs and Roth contributions, allow participants to customize their retirement strategy. These innovations, and more to come, are paving the way for stronger saving habits and more secure retirements for all."

The price of gold today, as of 4:50pm, was £2,022.01 per ounce. That's up 0.10% on yesterday's closing price of £2,019.99.

Compared to last week, the price of gold is up 1.55%, and it's up 5.85% from one month ago.

The 52-week gold price high is £2,022.40, while the 52-week gold price low is £1,898.58.

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation."
How The Hospital Industrial Complex Robs Poor Patients,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypipes/2024/10/07/how-the-hospital-industrial-complex-robs-poor-patients/,2024-10-07T16:22:42Z,"Sally Pipes is a scholar and think tank CEO who writes on health care.

Pharmaceutical leader Johnson & Johnson recently unleashed a firestorm in Washington after it proposed a change to how it offers discounted prices on two drugs in a little-known, but enormous, federal program that's hurting the low-income patients it was created to help.

That program, known as the ""340B Drug Pricing Program,"" allows certain hospitals -- and their affiliated clinics and pharmacies -- to access medicines at significantly lower prices offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

To help ensure that 340B discounts are being obtained lawfully and benefit the low-income patients they're intended for, J&J proposed offering such discounts as retroactive rebates -- rather than upfront discounts -- for a subset of 340B hospitals on two of its medicines. This change was intended to help bring much-needed transparency to the 340B program.

Officials at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), who run the program, blew a gasket. HRSA, whose mission is to provide ""equitable health care to the nation's highest-need communities,"" effectively announced that unless J&J backed down, the agency would kick the drug maker out of Medicare and Medicaid.

J&J has now decided to forgo implementation. But the concerns the company raised are wholly appropriate. Because the alleged behavior of many 340B hospitals is well-documented by government oversight agencies, raises patient and taxpayer costs, and boosts hospital profits, the current iteration of 340B ultimately detracts from the stated mission of the program.

One of 340B's most significant problems stems from the interaction of the program with Medicaid, the joint federal-state insurer for poor and indigent Americans. To have their drugs covered by Medicaid, drug makers must offer at least a 23.1% discount off their regular prices.

Federal law doesn't allow for 340B and Medicaid discounts to be paid on the same medicine. But that seems to be what's happening. Many hospitals and federal grantees are buying drugs at a discount, and state Medicaid programs are collecting hefty rebates for the same medicines given to the same patient.

The problem is only going to get worse as the Inflation Reduction Act is fully implemented and price controls, starting with 10 drugs under Medicare Part D in 2026, roll through the system. The IRA pours fuel on the fire with another government-mandated price, where duplication is illegal. For those keeping tabs, HHS is implementing all three programs, but the various hands are not talking to each other -- and not proactively trying to address these issues.

Thanks to the lack of transparency in the program, it's impossible to know just how widespread this double-dipping is. The process of interaction between 340B discounts and Medicaid discounts is opaque, and officials either can't or won't answer the question of how often this abuse occurs.

Hospitals have found new ways to profit off of 340B in recent years. Under the program, hospitals that meet certain criteria (for example, serving a certain percentage of low-income patients) are eligible to buy prescriptions from drug manufacturers at substantial mandatory discounts -- as much as half off. Hospitals can then charge insurers a higher price, pocketing the difference.

Health systems should use these savings to provide more charity care. But a loophole in the law means hospitals don't have to use or prove the money is to help the indigent. In practice, many simply keep the savings for themselves rather than passing them along to uninsured or underinsured patients.

Due to increasing hospital ownership consolidation, numerous facilities with little connection to poor communities have become eligible for 340B discounts. Of the nearly 3,000 hospitals in the program, only 35% are located in medically underserved neighborhoods. In fact, 85% of 340B hospitals make more money from 340B than they provide in total charity care.

Abuse of the 340B program doesn't just divert finite resources away from low-income patients. A study from a Columbia University economist found that the program could actually increase taxpayer costs in the long term ""by increasing provider consolidation, distorting incentives for efficient care, and impacting overall utilization.""

How can this be? For one, 340B incentivizes healthcare facilities to consolidate, leading to less competition and higher patient costs. And when drug makers are forced to hand over improper discounts to hospitals, they may simply raise prices elsewhere to accommodate for the lost revenue.

These distortions have become even more of a concern in recent years, as experts have warned that 340B hospitals could be illegally collecting duplicative discounts for the same medicines. Research firm IQVIA estimated that in 2021, ""manufacturers will be responsible for $20-25 billion in duplicate discounts that may not have been owed.""

Curiously, congressional outrage hasn't been directed at the parties responsible for this continued malfeasance. Instead, a letter from 189 lawmakers took aim at J&J as a menace to poor communities for attempting to make the discount system more transparent and less susceptible to exploitation, even though the behavior that J&J is attempting to root out is plainly illegal.

Yet, with no government enforcement mechanism in place to stop this multi-billion-dollar money grab, it's no wonder why J&J proposed to substitute rebates for up-front discounts to get a better handle on the problem and prevent redundant payments that raise overall costs.

Genuine congressional oversight would entail determining if unlawful double-dipping is going on and whether officials at HRSA, CMS (which oversees Medicaid), and elsewhere are turning a blind eye. Instead, we got political theater free of any real policy substance.

As it stands, the ongoing abuse of 340B and Medicaid discounts is enriching huge hospital conglomerates at the expense of patients, employers, state governments, poor communities, and taxpayers."
What To Expect From September's CPI Inflation Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/07/what-to-expect-from-septembers-cpi-inflation-report/,2024-10-07T16:20:48Z,"Consumer Price Index inflation data to be released on October 10 is expected to provide some support for the Federal Open Market Committee cutting rates in November. However, unemployment data may ultimately matter more for the FOMC's decision making.

All inflation metrics are down over the past 12 months according to the Atlanta Fed's Dashboard that measures a range of inflation metrics. Specifically, headline annual CPI inflation is 2.5% to August 2024 and core CPI, which removes swings in food and energy prices is 3.2%.

Although these figures do not hit the FOMC's 2% inflation goal, inflation is running at a much lower rate than for much of the 2021-2023 period. As a result the FOMC made the first interest rate cut of this cycle in September, recognizing that monetary policy no longer needed to be as restrictive with significant progress on inflation.

Inflation nowcasts from the Cleveland Fed call for reassuring inflation data. They expect 0.1% monthly inflation for headline CPI for September and 0.3% monthly core inflation. Should these forecasts hold, they would provide further reassurance for the FOMC that inflation is now under control. However, some minor concerns remain.

Firstly, shelter costs, which make up a large portion of CPI inflation continue to rise at a relatively fast 5.2% annual rate as of August 2024. Reaching the FOMC's 2% target may require shelter costs to cool from these levels. Secondly, the FOMC continues to monitor for unexpected shocks that could cause inflation to resume. For example, the dockworkers' strike ending with a substantial pay increase recently is the sort of thing the FOMC will be monitoring, to make sure wage-lead inflation doesn't resume.

Inflation was among the more closely watch economic indicators in recent years, given the surge in prices. Now, the FOMC is paying closer attention to the other component of its dual mandate - maintaining full employment. Typically, when the FOMC raises rates abruptly, increases in unemployment result. We've seen that to some degree this cycle with unemployment now at 4.1% for September compared to 3.8% in September 2023. However, so far the increase in unemployment has been sufficiently gradual, so far, to ease fears of a potential recession. Still, jobs data is likely to get more attention than inflation data should inflation continue to ease back towards 2%.

The FOMC next sets interest rates on November 7. Therefore, the October 10 figures will be the last CPI release before that meeting. However, there will be a Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index release on October 31, which may offer further insight on U.S. inflation trends.

It is expected that the FOMC elects to cut interest rates by 0.25% according to the CME FedWatch Tool, with some chance that rates are held steady. Previously, markets anticipated a material chance of a larger 0.5% cut. However, that probability has faded with unexpectedly robust jobs data for September, with the economy adding a higher than expected 254,000 jobs. Should inflation continue to cool, so it is likely that the FOMC continues to cut rates. However, the pace of loosening monetary policy may be more informed by jobs data than inflation figures."
Bad But Well-Intentioned Career Advice From Parents,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/07/bad-but-well-intentioned-career-advice-from-parents/,2024-10-07T15:19:41Z,"We may love our parents, but with any family dynamics, there are bound to be disagreements. While parents may have the best intentions for their kids, their advice can sometimes be outdated.

When you're searching for a new job or attempting to grow your career, one or both of your parents may bombard you with all of their advice and suggestions. They'll inform you that they are older, and, therefore, wiser and know what is best for you.

Unfortunately, they haven't been in the job market for decades, so their guidance may not hold up in the current environment. Nevertheless, it's a foregone conclusion that they'll lecture you on all aspects of the labor market.

You'll wince when they push you toward a safe career, such as becoming a doctor, lawyer or software engineer. Despite the fact that these careers don't appeal to you, they'll talk all about their friends' kids who are wonderfully successful in these occupations.

While these are respectable professions, there are countless other fulfilling and lucrative career options. It can be too much pressure on a young adult to lead a life and career that they are not enthusiastic about or have the ability to excel in.

Moreover, while your parents' advice may come from a place of love and care, it's essential to adapt it to the modern workplace. By critically evaluating different perspectives, you can make informed decisions about your career path.

Parents often say, ""Back in my day, you stayed at an organization for the entire duration of your career. There was none of that jumping around. You made a commitment to the company and you stay there."" They'll tell you, ""Keep your head down, stay out of trouble and you'll do fine.""

This advice may have held up for them, but in today's workforce, nobody is going to just give you a promotion or new job. You have to put yourself out there and seize the opportunity.

You have to get yourself noticed by the right people who can help grow your career. Competition is fiercer today now that more professionals hold four-year degrees compared to during our parents' time. Job security is at greater risk with the emergence of technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence. With the advent of remote work, it may be harder to get noticed by your supervisor now that you lack proximity and access to them in the physical workplace.

Workers no longer feel a sense of loyalty to their company because they have since realized how one-sided the relationship is. The notion that a company is a ""family"" has irrevocably been busted.

For decades, corporations have branded themselves as a big, happy family. However, employees now see it for what it really is: transactional. A family would never fire grandma right before Christmas.

People have caught on to the fact that loyalty comes with a price. In recruiting, there's a concept known as the ""loyalty discount,"" which refers to the compensation of long-term employees. This phenomenon occurs when an individual has been with a company for an extended period, such as 10 or 20 years. Initially, their starting salary may have been comparatively modest. Over time, with annual salary increases typically ranging from 1% to 2%, and factoring in the effects of inflation, these loyal employees often find their compensation considerably under market compared to those who frequently change jobs.

Job-hoppers tend to secure more substantial pay increases, often in the range of 10% to 20% with each career move, resulting in a notable disparity in earnings between long-term employees and those who change employers more frequently.

While that approach might be effective in dating, it doesn't apply to job interviews. If you appear standoffish, cold, distant or aloof, it won't create an air of mystery or intrigue; instead, it will lead interviewers to think you lack interest in the position.

Hiring managers are looking for candidates who genuinely want the job and are enthusiastic about the opportunity. They are not interested in pursuing someone who seems indifferent. If you are coy and unclear about how you feel about the opportunity, and plenty of other applicants are available, they'll just move on. Ultimately, they will avoid hiring someone who behaves as if they are doing you a favor by accepting the position.

Against your parent's advice, if you are interested in a job opportunity, make it clear that you want it. For example, at the end of the interview process, let the hiring manager know, ""I really enjoyed meeting with everyone and the role is a perfect fit for my background. If you are considering putting together an offer -- and I hope that you are -- I'd gladly accept the compensation we discussed.""

By stating this, the hiring manager doesn't have to worry about competing with a counteroffer. There is political capital spent getting an offer approved. At large companies, it has to go through several channels and a bunch of red tape. If a candidate later rejects the offer, it makes the team involved in the hiring process look bad.

In baseball, coaches may say, ""Don't swing at the first pitch."" It translates to ""there may be a better pitch thrown, if you wait a little longer"" or ""don't be too impatient.""

This cliché is also used in job searches. Your parents may admonish you for taking the first offer that's extended to you. Their old-school thinking is that there are so many other jobs available, so it's worthwhile to keep swinging until you get the perfect pitch.

In a tight job market, characterized by layoffs and financial insecurity, it may make sense to lock in the job. Since hiring has significantly slowed down, you may not have the luxury of plentiful choices. Also, to get this one offer, you had to endure over six months of interviews, meeting with 12 people from the company, completing a take-home project and pre-employment psychological assessment. You are invested!

If you believe in your heart that this is the right next step, don't let anyone talk you out of it just because it was the first offer.

While dressing professionally is important, you want to ensure that your interview attire aligns with the company's culture. Different industries have varying expectations for professional attire.

Dressing appropriately for the specific sector or company allows the interviewer to begin envisioning you as part of their team. In some casual work environments, like tech startups, wearing overly formal attire might make you appear too rigid.

Disconnecting from work is essential for your physical and mental health. To avoid falling victim to presenteeism or burnout, you must set clear boundaries to protect your overall well-being.

It is also important to allow yourself time to rest and recover, as you are no good to anybody if you feel run down. This means not checking work emails or taking calls while out of the office, unless urgent. Do not hesitate to delegate tasks to your team, as that is what they are there for.

To avoid burnout, make sure you are using your personal, vacation and sick days to give yourself respite. If your workload is overwhelming, request a meeting with your manager to discuss work-life balance concerns.

Your folks may suggest, ""Networking is just about who you know."" While connections are important, building genuine relationships based on mutual benefit is essential for long-term success.

In their day, they'd attend an event with a sticker on their jacket with their name, company and corporate title. People would shake their sweaty hands and check to see where everyone aligned in the corporate hierarchy. However, professional networking has evolved significantly over the decades, transforming from primarily face-to-face interactions to a blend of in-person and digital connections."
Democratizing Finance: How Web3 Bridges The Gap For The Underbanked,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/07/democratizing-finance-how-web3-bridges-the-gap-for-the-underbanked/,2024-10-07T15:08:01Z,"The global financial landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by rapid advancements in technology. In particular, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies promises to break down traditional barriers to financial services, making them more accessible to individuals and communities that have long been excluded. As of 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide remain unbanked, meaning they have no access to formal banking institutions. Another 1 billion are underbanked, lacking sufficient access to affordable financial products. This exclusion contributes to cycles of poverty, as it limits individuals' ability to save, borrow, or invest. However, decentralized technologies, which utilize blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, offer a new pathway to financial inclusion, providing innovative solutions for these underserved populations.

Web3 technologies, which refer to a decentralized version of the internet built on blockchain, represent a significant departure from traditional centralized financial systems. Instead of entirely relying on intermediaries such as banks or payment processors, Web3 enables peer-to-peer transactions and automated financial services. For the underbanked, this is revolutionary. Access to digital wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and cryptocurrencies means that people can store, transfer, and grow their wealth independently of traditional financial institutions, avoiding high fees and geographical limitations while complying to regulatory compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

Key industry players in this space are already making significant strides toward democratizing finance. Mastercard, in collaboration with MetaMask and Baanx, recently launched a crypto-to-fiat card allowing MetaMask wallet users to spend their cryptocurrency directly in fiat currency at any location accepting Mastercard. This new solution removes the need for intermediaries like exchanges or banks, making it easier for self-custodial wallet users to access funds outside the crypto space. This initiative is a step towards connecting Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, empowering underbanked individuals with instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for everyday purchases.

Another company actively driving financial inclusion through Web3 technologies is CrossFi, founded by Alexander Mamasidikov. It creates decentralized finance (DeFi) tools that aim to democratize access to financial services, empowering everyone to take control of their own financial futures. By building a bridge between traditional banking and DeFi, CrossFi offers a suite of products that allows users to seamlessly manage both fiat and cryptocurrency assets. These innovative products include the world's first non-custodial payment card, enabling users to spend cryptocurrency directly from their Web3 wallets, without the need for a third-party custodian or exchange. For millions of people across various socioeconomic backgrounds who don't have access to conventional banking, this on-chain payment card represents a gateway to the global economy, enabling their access to secure, transparent, and efficient financial services.

""We believe that financial inclusion is not just about offering financial services -- it's about creating accessible, secure, and user-friendly tools that anyone can use, regardless of where they are in the world,"" said Alexander Mamasidikov, founder of CrossFi.

Another player in the Web3 finance space is 1inch, known for its decentralized finance products. The 1inch Wallet and 1inch Card provide users with seamless ways to manage and spend digital assets. The 1inch Card allows for crypto-to-fiat conversion at competitive rates and supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, ensuring that users can make everyday purchases with crypto while benefiting from secure, fast transactions. With features like a physical and virtual card, it empowers individuals to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional financial systems.

However, as with any new financial technology, regulatory frameworks need to be in place to prevent misuse. Fintech companies like CrossFi need to ensure compliance with local regulations by requiring users to pass Know Your Customer (KYC) checks before obtaining their credit cards. These companies work closely with local regulators and banking partners to maintain full compliance across all products, backed by dedicated legal teams that monitor and adhere to the legal requirements of each geography.

""Robust compliance and regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure that web3-powered DeFi innovations operate within the boundaries of the law. Without clear guidelines, we risk creating a system vulnerable to exploitation. That's why, at CrossFi, we prioritize full compliance, leaving no loopholes in our approach. It's crucial for us to adhere to the laws in the different regions we operate, as it ensures trust and long-term sustainability for our users,"" said Mamasidikov.

Beyond payment cards, innovations like stablecoins and decentralized lending platforms are also playing a crucial role in extending financial services to the underbanked. Stablecoins, for instance, are digital currencies pegged to a stable asset such as the U.S. dollar issued by Circle or Hong Kong dollar issued by IDA. These offer a secure and reliable alternative to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies, making them an ideal option for people in regions with unstable currencies or inflationary economies. Additionally, decentralized lending platforms enable individuals to access credit without needing a traditional bank account or credit score, opening up new opportunities for financial empowerment.

Olga Feldmeier, a prominent blockchain expert and CEO of Smart Valor, an AI-powered crypto investment platform, believes that DeFi has the potential to completely reshape the financial landscape by making essential financial services more accessible to all. ""Stablecoins, for example, can serve as a lifeline for people living in countries with hyperinflation, providing them with a way to protect their wealth and participate in the global economy,"" Feldmeier explained.

Mamasidikov also shares a similar view: ""The real power of Web3 in democratizing finance lies in its ability to provide programmable liquidity and trust-less financial instruments. By leveraging decentralized protocols, we can bypass traditional gatekeepers and offer financial services that are not bound by geographic borders or legacy banking infrastructure. In this context, stablecoins represent a breakthrough in providing stability in uncertain economic environments. They allow people to store and transfer value securely and affordably, particularly in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or unreliable.""

The movement towards decentralized finance is still in its early stages, but it holds immense potential for creating a more inclusive financial system. By eliminating intermediaries and providing direct access to financial services, innovative Web3 technologies can empower individuals to take control of their finances, no matter where they are located. In doing so, they are helping to bridge the gap for the underbanked and pave the way for a more equitable global economy.

Ultimately, the democratization of finance through Web3 is not just about technology; it's about creating a fairer, more inclusive system that gives everyone the opportunity to participate in the global economy. The future of finance is decentralized, and it's one where everyone has a seat at the table."
5 Stocks To Own For The 2024 Elections & Beyond!,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenberman/2024/10/07/5-stocks-to-own-for-the-2024-elections--beyond/,2024-10-07T14:10:05Z,"Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut ""party,"" which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year's robust gains

The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren't going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India's middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade

The U.S. economy's relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns

After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections

Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance

Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases

Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities

Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond

2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector's continued leadership and the bull market's broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023.

Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq's extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years.

The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the ""New Golden Age of Stock Picking"" that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that.

But, before diving deep into the Gorilla's top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail!

Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer

Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market's continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros.

August's deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs' (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power.

There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer's pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don't believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist.

The Fed's New Focus: Jobs and Growth

The Fed's fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer.

What's more, inflation is now officially in the Fed's rear-view mirror, and the past few months' trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed's new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years.

Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates.

Let's see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed's easing cycle.

Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead?

Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system's strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector's stability in the face of last year's regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla's main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024.

So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer's gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August's pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon.

Evidence for a ""soft landing"" is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia's war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks.

With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring ""Goldilocks"" conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions.

A Maturing Bull Market

Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a ""slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year."" By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter's grinding and ""boring"" advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don't closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets.

Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla's expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally's base is undeniable.

The odds are that this year's trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November's elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year's increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party!

If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year.

The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies.

Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won't slow down anytime soon.

Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth

AMT's average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry's profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors.

American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge.

Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company's core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters.

Financials and Valuation

American Tower's short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029.

The company's growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years' surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth.

American Tower's valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company's valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently ""underinvested"" due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally.

The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company's substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth.

Technicals and Recent Performance

AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company's fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock's all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year.

Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business.

Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company's recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM's growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story.

Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption

Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI's most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized ""in-house"" productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM's expertise, especially given the company's ""hands-on"" approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years.

IBM's strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company's hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM's latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon's (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth.

IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company's offerings fit well into IBM's strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path.

Financials and Valuation

IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM's operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM's operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company's further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters.

IBM's latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM's debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed's easing cycle.

In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM's business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come.

Technicals and Recent Performance

IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently ""testing"" the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200.

Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company's mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic.

The company's mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company's biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix's video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces.

Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push

For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses.

Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify's customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify's U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts.

Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify's diversification push. These new products could broaden the company's demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company's bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run.

Financials and Valuation

Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers' fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company's increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify's total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a ""cash cow"" would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates.

When it comes to evaluating Spotify's financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company's costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify's optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price.

Spotify's revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022.

Thanks to the past couple of years' positive developments, the company's financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify's valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks.

Technicals and Recent Performance

SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company's cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company's business continues to mature, the stock's sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla's picks while having the most upside potential as well.

Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company's strategic focus since well before going public in 2019.

Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company's platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors.

The company navigated the past couple of years' bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market's weakness for ""bolt-on"" acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space.

Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients

Tradewed defines itself as an ""operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,"" which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb's average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb's, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company's growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients.

For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company's addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential.

The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal.

Financials and Valuation

Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb's profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company's revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more.

Tradeweb's rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions.

Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company's financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company's growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years.

Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock's valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Tradeweb's great execution is reflected in its shares' performance and the company's valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical ""support"" below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock.

Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the

U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber's core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company's ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the ""new economy"" over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the ""unicorn"" status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company.

Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber's revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion.

The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the ""big guns"" of the tech sector. Although Uber's markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed's easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant.

Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength

Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company's strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it's hard to question its strategic vision.

Uber One, the company's membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company's great execution.

Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber's platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver.

According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber's ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won't impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s.

Financials and Valuation

In its early years, profitability was Uber's achilles heel, but since 2018, the company's revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company's ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth.

Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics.

Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company's strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER's strong performance over the past couple of years.

Although the company's debt load is still substantial, Uber's swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company's bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock's market value, with the company's surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER's relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point.

Conclusion

Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the ""boring"" truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s.

Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August's historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index's (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days.

Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it's important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed's painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher.

That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed's tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this ""rotation"" could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level.

This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla's hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential.

Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections.

With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!"
Consumers Fall Into Four Segments Based On Their Affinity For Environmental Sustainability,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2024/10/07/consumers-fall-into-four-segments-based-on-their-affinity-for-environmental-sustainability/,2024-10-07T13:24:58Z,"A year ago, we predicted that the number of green consumers would stay constant in 2024, despite climate chaos and backlash. Despite evidence of accelerated weather-related disasters and a desire among many consumers to act sustainably, we predicted that inflation and the cost of living would heavily influence buying decisions.

New Forrester data bears this out, showing that the share of ""Active Green"" consumers -- those who pay close attention to companies' impact on the environment and overwhelmingly choose eco-friendly items over low-cost or convenient ones -- has held close to steady (it's down 1-2 percentage points in the markets we surveyed).

Though Active Greens are a relatively small segment -- fewer than one in five consumers fall into this category -- our advice to companies is to recognize the cognitive dissonance that many feel when making purchases. Now is the time to innovate to deliver more environmental value for the same price, particularly as environmentally conscious younger consumers gain buying power.

The reality, however, is that there is no single green or sustainable consumer. Values and attitudes vary greatly within the same age group or across different countries. It is critical to base your strategy on nuanced facts and to segment your customer base into distinct groups. We have mapped online adults in Australia, the US, and the Europe-5 markets to four segments that display various levels of affinity for environmental sustainability. Forrester grouped consumers into four segments according to their answers to three questions:

The result? Consumers are evolving into four distinct groups as they realize that their consumption habits affect both the environment and their daily lives:"
Forecasters Predict Tepid Holiday Sales Growth as Consumers Lean In to Austerity,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2024/10/07/forecasters-predict-tepid-holiday-sales-growth-as-consumers-lean-in-to-austerity/,2024-10-07T13:05:56Z,"Consumer sentiment has ticked up, but forecasts for Q4 retail sales see only modest growth as shoppers trim their budgets.

The retail industry begins its annual fourth-quarter dash to the end of its fiscal year (Jan. 30), with the majority of consumers planning to spend the same or less on gifts compared to last year. Overall, industry forecasters predict decelerating sales growth this year, despite a recent rebound in the widely-followed University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment.

Regardless of whether the economy achieves a soft landing or avoids a recession, consumers are still adjusting to the stubbornly high costs of major living expenses, such as housing, cars, and insurance. Across several recent consumer surveys, a common theme emerges -- consumer confidence in the future is rising, but so are credit card debt and financial stress.

In a survey of 1,300 shoppers across the US, Canada, and the UK, 9 out of 10 (a full 90%) said they expect to spend 50% less on holiday gifts this year compared to 2023, according to project44, a logistics technology vendor.

A recent survey by Bankrate, a financial services platform, found that 33% of holiday shoppers plan to spend less this year, and another 43% plan to spend about the same. Consumers are embracing frugality, says Bankrate senior analyst Ted Rossman, because ""multiple years of high inflation and high interest rates have taken a considerable toll.""

The Bankrate survey also found that older generations ""are more likely to feel stretched thin during the holiday season."" A third of Gen X holiday shoppers said gift shopping will strain their budgets, while only one in five Gen Z respondents said the same.

Accounting network PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) reported similar results. Nearly 30% of respondents in its survey expect to spend less this season than last, marking a new high. A quarter of respondents said they will spend more, which -- except for pandemic-era 2020 -- was the lowest PwC has ever recorded.

The National Retail Federation, which has a strong track record for forecasting industry revenue, is projecting full-year fiscal 2025 sales growth of between 2.5% and 3.5%, down from fiscal 2024's final tally of 3.8%. While this might seem like a small number, it's based on a very large industry base.

Beneath the top line, there will be the usual suspects that outperform and those that lose ground or disappear. Walmart is projecting sales growth of up to 4.75% for the current year, and Amazon.com's e-commerce sales are expected to grow by more than 10%.

At the bottom of the list, companies that are perennially struggling include department store brands like Macy's and Neiman Marcus, apparel chains like Express Inc., and big-box hardware stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, along with some surprises like Nike.

One can only wonder how consumers feel about each of these companies' product offerings and why they are winning or losing."
Council Post: The Hidden Impact Of Fees On Inflation -- And What It Means For Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/10/07/the-hidden-impact-of-fees-on-inflation-and-what-it-means-for-businesses/,2024-10-07T13:01:45Z,"Inflation is a complex phenomenon influenced by many factors, from global supply chain disruptions to labor shortages. However, another often overlooked contributor is subtly driving prices higher across various sectors: fees.

These fees can take many forms -- service fees, convenience fees, processing fees -- and while they may seem insignificant in isolation, their cumulative effect can be profound, especially when considered across an entire industry or economy.

Take the facilities management industry, for example, where I operate daily. We see how hidden fees accumulate and significantly increase operational costs. From contract management fees to technology charges, these can sneak into agreements and strain company budgets.

Such fees are often passed down the supply chain, ultimately affecting pricing strategies and inflating costs for consumers. In retail, we've seen similar impacts, where incremental fees are contributing to the rising cost of goods and services.

The Proliferation Of Fees In Modern Business

In recent years, fees have become ubiquitous, tacked onto everything from airline tickets to hotel stays and banking services to utility bills and healthcare services. Companies often justify these fees as necessary to cover the costs of new technology, comply with regulations or provide additional services. However, many of these fees are more about padding the bottom line than covering actual costs.

An example is the rise of swipe fees in the retail sector. When consumers use a credit or debit card to make a purchase, banks and card networks like Visa and Mastercard charge retailers a ""swipe fee"" to process the transaction. The implementation of these fees, which average just over 2% of the transaction, has skyrocketed over the past two decades: Total swipe fees in the U.S. have grown from about $20 billion in 2001 to $172 billion in 2023.

The Ripple Effect On Prices

When companies pass on fees to consumers, the immediate impact is an increase in the price of goods and services. But the ripple effect goes beyond retail consumers.

It also affects the B2B environment, where businesses are not immune to the growing prevalence of hidden fees. As organizations encounter higher costs due to fees in areas like payment processing, shipping and vendor contracts, these costs are often passed along to other businesses in the supply chain, eventually reaching consumers.

In retail and B2B settings, these incremental fees can create a cycle of rising costs. In B2B transactions, where pricing can be complex, fees further complicate the financial landscape, squeezing margins and straining budgets. Whether a company is a direct consumer-facing business or a B2B provider, these rising operational costs can drive inflationary pressures that affect everyone down the line. Ultimately, even cautious and well-informed companies and consumers pay more as these fees accumulate.

Facilities Management: A Case Study In Hidden Fees

In facilities management (FM), fees are a pervasive issue. For example, backend fees -- such as per-work-order charges, implementation fees and support fees for data downloads and tailored reporting -- often add up across multiple service agreements.

At my company, we have encountered these costs frequently, and I think it's clear that a lack of transparency in such contracts can quickly inflate operational expenses. Many companies managing multi-location facilities have found themselves blindsided by unexpected charges that quietly accumulate into significant annual expenses.

Strategies For Transparency And Efficiency

Clients and consumers today are increasingly savvy, often scrutinizing the costs and fees associated with their services. Many seek value and transparency and quickly switch providers if they feel they're being overcharged.

However, when an entire industry collectively adopts practices that involve adding or increasing fees, the options for avoiding these costs become limited. This collective action can lead to widespread cost increases, impacting everyone, regardless of their choices.

Over the years, I have learned that businesses can combat these rising costs through a variety of strategies. Here are a few to consider:

1. Audit existing contracts regularly. Conduct regular audits of contracts to identify hidden fees. Many businesses miss recurring charges because they assume all fees are necessary. An audit helps reveal unnecessary or redundant fees that can be renegotiated or eliminated.

2. Establish clear upfront pricing. Ensure that pricing structures are clear and transparent from the outset, both internally and for clients. By listing all potential costs upfront, businesses can avoid unpleasant surprises later in the process. This practice helps build trust and reinforces long-term client relationships.

3. Consider automation to reduce labor costs. Automating repetitive processes, such as invoice management or payment processing, can reduce the labor costs associated with fee management. At my company, we've integrated platforms that streamline operations, thereby avoiding unnecessary tech and service fees.

4. Negotiate terms with vendors. If a vendor's service fees seem inflated or unnecessary, negotiate for more favorable terms. Explain the impact of hidden fees on your bottom line and leverage volume agreements to secure better terms.

A Broader Perspective

The issue of fees and their contribution to inflation reminds us that the costs we encounter as consumers and businesses are often more complex than they appear. While fees may be justified in some cases, their widespread and sometimes opaque application can have unintended consequences for the broader economy.

Given the above, and with rising costs across sectors, it is more important than ever for businesses to investigate alternative solutions and cost models that reduce or eliminate unnecessary fees. By understanding the role fees play in driving up prices, we can make more informed decisions by advocating for greater transparency, choosing service providers that prioritize efficiency or simply being more aware of the actual costs behind our prices.

In the end, I think controlling inflation isn't just about managing the big-ticket items; it's also about keeping an eye on the small fees that can have a significant impact.

Earnings Kickoff And World Conflicts Highlight The Week,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/07/earnings-kickoff-and-world-conflicts-highlight-the-week/,2024-10-07T12:47:57Z,"Oil Surge And Inflation Fears Threaten Economic Stability And Markets

A stronger than expected jobs report on Friday further eased fears of a slowing economy and allowed markets to stage impressive rallies to end the week. The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%. For the week; however, markets were little changed. That came despite a wide trading range overall. As we head into this week, the expected move in the S&P 500 is 86 points, which means we could see a total trading range even bigger than last week.

It's going to be a data heavy week with much of it being of the qualitative variety. Fed members will be speaking throughout the week but what I think will be most interesting is the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, due out Wednesday. These will be the minutes from the meeting at which the Fed decided to cut rates by half a point. With another Fed meeting not scheduled until November, I think a lot of investors are eager for a closer view into the last meeting and what members were thinking moving forward. I think this is especially true in the wake of Friday's jobs report and the response out of the bond market where we've seen yields on the 10-year note climb back above 4% for the first time since August. Then later in the week, on Thursday and Friday, we'll get the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports.

Also on Friday, we'll kick off earnings season. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are both scheduled to announce earnings and each bank offers a slightly nuanced view into the health of the economy. JP Morgan will likely discuss the health of consumers, spending habits and credit card debt. Wells Fargo often provides a look into the housing sector given their presence in the mortgage market.

As we prepare for a deluge of earnings over the next few weeks, it's worth noting the expectations for the quarter have fallen. At the end of June, estimates for third quarter earnings were a growth rate of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. However, those estimates have since fallen and now stand at 4.2%, according to FactSet. While it is common to see estimates revised downward, these revisions are slightly larger than the average drop of around 3.3%. It's also worth noting that the S&P 500 is currently trading at 21.4x its expected 12-month forward-looking earnings, which is above its historical 10-year average of 18x and 5-year average of 19.5x. In other words, much like we saw at the end of the second quarter, stocks are fundamentally valued at levels above their norm.

The revised earnings growth rates and fundamental valuations may also explain the tempered enthusiasm for company stock purchases by insiders. An article in today's Wall Street Journal says insider purchases by officers and directors were at their lowest level in a decade. While purchases upticked in August and September, they are still below their 10-year average.

In addition to the economic news and earnings, we also have a couple other externalities that could make their way into the market this week. Oil, which was up 1% on Friday and 8% for the week, is something I'll be watching as the world continues to await possible continued escalation between Israel and Iran. Also, back here at home, we are less than thirty days away from the election and I would not be surprised if we see market volatility hold its current level of even increase as the election nears.

A couple individual stocks worth watching today include Chevron and Pfizer. Chevron is selling off some Canadian assets as part of a plan intended to divest between $10 to $15 billion by 2028. That stock is higher by just over 1% in premarket. Shares of Pfizer are higher by nearly 3% in premarket after it was announced that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a $1 billion position in the company.

For today, I am keeping my eye on oil and any news out of the Middle East. I think markets are already bracing for the economic data and upcoming earnings, but the geopolitical situation is the wildcard I'm most focused on. No one is entirely sure what response to expect from Israel and I think that adds a bit of volatility that's more difficult to quantify. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
"Consumers Start Holiday Shopping Early, But High Prices On Essentials Drives Cutbacks",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2024/10/07/consumers-start-holiday-shopping-early-but-high-prices-on-essentials-drives-cutbacks/,2024-10-07T12:31:16Z,"It's not even Halloween yet, but consumers already have Christmas on the brain. They're concerned about how prices of essentials will affect their budgets. In a survey by ESW, 61% said they'll spend more than $600 this holiday season, compared to 48% last year. Of the people who are spending less, about 47% said the high price of food and fuel will lead them to reduce spending.

""Even though global inflation is coming down, many consumers are still feeling stretched due to high essentials costs,"" said Martim Avillez Oliveira, chief revenue officer of ESW, a leader in direct to consumer ecommerce.

According to the survey, 37% of consumers have started their shopping journeys. As expected, Amazon Prime Deal Days and Black Friday are expected to be the biggest deal days of the season, with Cyber Monday coming in third place.

""Black Friday is where consumers plan to spend more money, and focus on deals and value,"" said Oliveira. ""We think global uncertainty isn't healthy for the economy. We're seeing that consumers will spend more, even though price and value was top of mind.""

From an intent perspective, consumers will spend more this holiday season, said Oliveira. Online will continue to grow, which means there are additional opportunities for online retailers to capture market share.

AI is going to be everywhere from physical to digital channels, smoothing store efficiencies and curating online experiences for shoppers. ESW found that 43% of consumers will shop more online.

""Retailers will have to make sure they have different promotions and loyalty schemes,"" Oliveira said. ""It's critical to understand who your customer is. Free shipping is now table stakes. In addition to free shipping, free returns are popular. We'll see free returns and other promotional activity like gifts-with-purchase and product bundles that consumers will expect from their preferred brands.""

ESW unlocks the local DTC channel for retailers. ""If you're a brand and want to capture or trial your product to international audiences, ESW acts as a merchant of record,"" Oliveira said. ""The brand can shift any liabilities and compliance requirements to the merchant of record [ESW].

Shopping cuts across demographic lines. For example, 51% of all consumers said they won't use TikTok for shopping, however, when broken down by age, 65% of millennials and Gen Z combined said they'll use TikTok for inspiration.

What categories will be popular? According to Oliveira, beauty will resonate with consumers, and ""private label will be able to stand out this year and gain more market share just because of the sensitivity and how price-conscious shoppers will be this season.""

In addition to free shipping, Oliveira sees omnichannel as table stakes this holiday season. ""That's a seamless commerce experience,""he said. """"For retailers, finding their most cost-effective routes to get their goods to the consumer will be important. And making sure they plan their inventory and their pools of stock according to where the demand lives, both domesticaally and internationally. From our perspective localizing inventory, making sure you have, for example, the right product, the right sizes and the right promotions, will be key."""
How EPC Firms Are Helping The Energy Sector Do 'More With Less',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/07/how-epc-firms-are-helping-the-energy-sector-do-more-with-less/,2024-10-07T11:40:21Z,"As the energy industry embraces increasing calls for more efficiency, decarbonization and adoption of environmentally friendly business practices, they are increasingly turning to their engineering, procurement, and construction or EPC partners to replicate that in the built environment.

With large scale energy, oil and gas projects being a critical part of their business, EPC companies also appear to be embracing the challenge effectively turning into ""EPCM"" outfits, with the ""M"" incorporating management services as part of their broader client offering.

EPCM contracts now routinely involve sustainability targets, circularity or circular economy tenets and environmentally friendly practices in the construction and procurement value chain, according to research conducted by EY, based on its study 30 leading firms in the segment.

Furthermore, EY also notes that new global regulatory requirements will likely compel EPCM companies to disclose information about their own greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks in tandem with the sponsors of the projects they happen to be working on.

Nobody in the industry has any illusions about the scale of such a challenge. That too in an operating climate that until very recently saw EPCM companies clobbered by high inflation and interest rates whilst facing the constant age-old clamor for on time and on budget energy project delivery.

To manage the turbulence, many turned to technology and digital tools to the point that what once a subtle shift has now become routine.

Artificial intelligence, the industrial internet of things, robotics, construction data analytics, 3D and 4D printing, drones, virtual reality and augmented reality are all playing a vital role in enabling the EPCM segment become more efficient and sustainable across the life-cycle of the project, according to Chris Ashton, CEO of Worley, one of the largest companies operating in the segment.

""These digital tools are disrupting ways of working as they are deployed, leading to a reduction in time on repetitive tasks. And we see the development of digital platforms, the digital accelerant, as critical enablers to create trust amongst stakeholders and drive faster, more efficient project processes to move forward at speed,"" Ashton said.

He also appeared unfazed by the fact that some investments in emerging technologies carries the near-term risk of failure.

""We're regularly investing and are open to fail fast as we learn and pivot if roadblocks appear; leveraging advancements in information technologies; tapping into our global expertise, using standardized tools and processes to reduce costs and increase capital efficiency; and truly working in partnership with our customers to deeply understand their strategic plans for the future.""

According to EY, despite economic head winds, capital flows in construction technology or ConTech came in at just under $5.7 billion in 2022. Further growth is expected when latest data is available early in 2025.

An evolving built environment within the energy sector inevitably requires construction equipment partners to also respond in kind and they are, said Gavin Kerr, Director Global of Services at Mammoet, the world's largest engineered heavy lifting and transport company.

""We own and operate most of the world's largest cranes, and large jacking systems and transporters that are specialized to lift the heaviest loads built by humanity. Recognizing the growing need for efficiency and sustainability in EPCM segment, we recently launched the world's strongest land-based crane - the SK6000.""

It has a maximum capacity of 6,000 tons and can lift components of up to 3,000 tons, roughly the weight of six Airbus A380 super-jumbo aircraft, to a height of 220 meters.

""Such a capacity allows for critical components to be simultaneously built offsite anywhere in the world, before being transported to the actual project site ahead of installation. This potentially allows our EPC customers to build efficiently in larger pieces and shrink their project logistics, integration and mobilization phases in the construction cycle,"" Kerr added.

Ultimately, it is all about helping project developers reach first power generation or first hydrocarbon production sooner.

The evolving climate has resulted in EPCM companies and equipment makers becoming co-drivers of industry change for their project partners. Nowhere is it more visible than at industry trade shows and exhibitions in general, and ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi in particular. Regularly billed as the world's largest energy event of its kind, it attracts nearly 200,000 attendees every year.

Among its over 2,000 exhibitors will be 30 of world's largest EPCM companies and energy construction equipment makers of all shapes and sizes jostling for attention at a 155,000 square foot facility.

How EPCM corporate exhibits, displays and business pitches to world have evolved over the year offer ample proof of ""changing times"" according to Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, an organizer of over 30 global energy events in a typical calendar year including ADIPEC.

""When we look at ADIPEC and go back as recently as ten years ago, it was primarily an oilfield services show. But since then, it has gradually transformed into a broader energy show with many, dare I say most, participants making their displays more cognizant of need to address the energy sector's efficiency and sustainability challenge,"" Hudson said.

""It feels different for us as platform creators. Even as recently as 10 years ago, you'd see very traditional exhibition booths of 100 sq meters with a drill bit here, a lifting equipment display and generator model there. Now it's far more technology driven with often two to three level stands, pods and meeting rooms.

And not only that, the EPCM exhibition boot of today also highlight specific technology and efficiency gains that can be achieved from energy project conception to completion - to produce on one level and generate at another level and how you split within that supply chain at, Hudson added.

""There is a clear reason for this. The major energy companies need to invest heavily in sustainability and decarbonization remains a key ADIPEC theme - something that 12 leading energy CEOs committed to in Abu Dhabi in 2023. The EPCM segment is key if this is to be achieved, and we see firms operating in the sphere adapting to opportunities presented by an evolving climate, something that's reflected in their displays and exhibits.""

Doing 'more with less' - or in other words achieving improved throughput / energy generation, doing so sustainably and whist using less energy - has become imperative for the industry. Therefore, ditching the old way of doing things is both mission critical and commercially logically for the EPCM segment and research strongly points to it, says Worley's CEO Ashton.

""Our thought leadership work with Princeton University Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment shows us that executing projects the same way we always have will not get us to net zero by 2050. In fact, we won't even get halfway. So we must change, and are changing, how we traditionally deliver projects.""

Ashton added that energy project sponsors are balancing strategic investments supporting their move to a lower carbon future and at the same time managing shareholder, investor, and society's environmental and sustainability expectations with the complex capital management, regulatory and jurisdictional frameworks within which they operate.

""Over the past five years, we've seen our customers shift to partner with Worley, to share their strategic plans and work together to drive down costs while delivering projects in new and innovative ways. And by working in partnership with our customers on their vast portfolios of projects, we're delivering real, life-time value across their assets.""

This will in all probability accelerate in a fiercely competitive post-pandemic EPCM market."
"Mortgage Rates Today: October 7, 2024 -- Rates Move Up",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-07-24/,2024-10-07T11:32:12Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.82%, according to Curinos. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.96%, while the average rate on a 30-year jumbo mortgage is 6.87%.

Today, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage is 6.82%, compared to last week when it was 6.67%.

The annual percentage rate (APR) on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.84%. The APR was 6.67% last week. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

With today's interest rate of 6.82%, a 30-year fixed mortgage of $100,000 costs approximately $653 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. Borrowers will pay about $135,077 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 5.96%, higher than it was at this time yesterday. Last week, it was 5.69%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.99%. It was 5.72% this time last week.

At today's interest rate of 5.96%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $842 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $51,515 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.87% -- 0.12 percentage point up from last week. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate had a 52-week APR low of 5.50% and a 52-week high of 10.50%.

A 30-year jumbo mortgage at today's fixed interest rate of 6.87% will cost you $657 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,924.

The first step on your homebuying journey should be to calculate affordability. You'll want to find out how much you can afford based on things like income, debt and savings.

Here are a few important factors that go into home affordability:

The annual percentage rate (APR) represents a loan's interest rate and fees, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. It's essentially the all-in cost of the loan.

The APR is a helpful number because it shows you the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it the entire term.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term.

Conventional home loans are issued by private lenders and typically require good or excellent credit and a minimum 20% down payment to get the best rates. Some lenders offer first-time home buyer loans and grants with relaxed down payment requirements as low as 3%.

For buyers with limited credit or finances, a government-backed loan is usually the better option as the minimum loan requirements are easier to satisfy.

For example, FHA loans can require 3.5% down with a minimum credit score of 580 or at least 10% down with a credit score between 500 and 579. However, upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums can apply for the life of the loan.

Buyers in eligible rural areas with a moderate income or lower may also consider USDA loans. This program doesn't require a down payment, but you pay an upfront and annual guarantee fee for the life of the loan.

If you come from a qualifying military background, VA loans can be your best option. First, you don't need to make a down payment in most situations. Second, borrowers pay a one-time funding fee but don't pay an annual fee as the FHA and USDA loan programs require."

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are notorious for paying puny interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts generally pay considerably higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

If you're shopping around for a traditional savings account, high-yield savings account or MMA, you'll want to remember a few key points.

A great interest rate is important, but it's not the only factor that matters when picking an account to hold your savings. Another major consideration is whether the account has a minimum deposit -- and whether you can come up with the cash.

You'll also want to understand the fees. Savings accounts can come with monthly maintenance fees, excess transaction fees (if you ignore limits on withdrawals) and other pesky charges that can bite into your returns.

And before you open an account, look into a financial institution's reputation and safety. You should trust your bank or credit union and feel like you're in good hands. Read the reviews, see what account holders have to say about customer service and learn about how the financial institution responds to consumer questions.

Search for an account that's insured by the FDIC or, in the case of credit unions, the NCUA. Those federal agencies provide up to $250,000 in insurance per depositor and per bank for each account ownership category.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Beyond Meat Stock Has 24% YTD Decline, But Can Sentiment Change?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/beyond-meat-stock-has-24-ytd-decline-but-can-sentiment-change/,2024-10-07T11:07:25Z,"After almost a 24% decline this year, at the current price of around $6 per share, we believe Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ: BYND), a plant-based meat alternative - is fairly priced. BYND stock has dropped from around $8 to $6 year-to-date, largely underperforming the broader indices, with the S&P growing about 20% over the same period. The company has been facing challenging revenue and considerable cash burn for about three years now - thanks to the combination of inflation, pandemic-related shifts in demand, and rising competition. Although it would be premature to declare Beyond Meat's stock as irreparable, the company's current trajectory suggests a challenging outlook with no clear escape from its detrimental cycle.

In Q2 2024, the company's revenue of $93 million was down almost 9% year-over-year (y-o-y), driven by a 14% decrease in the volume of products sold. BYND also saw its revenues decline somewhat moderately in Q2 from an -18% y-o-y decline in Q1, but again this is largely a function of prior-year comps easing as well. BYND scaled back on promotional trade discounts in the recent Q2. Along with price increases on certain products in the U.S., this resulted in a 6.1% increase in its net revenue per pound compared to the year-ago period, which includes a ~21% increase in its U.S. retail channel (largest segment) net revenue per pound. Thanks to this, the revenue declines softened in Q2 and gross margins made a major recovery. However, there are still several headwinds that continue to pressure BYND stock in the future. In the U.S., the company's distribution has maxed out, while inventory levels remain high. Moreover, the company is dealing with low plant utilization and lower product volume. The company also has a substantial amount of debt in its capital structure, which may become a meaningful risk factor in the current high-interest rate environment. BYND has $1.14 billion in debt (due in 2027) on its balance sheet and a limited cash runway of $145 million (down from $194 million at year-end 2023). All said, BYND's most pressing issues still have not been addressed.

Notably, BYND stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were -48% in 2021, -81% in 2022, and -28% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BYND face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Beyond Meat's gross margin turned negative in 2023 and 2022 compared to its positive gross margins of 25% in 2021 and 30% in 2020. It should be noted that the company achieved a 4.9% gross margin in Q1 2024 and showed a substantial improvement to 14.7% in Q2 2024. Price increases have helped in this improvement along with lower cost of goods sold per pound and higher net revenue per pound. In addition, the company's adjusted Q2 EBITDA came in at a loss of $23 million compared to a loss of $41 million in the year-ago period. Beyond Meat was able to bring its operating cash flow losses down to -$47.8 million so far, roughly half of the year-ago loss, driven by the gross margin expansion and reduction in operating expenses from headcount efficiencies.

We forecast Beyond Meat's Revenues to be $326 million for the fiscal year 2024, down 5% y-o-y. We now forecast revenue per share to come in at $5.07. Given the changes to our revenues and RPS forecast, we have revised our Beyond Meat's Valuation to $6 per share, based on a $5.07 expected RPS and a 1.2x P/S multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price. Beyond Meat expects net revenues to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million in FY 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 7% to 1% compared to 2023. The company continues to anticipate operating expenses to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. Also, the company expects further gross margin progress across the balance of the year, reflecting the combined impact of more fully distributed pricing adjustments and continued moderation of promotional spending.

Lake rips Biden-Harris 'double whammy' policies affecting Arizonans : 'Driven us over the cliff',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lake-rips-biden-harris-double-whammy-policies-affecting-arizonans-driven-us-over-the-cliff,2024-10-07T10:21:22Z,"PHOENIX, Ariz. - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake told Fox News Digital that illegal immigration has disproportionately hammered residents of her state which she says has created a ""double whammy"" that will result in GOP wins in the state in November.

""I think most Americans think that they have driven us right over the edge, over the cliff,"" Lake told Fox News Digital about the policies of the Biden-Harris administration. ""And we're hoping that we can pull this back come November and that's what we plan to do. But our polling shows that the economy is really affecting everybody. The border is affecting everybody.""

Lake explained to Fox News Digital that the current administration's border policies have disproportionately hurt Arizona particularly when it comes to housing costs.

""It's basic supply and demand,"" Lake said. ""21 million people coming in, even if you take the estimate that Joe Biden and Kamala are giving, which is 10 million, they've got to live somewhere. They're living in homes and apartments and hotels and these are taking away housing opportunities for Americans and also jacking up the prices as well. Because right now, when you have a very limited supply of housing, which we do, we have not built enough homes and apartments in the past 20 years to keep up with the demand. So now all of a sudden, you add 21 million people, you've got a supply and demand issue. You got you don't have enough supply and you have a lot of demand.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

Lake continued, ""We know that these people that are pouring across our country illegally, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are bringing in hand-holding and saying, yes, please come in and we will supply you housing, federally subsidized housing, which means you and I are paying for it. And we will give you an ID card with thousands of dollars a month to pay for your food. They don't have living expenses like the American people do. The American people are barely getting by because living expenses have gone up so they can then afford to take these jobs making less than the going rate, which takes Americans salaries and hourly wages and depresses them or pushes them down. So it's a double whammy and it's really affecting Arizona particularly hard.""

On inflation, Lake pointed to data showing that Phoenix was at one point the hardest hit city in the country.

""I talk to more Arizonans than anybody in the whole country,"" Lake told Fox News Digital. ""I have a better relationship with the people of Arizona, I think, than anybody in the country and they're struggling. You know, it kills me to see families and people who are retiring or retirees, Arizona used to be an affordable state it's not so much anymore, who are telling me now, Kari, I've never had to go to a food bank in my life. As a matter of fact, I used to donate to food banks. Now I'm finding myself there every couple of weeks just to make ends meet. I can't even afford the basics. It breaks my heart because the people of this state are incredible, hard working people.""

FLASHBACK: ARIZONA DEM SENATE CANDIDATE CALLED TRUMP VOTERS 'DUMB': 'WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD'

""They don't deserve this and they don't want to be asking for a handout, but they're working as hard as they ever have. Some of them are doing two jobs and there's not enough hours in the day. They can't work any harder than they already are and they're still not making ends meet. So it's very distressing for the people and it's distressing for me because I really, truly love the people of the state.""

Lake, who is running for Senate against Dem. Rep. Ruben Gallego who she says is responsible for supporting the Harris-Biden immigration and inflation record, told Fox News Digital that she believes Republicans will have success in November as a result of those policies.

""Every main issue that we're facing as a country somehow seems to kind of come right through Arizona and this is why I feel so comfortable that we're going to win this because, well, first of all, we're registering voters left to right,"" Lake said.

""People are saying, yep, we're voting, we're going to become a Republican. People who've never been a Republican before are now registered Republicans...We're calling people who haven't voted in a number of elections, people who maybe skipped the last 4 or 5 elections. I guess they are called low propensity voters and we're asking, are you going to vote? And they're saying, 'Hell, yes, I'm going to vote. Absolutely, I'm going to vote. I'm struggling right now. This is the first election I voted in a number of elections.' But this one really matters. I think it's our last election. If we don't get this right as a free America."""
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
September CPI Will Impact Fed Policy And Market Expectations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/06/september-cpi-will-impact-fed-policy-and-market-expectations/,2024-10-06T21:38:58Z,"The September U.S. Consumer Price Index tops this week's economic reports. With year-on-year total and core CPI inflation rates still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, traders and investors will be watching for signs that give the Fed license to cut rates on November 7. The potential that inflation rates are too high presents downside risks to equity markets and commodity prices because elevated inflation rates could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates next month.

This week's September CPI report will be critical for Fed interest rate policy expectations because labor market and inflation data are the Fed's main policy concerns. With the potential to shape Fed policies, which are front and center for financial markets, the CPI report has the potential to impact financial markets from equities and bonds to industrial commodities and the dollar.

Year-on-year total CPI inflation slowed in August to the lowest year-on-year pace since February 2021. Total CPI decelerated to 2.5% from 2.9%, although year-on-year core CPI was unchanged at a relatively high 3.2%. Both total and core year-on-year CPI rates are still elevated and above the Fed's 2% target.

Inflation has been easing slowly, but base effects threaten to keep year-on-year total CPI and core CPI above the Fed's 2% target until the first half of 2025. Nevertheless, year-on-year CPI inflation rates appear likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%.

As the Fed carefully weighs the importance of labor market and inflation data, this week's CPI report will be more critical for Fed policy expectations in the wake of last week's Employment Situation Report -- informally called the jobs report by economists and analysts. September payrolls and unemployment data were much stronger than expected with strong payroll gains of 254,000, upward revisions to payrolls of 72,000, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%.

Following the release of the strong September jobs report, the potential for a 0.5% Fed rate cut on November 7 fell to zero in the CME FedWatch Tool on October 6, while the potential for a 0.25% interest rate cut rose to 97.4% and the chance that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged rose to 2.6%.

Just one week prior, on September 27, the CME FedWatch Tool reflected the chance of a 0.5% Fed interest rate cut on November 7 at 53.3%. Meanwhile, the chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut was 46.7%, and the chance of no changes in interest rate policies was zero. The change in the CME FedWatch Tool expectations reflects just how important the strong September jobs report was for shifting Fed policy expectations.

The CME FedWatch Tool reflects that there is no urgency to cut interest rates due to the strength of the labor market. However, if inflation eases in September, the Fed will have more wiggle room to cut interest rates next month.

If the September CPI report does not show a further easing of year-on-year consumer inflation, expectations that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged on November 7 will likely rise. These dynamics would likely support the dollar but potentially hold mixed to negative implications for equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

However, if the September CPI report shows an easing of year-on-year inflationary pressures from August, the potential for a 0.5% rate cut would likely increase, weighing on the greenback but supporting equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

What do you expect for the September CPI inflation report?"

Q3 In Review: Family Office News Roundup 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/francoisbotha/2024/10/06/q3-in-review-family-office-news-roundup-2024/,2024-10-06T15:43:56Z,"As we move deeper into the latter half of 2024, family offices continue to navigate a complex web of economic, regulatory, and investment challenges. The third quarter of 2024 brought several developments that are reshaping the landscape for ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) and their family offices worldwide. From the intensifying competition between global financial hubs to the rising prominence of alternative investments, here's a roundup of some of the key family-office related items covered in in the news the last quarter based on 300 tracked articles from various news publications.

The race to attract family offices has reached a fever pitch, particularly in Asia. Singapore and Hong Kong, long-standing rivals in the financial sector, are doubling down on their efforts to woo UHNWIs and their family offices.

With central banks continuing to grapple with inflation, interest rate volatility has become a key concern for family offices. This shifting landscape is prompting a reevaluation of investment strategies, with a renewed focus on capital preservation and liquidity.

Many family offices are adjusting their portfolios, showing increased interest in fixed-income securities as rates rise. However, it's crucial to maintain a balanced approach. As one family office advisor put it, ""It's not about timing the market, but about time in the market."".

Diversification remains a cornerstone of family office strategies, but the definition of a ""diverse portfolio"" is evolving. Q3 saw a notable shift towards alternative investments and life insurance policies aimed at preserving wealth across generations.

This trend reflects a broader desire for uncorrelated returns and long-term value creation. However, it's important to note that these investments come with their own set of risks and complexities.

Private banks are increasingly positioning themselves as strategic partners for family offices, offering tailored services that cater to the complex needs of UHNWIs. From bespoke lending products to sophisticated investment advisory services, these institutions are stepping up their game to serve the family office sector.

As family offices expand their global footprint, navigating the complex web of international tax and regulatory requirements has become more critical than ever. This past quarter's news cycle highlighted several developments in tax laws that impact family offices, particularly in regions like Asia and the Middle East.

Q3 2024 has been an eventful quarter for family offices, marked by global shifts in wealth management strategies, regulatory changes, and evolving investment landscapes. As family offices continue to navigate these complexities, it will be interesting to see how they approach growth opportunities while carefully balancing risks in an uncertain economic environment. The ongoing competition for share-of-wealth between financial hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong, coupled with the increasing role of private banks, will likely continue to shape the family office landscape in the months to come."
Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/06/robust-job-gains-remove-recession-fears/,2024-10-06T11:06:04Z,"The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger.

Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000.

The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%.

Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January.

The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks.

Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy.

Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday's market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well.

Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies.

The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday's consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed's CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting.

Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively.

Friday's job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue."
How This Bitcoin Bull Market Cycle Stands Out,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/06/how-this-bitcoin-bull-market-cycle-stands-out/,2024-10-06T06:07:35Z,"As markets enter Q4 2024, investors keenly observe the current bitcoin market cycle, questioning whether it will reflect historical patterns. Typically, halving events every four years dictate these cycles, each marked by sharp supply cuts. However, today's demand and supply forces, regulatory changes, and external market shocks suggest this cycle could be different.

Historically, bitcoin bull market price surges were mostly fueled by a diminishing liquid supply, with coins increasingly held long-term or presumed lost. Bitcoin's circulating supply currently stands at approximately 19.7 million coins, with an estimated 5 million permanently out of circulation.

This leaves about 14.6 million BTC characterized as illiquid -- held in wallets with little to no selling intent. Over 73% of the total supply is now illiquid, reducing the coins available for active trading and hinting at tightening market liquidity similar to periods preceding historic bull runs.

This cycle differs as major holders like Grayscale sell off their bitcoin assets, reacting to competition from lower-fee ETFs.

Despite this increase in short-term liquid supply, the overarching trend sees entities like MicroStrategy and various new ETFs accumulating vast amounts of bitcoin, potentially triggering a supply crunch. The liquidity ratio of bitcoin has dropped below 0.25, signaling that most circulating coins are effectively being removed from the trading pool as institutional and long-term investors increase their holdings.

The wider economic environment, especially movements in the M2 money supply, has historically correlated with bitcoin's price cycles. Recent expansions in M2, following a contraction phase, are perceived by some analysts as potential catalysts for bitcoin's growth in the upcoming months.

Central banks' potentially moving towards more aggressive quantitative easing to mitigate economic slowdowns could enhance bitcoin's appeal as an inflation hedge, potentially accelerating its price appreciation. In addition, the U.S. dollar index's, also known as the DXY, remain a key focus; a large drop could further boost bitcoins growth.

Another factor making this cycle different is the rise in global adoption and interest from nation-states. Countries like El Salvador and regions with economic instability increasingly turn to bitcoin as legal tender or reserve asset. While still in its infancy, this adoption could lead to greater stability and credibility for bitcoin, shifting its market perception from a speculative asset to a legitimate store of value.

Together with geopolitical tensions and financial sanctions, bitcoin is becoming a hedge for inflation and sovereign risk, which may further accelerate its institutional and governmental accumulation. This macro transition towards bitcoin as a global, non-sovereign currency is a fascinating development that suggests a stronger, more resilient market dynamic, making this cycle stand apart from those before it.

Although some experts forecast Q2 2025 as the cycle's peak, the unique conditions of this cycle warrant a cautious outlook.

The continuous increase in illiquid supply supports long-term holding strategies, without a catalyst like increased institutional buying or favorable macroeconomic conditions, the duration of this accumulation phase remains uncertain. Regulation and potential changes in U.S. monetary policy could inject further volatility into the market.

Global liquidity has increased by $10 trillion since the beginning of the year, a development potent enough to purchase all of bitcoin ten times over. This influx in global liquidity has not immediately been reflected in bitcoin's price, which shows the typical lag as these vast sums trickle into various asset classes.

The FTX scandal ironically cut short the last bull run and prevented bitcoin from reaching $100,000. Now, FTX-related payouts could serve as a bullish catalyst for the next cycle, possibly driving bitcoin toward that $100,000 milestone.

For investors, the decision points involve weighing the slow momentum of the current market against the prospects of a more defined uptrend. With big players like Grayscale reducing their holdings and others like ETFs and MicroStrategy increasing their stakes, the timing and strategic positioning will be important.

The fundamental principles of bitcoin's deflationary model and growing institutional interest suggest that despite potential deviations from past patterns, the underlying strengths of bitcoin remain strong. Only time will reveal how this market cycle unfolds, but current indicators suggest a distinct and more pronounced bull run."
Mortgage Rates 5 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-05-10-24/,2024-10-05T19:31:10Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.45%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.47% and 4.20% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.59%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.15%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."

How to invest in gold

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Gold bars. Known as bullion, gold bars tend to be a popular choice for buying gold. Bullion is typically sold by gram or ounce. Purity, manufacturer and weight should be stamped on the face of the bar. Gold coins. The Sovereign and Britannia are popular collectables that command a premium over what you would get for the same amount of gold in the form of bullion. Gold jewellery. Like gold coins, you'll probably be paying extra for gold when you buy it in the form of jewellery - a premium that could be anywhere from 20% to 300%, depending on the manufacturer.

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

Gold shares. Buying the stocks of gold mining or processing companies is another way to invest in the yellow metal. You don't get to own physical gold, but you do get exposure to the rise and fall of the price of gold in the market. Gold funds. There are a range of funds that provide exposure to gold. They may invest in gold stocks, or they may trade gold derivatives in the options and futures markets.

Should you invest in gold?

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Is gold an inflation hedge?

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Is buying gold better than holding cash?

Inflation reduces the 'real' value of a currency over time. Or, put another way, £50 today buys you less than it did 10 years ago. However, gold can provide a way of protecting the 'real' value of your wealth against inflation.

During a period of high inflation, some investors may revert to buying gold as a real physical asset that holds its value.

Periods of high inflation often correspond with a rise in interest rates and general economic uncertainty. As a result, gold is seen to some as a safe haven and, in theory, increased demand results in a rise in price.

Over the last 20 years, annual inflation has averaged 3% in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. Over the same period, the price of gold has increased by an average of 9% per year (according to the World Gold Council). Whereas the average base rate (a proxy for the interest rate on savings) was 3% over this period, according to the Bank of England.

Adjusting for the inflation rate of 3%, the 'real' value of gold has therefore increased by an average of 6% per year. In comparison, savers would have experienced no 'real' increase in the value of cash held in savings accounts due to the impact of inflation.

That said, there is no guarantee that gold will perform the same way in the future as it has in the past.

Is it a good time to buy gold?

Gold potentially offer investors a safe haven in times of economic and geopolitical volatility. It may also provide a way of preserving wealth in a high inflation environment. As with shares, the price of gold is volatile. However it has delivered an increase in value over the last 30 years. Again, performance going forward is not guaranteed.

Investors should also consider the effect of foreign currency movements when deciding whether to buy gold. Gold is typically denominated in US dollars and, as a result, tends to have an inverse relationship with the US dollar. This means that, if the US dollar strengthens against other currencies, the price of gold can fall.

Looking over the last year, the price of gold in US dollars has decreased by 3% as the US dollar has strengthened against other currencies. However, the price of gold in sterling has increased by 10% due to the weakening of the pound against the dollar.

Overall, it is difficult to assess whether it's a good time to buy gold as its price is dependent on a number of factors. Although a continuation in the current level of economic and political uncertainty may provide a tailwind for gold prices, investors should also be aware of the volatility of this asset.

Does gold drop in value?

Gold is a limited commodity with a relatively static supply, meaning that the price of gold is highly sensitive to changes in demand. A fall in demand will therefore result in a drop in the value of gold.

By way of example, the price of gold fell by over 25% from 2011 to 2013. It also fell from over $2,000 per Troy ounce in mid-2020 to less than $1,700 in early 2021, a fall of 17%.

How is gold price determined?

The price of gold is determined by the level of supply and demand. The daily price is set by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and there are two different types of gold prices:

Fixed: LBMA members meet via conference call twice-daily to agree a price to clear their outstanding client orders. This is typically used for larger gold orders. Spot: this is a 'live' price largely used for buying and selling gold bullion.

Is it profitable to invest in digital gold?

Digital gold (or digigold) is a form of digital currency that allows you to buy fractions of physical gold stored by the seller. Buyers of digital gold will own, and have legal title to, the gold, with the seller acting as custodian.

Digital gold enables buyers to invest by value - say, £25 - rather than by weight (as with a 1 kilogram bar of bullion). Buyers can also invest a lower minimum amount than with the physical asset.

Digital gold also offers a saving in terms of storage and insurance. For example, the Royal Mint charges an annual management fee of 0.5% for its DigiGold products, compared to 1-2% for physical gold.

As buyers own the underlying physical gold, their profit (or loss) will be dependent on the price of gold, as covered in the questions above.

Which types of gold is it possible to invest in?

You can buy physical gold in the form of bullion, coins or jewellery, or invest in digital gold:

Bullion bars: these usually range in weight from one gram to over 10 kilograms. A premium is typically charged above the 'spot price' of the gold to cover manufacturing costs.The cheapest option currently sold by the Royal Mint is the one gram 999.99 fine gold Britannia bullion bar, retailing at £70 Coins: these are available in lower weights than bullion bars. The flagship gold coins in the UK are the Sovereign and Britannia. The Royal Mint is currently charging £122 for a 916.67 Fine Gold Quarter Sovereign 2022. Both coins are legal tender in the UK, and, as such, are free from capital gains tax and VAT for UK resident Jewellery: jewellery, especially antique pieces, is another option. However, you may pay a mark-up of at least 20%, and often far higher, relative to the content of the gold. This covers the labour cost of the design and manufacture and the retail margin Digital gold: this allows you to buy and hold fractions of the physical assets, with lower minimum investment amounts and savings on the storage and insurance costs.

Investors may also want to consider investing in an indirect form of gold, including:

Buying shares in companies that mine, refine and trade gold: However, while the prices of mining company shares correlate to gold prices, their share prices are also impacted by other factors Buying gold and commodity funds: specialist commodities, mining and exchange-traded funds can provide investors with exposure to gold, without the difficulties of trading and storing it in physical form.

"Boone, NC church becomes Helene recovery hub, one of dozens across Southeast: 'God will carry us through this'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/boone-nc-church-becomes-helene-recovery-hub-one-dozens-across-southeast-,2024-10-05T18:45:34Z,"Judge Phil Ginn speaks about how the Perkinsville Church in western North Carolina is helping Hurricane Helene survivors.

A former North Carolina judge whose church is supporting relief efforts for those affected by Hurricane Helene told Fox News Digital there ""is a resounding faith"" among residents that ""God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this.""

Judge Phil Ginn, a resident of Boone, said the Perkinsville Church in the western North Carolina town is one of several in the region stepping up in the wake of the devastating storm, which has so far left more than 230 dead and caused billions in property damage.

""We're housing people in our church. We've given up all of our Sunday school space to literally house people who are coming to work,"" said Ginn, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. ""And so our church had just seen fit to not only help our neighbors, but to help those who are coming here to help our neighbors by feeding them. We've got a shower trailer set up and washer and dryer to keep their clothes clean.""

Ginn described the storm as a ""generational event"" and said the recovery effort is going to be a ""marathon that's going to last for years."" However, he added that ""it's amazing to me to see God has come to us during the storm.""

SAMARITAN'S PURSE CONTINUES HELENE RELIEF EFFORTS WITH THREE WATER FILTRATION SYSTEMS IN NORTH CAROLINA

""There is a resounding faith among folks that I'm talking to out there that God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this. And so we have that faith to lean into,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital. ""And it is stronger now than it ever was. The bond between us as human beings, as brothers and sisters, has really increased.""

The help seems to be coming more from local people than the federal government, Ginn said.

President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump have each made multiple trips to affected areas, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has committed $110 million in federal aid to Helene victims, the White House said Saturday.

Ginn said people are coming together to help each other regardless of their circumstances or backgrounds.

""Nobody's asking what your politics are. Nobody's asking what your faith is. Nobody's asking if you just got out of prison. There's nothing of that,"" he said. ""It's just if you need help, you're getting it from local people.""

GEORGIA MAN SHARES STORY OF SURVIVAL IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE: 'INCREASED MY FAITH IN GOD'

Ginn's seminary, working alongside Samaritan's Purse and the North Carolina Baptist Men's Association, has established the SES Benevolence Fund for Hurricane Helene Relief, which is helping provide food, water, hygiene items, first aid kits and other essentials to those in need across four southeastern states.

""The great problem that we have right now is that virtually all of the damage was caused by water or mud, and none of that is covered by insurance. And so we've got families who were barely edging by with inflation and everything else, and now they've lost everything,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital.

""They've lost all their personal possessions. They can't live in their home. Their property is gone ... so it's going to be a mental health issue, and it's going to be an economic issue as well.

""It will never return to what it was,"" Ginn added. ""We have not only buildings gone and towns gone, but the land on which these buildings are set ... that's gone too. Rivers have changed courses.

Tax Breaks: The There's No Crying In Baseball Edition,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/10/05/tax-breaks-the-theres-no-crying-in-baseball-edition/,2024-10-05T14:08:01Z,"This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter.

My grandfather worked his entire life. By the time he reached what we would consider ""retirement age,"" he was still working. Farming and other manual labor had taken their toll on his body, so in his mid-70s, he would suit up in his uniform as a security guard and work nights at the local hospital. He was gone a lot. But on those hot, sticky summer afternoons in the south, when he had a free moment, he and I would sit and watch baseball on the old TV in the family room (for the record, he was a Cubs fan). Those are some of the most special memories of my life, and I suspect they are why I love baseball to this day.

I'll bet you have a similar story. For many, especially those of us in the U.S., baseball is synonymous with childhood summers and evening games of catch.

Baseball has been on the minds of many folks this week -- and not just because of the World Series. Earlier this week, baseball great Pete Rose died at age 83. I noted (☆) that if you asked ten people what they think about Rose, you'd likely get ten different answers. Rose's resume dazzles on paper -- he still holds several baseball records, including the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890). He racked up multiple awards, including two Golden Gloves (1969 and 1970), Silver Slugger (1981), and World Series MVP (1975). But he had his vices and polarized the baseball community. He admitted to cheating on his taxes -- for which he did jail time -- and betting on baseball. The latter is why he died without seriously being considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Those hot, sticky summers? I spent them in my native state of North Carolina. The stories coming out of western North Carolina -- and neighboring states -- are heartbreaking. Recovery will be slow and expensive. If you can be generous and help, please do (here's how). Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply are good to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

The IRS acted quickly (☆) to announce relief for individuals and businesses affected by the storm, including the entire states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and parts of Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia. These taxpayers now have until May 1, 2025, to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments. That date is particularly noteworthy as it's after the traditional tax filing deadline of April 15, 2025. Additionally, some of the areas hit by Helene were already extended because of Hurricane Debby -- those due dates have also been pushed forward to May 1, 2025.

The recent damage to communities caused by natural disasters has renewed discussions about climate change. According to the United Nations, as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat, leading to climate change. As a result, the world is warming faster than ever in recorded history. As policymakers seek to curb greenhouse gas emissions through taxation, the star of the show has always been carbon dioxide, but methane emissions are a significant challenge that also require attention. So why is it essential to address methane emissions, and what policy tools are we seeing in this area? Tax Notes contributing editor Nana Ama Sarfo tackles this issue in the latest episode of the Tax Notes Talk (transcript available).

Another controversial topic in the tax world is also getting a new look -- whistleblowers. Earlier this year, the annual report to Congress issued by the IRS Whistleblower Office (WBO) suggested more taxpayers than ever (☆) are blowing the whistle on bad tax behavior. The IRS paid whistleblowers 121 awards totaling $88.8 million in 2023 -- those amounts correspond to information that resulted in tax collections of $338 million. That's a significant increase from the total whistleblower awards paid in 2022 when just $37.8 million were distributed.

The WBO has recently announced some significant awards (details on two can be found here). The WBO has also revised its part of the Internal Revenue Manual and provided guidance on when the WBO will ""disaggregate"" claims, i.e., make partial awards. This issue of partial awards has been a significant one. A classic example involves a criminal tax case that has been settled and all dollars collected, but there is an open civil tax matter. The WBO has historically waited for the civil matter to be resolved before paying. Whistleblowers, writes Dean Zerbe, have been in Mudville -- with no joy (a bonus baseball reference).

Much of coming forward with a whistleblower claim -- or defending an action based on such a claim -- relies on having great records. Many people face the dilemma of what to do with old tax returns and supporting paperwork, often wondering when it's safe to discard them. However, determining the right time can be tricky, especially for taxpayers with foreign assets. Those with overseas financial interests must pay particular attention for many reasons, including expanded statutes of limitation that permit an indefinite IRS audit timeline and problems in retrieving records from foreign institutions, which can often be more challenging.

Speaking of records, it's possible that a few could be broken in the coming weeks. I know the extended tax deadline is just days away, but the World Series postseason heats up this weekend. Let's hope your team wins (and hopefully, your team will also be the Phillies).

Most taxpayers opt for the standard deduction -- but not all taxpayers understand why that happens. For most taxpayers, it comes down to numbers.

If your total deductions on Schedule A exceed the standard deduction for your filing status, you can claim that amount instead -- these are your itemized deductions. Itemized deductions include, among other things, the home mortgage interest deduction, medical and dental expenses, taxes paid (including up to $10,000 of state and local income taxes), and charitable gifts. If the total of those deductions exceeds the standard deduction for your filing status, you will (in most cases) want to claim itemized deductions instead of the standard deduction. If the total of those deductions is less than the standard deduction for your filing status, you will want to claim the standard deduction.

If you're not sure whether you'll want to take the standard or the itemized deduction, and the math in your head makes it seem too close to call, run the numbers and see which is the most beneficial. If you're using tax software, that should be pretty simple, ditto if you're using a tax preparer.

As with almost everything tax-related, there are some exceptions. You cannot use the standard deduction if you file as married filing a separate return and your spouse itemizes deductions; you are a nonresident alien or a dual-status alien during the year; or you are filing a tax return for less than 12 months because of a change in your annual accounting method.

The 2017 tax reform changed the game for many taxpayers -- the much larger standard deduction, together with limits on mortgage and SALT deductions and the elimination of other deductions (like unreimbursed job expenses, including the home office deduction for employees), made itemizing deductions less appealing. The overwhelming majority of taxpayers now claim the standard deduction -- for 2021, nearly nine out of ten taxpayers (88.2%) claimed the standard deduction.

For the tax year 2024, the standard deduction is $14,600 for individuals and married couples filing separately, an increase of $750 from 2023. Married couples filing jointly can claim $29,200, a boost of $1,500 from 2023, while heads of household can claim $21,900, an increase of $1,100 from 2023.

You are entitled to a higher standard deduction if you are age 65 or older at the end of the year (for this purpose, you are considered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday). If you are blind on the last day of the year, you are also entitled to a higher standard deduction.

For 2024, the standard deduction amount for an individual who may be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer cannot exceed the greater of $1,300 or the sum of $450, and the individual's earned income (not to exceed the regular standard deduction amount).

I'm buying a house. I am married. How much can each of our parents, three in total, give us in gift money before taxes?

Each year, you can make gifts up to the federal gift tax exclusion amount to as many people as you like without any gift tax consequences. For 2024, that number is $18,000, up from $17,000 in 2023. That means that any person can gift you $18,000 without gift tax consequences -- or they could gift 10 people $18,000 without gift tax consequences.

(The annual exclusion for federal gift tax purposes is predicted to increase to $19,000 in 2025.)

So, doing the math from your question, your three parents can gift you and your spouse a total of $108,000 ($18,000 limit x 3 donors x 2 recipients).

Here's where it gets tricky. If a gift exceeds the $18,000 limit for 2024, most taxpayers don't automatically pay gift tax. Instead, the amount of the gift over the $18,000 limit ""chips away"" at your available federal estate tax exemption -- for 2024, that's $13,610,000 per person.

Let's assume your father gifted you $1,018,000 -- that amount is $1 million over the annual gift tax exclusion. Instead of paying gift tax on the $1 million, your father would file a gift tax return (Form 709) notifying the IRS that his exemption is reduced by $1 million. At death, he would only be able to pass $12,610,000 to his heirs, federal estate tax free (assuming he died in 2024-the federal estate tax exemption can vary from year to year due to inflation and, of course, any changes in the law).

The reality? Most taxpayers are not subject to the federal estate or gift tax.

The IRS has announced that the number of states offering Direct File will double for the 2025 tax filing season to 24. For the next filing season, Direct File will be available in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. That means 62% of Americans will live in states offering Direct File.

In addition to expanding the number of participating states, Direct File will now cover additional types of income, credits, and deductions. It's estimated that more than 30 million taxpayers will be eligible to use Direct File in the 2025 filing season.

With about a month left before the elections, the highly critiqued ""no tax on tips"" proposal promoted by both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is still a talking point. Tax experts appear to hate everything about these proposals -- Steve Rosenthal of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center spoke for many with his list of complaints. ""In tax policy, we evaluate proposed reforms by how well they promote equity, efficiency, and revenue,"" he wrote in a recent piece for Forbes. ""'No taxes on tips' fails all three tests by singling out certain taxpayers for relief but not others similarly situated; distorting compensation arrangements and labor markets; and losing substantial revenue, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in the first 10 years.""

And, one of the worst things about the proposals is how ineffective they would be at actually helping tipped workers. The Budget Lab at Yale University noted in a recent report that ""about 4% of families report tips to the IRS, and those who do are disproportionately young, unmarried, and lower-income. This means that many tipped workers do not pay income tax to begin with and would not benefit from a new deduction.""

A little history, writes Tax Notes' Joseph Thorndike, can illuminate today's rush to exempt tips from taxation. Here's more.

Of the eight teams remaining in the run-up to the World Series, how many will likely be subject to the Competitive Balance Tax (CBT) -- often referred to as the luxury tax?

The IRS has published Notice 2024-73, which provides additional guidance with respect to long-term, part-time employees, including guidance regarding application of section 403(b)(12) under section 403(b) plans.

The AICPA has submitted a letter to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) urging them to implement a policy to offer automatic filing extensions for Reporting of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) and Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reports to victims of major disasters.

Baker Tilly is expanding its advanced technology capabilities with the acquisition of Alirrium, a fast-growing leader in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) advisory and implementation services. Effective November 1, the move strengthens Baker Tilly's capabilities in RPA, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to better support businesses in modernizing their operations and improving their competitive edge.

Here's what readers clicked through most often last week:

While the official numbers are generally available at the end of the year, estimates suggest that the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and my own Philadelphia Phillies will be subject to the luxury tax for the 2024 season.

By rule, teams that exceed the payroll threshold are subject to the luxury tax -- for 2024, that number is $237 million. The tax is figured on each dollar that payrolls are above the threshold, and the tax rate increases based on the number of consecutive years a club has exceeded the threshold (for the first year, there's a 20% tax on all overages, for the second consecutive year, the tax is 30%, and for the third consecutive year or more, it's 50%).

Tops on the list for the season will likely be the New York Mets, who are paying more money to players no longer on their roster ($70.3 million) than the entire total the A's are paying for players on their team ($60.5 million).

5 Questions For The Fed's Austan Goolsbee -- Including: Did They Move Fast Enough On Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/05/5-questions-for-the-feds-austan-goolsbee-including-did-they-move-fast-enough-on-inflation/,2024-10-05T12:09:41Z,"It's an unusually tense time at the Federal Reserve as Democrats and Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- target the central bank as it starts cutting rates in its most significant monetary policy in decades. Forbes spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, an alternate member on the highly watched Federal Open Market Committee and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama, about how ""super serious"" central bankers feel about becoming a political football ahead of the election, how the Fed is adjusting to easing inflation and growing recession angst, and what he'd change about the ""behind the curve"" policy leading to the worst inflation crisis in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Forbes: Have there been any discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings about pressure from both sides of the political aisle to act in a certain way heading into the election? Context: The FOMC is the U.S. central bank panel that votes on the target federal funds rate, which heavily influences interest rates on loans across the country, impacting inflation, economic growth and unemployment. The Fed is under heightened scrutiny after rolling out the first interest rate cuts since early 2020 last month. The reaction function refers to how a central bank responds to one event, like lowering rates when inflation rises.

When you become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the election business. Everybody takes that super seriously. The things that determine our decisions are: What are the economic conditions and what are the forecasts. What would we need to see to stop raising? What would we need to see to hold? What do we need to see for stuff to come down? We've been laying out the criteria, and now we're just seeing come to pass the stuff that we've been forecasting, and so the reaction function is pretty well established.

Forbes: What are the data points in the labor market that you are paying the closest attention to meeting to meeting? Context: We interviewed Goolsbee two days before the September jobs report surprisingly revealed the strongest job growth since March, decelerating bets on continued aggression from the Fed on lowering rates and throwing another wrench into the central bank shift as borrowing costs look less likely to tumble.

Goolsbee: The unemployment rate, but everybody knows that. A little bit less, the payroll, job employment numbers. There was a time when, if you had asked me ""what's the single most important number?"" I probably would have said that, but not now, with the uncertainty about immigration and the uncertainty about these [revisions to jobs data].

This has been such a strange, unprecedented moment of new firm creation and self employment and different work arrangements. I think that's why we're having such major revisions on these [data points]. All of those things make me put a little bit less weight [on monthly nonfarm payrolls] since there's more of a question mark around [them]. All the measures that we tend to look at as economists to track the labor market - the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed, the employment-to-population ratio of prime age workforce, the quit rate, hiring rate, all of those things, plus the the new unemployment claims - I feel like they're all kind of saying the same thing.

The rate of change is all in the direction of cooling. And if you look in the past, it's quite rare that you see cooling labor markets that just settle into full employment. Usually, when things start to go bad, they keep getting worse. And so that's our challenge now: After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?

Forbes: Let's imagine we have that crystal ball and we're able to look forward to the end of next year. We officially stick the landing, core PCE runs right in that sweet spot of about 2%, and the federal funds rate falls to right around the median forecast around 3%. What risks for the second half of the decade are you most worried about? Context: Core PCE is the Fed's favored inflation metric as it tracks how much Americans spend monthly on goods and services outside of more volatile food and energy categories. Projections shared at the FOMC's latest meeting indicate officials have a median forecast of 3.4% at the end of 2025.

Goolsbee: It's productivity growth.

For productivity growth, the [data] matters the most over the long run, and in the short run, it's one of the most noisy [data points] there is. So that's why it's kind of hard to take that into account in the meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions. We saw wild swings in that over Covid...but in the last year-and-a-half, that growth rate of productivity has been averaging well higher than the trend before Covid.

Is that a sign that technology has changed, or is it AI? Is it something else? Is it hybrid work? Is it the business dynamism that we've had all these startups? Because if the productivity growth rate is going to be higher, even if not permanent [but] for the medium term, then the second half of the decade we're going to have a bunch of discussions like the second half of the 1990s, where there was an extended increase in the productivity growth rate. The implications for the economy are that you can grow faster and have more job growth without inflation in a world like that.

And income, wages are going to go up. Nobody needs to be nervous about wages going up at fast rates, because productivity growth will justify it. To me, that's an overwhelmingly important factor that we're going to have to think about in this second half.

Forbes: You're allowed to time travel back to mid-to-late 2021, right before inflation skyrocketed, and you can change one policy within relative reason. What do you choose? Context: After a decade of sub-3% inflation, prices began rising rapidly in 2021, and consumer price index inflation peaked in June 2022 at a 41-year high of 9.1%. The Fed didn't raise rates, the most common response to inflation, until March 2022, and raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to a two-decade high of over 5% in a 16-month span.

Goolsbee: I think looking back, if you had one thing to change, if you could know that the supply shocks were not going to be transitory in the three or four months sense, you would have started moving earlier.

You would not have been raising with this kind of rapidity that the Fed engaged in, 500 basis points in one year. That's about as fast as it's ever gone up. You would have started earlier but also realistically, I think it's worth considering how much lower you think inflation would be if they had done that. If you could have a crystal ball and have perfect timing and recognize it's not going to be a temporary supply shock lasting three months, it's going to be a temporary supply shock lasting two years, how much less would inflation be?

There were a lot of countries that tried both monetary and fiscal policy a lot of different ways, and, for the most part, they basically had the same inflation experience. It is instructive that there are limits to what the Fed could have done. But if I had one thing to do over - I wasn't on the FOMC at that time - but looking back, they were behind the curve, slow to move.

Forbes: I know you're a big fan of ""The Simpsons"" - what do you think Mr. Burns would want the FOMC to do now? What's the conversation like at Moe's tavern when CNBC comes on after the last FOMC meeting? Context: Goolsbee often references ""The Simpsons,"" the animated comedy which features curmudgeonly nuclear power tycoon Mr. Charles Burns and the pub ""Moe's Tavern,"" where Homer Simpson and his more working class drinking buddies congregate.

Goolsbee: Mr. Burns has, in various episodes, lots of cash, lots of equity and/or lots of bonds. So does he want high rates or low rates? I would like to think Mr. Burns, just out of his own pure self-interest, wants whatever is good for the economy. Financial stability seems like it is the order of the day for him. At Moe's Tavern, there's one of the episodes where they're showing old presidential debates, and Kennedy's like, 'I'd like to express my fondness for Duff beer,' and Richard Nixon's like, 'I would also like to express my fondness for that particular beer,' and it cuts Moe's Tavern. And they're like, 'That guy never drank a Duff in his life!' And I fear that Moe's Tavern, they would not be super enamored of the FOMC, but they should be. We're not the bad guys. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[Goolsbee revised his Burns response in an email: ""Burns is a notorious gold bug that's still complaining that the Coinage Act got rid of the ha'penny in 1857. He's had it out for the Fed since we tipped off authorities in season 9 that he was the one who stole the 1 Trillion dollar bill after WWII.""]"
Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."

But a lucky few -- the legendary 11 -- have had staying power, managing to earn a spot on The Forbes 400 every year since its 1982 inception.

In all, they are worth an estimated $342.3 billion today, up from $3.8 billion all the way back in 1982 when they first appeared on Forbes' ranking (equivalent to $12.2 billion in today's dollars), meaning they have grown their wealth by some 8,900%, more than double the 4,200% growth of the S&P 500. Their average age is 88.

When Forbes first published The Forbes 400, Warren Buffett was the 52-year-old chairman of a $1.5 billion (assets) Berkshire Hathaway. ""Lives modestly,"" we wrote. ""Estimated net worth: $250 million."" Four decades later, Berkshire's assets have surpassed $1 trillion and Buffett is the fifth-richest person in America, and the wealthiest ""billionaire streaker"" never to miss The Forbes 400. His $150 billion net worth is 187 times his 1982 stash, even after adjusting for inflation. (He'd be even richer but for the fact that he's also America's most generous philanthropist.)

Only 4 of the 11 are self-made. In addition to Buffett, two retail and fashion tycoons earned their way onto the lists thanks to their world-renowned brands: Nike's Phil Knight and Les Wexner, the disgraced L Brands founder behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. The fourth self-made icon is Donald Bren, the richest real estate developer in the nation, whose Irvine Co. owns 129 million square feet of real estate, mostly in Southern California.

The remaining seven all got started with substantial help from their families though all but one were able to turn millions into billions. Among them: the 17th-richest person in America Charles Koch; Leonard and Ron Lauder, sons of Estée Lauder; and media giant Donald Newhouse, whose family has investments in Conde Nast, Warner Bros. Discovery and social news site Reddit.

Four other members of the inaugural 1982 ranking made the list in 2024 but fell off at least once along the way. Star Wars billionaire George Lucas dropped off in 1983 due to a divorce settlement, but rejoined in 1996 during the planning stage of the franchise's prequel trilogy. Former president Donald Trump disappeared from the ranks amid his 1990s bankruptcies, and again in 2021 and 2023, but is back among the top 400 this year thanks, largely, to his Truth Social platform. Oil heir Sid Bass didn't make the cut in 2021, while FedEx founder Fred Smith spent a total of 6 years off the list.

Many of the original 1982 Forbes 400 listees have since died. That includes comedian Bob Hope (d. 2003), who only made the list once; mobster Meyer Lansky (d. 1983); Steve Jobs (d. 2011); and shipping tycoon Daniel Ludwig (d. 1992), the richest person in America in 1982, worth $2 billion ($6.4 billion in today's dollars). Others who made the original minimum net worth of $100 million (equivalent to $320 million today) -- including musician Yoko Ono and heir Timothy Mellon -- have either transferred their fortunes to heirs or were simply overtaken in worth by the likes of tech moguls, social media stars and crypto bulls."
"Texas residents express frustration with the economy, trust Trump more than Harris",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-residents-express-frustration-economy-trust-trump-more-than-harris,2024-10-05T09:05:44Z,"Residents in Houston, Texas revealed their preferred candidate to boost the economy in conversations with Fox News Digital.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

The Harris ticket was buoyed on Friday by a strong September jobs report. Also, striking U.S. dockworkers returned to work Friday after reaching a tentative agreement with employers on an improved wage offer."
"Three states show how abortion, schools and taxes are at stake in legislature races",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5124638/state-legislature-supermajority-kansas-arizona-minnesota-elections,2024-10-05T09:04:20Z,"Elections for state legislatures don't get the attention that races for president or Congress do but they often have a big impact on our lives. Congress is divided and gridlocked. In contrast, nearly all state legislatures have both chambers run by one party or another. That makes it easy to pass laws.

And they've been passing a lot. More than 20 states have imposed new limits on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion in 2022. In education, state lawmakers create voucher programs and determine public school funding. Gun laws, taxes, criminal sentences, access to Medicaid and food stamps are just a few other issues decided by state legislatures.

Redistricting and polarization have increased the political tilt of many legislatures -- even where the state might be more balanced overall.

This year, several legislatures could see power shift if just a few seats flip in the election -- maybe just a matter of hundreds of votes in some districts. Here are three states, Kansas, Minnesota and Arizona, that illustrate the stakes around the country.

TOPEKA, Kansas -- Kansas is one of several states where the Legislature sometimes tilts more conservative than the state's voters overall. While it votes Republican for president, it has elected a Democrat for governor twice in a row and voted with 59% to protect abortion rights.

But Republicans hold 29 of the 40 seats in the Senate and 85 of the 125 seats in the House. That gives them the two-thirds ""supermajority"" to pass bills and override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

They've overridden Kelly's vetoes 15 times in the last two years. They used the override to pass a bill requiring doctors to question patients seeking abortions about their reasons. They overrode vetoes to pass laws banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports and to limit access to food stamps.

Democrats say they can break the supermajority in this year's elections -- they'd only need to flip two or three seats in either chamber. It would give Kelly a stronger veto in her last two years in office -- and Democrats more leverage over what the majority passes.

""My hope is that with the governor being able to veto and being able to sustain those vetoes, it puts us more at the table for compromise,"" says Democrat Dinah Sykes, the Senate minority leader.

National Democratic party organizations say that goal is within reach. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is highlighting 10 legislative races in Kansas and helping with campaign logistics.

Kansas Republicans, meanwhile, have scorned that contribution as outside interference. And they defend the supermajority.

Republican House Majority Leader Chris Croft says it's a necessary counterbalance to the governor's veto pen.

""[The] supermajority in this case, while it sounds like it's this huge number, in fact, what it does is just gives us a seat at the table,"" Croft told NPR.

Even with their heavy majority, Republican's priorities aren't always veto-proof. Last session, Kelly successfully vetoed three major tax-cut proposals, including one that fell a single vote shy of an override. The fight forced the Legislature into a special session.

""You can't get everything you want in this business. This business has a little bit of give and take and that's the beauty of the process,"" Croft says. ""It's also the frustrating part.""

Supermajorities, like the one held by Kansas Republicans, have become common. Across the country as of their recent legislative sessions, one party or another held a veto-proof majority in 29 states. Republicans had 20 of those, Democrats nine.

Patrick Miller, a political scientist at Kent State University, says supermajorities have spread in part because of polarization and legislators gerrymandering their own districts.

""One of those consequences of supermajority, is a lot more ideological politics and policy,"" he says.

While the U.S. Congress is often locked in stalemate, Miller says state legislatures that are dominated by one party are able to step into the vacuum to pass laws shaping day-to-day life.

""If you care about education, if you care about health care regulation in your state, if you care about abortion, transgender rights, LGBT rights, if you care about whether your roads have potholes ... you need to be looking at your state legislature,"" he says.

TONKA BAY, Minn. -- On a sunny Tuesday morning, Republican state Senate candidate Kathleen Fowke walks door-to-door near Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis. The tree-lined roads by the water are quiet but when she knocks on a door she's reminded that this is hotly contested territory.

""You're in my YouTube all the time,"" says the man inside -- a reminder of the ads targeting voters here.

The contest to win this legislative district could be the state's most expensive ever -- and key to winning the Senate.

For two years, Democrats have controlled the Legislature and the governor's office under Gov. Tim Walz -- now the Democratic nominee for vice president. They've passed more spending for affordable housing and public schools, and guaranteed protections for patients who seek or provide abortion or gender-affirming care.

Now Republicans see a chance to curb the progressive trend. They're just a few seats behind in the state House. The Senate is tied 33-33 and this vacant seat by the lake could be the tiebreaker that ends the Democrats' so-called ""trifecta"" of House, Senate and governorship.

The GOP wants to slow state spending and focus on the economy overall. Fowke, a real estate agent, says that, while voters don't always know about the work the Legislature does, what she does hear about from them is money.

""It's basically affordability, and they can't afford, you know, just to go to the grocery store anymore,"" Fowke says. ""Taxes are high. Inflation is high. They need to find a way to help lower the costs of everything all around them.""

Republicans promise to cut taxes, tighten up on spending and curb fraud and abuse in state programs. ""With one-party, Democrat control, it was easy just to push through partisan policy and partisan priorities,"" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth says.

Democrats say they address people's cost of living with laws requiring companies to offer paid time off for illness, family leave and safe time and new money for free school lunches.

""They trust the Democrats are going to do more for their economic well being, whereas what they hear from Republicans is, 'Oh, we have to give more tax cuts to corporations,'"" says Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The national Democratic Party is helping fund the state party's effort.

Their candidate facing Fowke is civil engineer Ann Johnson Stewart. She's knocking on doors, too, telling people she stands for maintaining legal protections for abortion in the state. ""One of the reasons I'm running is to make sure we can continue on that track,"" she says.

She hopes Democrats will work now on carbon-free energy sources, local infrastructure, expanding mental health care and reducing gun violence.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says candidates face an uphill battle getting voters to pay attention to state issues.

""There's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" Karch says. And many voters don't focus on state issues.

""I think politics in Minnesota specifically may have been more distinctive a generation ago than they are today,"" he says. ""State and local politicians are increasingly being asked to comment on issues that we might think of as national.""

Fowke and Johnson Stewart say they hope to keep the conversations focused on what's going on in their district. But they know that's a big ask in a presidential election year.

PHOENIX -- In Arizona, the party that wins the Legislature could determine where tens of thousands of children go to school or how well their schools are funded. At issue is the state's sweeping vouchers program that gives families tax dollars for use in private schools or for homeschooling.

For Chelsea Ellison, a homeschool parent, the program has helped turn things around for a daughter who struggled in public elementary school.

""It took us a little bit of last year to get her where she should have been, in general, and now she's thriving,"" Ellison says. ""She loves school.""

But parents and teachers sticking with public schools say they've paid the price.

""I notice that the amount of resources available to the teachers, directly, it just is not there, any kind of funding for improvements at the school is not there,"" says Miriam Hoban, whose child attends a public school in Scottsdale. She says teachers or parents are forced to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like pencils and markers.

Arizona's program, called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, is a national model for what advocates call school choice. In 2022, the Republican Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey took a small program offering vouchers for kids with disabilities or in underperforming schools and made it available for any child.

Enrollment in the program leaped from 12,000 students to 78,000 students and growing. Students got a median of $7,409 per year. That added up to a total of about $718 million from the state budget, which was $93 million more than projected, according to the Arizona Department of Education.

Republicans control the Legislature with just a two-seat advantage in both the House and Senate. The narrow margin was in the national spotlight this year as lawmakers just barely repealed an 1864 law that banned abortion.

If Democrats win control, they pledge to scale back the voucher program and they can rely on backing from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, elected after the program was expanded. ""The previous Legislature passed a massive expansion of school vouchers that lacks accountability and will likely bankrupt this state,"" she said after taking office last year.

Critics point to stories about voucher money going for private lessons in luxury cars and ski resort passes, supposedly part of a child's education. And they say much of the money goes to families that were able to pay for private schools on their own with kids already out of the public schools.

But as the program has grown and gained support among some swing voters, it could be tougher for Democrats in competitive districts to campaign against it. They'll have to temper their ambitions, says Arizona pollster Paul Bentz.

""I don't expect that they could mount a full-fledged repeal,"" Bentz says. ""I think that would be challenging for some of the swing areas for Democrats. But I certainly think at a minimum, there would be regulation on it, and probably some definite changes to the program.""

Ellison, the voucher mom, says her family did try to make it work in public schools before opting to teach at home with voucher support.

""There was larger class sizes, more budget cuts,"" Ellison says of their old public school. ""We had no STEM teacher, we had no music teacher, we had no art teacher.""

Public school supporters say the vouchers drain the money for just those kinds of needs."
Chris Hayes: How the Trump campaign is gaslighting Americans,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vance-lies-gaslighting-debate-fact-check-rcna174067,2024-10-05T01:12:38Z,"Sen. JD Vance lies with such ease that even sometimes when you're paying attention, you don't know you're being lied to and, frankly, it drives me insane.

Just take this moment from Tuesday night's vice presidential debate:

But that's just not true: The United States, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, already produces more energy than any other nation on earth. Biden's Energy Department helped open the second of two nuclear reactors in Georgia in May. These were the first new reactors built in the United States in more than 30 years. And in July, Biden signed a bipartisan bill into law aimed at vastly growing domestic nuclear energy.

So, what do you call it when someone says the opposite of the truth? Let's just call it the Trump-Vance campaign: an entire political movement premised on Americans not believing their lying eyes and directing hate and rage at out-groups, rather than dealing with the thorny work of attempting to solve real problems with actual solutions.

Vance proved as much with his debate performance Tuesday night. He claimed there were 25 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, a made-up figure he's repeated often on the campaign trail. The actual number, experts say, is less than half of that. He then suggested Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were ""illegal immigrants"" when they in fact hold protected status.

He falsely claimed that Mexican cartels were running guns across the border into the U.S. But everyone who covers the border knows guns flow from America, where they're readily available, to Mexico which has some of the strictest gun laws in the world. Vance also said crime, inflation and border crossings are up. The opposite is true; they are all falling.

But my favorite lie from Tuesday's debate was when Vance said -- in a manner so assured that I literally had a moment where I thought I maybe was missing something -- that Donald Trump spearheaded a bipartisan effort to save the Affordable Care Act.

Again, this just isn't true. In 2016, Trump ran on a promise to kill the ACA. And, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, pointed out during the debate, Trump came within one Senate vote of succeeding in killing it.

Look, this isn't about two parties having good-faith disagreements on whether some policy will have the promised effects. It's about Trump and Vance gaslighting you into not knowing what to believe. Creating this alternate reality has become a central part of their campaign."
Biden says he and Kamala Harris are 'singing from the same song sheet'  --  as she tries distancing herself,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-kamala-harris-singing-from-same-song-sheet-she-tries-distancing-herself,2024-10-05T01:05:36Z,"President Joe Biden joined the White House press briefing for an impromptu presentation and Q&A session on Friday, claiming that he and Vice President Harris ""sing from the same song sheet.""

President Joe Biden held the floor for an impromptu Q&A session Friday afternoon during the White House press briefing, where he claimed Vice President Kamala Harris is ""in constant contact."" His comments may not come across as music to the Harris campaign's ears.

In the president's surprise appearance, he remarked on the port strike, the latest jobs numbers, and briefly on Hurricane Helene. No reporters asked about the administration's response to the storm, but one asked Biden to assess whether Harris has been deeply involved in policy.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

The president strongly linked Vice President Harris to the Biden administration's record over the past 3 ½ years, despite the Harris campaign's attempts to distance her from everything from ""Bidenomics"" to inflation to the border crisis, since Biden announced he was ending his reelection campaign, and Harris assumed the mantle of nominee.

Harris recently changed the Biden fiscal year 2025 plan from a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% on a salary of $1M or more to her own 28%, for example. As illegal migration across the border surged to historic levels, Harris has also insisted she was never in charge of Biden's border policy, despite Biden personally handing her the reins at the White House in March 2021.

Axios reported that Harris would begin creating some daylight between herself and Biden in August in order to defeat Trump, as inflation raged, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East heated up, the border crisis continued, crime lingered as a concern, and other factors, including Harris' own weak approval rating, weighed her campaign down. Other outlets and pundits on the left soon followed suit.

But Biden has reportedly bristled about his vice president distancing herself from him behind the scenes. He has also hinted that he believes he could have won the election had he not dropped out.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

During an appearance on The View last week, Biden said, ""I never fully believed the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance to my running again. The fact of the matter is, my polling was always in range of beating [Trump]."" Biden even joked about jumping back into the race during Friday's surprise appearance at the White House.

He also began his first White House briefing appearance of his presidency at the same Harris was taking the stage at a campaign event, raising questions over whether it was a communications issue between him and the campaign, or he was trying to upstage her.

Biden sparked questions on the topic before, on the anniversary of September 11, by wearing a Trump hat momentarily. The White House referred it to as a ""unity gesture"" - after Biden spent years casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy.""

The Harris campaign has further distanced itself from the Biden administration by mentioning him less and less often as the election nears. During Tuesday's Vice Presidential Debate, Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, only referred to the sitting president by referencing the ""Biden-Harris administration.""

Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
Has The Fed Cut Rates Too Much And Too Soon?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/10/04/has-the-fed-cut-rates-too-much-and-too-soon/,2024-10-04T19:53:12Z,"Winter it seems, across much of Europe, has come early. Two instincts that grow as the evenings darken are the inclination to have a tipple in the evening and to watch a good film. One Danish work that captures both sentiments is 'Druk' or 'Another Round', which won the Oscar for best international film in 2021. I recommend it.

In the film a group of four school teacher friends decide to test the hypothesis of a Norwegian psychologist that humans have a deficiency of alcohol in their blood, and the protagonists undertake an experiment to maintain a 'warm' level of alcohol in their blood. It is an experiment I attempt often, but the real lesson today is with central banking.

It seems that central bankers have decided that in the spirit of 'Druk', the liquidity in the world financial system is not sufficient and have set out to administer near daily injections of cheap money. The number of central banks changing policy (i.e. to negative) is the greatest it has been, apart from the global financial crisis and the COVID period. In September alone there have been 24 rate cuts from central banks around the world.

Chief amongst these has been the 50-basis point cut from the Federal Reserve and the very dramatic, multiple policy moves by China. In short China has cut rates, infused the banking system, made mortgages cheaper and generally tried to spread liquidity over the emerging cracks in China's economy. In the spirit of 'Druk' it is the equivalent of going on a five day bender in order to cure a serious disease.

Nonetheless, the easing in policy from the Fed and China, together with what will likely be a couple of more rate cuts this year from the European Central Bank mean that the world financial system is flush with liquidity. Chinese markets - hitherto the worst performing markets of a major economy - show the impact and importance of liquidity. The market cap of the Hang Seng index has grown by a quarter in less than two weeks. China has overtaken the US in terms of equity market performance to date.

There is no change to fundamentals - I don't see this policy move having a decisive impact on the downward trend in Chinese earnings, but that doesn't matter in the near term - liquidity is coursing through the pipes of the Chinese financial system, and in turn might bring a temporary easing to conditions in the property market.

For all the analysts who devote time to measuring earnings and calibrating valuations, the reality is that in this era of 'quick to please' monetary policy, liquidity matters a lot for asset prices. My rule of thumb in constructing a measure of liquidity would encompass money supply, the state of central bank balance sheets, the key role of the dollar and net issuance of debt by treasuries.

The arcane notion of financial liquidity has attracted enough attention that the Financial Times recently ran an article breaking down its component parts. A couple of top-flight economics consultancies run their own measures of liquidity - such as LongView Economics and Michael Howell at CrossBorder Capital. The latter holds that we are on the cusp of a significant upswing in global liquidity.

If that is true, the implication for markets is 'Druk'- a persistent giddyiness whilst central banks keep rates low and liquidity flush, amidst an acceptable level of GDP and profit growth. Friday's job market figures in the US were very strong, suggesting that in fact there was no need for a large rate cut. This is the kind of macro climate we have seen in the mid and late 1990's, and one that tends to dampen the market implications of turbulent geopolitics.

From the point of view of asset prices, there are a couple of possible trajectories. Historically, the Fed has started to cut interest rates when the price to earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has been close to 10 times (1960's to 1990's). Now, like in 2000, it is in the mid 20's which suggests that extra liquidity now could run asset prices in bubble territory proper, and cultivate the next bout of inflation, something the central banks' bank, the BIS, has warned about (helpfully the BIS has taken a counter view to that of its members ahead of a number of crisis).

For the time being, the upturn in liquidity may be most meaningful for capital markets activity and assets in the private economy. They have been in the doldrums. If the 'Druk' hypothesis is working we should see a rise in IPO activity into 2025, and intensification in private equity deals and a rise in funding activity (beyond AI firms) in venture."
Trump national security advisors mock Biden's warnings to Israel to stick to 'proportional' Iran response,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-israel-response-iran-trump,2024-10-04T19:26:57Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joined 'Fox & Friends'

A ""painful"" Israeli response weighs over the heads of the Iranian regime after their ballistic missile attacks on Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden has insisted that an angry Israel should not strike Iran's nuclear sites - and should make sure its response is measured - proportional.

""Iran launched a war into Israel,"" said former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel.

""So to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

On Thursday, he revealed that he was ""discussing"" recommending Israel target Iran's energy facilities.

""That put the oil markets into a tailspin, even if we are talking to them about it. It's not something you muse about publicly,"" said former Trump deputy national security advisor Victoria Coates.

""If you've made a decision, and you have something to announce, fine. You want to level with the American people as much as you can. These random comments are really damaging and confusing to the Iranians, because . . . they don't have any guidelines or guardrails about what might be coming and so they might do something weird.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH KHAMEINI DEFENDS MISSILE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL

Israel's counterattack could come at any moment. ""We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.

Rather than its longtime goal of helping to negotiate a ceasefire, the Biden administration has now shifted its priority to containment - helping the region avoid all-out war between its two hegemonic superpowers.

""This is the 1930s all over again. G7 leaders - led by President Biden - are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital.

""The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality,"" he went on. ""Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?""

Former President Donald Trump has not said how Israel should respond to the attacks - which he insists never would have happened under his watch.

Striking Iran's nuclear facilities risks provoking all-out war on yet another front for Israel in the eyes of the Biden administration. The Trump team is caught between an anti-war mindset and a penchant for supporting Israel without conditions. It's unclear whether they still believe the two can exist in harmony.

Proportionality is ""clearly not what Israel is doing,"" according to Coates.

""It really seems to me that after the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] left Washington in July, after that visit, some factor, or combination of factors, really changed his calculus,"" she said.

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""He appears to have gotten home with the attitude of, 'I want to get everything I can get done before the election.' He's not really listening to the White House at all, which is unfortunate.""

After Iranian plots to assassinate him and the hacking of his campaign, Trump did say that if he were president, he would tell Iran, ""I'm going to blow you to smithereens"" if they harm any U.S. political figures.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he wished he had responded more forcefully after Iran fired dozens of missiles at U.S. forces stationed in Iraq in 2020, leaving many with traumatic brain injuries.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean? 'Injured' means -- you mean, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort,"" Trump said.

""So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq,"" Trump continued, saying 'Iraq' instead of 'Iran.' ""When you say not tough, they had no money. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. And when we hit them, they hit us. And they called us, and they said, 'We're going to shoot at your fort, but we're not going to hit it.'""

Defense officials have said more than 100 suffered traumatic brain injuries after the January 2020 attack.

That attack came after Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani due to an uncovered Iranian plot to kill American diplomats and service members.

Trump vowed to hit 52 Iranian sites ""very hard"" if Iran were to carry out the plot, representing the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days after being seized at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979.

Still, in January, Iran lobbed attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, including the Ain al-Assad military base, and a second facility near Erbil airport.

In March, three U.S.-led coalition forces were killed when multiple rockets hit Taji military base.

Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, has insisted to reporters this week that ""nobody [was] ever tougher on Iran"" than he was.

'Look at the World today -- Look at the missiles flying right now in the Middle East, look at what's happening with Russia/Ukraine, look at Inflation destroying the World. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT!' he wrote on Truth Social.

Alexander Vindman, the former Trump National Security Council Director for European Affairs for the United States, claimed that the former president was ""fearful"" of escalation with Iran.

""Iran struck first and early, during Trump's presidency, attacking US troops. Trump consistently recoiled in fear inviting further attacks,"" he wrote on X.

""Fact check: In 2020, Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in retaliation for the Soleimani assassination. 110 U.S. service members sustained traumatic brain injuries. Many administration officials remain on an Iranian hit list today,"" former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

But Patel argued the Biden administration's lifting of sanctions on Iran -- and the Obama administration's 2015 nuclear deal -- is what led to the attacks in the first place.

""The JCPOA, which was called the 'Iran nuclear deal' for a reason. It was never intended to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It literally gave them one on a timeline,"" he said.

""Now I believe they have one, because for four years they haven't stopped them or slowed them down. They've only been successful in politicizing national security."""
September Jobs Report Obliterates Experts' Projections,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2024/10/04/september-jobs-report-obliterates-experts-projections/,2024-10-04T18:01:30Z,"The American job market continues to forge ahead under a head of steam, forcing even the most cautious prognosticators to ask if it's really that good. Well, truth is, it's better than that.

Once again, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly Jobs Report astonished economists and market observers by revealing that 254,000 jobs were created last month, blowing away predictions of 140,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down from 4.2% to 4.1%. For the 45 consecutive month, the job market outperformed expectations, continued the most robust expansion in history, and even defied possible disruptions usually associated with election year jitters and shenanigans. In short, the American job market is a beautiful thing.

And as usual, it's not limited to the veneer of jobs created and unemployment rate. A look under the hood shows us the following:

While all this is going on, wages continued rising and are now 4.0% above the level 12 month ago. This is not the only good news for the wage earner. At the same time, inflation has cooled to a very manageable 2.5%. The typical worker, then, is up 1.5% over inflation, although that's little consolation after a trip to the supermarket. In other words, had it not been for the rock-solid job market we've come to rely upon, this would be a different conversation.

In sum, the current job market is a sturdy structure, not susceptible to erosion or collapse. In large part, that's due to to smart initiatives like the American Relief Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, smart fiscal policy on the Fed's part, continued enrollment growth in the Affordable Care Act, and - intangible but undeniable - overall confidence on everyone's part."
"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

""I think one of the bigger things to look at has been abortion... Michigan has been one of the stronger states in supporting that,"" the voter told Fox News Digital. ""He can do a very good job in getting us to just see the value of life."""
The U.S. saw stunningly strong growth in jobs last month. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140039/labor-market-jobs-economy-interest-rates,2024-10-04T17:19:53Z,"U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September -- more than forecasters had expected. Gains for July and August were also revised upward. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images hide caption

As far as economic data goes, it was a bit of a stunner.

Economists had expected U.S. employers to have added about 150,000 jobs in September. Instead, they created more than a quarter-million jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department.

Here are five things to know about Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report.

In total, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs in September. Restaurants, retailers and construction companies all added jobs at a healthy pace.

In addition, employment gains for July and August were revised upwards by a total of 72,000 jobs. That means that, on average, employers have added 186,000 jobs in each of the last three months.

While that's a slowdown from the first three months of the year, when employers added an average of 267,000 jobs a month, it's still a solid pace.

A separate report earlier this week also showed the number of job openings increased slightly in August to 8 million.

But not all industries are enjoying a boom. Manufacturing has been in a slump for most of the last two years. Factories cut 7,000 jobs in September, although factory employment is still higher than it was just before the pandemic, by 137,000 jobs. Most of September's job cuts were in the auto industry.

A survey of factory managers released this week by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturers are still struggling with high interest rates and uncertainty about the upcoming presidential election.

By contrast, another ISM survey shows continued growth in the much-larger services side of the economy -- things like restaurants and car repair.

In order to keep adding jobs, employers need workers. Fortunately, the U.S. labor force continues to grow.

Friday's report shows 150,000 people joined or re-joined the workforce last month. Much of this growth is driven by immigration. The foreign-born workforce has grown rapidly over the last year, adding 1.4 million workers, while the native-born workforce shrank by nearly 600,000 workers.

Were it not for immigrant workers, job growth might well have stalled. The decline of the native-born workforce is primarily the result of baby boomers retiring. By contrast, the share of people in their prime working years (25 to 54) is near an all-time high.

Average wages in September were up 4% from a year ago. That's likely more than enough to outpace rising prices, giving workers a real boost in their purchasing power.

Inflation data for September won't be released until next week, but in recent months, prices have been climbing at a modest pace -- 2.5% for the 12 months ending in August. In fact, wage gains have exceeded price hikes for fifteen months and September's increase probably extended that trend.

The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates last month with an aggressive half-a-percentage-point move, signaling a turning point in its years-long battle against inflation.

But Fed chairman Jerome Powell says he and his colleagues may move more cautiously in the future, cutting rates by a quarter point at a time.

""This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry,"" Powell said Monday.

Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report is likely to reinforce that patient approach. According to CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the next Fed meeting rose to nearly 95% after the jobs report was released, from 68% the day before.

Fed policymakers will get one more monthly jobs report before their next scheduled meeting in early November."

A Florida restaurant owner struggling to keep doors open in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic received a surprise message of support from former President Trump.

""I'd like to ask everybody to pitch in and help save Harry and the Natives. It's a special restaurant, a very special place. People love it. It's been around a long time. Like a really long time. But it's fallen prey to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's economy,"" Trump told owner Harry MacArthur in a pre-recorded message Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We have to keep the good ones open, especially when it comes to Florida. Florida is a very, very special place, and that's a very, very great restaurant. So Harry and the Natives, keep it going. We love it. And you're going to be around for a long time.""

'ECONOMY WAY BETTER UNDER TRUMP': BLACK VOTERS SHARE IF THEY WERE BETTER OFF 4 YEARS AGO

Co-host Steve Doocy hosted Friday's show from the packed restaurant in Hobe Sound after MacArthur wrote on Facebook he would have to shut down unless something changed by October 12.

The community, however, rallied behind MacArthur by supporting a GoFundMe set up by his son, Wyatt.

MacArthur called the response from Trump and the community ""overwhelming.""

""Turns out everybody cares,"" he said.

The restaurant has been in MacArthur's family for 72 years. Although the business was originally run by his parents, MacArthur reopened the business as Harry and the Natives after his father died in the 1980s.

MacArthur's business was close to bankruptcy in 2021, but after a ""Breakfast with Friends"" segment, the business was able to hold on. But the financial struggle was not over.

""Fox saved us then. Fox and Steve Doocy saved us, and we rolled for the next six months on that and then everything else. And then the economy kept going south and everything else,"" Macarthur told co-host Steve Doocy.

""It's like a nationwide thing. Family restaurants aren't going to be there.""

The latest polling from 7News/Suffolk University/USA Today shows the economy and inflation remain the top issue for voters at 34%. Since the Biden-Harris administration took office in 2021, prices in the Sunshine State have surged 21.7%."
Why Are Concert Tickets So Expensive? It's Not (Entirely) Ticketmaster's Fault,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/why-are-concert-tickets-so-expensive/,2024-10-04T14:34:44Z,"These days, it seems like snagging affordably priced tickets to a concert should be its own Olympic sport. It wasn't that long ago when Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain was famously shocked to learn some musicians charged $50 or more per ticket; in comparison, Nirvana was only charging about $17. If someone told you today they got a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert for only $50, you'd probably wonder where they found their magic lamp. Which leads to the inevitable question: Why are concert tickets so expensive these days?

To find out why things have changed so much in the live entertainment industry, we spoke to Eric Renner Brown, senior editor at Billboard and a former staff writer and editor at the concert-centric publication Pollstar, as well as Tatiana Cirisano, a senior music industry analyst at MIDiA Research and a former music business reporter at Billboard.

As you might imagine, it's a little complicated, with multiple factors conspiring to raise prices. Some factors, such as inflation, aren't especially surprising, but others are more subtle and involve the way modern day musicians make money right now.

As with other sectors of the economy, inflation has impacted the concert industry, causing the price of supplies to spiral upward. But there's more to it than that, because it largely started during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the global economy slowed down and large public gatherings stopped in 2019 and 2020, many professionals were forced to take a step back from their work when concerts were canceled for health and safety reasons.

""A lot of bus drivers and truck drivers who transport musicians and crews, and, in some cases, semi-trucks full of production equipment for tours -- a lot of those people left the concert business,"" says Brown. ""They went to work in freight trucking, Amazon and other big companies transporting goods because that was still happening during the pandemic.""

Once concerts started up again, however, getting those workers back into the touring business didn't happen right away. With fewer people available to work on tours, wages (and consequently prices) escalated. So if concert producers wanted those goods and services, they had to pay more for them, post-pandemic. That lead directly to higher ticket prices.

Cirisano adds that inflation affects the cost of everything, including the gas to get to tour stops, airfare and hotel accommodations. There's also been a multi-year global supply chain crisis, which impacted many goods and services, including the tour buses themselves.

""There was a point where they were really scarce, so the prices went up,"" says Cirisano. ""If you have to spend more on that as an artist, you end up maybe pricing tickets a little bit higher.""

Big-name artists such as Taylor Swift and Beyoncé don't live directly off the money they make from touring; they have additional income streams like record sales, merchandise, endorsement deals, royalties and more.

But that's not the experience for many smaller artists, who generally rely on touring income as a main source of revenue. That's even more true now than it was a decade or two ago when record sales were higher and streaming wasn't the predominant way for people to consume music. Factor in that many artists were sidelined for a year or two because of the pandemic, and the result is that many musicians need to earn back what they lost during those non-touring years.

""Most artists don't make any meaningful income from streaming, so they have to supplement it with these other things [such as merchandise or live performances],"" Cirisano says. ""For a lot of artists, touring is their bread and butter.""

Moreover, Brown points out that many tours taking place across the U.S. are much bigger productions today than they were in the past. ""When you're looking at these extremely highly produced arena and stadium tours, fans expect a more immersive, multi-faceted concert experience than they might have expected before,"" Brown says.

Having a band play onstage with little-to-no production simply doesn't cut it with modern audiences -- which means that there are extra costs to create a monumental performance -- and that obviously becomes the fans' burden.

While this is a complicated question, Brown says it's a safe bet that the bigger the artist, the more control they have over their business, including ticket prices. Even if the artist doesn't have the final say over the final ticket price, they do have leverage. That said, artists simply don't have control over reseller prices on the secondary market.

Longtime bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Eagles tend to have some of the priciest tickets in the concert business, and fans will typically pay the high costs to see these legendary artists. It's a case of supply and demand, Brown points out.

Back in 2022, ahead of his 2023 U.S. tour, Bruce Springsteen faced controversy over exorbitant dynamic prices -- as much as $5,000 per ticket -- and that's before tickets hit the secondary market. When asked by Rolling Stone about the choice to price that high, Springsteen said he told his team, ""'Hey, we're 73 years old. The guys are there. I want to do what everybody else is doing, my peers.' So that's what happened."" The Boss then explained how ""most of [his] tickets are totally affordable"" but if ""the ticket broker or someone is going to be taking that money, [he thought,] 'Hey, why shouldn't that money go to the guys that are going to be up there sweating three hours a night for it?'""

In the pop world, Taylor Swift tickets could easily set you back four figures if you're seeing her in the U.S. this year. Tickets to her European shows were priced significantly lower. However, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end business analysis, Swift's average ticket price was about $239, the highest in 2023. Beyoncé's average ticket price came in at No. 2, around $209. Interestingly, according to Pollstar's 2024 mid-year report, the publication noted a 9.4% increase in the average ticket price, going from $116.41 to $127.38. The report stated the price hike ""marks only the third year on record with an average ticket price over $100. The 2022 average was $105.55, while the 2019 average topped out at $92.42.""

On the flipside, Ed Sheeran is a major artist who's managed to keep his ticket prices relatively low. Brown cited Sheeran's smaller band as a possible contributing factor to lower ticket costs. Per Pollstar, Sheeran's average ticket price was about $105 in 2023.

Another example is Robert Smith from The Cure. He worked to significantly lower prices, spurning dynamic pricing. Many of the tickets to The Cure's Shows of a Lost World tour in 2023 only cost fans $20 apiece. Smith worked with Ticketmaster after learning fees on the platform doubled the $20 tickets and surprisingly was able to refund fans for part of the service charge.

Web searches for concert tickets can sometimes lead to misleading perceptions of ticket prices. Google ""Taylor Swift tickets,"" for example, and the first few results you see will generally be resale sites on the secondary market, not the primary market. Cirisano notes that Ticketmaster is part of both market types, which can be especially confusing to fans trying to purchase tickets from their website.

""I think that's added to this perception that ticket prices are skyrocketing, when, a lot of the time, it's not actually the original ticket price you're looking at,"" Cirisano explains. ""It's the one that's been marked up by, in many cases, professional resellers who employ bots to buy hundreds, if not thousands, of tickets and resell them at higher prices.""

In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, over an alleged monopoly. According to a press release, ""The lawsuit, which includes a request for structural relief, seeks to restore competition in the live concert industry, provide better choices at lower prices for fans, and open venue doors for working musicians and other performance artists.""

Could this lawsuit be successful? Cirisano believes that the case depends on whether the Justice Department can prove Live Nation is putting artists who do not book through their venue system at a disadvantage. Without that evidence, the suit could be in jeopardy.

Also in May 2024, the so-called Taylor Swift bill was signed into law by Minnesota Governor (and now vice presidential candidate) Tim Walz after the politician was unable to purchase tickets to Swift's tour stop in Minneapolis in 2023. This law, according to The Associated Press, ""will require ticket sellers to disclose all fees up front and prohibit resellers from selling more than one copy of a ticket, among other measures. The law will apply to tickets purchased in Minnesota or other states for concerts or other live events held in Minnesota."" Basically, it will provide stronger protections for digital consumers and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.

The internet is ablaze with memes about Ticketmaster's controversial fees, but where do these fees actually go? Who's benefiting? For starters, the main benefactors are (perhaps surprisingly) the venues themselves.

Some of the fees are going to credit card processing as well. ""What a lot of fans don't realize is that when they're seeing those fees that are added on, a lot of them are not actually going to Ticketmaster,"" Cirisano says. ""It creates this perception like, 'Oh, Ticketmaster is adding all of these fees,' when a lot of those fees are being passed on to others.""

Of course, some of the fees do go directly to Ticketmaster, though the site claims that they are used to improve the platform and services.

Case in point: One way Ticketmaster has tried to improve the users' experiences is to use All-In Pricing for certain shows. (Some states, such as New York, Tennessee and Connecticut mandate the use of All-In Pricing.) All-In Pricing requires Ticketmaster to include all fees as part of the ticket price right up front, so there aren't any surprises when a fan goes to check out. For tickets that don't offer All-In Pricing, Ticketmaster created a feature that lets you toggle to view the total price with fees.

Advocates for All-In Pricing, such as the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), also want an itemized list of fees presented at the time of purchase for better pay transparency.

All-In Pricing can be the make-or-break solution for fans who budget a maximum price of, for example, $100, for a specific concert, then learn at the checkout their final cost will now be $200 with fees. The timer counting down how long they have to make a decision creates added pressure to what may already be a stressful situation. Fans in this predicament are forced to make a choice and it could be between having money for bills or getting to attend their dream concert. Knowing all the facts upfront can lessen the anxiety and make the experience a more relaxing purchase.

Make no mistake: If the next time you go to purchase a concert ticket and have to do a double take when you see the final total, it's not your imagination. Prices have gone up significantly in recent years.

Yes, Ticketmaster and other ticket sellers frontload ticket prices with additional fees that benefit the venue, credit card companies and the ticket sellers themselves. But don't discount the pandemic and all its financial repercussions, along with the need to offset the revenue artists have lost in the transition from CD sales to online streaming. It's no secret that Spotify just doesn't pay the bills for most musicians.

Artists have to adapt to these changes, which can ultimately trickle down to consumers through ticketing platforms. But in the words of Oasis, ""Don't look back in anger"" -- or, at least try not to when you remember a ticket to one of their shows in 2009 was about $50, but a ticket for their 2025 tour starts around $180.

"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."
Strong September Jobs Report Reduces Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/04/strong-september-jobs-report-reduces-recession-fears/,2024-10-04T14:03:49Z,"The September jobs report was stronger than expected and is likely to assuage recession risks and fears, driving up hopes for ""soft landing"" or ""no landing"" economic scenarios. This report is likely to reduce the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 0.5% on November 7, but the recent trend of slowing payrolls is still supportive of a 0.25% rate cut. An uncertain presidential election outcome could still push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%.

The Employment Situation report, known to economists and analysts as the jobs report, was strong for September. It showed a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, strong net payroll gains of 254,000, and strong upward revisions to payrolls by 72,000 for the previous two months. This was a much stronger report than economists and analysts had been forecasting, and it reduces the perceived downside risks to the U.S. labor market and economy.

While the jobs report supports the claim that the U.S. labor market is relatively solid, other recent data also reinforce this notion. After all, initial and continuing jobless claims are very low. Continuing claims are at 1.826 million, which is only around 1.1 percent of the labor force. Initial Jobless Claims are also very low, at just 225,000.

Strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showed that there were over 8 million open jobs in August 2024. While this is around 4.2 million fewer open jobs than the U.S. historic high in March 2022 of 12.2 million, 8 million is still around 1 million more open jobs than before the COVID pandemic. With over 6 million more open jobs than people collecting unemployment, it is difficult to expect very large net payroll losses across multiple months anytime soon.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. The September jobs report, August JOLTS data, and recent weekly jobless claims reflect full employment in the U.S. labor market, but consumer prices are not yet low and stable - or at least not yet at the Fed's 2% inflation target. The combination of above-target inflation and a solid labor market could incentivize the Fed to cut interest rates by only 0.25% rather than 0.5% in its next policy decision on November 7.

Of course, we don't yet have September inflation data, and there is also a U.S. election to contend with before the next Fed meeting.

The September CPI and PCE reports will be critical for the November 7 Fed decision. Year-on-year inflation rates are likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year September total CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%. However, it may be the November election outcome - or uncertainty about that outcome by November 7 - that could push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%

A strong September employment report with payrolls well above August levels and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1% is a signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which is likely to support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, this solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it assuages concerns about recession."
Port strike longshoremen union boss linked to murdered mobster in 'farce' racketeering case he beat at trial,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/port-strike-longshoremen-union-boss-linked-murdered-mobster-farce-racketeering-case-he-beat-at-trial,2024-10-04T13:40:45Z,"FOX Business' Cheryl Casone previews the September jobs report, break downs the tentative agreement with the International Longshoremen's Association and discusses the hold on Biden's student loan forgiveness plan.

Harold Daggett, the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, which went on a brief strike this week in a labor dispute that could have created a shipping crisis across the U.S., was once cleared of federal racketeering charges in connection with alleged mafia ties to the same union.

Daggett's attorney, his cousin George Daggett, said the 2005 charges were politically motivated and based on weak evidence.

""This trial was a farce,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.""

The Justice Department failed to convict - but the case had deadly results. One of the co-defendants, a reputed Genovese family captain named Larry Ricci, disappeared mid-trial and was later found dead in the trunk of a car outside the Huck Finn Diner in Union, New Jersey, 20 miles west of New York City.

DOCKWORKERS' UNION REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT, WILL SUSPEND PORT STRIKE UNTIL JANUARY

""He's either been abducted -- that is unlikely because he'd be far too difficult a person to keep hostage -- or killed,"" Ricci's attorney Martin Schmukler told the court after he vanished mid-trial, The Associated Press reported at the time. He was later acquitted in absentia.

The commission, at the time a joint oversight operation between the states of New York and New Jersey, pressured federal prosecutors to bring charges it couldn't prove, George Daggett told Fox News Digital.

This trial was a farce. People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.

-- George Daggett, cousin and lawyer of ILA President Harold Daggett

Harold Daggett denied the criminal accusations and said he was a victim of mob extortion. He testified that another mobster, George Barone, put a gun to his head and threatened to massacre his family.

MOBSTERS CHARGED IN INTERNATIONAL PLOT TO CONTROL NEW YORK GARBAGE TRUCK INDUSTRY

""I was so nervous, I urinated all over myself,"" he testified at the time, according to a New York Post report. In a separate deposition, he denied knowing Barone was a Genovese ""soldier,"" court documents show.

Prosecutors had alleged that Daggett had ties to the Genovese crime family as far back as 2000, and the union has long been accused of handing no-show jobs to mobsters' relatives and providing kickbacks.

In exchange for union contracts, the mob was supposed to protect the careers and salaries of corrupt ILA officials, prosecutors alleged.

UNION LEADER SLAMS 'MONEY CRAZY' SHIPPING COMPANIES FOR REFUSING TO 'SHARE' 'BILLIONS' EARNED DURING PANDEMIC

The Justice Department couldn't convince jurors that the defendants were guilty of a crime.

George Daggett, the attorney, said the case began after his cousin asked a Catholic priest for financial advice and had $18 million in union funds placed under the supervision of the same money manager who worked with Our Lady of the Lake Church in Sparta, New Jersey.

""So at the trial, every time a mobster's name was mentioned, the government had a big board, and they made a circle, [and] every time a mobster was mentioned, they put his picture up on this big board,"" he said. ""The government's case ended, and I took Father Cassidy's picture and I put it in the middle of all those mobsters. So that's the kind of trial it was.""

Although the case had to do with allegations of extortion and interference with commerce, prosecutors asked their first witness how many people he'd killed, Daggett said.

""You knew for the government it was all downhill after that,"" he said.

After Ricci's disappearance, his attorney continued to work on his behalf at trial and clear his name.

DESANTIS TAKES MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS AS 'UNACCEPTABLE' STRIKE THREATENS PRODUCT SUPPLY

""What happened was it was not a good fact-pattern for the government, but the Waterfront Commission was pushing so hard that the eastern district said OK,"" Daggett told Fox News Digital. ""Larry Ricci lost his life because, I guess, people thought that everybody was going to be guilty. There was no way [the verdict] could've been guilty.""

Another co-defendant, Albert Cernadas pleaded guilty, but jurors went on to find Daggett, Ricci and Arthur Coffey, another ILA executive, not guilty at trial.

No one has been charged with Riccis' death, although federal prosecutors said they overheard on wiretaps a New Jersey mobster discussing the retrieval of the murder weapon with his son. That man, Michael Coppola, was sent to prison in another RICO case, which involved ILA kickbacks, identity fraud and the 1977 murder of a man named John ""Johnny Cokes"" Lardiere.

Prosecutors have also hinted that Ricci's murder opened a path for other suspected mobsters to corruptly profit off of the ILA, according to court documents.

Harold Daggett became the union's president in 2011. He has been purported to drive a yacht and a luxe Bentley car, live in a sprawling mansion in Sparta, New Jersey, and brought home more than $900,000 in union pay last year - $728,000 for being union president, and another $173,000 for his past role in local 1804-1, which he left in 2011, FOX Business reported.

The ILA, which represents dock workers on the East and Gulf Coasts, went on strike this week in a dispute over what the union calls unfair pay against a backdrop of steep inflation, a rising minimum wage that has outpaced union raises, and the threat of losing human jobs to automation.

The union was demanding concessions from the U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, before the sides reached a deal late Thursday.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 U.S. workers at ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, said the sides reached a provisional wage agreement that extends the current contract until Jan. 15, 2025.

""Things were rough back then [in 1977, when] we went on strike for 80 cents,"" Harold Daggett told FOX Business Tuesday. ""The companies only made like $5 to 10 million, but since COVID and before COVID 'til now, they're making billions and billions of dollars. It's a whole different story, but they don't want to share it. They'd rather see a fully automated terminal right here on the East Coast so they can make more money. They're money crazy.""

The strike could have crippled the U.S. supply chain and cost the country's economy more than $4. billion a day, according to one JPMorgan analysis."
Tiny Houses Are Still Too Expensive,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2024/10/04/tiny-houses-are-still-too-expensive/,2024-10-04T13:36:52Z,"Last month I told the tale of two villages, one an improvised solution for shelter for people living outside and the other a tiny house village. The contrast in costs is significant, with the solution of sheds costs several thousand dollars and the tiny house village costing $5 million for just 30 units. Why are tiny house villages so expensive to build and manage? The A-Mark Foundation conducted an important look at tiny houses in Los Angeles asking and answering that question. There, since 2021, 9 villages have been created with a total of 1,217 beds and villages ranging in size from 74 units to 224 units. That is a significant number of people not living on the street, rights of way, or otherwise in the elements, but the average costs are $500,000 per unit. What can be learned about those high costs in Los Angeles and can tiny houses be saved from these high costs?

First of all, what is a tiny house or tiny home village? Generally speaking, it is just what it sounds like, small buildings around 120 square feet that range from prefabricated structures that can be dropped on the ground or in a parking lot to more elaborate built out versions with plumbing and utilities. The tiny houses have the origin in efforts by compassionate activists, often churches, to create fast solutions to immediate shelter needs for people living outside. These structures could often be built on church sites because usually local zoning codes give exemptions from elements of code compliance for religious institutions, giving consideration for these interventions as an expression of freedom of religion protected by the First Amendment.

Businesses have sprung up over the years building and selling small structures, some of them for the purpose of compassionate housing, others touting themselves as a ""solution"" to the housing crisis because they are manufactured off site and can be dropped with minimal construction costs.

The reality is that no matter how cheap these solutions are coming out of a factory or assembled on site from components, site conditions and regulations drive up the price. I wrote a post in 2019, Modular Housing Can Save Time, Money, And Lower Prices, and another one earlier this year, What A Fool Believes: No, Tech Won't Solve Housing Inflation, describing the benefits of manufactured housing solutions and the limits of them; factory production saves time (which is money after all), and local regulatory hurdles, site conditions, utilities and regulations shave off savings from the factory.

The conclusions of the foundation study are very conservative, mostly, I think, because of politics. The A-Mark Foundation gives grants for independent reporting, and The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) refused to answer their questions about costs for the report.

To say out loud, as I do, that regulations and codes are killing savings of improvised housing, would undermine the push for more cash. Those on the left are allergic to the word ""efficient"" believing it means cutting people off that don't bootstrap themselves out of poverty or living on the streets. Those on the right can blindly use the word to mean ""waste,"" implying that these people don't need a tiny home but a sobriety and a job. I get it. But let's face it, these solutions are way too expensive, and that means not enough of them are available. As I say often, efficiency is compassionate.

Los Angeles is no different than any other part of the country. The the price of land, construction materials, plumbing, electricity, and shared facilities are expensive if they are required. The foundation's report found that, ""Some of the biggest construction costs appear to involve grading/paving the sites and installing sewer and power lines. The Pallet shelters themselves, at an average of $4,419 per bed, account for a small portion of the $42,344 average construction cost per bed."" This validates my point, the tiny houses are cheap, but site costs and complying with regulations and including utilities kill that savings.

The answer, I believe, is to revise model building codes promulgated by the International Building Code Council (IBCC), creating a standard of health and safety that prioritizes health and safety but also speed and low costs. States and local jurisdictions should adopt these codes and treat the crisis on the streets for what it is, an emergency just like an earthquake or a hurricane.

Cities simply won't see progress on dealing with the crisis on the streets with big Low Income Housing Tax Credit which require substantial rent payments and screening and are very expensive to build or with sweeps of encampments which just move people around public spaces. The answer is a radical revision of expectations of what a dwelling unit can be and making building and permitting them safely easy and cheap."
Great news on job growth strengthens Dems' pre-election pitch,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jobs-job-growth-democrats-biden-harris-economy-election-2024-rcna174006,2024-10-04T13:28:30Z,"As Election Day 2024 approaches, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality keeps getting in the way.

Expectations heading into this week showed projections of about 150,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in September. As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market fared quite a bit better than that. NBC News reported:

In addition to the encouraging top-line data, the same Labor Department report showed that wage growth continued to outpace inflation.

This is not the final jobs report before Election Day -- that will be released the morning of Nov. 1, five days before voters go to the polls -- but the new data will help drive the public conversation about the economy in the race's final weeks.

The encouraging job numbers also come the week after a surprisingly good report on U.S. economic growth, which led White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard to note in a written statement, ""We learned this morning that the economy has grown by 3.2% per year during Biden-Harris Administration -- even stronger than previously estimated -- and better than the first three years of the previous administration.""

As the 2024 election cycle nears its end, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality, however, keeps getting in the way of GOP talking points.

Let's also circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump's presidency -- when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet -- the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018, and 2019.

According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16.5 million jobs since January 2021 -- more than double the combined total of Trump's first three years. (If we include the fourth year of the Republican's term, the data looks even worse for him.)

For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions:"
Is It A Goldilocks Economy?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/04/is-it-a-goldilocks-economy/,2024-10-04T13:06:32Z,"Temporary Strike Resolution Offers Short-Term Relief For Impacted Industries

Stocks were relatively quiet on Thursday as markets awaited this morning's employment situation report. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Small cap stocks were the biggest movers for the day, falling over 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%.

This morning, the Labor Department released the latest employment report. Forecasts were calling for 147 thousand new jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual numbers were 254 thousand new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. We also saw upward revisions for both July and August, suggesting the economy continues to show strength. We'll get the latest Consumer Price Index late next week and a chance to see if prices are continuing on their trajectory of moderating. Thus far though, the net effect of recent data implies an economy continuing on target for a soft landing. However, there is one potential caveat to that, oil.

On Thursday, oil was up over 5% as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile attack earlier in the week. For the week, crude oil prices are up nearly 10% and that is something with the potential to upset the progress made vis-a-vis inflation. If there is one commodity that has the potential to jumpstart inflation, it is oil. Therefore, in addition to both the humanitarian and geopolitical repercussions, there is the potential for economic upheaval as well. The 200-day moving average for crude oil is right around $75 and that is a level I'll be watching. A close above that could be bullish for those who are long but bearish for inflation.

The other big story on Thursday was the temporary end to the strike at ports along the East Coast. Employers offered workers a pay increase of 62% spread out over six years. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators said this agreement will last until late January as the two sides work on a long-term deal. One of the main sticking points in the negotiations is automation and how that will impact jobs. Seeing as how the strike lasted just three days, any economic impact was likely muted. However, this is an issue we may hear about again come early next year. In the meantime, we're seeing some of the companies that could have been negatively impacted by a prolonged strike trading higher in premarket activity. Shares of Walmart are up 0.5% along with Target, which is trading higher by nearly 1%.

For today, I'm keeping an eye on how the jobs data report is spun and oil. The market's initial reaction to the jobs number has been bullish. Index futures jumped when the report was released. Heading into this morning's report, sentiment was largely in the camp that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet in November. Expectations for that quarter point cut were relatively unchanged after the employment number was released. One other thing I'll be watching today is the VIX. Last Friday, volatility increased right near the end of the day. I believe that was largely due to the situation in the Middle East and investor concern about the potential for increased hostilities over the weekend. Given the state of affairs as of Friday morning, I would not be surprised if we saw a similar situation today. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
The Latest Employment Numbers And The Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2024/10/04/the-latest-employment-numbers-and-the-presidential-election/,2024-10-04T12:44:31Z,"The Employment Situation Report for the month of September was released this morning. It showed what everyone expected: very little change in the unemployment rate. At 4.1%, it was actually slightly lower than that for August (4.2%). One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other. And while there is evidence that Kamala Harris' economic message may be gaining ground on Donald Trump's, a lot can happen in a month.

Everyone will be watching these numbers closely."
What's Happening With News Corp Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/04/whats-happening-with-news-corp-stock/,2024-10-04T11:04:12Z,"After an 8% rise year-to-date, at the current price of around $26 per share, we believe News Corp stock (NASDAQ: NWSA), a global, diversified media and information services company, could see further gains in the longer term. NWSA stock grew from around $25 to $26 during this period, underperforming the broader indices, with the S&P rising about 20% over the same time. For the full year 2024, News Corp's revenues grew 2% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $10 billion while its adjusted profitability grew 43% y-o-y to 70 cents. The results were driven by higher Australian residential revenues at REA Group, improved digital sales at the Book Publishing segment, and continued growth in the professional information business at the Dow Jones segment. The results were partly offset by lower advertising revenues in the News Media segment and lower revenues at Move due to ongoing challenging housing market conditions in the U.S.

The company's segment-wise review presents a largely optimistic picture, albeit with notable exceptions in two operating segments that are exhibiting declining trends: Subscription Video Services (revenue down 1%, EBITDA down 11%) and News Media segment (revenue down 4%, EBITDA down 23%). In the Subscription Video Services segment, higher costs related to Hubbl's launch and escalated sports programming rights expenses, resulting from contractual rate increases, contributed to the decline in profitability. The news media businesses face ongoing print challenges and transition to digital platforms, particularly in the News Corp Australia division.

The increase in NWSA stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 25% in 2021, -18% in 2022, and 36% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NWSA face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Going forward, NWSA expects higher costs due to the supply chain and inflationary pressures. Advertising conditions and visibility remain limited across businesses. Looking at each of the segments, Australian residential new buy listings for July grew 12% as it lapped tougher prior-year comparisons at Digital Real Estate Services. REA's fiscal 2025 prospects have been bolstered by the successful implementation of a 10% price increase for Premier Plus. The company's y-o-y growth trajectory is anticipated to benefit from strong prior-year listing volumes, driven primarily by the Melbourne and Sydney markets. At Dow Jones, the segment is expected to benefit from stronger growth in B2B revenues with the rate of expenses to be moderately higher due to investment in upselling and new products.

How Mining For National Security Will Help Salmon In Central Idaho,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/10/04/how-mining-for-national-security-will-help-salmon-in-central-idaho/,2024-10-04T10:39:43Z,"Thanks to record gold prices, Laurel Sayers and Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of back country salmon streams.

ow frustrating to be a Chinook salmon. You exit the Pacific Ocean into the Columbia River, then migrate up the Snake River to the Salmon River, where hundreds of miles from the ocean in central Idaho you finally reach your ancestral stream, the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River - only for the journey to end in an abandoned mine pit called the ""Glory Hole,"" where your path upstream is blocked by a million tons of mine tailings leaching a ton of arsenic a year into your river.

During World War II the Stibnite mine near Yellow Pine, Idaho (pop: 32) produced 50% of the tungsten and 90% of the antimony vital to the war effort. Antimony, a soft, shiny metalloid, is used in explosives, ammunition and now in semiconductors, solar panels and night vision gear. Mine operators back in the day weren't too worried about the plight of migrating salmon or even the gold ore they produced, much of which they left behind in tailings piles.

After being mothballed in 1997, the site became somewhat of an obsession for geologists and entrepreneurs who recognized how much valuable ore remained. ""We didn't make this mess, but we are willing to be part of the solution,"" says Laurel Sayer, CEO of publicly traded Perpetua Resources Idaho (market cap $600 million) who was working as a conservationist, running the Idaho Land Trust a decade ago when she learned about the Stibnite mine and caught the bug. ""I was so drawn to the opportunity to marry the responsible production of gold and antimony and leave it better than it is today."" (Stibnite is the mineral form of the element antimony, often found in ore containing gold.)

Why care so much? The mine, in the Payette National Forest, could not be in a more remote or rugged location. But its contents are unique to North America, and uniquely vital for national security. That's because in recent decades China has cornered the antimony market, controlling some 90% of global supplies with mines in China and Tajikistan.

""When we don't control the resource, they can manipulate the price,"" says Sayer, 67. In the eight years since she started guiding Perpetua (formerly Midas Gold) through the federal permitting process, antimony prices have nearly doubled - to a record $22,000 a ton after China's announcement in August that it would restrict exports. It was already evident that the U.S. was in vital need of diversifying supply; now getting access to 75,000 tons of antimony reserves at the mine has become a low-key emergency.

But although the U.S. Department of Defense is a big backer of Perpetua's efforts, with $70 million in grants so far, not even the Pentagon can simply order the mine reopened. For eight years Perpetua has labored under the auspices of the National Environmental Policy Act to detail how its new mining operation would clean up the mess of the old one.

Sayers relied on her background working on Capitol Hill to acquire the adequate ""social license"", mostly by utilizing the good neighbor approach. ""In developing the plan we worked backwards,"" she says. ""What do we want it to look like and what do we have to do to get there?"" The vision involved 450 acres of restored wetlands, forests replanted with 65,000 trees and 20 miles of stream reopened to the salmon.

In 2020 the Forest Service released a draft environmental statement for the project, which inspired more than 8,000 public comments, inspiring Perpetua to re-engineer for lower arsenic levels and cooler salmon-friendly temperatures in the river. That led to a supplemental environmental statement in 2022, and another couple years of comments and reconsiderations. This September, Perpetua celebrated receipt of a final environmental statement.

Meanwhile, a year ago the Nez Perce tribe settled its Clean Water Act lawsuit against Perpetua for $5 million in payments. And even before receiving official greenlights (expected by yearend) Perpetua has spent $17 million on conservation work, including moving 325,000 tons of old mine tailings away from waterways.

Naturally, groups like the Save The South Fork Salmon still object to any plan involving open pits and cyanide-based ore leaching. But it's unlikely now for any heckler's veto to block a Pentagon pet project. ""I'm a mom of a veteran soldier in Iraq,"" says Sayer. ""I know what it means to have our soldiers prepared.""

Another force propelling Perpetua is the surge in the price of gold since the pandemic. Even at a record $2,660 per ounce, demand is strong. Costco, which sells 1 oz gold bars via its website, reports that customers have been buying the bars at a rate of $100 million per month. ""Antimony is the enabler, but gold drives the economics,""says Saylor. Over the 15 year initial life of the mine, Perpetua expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits. For goldbugs, this makes Perpetua an alluring long-term, out-of-the-money option on the yellow metal, with a lot more appreciation potential than buying shares in a physical gold ETF, or top miners like Barrick Gold or Franco-Nevada.

Investing in micro-cap Perpetua is not risk-free. Its stock has tripled since February to more than $9, but it has been extremely volatile. From its peak at $15 in August 2020, it fell to under $2 by the end of October 2022. The company has posted cumulative losses of $600 million going back more than a decade, with $400 million spent just getting through the eight-year-long NEPA process. Despite an annual cash-burn of about $20 million, Perpetua has just $10 million in long-term debts. To build out the mine, Perpetua has tapped RBC Capital Markets and Endeavor Financial to arrange financing and is already eyeing a potential $1.8 billion in loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Tax credits for critical materials enshrined in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act promise to offset 10% of antimony production costs.

There's naturally some execution risk here. With the permitting phase nearly complete, Sayers has turned over the reins to new CEO John Cherry who previously ran PolyMet Mining after years at Rio Tinto. He'll oversee a construction phase featuring 650 workers who will be transported in for two-week work stints - like rig hands on a Gulf of Mexico oil platform.

Sayers says measuring success will be easy: ""All you have to do is to see the salmon come back and spawn again."""
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 4, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-04-24/,2024-10-04T10:36:58Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can park some cash? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are infamous for paying paltry interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you score a basic savings account with a rate in that general area, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Los Angeles' plan for a car-free 2028 Olympics is a costly pipe dream,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/los-angeless-plan-car-free-2028-olympics-costly-pipe-dream,2024-10-04T09:18:14Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Tom Cruise turned all Olympic eyes from Paris to Los Angeles this summer with his daring closing ceremony stunts. But those eyes had best now turn to the LA Olympic Organizing Committee and Mayor Karen Bass.

In only four short years, the Olympics come to LA, meaning Mayor Bass and the Olympic organizers have just four years to transform Los Angeles into a metropolis fit for the international attention brought by the Olympics. That seems like a big task for a city whose failed governance leaves it with rampant crime, homelessness, congestion, crumbling infrastructure, business and regulatory nightmares, and tax and budget shortfalls.

The LA solution: a ""car-free"" Olympics!

Personal vehicles will not be allowed at Olympic venues. Private parking will simply not be available. Don't even think about driving to an event. Bass and the LA Organizing Committee plan to spend over $900 million on a massive public transit overhaul.

LOS ANGELES KICKS OFF JOURNEY TO 2028 OLYMPICS IN STYLE

Called the ""Twenty-eight by '28 Project"" and initiated in January 2018 during the bidding process for the 2028 Olympics, it proposes 28 transit projects to facilitate the movement of more than one million anticipated visitors the Olympics will bring - all without cars.

How is the Twenty-eight by '28 Project going six years after being proposed and only four years out from the Games?

The answer is not well. I serve on the board of the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). We recently received a report from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority admitting that it will miss the '28 deadline for 10 of the 28 projects. Only five have so far been completed in the past six years of planning.

Bass does not let this diminish her enthusiasm for a car-free Games. She promises that LA will purchase or borrow and then deploy 3,000 buses. I can't imagine at what cost, both financial to Los Angeles, but also on other transportation agencies like OCTA and the people they serve around the country.

ANGEL REESE TRIES TO TAMP DOWN 2028 OLYMPIC EXPECTATIONS AFTER TEAM USA'S LATEST GOLD

That is a mammoth, market-warping diversion of resources - 3,000 buses - to just one city. Other places like Orange County can well expect to feel the pain caused by such a market disrupting force.

The car-free Olympics promise was never serious public policy. Southern California, for the foreseeable future, will remain dominated by personal vehicles. Just over 7.5 million registered motor vehicles exist in LA County, including cars, trucks and motorcycles. The city itself covers a vast 469 square miles, in a stark contrast to Paris's compact 41 square miles. This sprawling landscape complicates public transit use as residents often need to make multiple transfers to reach their destinations, diminishing the likelihood of opting for buses or trains.

Then there are the substantial safety concerns inherent in today's LA public transit system. The public worries rightly about personal safety while on the system. Just last week, in the early hours of Wednesday, Sept. 25, an LA Metro bus was hijacked by a gunman who held the driver at gunpoint, led the police on a pursuit, and murdered one of the passengers.

LOS ANGELES ALLEGEDLY PLANS TO SPEND $500K TO INSTALL OLYMPIC FLAGS AT CITY HALL

That level of dramatic violence is admittedly rare. But we do see persistent knife attacks, sexual assaults, homeless vagrant activity and other crimes on public transportation. This is the transit system to be foisted on visitors from all over the world to accomplish the vision of a car-free Olympics.

Given the city's deep-rooted car culture, the lack of public transit infrastructure, the long commutes that residents have come to accept as normal, and the sheer physical safety concerns, local residents will likely skip the Games rather than abandon their vehicles.

Public transportation cannot rise to the occasion, as the LA Metro report frankly admits, leaving a potentially miserable experience for out-of-town visitors and a very bad lasting image for Los Angeles and the Olympics organizers. At least Orange County had nothing to do with these bad decisions, even if we will feel some of the consequences.

A car-free Olympics was always an enviro-activist pipe dream. It sounded good to certain interest groups, but is nothing more than a liberal government's virtue signaling and self-deception.

The LA Metro report of missed targets throws the harsh light of reality on such wishful thinking. Delays, rising costs due to inflation, failures to meet deadlines and inefficient government bureaucracy can't deliver on the empty promises of politicians. A car-free Olympics, at least as sold when LA made its bid, is one of those empty promises."
Harris claims ad quoting her 2019 vow to ban fracking is 'mischaracterization' to make people 'afraid' of her,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-claims-ad-quoting-her-2019-vow-ban-fracking-mischaracterization-make-people-afraid-her,2024-10-03T23:33:00Z,"The 'Fox & Friends Weekend' hosts react to a resurfaced video of Kamala Harris saying she would 'put an end to fracking once and for all.'

Vice President Kamala Harris argued this week that an ad showing a clip of her past rhetoric about fracking is misleading and ""intended to make people afraid of my presidency.""

CBS Pittsburgh's Jon Delano spoke with Harris in an interview on Tuesday, challenging her to clarify her evolving stance on fracking, one of many key issues where she has been accused of flip-flopping for political gain.

""I wanted to ask you, there's a political ad on TV from a 2019 climate hall town meeting that you had, in which you basically said, quote, 'There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,' unquote,"" the interviewer said. ""The ad claims that if you are elected president you will ban fracking and you will cost Pennsylvania over 300,000 jobs. Have you changed your view on fracking, and if so, why?""

HARRIS DODGING FLIP-FLOP ATTACKS AS FACELESS SURROGATES FLIP KEY POSITIONS: 'PLAYING POLITICS'

""So let me start by saying that that ad, as you described it, is absolutely a mischaracterization, that I think is intended to make people afraid of my presidency,"" Harris said.

""Let me be absolutely clear, as I've been when I said it back in 2020, I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to open up more fracking leases,"" she added, referencing her role as vice president in getting the so-called Inflation Reduction Act through the deadlocked Senate.

In 2020, Harris was asked about fracking during her vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, but did not reveal a reversal of her stated 2019 opposition to fracking, instead simply saying that Biden would not ban fracking as president.

""Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that,"" Harris said.

""I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact,"" she added during another portion of the debate.

CNN FACT CHECKER HITS KAMALA HARRIS FOR CLAIMING SHE 'MADE CLEAR' IN 2020 SHE WOULDN'T BAN FRACKING

On Tuesday, Harris said, ""My perspective on this is grounded in a number of things, including that we don't have to ban fracking to do the work that we can do to also invest in a clean energy economy.""

She then made multiple promises to American voters.

""I'm going to bring jobs back to rural communities. I'm going to make sure that we invest in those communities that have done the kind of work that you have in mind when you talk about Pittsburgh, when you talk about the greater aspect of Pennsylvania,"" she pledged. ""And I'm going to keep doing that work.""

Oil Surges On Israel-Iran Tensions: OPEC+ Strategy Shifts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2024/10/03/oil-surges-on-israel-iran-tensions-opec-strategy-shifts/,2024-10-03T21:42:38Z,"In the span of 24 hours, President Biden met to discuss an Israeli attack on Iranian facilities causing oil prices to surge while the Saudi oil minister has said prices could drop to as low as $50 per barrel if so-called cheaters within OPEC+ don't stick to agreed-upon production limits, according to delegates in the cartel. Benchmark U.S. crude saw its largest one-day gain in a year, jumping 5.1% to $73.71. The news also impacted U.S. stock indexes negatively. The Saudi oil minister's remarks were interpreted by other producers as a veiled threat that the kingdom is willing to launch a price war to keep its market share if other countries don't abide by the group's agreements.

This stark juxtaposition of geopolitical tensions and internal OPEC+ dynamics underscores the complex forces at play in the global oil market. As the threat of conflict pushes prices up, internal disagreements within OPEC+ threaten to pull them down, creating a volatile environment for oil prices. Daniel Yergin, the legendary authority on energy, geopolitics and the global economy, has consistently shared insights about oil prices. He notes, ""Energy is a strategic commodity, and those who control its production and distribution wield considerable power"" and ""If a war started, the oil price probably would go up until you saw other oil from the extra supplies that are available elsewhere coming into the world, into the market.""

As tensions escalate in the Middle East, with Israel retaliating against Iran's recent launch of 200 missiles (most of which were intercepted or landed in unoccupied areas), the global oil market finds itself on edge. The potential for conflict in this volatile region raises concerns about disruptions to the world's oil supply, with implications that extend far beyond the immediate participants. Iran, a key player in this unfolding drama, contributes significantly to the global oil market. Producing approximately 3.99 million barrels per day, Iran accounts for about 4% of the world's oil supply.

Any disruption to this output could have immediate and far-reaching consequences for global energy markets. Iran's smuggling network is sophisticated; the country's petroleum business is run by the National Iran Oil Company (NIOC), a state monopoly. Its main customer is China -- not the country's large, state-owned firms, which are exposed to Western sanctions, but ""teapot refineries"" that snap up 95% of Iranian supplies. However, the concerns don't stop at Iran's borders. The fear of a wider regional conflict looms large, potentially impacting other major oil-producing nations in the area. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer, contributes a staggering 11% to global supply. Iraq and the United Arab Emirates each account for 4%, while Kuwait adds another 3%. Collectively, these Middle Eastern nations form the backbone of global oil production.

The interconnected nature of the global oil market means that disruptions in one area can quickly ripple across the entire industry. The potential for price volatility extends beyond the immediate term. If a conflict were to escalate and impact multiple producing countries, the effect on oil prices could be much more dramatic. Historical precedents, such as the 1973 oil crisis, serve as stark reminders of how geopolitical events in the Middle East can send shockwaves through the global economy. Furthermore, as Yergin points out, higher prices tend to incentivize increased production from other sources. This market response can help to balance supply and demand over time, though the process is neither immediate nor without its own complexities.

The impact of oil price fluctuations extends far beyond the energy sector. Transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer goods prices are all influenced by the cost of oil. Central banks and policymakers watch oil prices closely, as significant increases can contribute to inflationary pressures and impact economic growth. For oil-importing nations, particularly in the developing world, sustained high oil prices can pose significant challenges to economic stability and growth. Conversely, for oil-exporting countries, including those in the Middle East, higher prices can boost government revenues but may also intensify regional tensions.

For investors looking to capitalize on potential oil price increases, especially if further hostilities break out in the Middle East with direct conflict involving producing nations, two stocks stand out as potentially beneficial: Exxon (ticker: XOM) and Imperial Oil (ticker: IMO). Both of these companies are poised to benefit from higher oil prices and have less exposure to activities in the region than major oil producers operating directly in the Middle East. However, as with all investments, thorough research and consideration of one's individual financial situation and risk tolerance is advised before making any investment decisions."
"Voters in critical Michigan county focused on economy, candidate character as 2024 race tightens",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-critical-michigan-county-focused-economy-candidate-character-2024-race-tightens,2024-10-03T18:04:18Z,"Voters in Kent County, Michigan, a swing county in one of the most critical swing states, told Fox News Digital about the issues weighing on their mind and whom they support in the upcoming election.

Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins November's presidential election, but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.

""I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don't think that's right,"" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.

The comments come as Kent County, which includes Michigan's second-largest city of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November.

While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state's population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Barack Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while former President Donald Trump took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.

This year's race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.

""Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn't bring us into any wars,"" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris' ""stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.""

Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.

""People having the rights to be in our country and the rights to health care,"" said0 the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

""Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,"" he added. ""Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.""

However, another voter disagreed on the economy, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.

""I believe that a person who has run a company, that's been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,"" the voter said.

That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.

""I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,"" he said. ""I think other world leaders took note of that.""

Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.

""One candidate gets it and the other doesn't,"" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.

""She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don't think Trump understands that,"" the voter continued.

Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.

""One day I'll go one way and another day I'll go another way,"" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.

""It's hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,"" she said on Harris, while also noting that he finds it ""very hard to believe"" that someone as rich as Trump "" could care about people that don't have any money.""

The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the ""tone of his voice.""

""The name calling, I don't particularly care for that,"" the voter said."
Gold's Ascent: Why The Bull Market Is Just Getting Started,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobhaber/2024/10/03/golds-ascent-why-the-bull-market-is-just-getting-started/,2024-10-03T17:51:26Z,"In April, I published an article titled The Gold Investing Madness Is Just Getting Started. At that time, gold had broken out of a four-year trading range, reaching an all-time high of around $2,200 per ounce, coinciding with the excitement of college basketball's March Madness. This surge was fueled by foreign central banks buying gold at an unprecedented rate to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. Despite these developments, the Federal Reserve had yet to cut interest rates, the dollar remained strong, and U.S. investors continued selling off their gold ETFs. Given this combination of factors, I believed the ""madness"" was just beginning and that shifts these macro-economic conditions could quickly turn in gold's favor.

Fast forward to today, and gold is trading at around $2,650 per ounce -- a more than 20% increase! What has fueled this next leg higher? The same catalyst that originally broke gold out: foreign central bank buying, which remains robust and perhaps even understated. Additionally, two of the three previous headwinds have now become tailwinds: the Federal Reserve has begun cutting interest rates, and the dollar has started to weaken. Let's dive into each of these factors in more detail.

On the central bank front, the first half of 2024 saw another period of record demand from foreign buyers (source: World Gold Council). This buying has been driven by both adversarial countries like China and Russia, as well as allied nations such as Poland. The National Bank of Poland was the largest buyer in Q2, with gold now comprising 13% of their total reserves. The Reserve Bank of India has added gold every month in 2024, with year-to-date purchases totaling 37 tons -- surpassing their annual totals for both 2022 and 2023. According to BofA Securities, gold is now the second-largest reserve asset globally (16.1% of reserves, compared to the Euro at 15.6%), following the U.S. dollar.

While this activity is impressive, there is reason to believe that much more is on the horizon -- or possibly going unreported. China, previously the largest foreign buyer of gold, paused its purchases in May 2024, with gold still accounting for only 4.9% of the People's Bank of China's total reserves. Even more intriguing are recent reports suggesting that Saudi Arabia has been secretly buying gold in Switzerland. Since early 2022, it is believed that Saudi Arabia has purchased 160 tons of gold. Notably, the Saudi central bank last updated its official gold reserves in 2008, when it held 332 tons of gold. Anecdotes like these make it hard to believe that central bank gold purchasing is anywhere near its end, or that we fully understand the extent of what is happening behind the scenes. With potential underreporting and continued interest from both friendly and adversarial nations, the scope of central bank demand for gold may be far greater than currently recognized.

New tailwinds to the gold thesis include Federal Reserve rate cuts. On Wednesday, September 18th, the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points, an action front run by the market as 2-year interest rates had already dropped from 5% to 3.5% between May and September. It's important to note that the Fed has effectively declared victory over inflation, even though it remains well above the 2% target. At Proficio, we subscribe to some of the top inflation forecasters, many of whom predict inflation could make a run back towards 4%. A Fed cutting interest rates while inflation stays elevated will result in suppressed long-term real rates (interest rates minus inflation), creating a bullish environment for a non-yielding asset like gold.

Another key catalyst driving gold higher has been the significant weakening of the U.S. dollar, a topic I recently covered in an article titled America's Currency Crisis: Declining Global Confidence In The Dollar. To summarize, the U.S. continues to run a growing budget deficit, now approaching $1.9 trillion, alongside an enormous national debt exceeding $35 trillion. Additionally, the U.S. has maintained a trade deficit for over five decades. Combined with escalating geopolitical tensions, these factors have motivated BRICS+ nations to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. What is the perfect alternative, untethered to any country's debt? Gold.

I believe the three catalysts I've highlighted -- central bank buying, Fed interest rate cuts, and a weak dollar -- are all still in their early innings. However, one major catalyst has yet to materialize: retail participation through U.S. ETF gold buying. Despite gold having a market cap of over $17 trillion, sitting at all-time highs, and being uncorrelated with stocks and bonds, it has garnered little attention. A study by State Street Global Advisors and the World Gold Council in Q4 2023 found that a third of financial advisors in North America allocate less than 1% of assets under management (AUM) to gold, while 56% allocate between 1% and 4.9%. As my followers know, my research this year has recommended portfolios hold more than 20% in gold. When retail and institutional investors eventually enter the market -- and I believe they will -- my next article might just be titled ""The Gold Madness is MADNESS.""

Buyers beware: October is typically a challenging month for gold, historically speaking. Since 1968, gold has posted only a slightly positive average return during the month, with a median return in the negative. Add to that the upcoming election and excessive optimism around rate cuts already priced in, and it's possible we could see moments of weakness in gold. In my view, these dips should be seen as opportunities -- stay disciplined and accumulate your gold exposure. Gold bull markets are structural by nature, and we're likely in it for the long haul. As I said back in April, play along -- these are exciting times."
How Americans Think The Election Will Impact Their Personal Finances,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/presidential-election-personal-finance-impact/,2024-10-03T16:32:49Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The economy is the top issue on the minds of voters heading into the 2024 presidential election, and Americans are divided on which candidate will improve their personal finances, according to a Forbes Advisor and Talker Research survey of 2,000 registered voters. Of these, 48% were Democrats, 39% were Republicans and 10% were independents.

For instance, 48% of respondents said Vice President Kamala Harris would deliver a better economy compared to 44% for former President Donald Trump.

However, 52% said their personal finances were healthier four years ago, when Trump was in office, compared to less than a quarter who said they're doing better now during the Biden Administration.

Voters want the eventual winner to focus on bringing down prices; 60% cited inflation as the top priority for the next administration.

A look at the topline figures paint a positive picture of the public's appetite for a potential Harris Administration.

Nearly half (48%) of respondents said the economy would improve under her presidency, compared to 36% who said it would worsen. Another 16% said it wouldn't change.

Meanwhile, 44% said that a Trump Administration would bode well for the nation's economic future, while 42% believed the economy would suffer. A seventh (14%) replied that the economy wouldn't change much in a second Trump Administration.

But when you drill down on the specific issues that affect personal finances, including borrowing costs and the stock market, Americans seemed to have a better appreciation for a Trump victory.

More than half of respondents (52%) said their finances are worse than four years ago, compared to just 23% who think they're better off. Another 20% said they were about the same, while another 5% weren't sure.

Republicans (70%) and independents (65%) were far more likely to think they're finances have gotten worse over the past four years than Democrats (35%).

This finding jibes with a series of data points and sentiment surveys.

For instance, median household income adjusted for inflation was higher in 2019 ($81,210) than in 2023 ($80,610), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Just 31% of Americans believe the economy is getting better, according to Gallup, which is down from 51% at the end of 2019.

High prices continue to plague the American consumer.

Even as the rate of inflation has come down, prices are still growing much faster than the Fed's preferred target of 2%.

The personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out volatile food and energy prices, which is the Fed's preferred gauge, rose by 2.7% in August over the previous 12 months.

That's why 60% respondents in our survey think that easing the cost of living should be the top priority of a future Harris or Trump administration.

The next most important issues, lowering income taxes and creating more jobs, were each selected by just 10% of respondents.

Those results dovetail with what Americans say is impacting their decision this November.When asked to name the two biggest economic issues in the election, nearly three-quarters (74%) identified inflation. The second most popular response was healthcare expenses at just 33%.

This is a bipartisan issue: 79% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats selected inflation as one of their biggest concerns.

Americans are likely taking their vote seriously since 68% of respondents either somewhat or strongly agree that the president has a tangible impact on their financial situation.

Meanwhile, 54% think macroeconomic events, such as inflation or stock market performance, have the biggest impact on their financial health, compared to just 20% who say their personal choices are more important.

That makes sense given the massive events American consumers have faced over the past four years, from pandemic-era business and school closures to stimulus checks to sky-high inflation.

While folks believe that the outcome of the election will impact their personal finances, few will wait for a winner before making financial decisions.

In 2016, while President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was finishing his final year in office, those with a Democratic party identification were optimistic about the economy (+18), according to Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, while Republicans were gloomy (-31).

In 2017, when Obama was replaced by Trump, a Republican, the two sides flipped. Republicans (+46) were now ecstatic, while Democrats (-20) were miserable.

Independents were even-keeled throughout.

Obviously, these voters were viewing events through their partisan lens; people's fortunes didn't radically shift overnight.

This can have real consequences.

A Democratic voter who believed Trump would bring a market collapse missed out on years of stock market gains, for instance.

While your political passions may run hot, don't let them influence how you operate your personal budget.

Of course, big events impact your personal finances. Anyone who has lived through the past four years may have seen wild fluctuations in the value of their home, the interest rate on their high-yield savings account or the annual percentage rate (APR) on their credit card.

Where you run into trouble, though, is believing that these events have a bigger impact on your financial health than your own actions.

Research shows that financial self-efficacy, which is the belief that you're in control of your fate, is key to financial success.

Yes, big stuff happens. But big stuff always happens. The 2000s, for instance, were bookended by two recessions that led to a lost decade for stocks and a housing bubble burst.

You can thrive by learning how to navigate rough waters.

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Moreno hits Brown on Inflation Reduction Act vote in ad that's part of $25M buy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-gop-senate-candidate-moreno-hits-brown-inflation-reduction-act-vote-ad-thats-part-25m-buy,2024-10-03T16:19:51Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno is hitting incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

NRA TARGETS SEN SHERROD BROWN IN 7-FIGURE AD BUY IN OHIO: 'VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT'

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

The bureau said the index for all items, less food and energy, advanced 3.2% over the year, while food prices increased 1.8%. Energy prices declined 2.6%, ""largely the result of decreasing prices for gasoline,"" it added."

After Hurricane Helene devastated much of the southeastern U.S., survivors of the wreckage wrought by the storm are grappling with another issue: How to pay for goods and services. Across much of the region, particularly in the hardest hit areas, credit card networks have been disabled in tandem with power and internet outages. Merchants who managed to open their doors were sometimes demanding that customers use cash only because of an inability to process credit or debit card transactions. [Payments Dive]

The Buying Power of Your Credit Card Points Is Tanking

Inflation is eroding the value of credit card points that are converted to dollars, losing about 20% of their purchasing power since 2018.

Experts recommend redeeming points soon after earning them to avoid ""pointsflation"" and suggest using cards with easily transferable points to get the best deals. [The Wall Street Journal]

U.S. Senator Warren Asks Regulator to Impose Growth Curbs on Citi

A prominent Democratic U.S. senator called on a top regulator on Wednesday to impose growth restrictions on Citigroup as the Wall Street bank struggles to fix ongoing regulatory problems. In a letter to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Citi's years-long struggle to fix data, controls and other management problems show it has become ""too big to manage"" and should be curtailed. A prominent bank critic who has previously taken aim at Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and others, Warren cannot force Hsu to take action but her letter can still put pressure on him to be tough on Citi, and draws more attention to the bank's problems.

Mastercard to Buy Swedish Startup That Makes It Easier to Manage and Cancel Subscription Plans

Mastercard said it's agreed to acquire Minna Technologies, a software firm that makes it easier for consumers to manage their subscriptions. The move comes as Mastercard and its primary payment network rival Visa are rapidly attempting to expand beyond their core credit and debit card businesses into technology services, such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and pay-by-bank payments. The payments giant said that the deal, along with other initiatives it's committed to around subscriptions, will allow it to give consumers a way to access all their subscriptions in a single view, whether inside your banking app or a central ""hub.""

UK Banks to Put Four-Day Hold on Suspicious Payments

UK Banks will have the power to pause payments for up to four days to give them more time to investigate fraud, the government has said. Currently, transfers must be processed or declined by the end of the next business day, but the new law will allow an extension of three more days. For years, banks have needed to have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud before being able to investigate but have also faced pressure from customers who want payments to be made instantly. The long-proposed new regulations will come into force at the end of October, later than originally planned. [BBC]

E-payments Are Essential in China, But Still Tricky for Foreign Visitors

China's digital economy has been evolving at a faster pace since the pandemic. Daily tasks like calling a cab or ordering and paying at a restaurant are all done mostly through Alipay and WeChat. According to the Chinese central bank, in 2023 there were 340 trillion yuan ($48 trillion) worth of third-party online payments. Alipay and WeChat make up over 90% of mobile payments. However, it has not been easy for foreigners to sign up for the payment apps. To attract more foreign visitors, cities like Shanghai, aided by the country's central bank, have pushed to make mobile payments more visitor-friendly. Foreigners residing in China must provide passport details and a scan of their passport information page. [Marketplace]

Average Cost of Credit Card Processing Fees

You can give your customers more payment options by accepting credit cards, but you will pay a credit card processing fee to do this. The average credit card processing fee, which will be taken out of a merchant's sales revenue, is in the range of about 1.5% to 3.5%. Merchants can negotiate their card processing fees, and they are not set in stone. [Bankrate]

Baby Boomers Still Have the Highest Credit Limits

A recent Experian survey found that baby boomers have an average credit limit of $41,906, up nearly 4% from the year before and more than three-times the average for Generation Z ($12,899). While it's tempting to be jealous of other people's financial positions, there are some good reasons why baby boomers outpace everyone else with their credit limits. For one, boomers have decades-long credit histories. Lenders love long credit histories, and those who've paid their bills on time have likely earned higher limits. Second, baby boomers generally have a higher credit score than most generations, with an average score of 743. [The Motley Fool]

More than 1 in 3 Americans have lost money with a gift card misstep. The data shows that 55 percent of households with annual incomes of $100,000+ have at least one unused gift card, more than any other income bracket. The average amount of unused gift cards for this income bracket is $348. This contrasts sharply with households making under $50,000 annually. Just 35 percent of them have unused gift cards with an average value of $180. [Bankrate]

Strategic Leasing Is Driving The Future Of Luxury Retail,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/naveenjaggi/2024/10/03/strategic-leasing-is-driving-the-future-of-luxury-retail/,2024-10-03T16:10:54Z,"When it comes to luxury retail, location matters more than ever. From prime corridors like New York's Madison Avenue to the Beverly Hills Triangle, to Class A malls, luxury is back and it's bigger than ever. U.S. luxury sales reached over $75 billion in 2023 -- an 8.9% increase from the previous year, according to the latest JLL Luxury Report. Top-tier brands are claiming their spots and transforming the future of the retail landscape.

But in a market where space is scarce and competition is fierce, what sets one location apart from another? And how can property owners attract and retain these high-end tenants?

Creating spaces that keep luxury stores in place demands a strategic approach to leasing that mirrors the level of high-end service luxury retailers use to meet their own clients' needs. Here's how developers and owners can attract and retain luxury brands by offering targeted leasing strategies that enhance the brand experience and maximize property value.

Inventing a luxury destination, regardless of the location

Despite inflationary pressures, the U.S. luxury market saw significant expansion, with luxury brands leasing over 360,000 square feet of retail space between July 2023 and July 2024.

Nearly half of these new luxury stores opened in high-end malls, and almost a third of new leases exceeded 4,000 square feet. This includes Gucci, which expanded to a 17,500 sq ft boutique in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza, doubling the floor space across two floors. Cartier, Bulgari and Van Cleef & Arpels followed suit, signaling luxury's shift toward larger, more immersive spaces.

Street retail, in particular, accounted for 40.9% of new luxury openings during this time, with nearly 68% in prime corridors. This included Valentino's large opening of a 25,000 sq ft location on New York's Madison Avenue, and Saks Fifth Avenue's 130,000 sq ft opening in the Beverly Hills Triangle.

Seeing these trends, it is important for property owners to position their properties as a luxury destination, separate from mass market stores. Exclusive addresses, separate ""luxury wings"" in upscale malls and other exclusive zones within shopping centers all help signal these brands stand for quality and prestige that can't be found at a lower price point -- or at any other location.

Finding space to expand their footprints

While e-commerce's share of total retail sales has risen to 16% in Q2 2024, it remains below the pandemic high of 16.4% in Q2 2020 - a clear indication that physical stores are central in the consumer shopping experience, as over 80% of retail sales still occur in stores.

Luxury brands recognize the opportunity and are looking to expand their footprints by creating flagship stores that offer unique, elevated customer experiences among similar brands. First-to-market luxury brands like Serapian, Johanna Ortiz and Del Core chose to open flagships on New York's Madison Avenue, with notable openings.

Still, as the demand for prime space has surged, space remains limited. Malls offer a distinct advantage in this area, as even in saturated markets, property owners can relocate smaller tenants to make room for a luxury brand to build out its flagship in prime areas.

Catering to the next generation of luxury shoppers

Retail leasing strategies must also consider the evolving preferences of Gen Z and younger consumers, who are set to account for 70% of global luxury spending by 2030. As Gen Z and younger consumers gear up to dominate luxury spending, retailers and property owners need to evolve. More diverse and digitally savvy than previous generations, this younger demographic isn't just looking for products -- they want exclusivity, personalization, and unique experiences.

The key is understanding these shifting consumer preferences, then identifying and designing spaces to meet them, bridging form and function. For example, property owners can harness the power of their property managers to help their luxury tenants offer pop-up or influencer-driven experiences to engage and create a sense of exclusivity, cultural relevance, and luxury. Malls and luxury shopping centers can subsequently establish creative leasing and merchandizing solutions to help their luxury tenants reach this formable demographic.

Positioning properties for long-term success

Luxury retail is showing no signs of slowing down, and with the right leasing strategies, property owners can capitalize on this growth. Developers and landlords should look to attract high-end tenants, reposition existing spaces, and create experiences that appeal to today's luxury consumers and keep them engaged.

Whether it's expanding a flagship store or merging hospitality with retail, taking a strategic approach will ensure the long-term value of an asset and position a brand as a top destination within an increasingly competitive luxury market."
Signet Jewelers' CEO Gina Drosos Passes Torch To Ex-PetSmart CEO J.K. Symancyk,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/10/03/signet-jewelers-ceo-gina-drosos-passes-torch-to-ex-petsmart-ceo-jk-symancyk/,2024-10-03T15:26:38Z,"Signet Jewelers of Kay Jewelers, Zales, Jared, Banter by Piercing Pagoda, Blue Nile, Diamonds Direct and James Allen fame just announced that CEO Gina Drosos will retire on November 4, after serving the company on the board for 12 years, including seven as CEO.

PetSmart CEO J.K. Symancyk will fill her very capable shoes at Signet, as it executes a carefully planned leadership succession strategy.

However, PetSmart was caught unawares when Symancyk announced his leaving a day before Signet made its announcement. Now the company's chief executive vice president and chief financial officer Alan Schnaid will serve as interim CEO until a successor is found.

For Symancyk, it will be a major step up in responsibilities, going from overseeing 1,700 pet stores, including 200 in-store PetsHotels boarding facilities as well as a range of pet services to managing Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry with some 2,700 stores under 11 brand banners.

He will also be moving from a private to a public company, though he served two years prior to joining PetSmart in 2018 as CEO of Academy Sports + Outdoors.

And he will be entering an entirely new retail vertical, though he's done that before, going from president of grocery chain Meijer to sporting goods then onto pets.

""I am honored to join Signet as its next CEO and continue advancing the strategy that Gina and the team have established,"" Symancyk said in a statement.

""I am passionate about serving customers and I recognize the emotional connection of Signet's customers when they are making a jewelry purchase. One of the key attributes that drew me to Signet is its purpose-driven and agile culture and focus on putting its team members and customers first,"" he continued.

For Drosos, it will be a bittersweet parting from a company she did so much for and that did so much for her.

""It's always a good thing to go out on a high,"" she shared with me. ""It's not a sudden departure, by any stretch. I've been talking with the board of directors for more than a year to get the timing right and allowing for plenty of time to find a successor. The whole governance around this has been spot on, just the way a good company should do it.""

Drosos has racked up any number of accomplishments under her ""Inspiring Brilliance"" plan, including:

But perhaps Drosos is most proud of the corporate culture she helped build at Signet, including being named by Forbes as one of its ""Best Employers for Women"" and ""Best Employers for Diversity.""

""We've built one of the strongest teams in retail. It's one of innovation, agility, with a results orientation and strong purpose,"" she said adding that critical to the succession plan was finding a leader who would preserve and further build the corporate culture.

""J.K. comes into an environment that will be very welcoming to him, that will stand beside him, learn from him in the areas he knows and also be able to give him the opportunity to learn in areas that are new to him,"" she said.

Symancyk will get a crash course in jewelry retail over the holiday period, by far Signet's prime selling season and Drosos will lend a guiding hand during the transition period through the end of the fiscal year in early February.

Current president Jamie Singleton will continue to manage the company's biggest banners including Kay, Zales, Peoples and Banter by Piercing Pagoda.

Plus with Drosos' retirement, CFO Joan Hilson will take on an expanded role as both chief financial and operating officer, overseeing the supply chain and Signet's digital Blue Nile and James Allen banners, along with her continued responsibilities over Rocksbox, finance, strategy, real estate and the Signet services business, which is expected to contribute over $1 billion to the company in the future.

Through the course of Signet's extended succession planning, it believes it's found the right successor to Drosos to keep the company on its forward course, though Drosos said ""Change is a great accelerator,"" suggesting that Signet is likely to pick up steam in the years ahead.

Regarding Symancyk's appointment, Helen McCluskey, chairperson of Signet's board of directors added in a statement:

""He is a strong leader with more than three decades of experience across the retail industry and proven expertise in driving strategic growth, focusing on the customer, and developing and sustaining high performing leadership teams that deliver results.

""J.K. has overseen the expansion of large-scale businesses with multi-branded portfolios as well as services businesses, and brings important merchandising and operational skills to the role.""

Now PetSmart is in the unenviable position of replacing Symancyk, which will likely take an extended time. While CEO turnover reached an all-time high last year, up from 1,261 CEO exits in 2022 to 1,450 in 2023, according to outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, churn at the CEO level is not necessarily a good thing.

""Long-time and older leaders appear to be stepping down during this period, something we haven't seen since the pandemic,"" the firm's Andrew Challenger said.

Notably, both Drosos and Symancyk reached the nearly seven year tenure mark for outgoing retail CEOs, based on Korn Ferry's analysis. And PetSmart's primary competitor, Petco scooped up Joel Anderson as CEO after he abruptly vacated his CEO role at Five Below earlier this summer.

Given the current headwinds in retail, bruised by rising inflation and declining consumer confidence, plus a pending supply chain crisis from the longshoremen's strike, escalating geopolitical conflicts, the divisive upcoming election and all-round economic uncertainty, promising CEO candidates are likely to stay put in their current jobs. Or, if they've walked away from a previous position, they may be inclined to remain on the side lines until the present uncertainty clears."
"Biden will 'wreck' US economy by failing to intervene in dockworkers' port strike, GOP leader warns",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-wreck-u-s-economy-failing-intervene-dockworkers-port-strike-gop-leader-warns,2024-10-03T15:26:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., slammed President Biden for failing to intervene in the dockworkers' port strike, expressing concern over the impact it will have on American families who are already struggling with crippling inflation.

Scalise accused Biden of potentially allowing the strike to ""wreck"" the U.S. economy during ""Fox & Friends,"" arguing that consumers will struggle even more with rising costs as the International Longshoremen's Association's (ILA) strike drags on.

PORT STRIKE WILL BRING ANOTHER HIT TO FARMERS, SAYS FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL

""The president said we're just going to let it go on and wreck the economy,"" Scalise told Lawrence Jones. ""We're losing over $5 billion a day and costs are going to start going up even higher on families who are already struggling under the Biden-Harris inflation economy. Food on the shelves is going to become more scarce.""

Although Biden could invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act to intervene in the strike, he has insisted against taking action. Under that law, Biden could enact an 80-day ""cooling off"" period for negotiations to resume while workers are back at work.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 dockworkers, began its first strike since 1977 after its six-year contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents port employers, expired Monday night.

The 36 ports impacted by the strike on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

Negotiations between the ILA and USMX have been deadlocked thus far over the union's demands related to wage hikes and compensation, as well as protection from automation at ports.

Scalise argued that Congress would not support a ban on automation despite demands from the ILA.

""When we're competing globally, we're not just competing one city against another,"" he said. ""You've got ports all around the world that are heavily automated, and they still have humans, by the way, who actually run the devices. These automated devices aren't running themselves, but they're already making with overtime over $200,000 a year, in some cases, and they want to shut the economy down to get more.""

THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT: WHY BIDEN COULD USE THIS LABOR TO PREEMPT A PORT STRIKE

""Who pays for this? And this will add even more to inflation,"" he continued. ""There are a lot of families making 50,000 a year that are saying please stop adding to the costs, and Biden and Harris won't do anything because they want to see those prices keep going.""

Meanwhile, the president has faced fierce scrutiny for spending numerous days at the beach while the nation faces implications of the strike along with various other crises - the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and surging violence in the Middle East.

""We see Joe Biden on the beach. He comes to the White House whenever he wants to,"" Jones said. ""Kamala Harris is on the campaign trail. The Cabinet members are just on the Sunday shows as allies of Kamala Harris. You're in leadership of our government, but who's running the country right now?""

""It's a really scary thought,"" Scalise responded. ""When you look at some of the bills we passed, we passed bills to secure the southern border. Joe Biden came out, said he's against it. Kamala Harris said she's against it. We have bills to produce our own American energy, so we don't need to give Iran and Russia billions of dollars a month. President Biden and Kamala Harris oppose that, so... you see a clear divide. The country is going to speak really loudly on this.""

""I think JD Vance said it best at the debate the other night,"" he continued. ""Kamala Harris talks about what you do on the first day. Kamala Harris's first day was 1,400 days ago, and look at the results. The world's on fire. Americans can't drive to go to the grocery store, let alone put food on the table."""

For years she has been enamored with the FedEx Corp (FDX) logo. Neither her sister nor her parents are sure why, but the affinity is real. See a truck on the road, yell ""FedEx!"" loudly to score the point.

I didn't have the heart to tell her that FedEx disappointed investors with a sanguine outlook a couple of weeks ago. The stock corrected lower, as usually does after earnings.

(Seriously, the best time to buy FedEx lately has been right after the company talks to Wall Street and the suits sell their shares. They rally in between earnings calls.)

FedEx is the type of stock I always watch, waiting for a pullback. It directly benefits from a megatrend, a bull market in e-commerce sales. E-commerce as a percentage of retail sales gained for two decades and then spiked in 2020. After a brief respite, e-comm sales are heading to new all-time highs:

FedEx is increasingly fulfilling e-comm shipments. My in-house FedEx fan recently received her brand-new rainbow basketball via her favorite courier via my order from DICK's Sporting Goods (DKS).

Instead, FedEx got the call and this beautiful roundball -- sans air -- was shoved into a shoebox.

FedEx may be delivering even more rainbow basketballs shoved into shoeboxes thanks to an accommodative Fed. Chair Jay Powell spent the last two years focusing solely on the Fed's key mandate: stable prices. Now, he needs to make an about-face and hit the second mandate -- labor. So long, inflation concerns and hello, accommodation!

With lower rates and quiet QE on the menu, it is time to ask ourselves ""what if"" the economy surprises everyone and the Fed stimulus fuels growth. After all, the economy has been growing since April 2020. Rates are down 50 ""bips"" with more to come. What if we see neither a hard or soft landing but rather no landing at all?

In this scenario. FedEx benefits. In fact its stock price has 40% upside from here just to catch up with its ever-rising dividend.

And our Fed isn't the only dovish central bank! Last week the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced ""stock market support"" plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios.

Yee haw, China! Shares of Chinese firms spiked last week and copper miners popped with them.

Energy prices have, thus far, remained subdued. But this flood of global liquidity is obviously supportive of dividend king Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP ). When energy prices jump, the pipeline stocks that AMLP owns boost their dividends. Just look:

However! If you cleverly own the stock through AMLP, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your sweet dividends received. Which dish an elite 8% as I write today, supported by central banks everywhere."
This is who gets the blame for the port strike. Hint: It's not labor or management,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/who-gets-blame-port-strike-hint-its-not-labor-management,2024-10-03T11:12:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration gave America 40-year-high inflation, labor unrest, and now potentially the costliest strike in American history. By directing its 45,000 members to walk off the job, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union is crippling eastern seaboard ports and costing $5 billion per day.

In October 2021, I warned that the tax-and-spend agenda of the Biden-Harris administration would set an inflationary fire and torch Americans' finances, resulting in labor unrest. By the fall of 2023, we had the largest auto strike in history as the United Auto Workers (UAW) demanded higher wages to counter their losses from inflation.

While the UAW strike was disruptive to the auto industry, it didn't cause severe economic harm or noticeably impact the consumer. The ILA walk-off is an order of magnitude worse, with the potential for severe disruptions to the economy if it lasts more than just a few days.

BALTIMORE RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS PORT STRIKE IS ALREADY IMPACTING BUSINESS: 'IT REALLY HURTS'

The 36 ports on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

In short, America's international trade has been severely hamstrung, with consumers and businesses alike about to get hit hard if this labor dispute isn't resolved quickly.

The primary reason for this and other labor unrest over the last three years has been the stratospheric rise in the cost of living, which stems directly from mismanagement by the Biden-Harris administration.

Biden and Harris pushed for runaway federal deficits, fueled with newly created money from the Federal Reserve, destroyed one-fifth of the dollar's value in less than four years. It also caused violent fluctuations in interest rates for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

The result has been a cost-of-living crisis with homeownership affordability plunging to some of the lowest levels on record, while families pay over $300 billion annually just in interest on their outstanding credit card balances. Despite the average American's weekly paycheck being larger than ever before, it buys less than it did just four years ago.

But the plunge in the dollar's purchasing power has hit businesses every bit as hard as consumers, and the Biden-Harris administration's own data proves it. Prices paid by firms and by customers have both increased 20% since January 2021, meaning businesses have merely passed on their cost increases to consumers.

Inflation has massively increased both the cost of living and the cost of doing business, leaving no winners but government. So, while workers are demanding higher wages to combat today's sky-high cost of living, management is desperate to control increases in the cost of doing business -- and that includes labor costs. With such tight margins, any pay increases to workers will result in higher prices for customers.

But that didn't stop the Biden-Harris administration from weighing in and siding with the strikers, citing growth in corporate profits as somehow indicative of management's misbehavior. Corporate profits have increased in the same sense that families' paychecks have increased, but both buy less, on average, than they did four years ago because of the hidden tax of inflation.

Of all the politicians in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris owns a disproportionate amount of the blame for inflation over the last four years. Not only was she the biggest cheerleader of the president's big-government agenda, but she also cast the tie-breaking vote on trillions of dollars in inflationary federal deficit spending.

What's particularly worrisome is that Harris hasn't learned from her mistakes. She's doubling down instead, proposing more of the same economic malfeasance that got America into this mess. If public policy continues down the path of the last three-and-a-half years, it will mean more inflation, more labor unrest, and evermore disruptive strikes."

The bitcoin price has dropped to almost $60,000 per bitcoin, wiping away much of the gains it made following China's bombshell.

Now, after Elon Musk revealed the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, the Tesla billionaire has warned the U.S. heading for bankruptcy after U.S. debt jumped $204 billion in one day.

""America is headed for bankruptcy,"" Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter, linking to a report of U.S. debt surging on October 1.

""Federal debt explodes on 1st day of the new fiscal year, jumping $204 billion to new record of $35.669 trillion, but it gets worse: Treasury also had to draw down its cash balance by $72 billion -- that's over $275 billion in the red for just one day,"" EJ Antoni, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted.

Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered.

U.S. debt interest payments are forecast to hit $870 billion this year, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office earlier this year after runaway inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a never-before-seen clip in the aftermath of huge Covid-era spending and money-printing.

U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures.

Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days -- potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge -- and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024.

Last month, the Fed kicked off its interest rate cutting cycle, taking the market somewhat by surprise with a 50 basis point reduction and fueling expectations of a similar sized cut in November -- described as ""crazy"" by BlackRock's chief executive.

Bitcoin price swings this week come as tensions rise in the Middle East between Israel and its neighbors, with fears growing the regional conflict could spiral to a wider war -- highlighting bitcoin's role as a U.S. dollar and debt hedge.

""Observers of bitcoin prices this week would once again note that it is not a safe haven against geopolitical concerns,"" Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in an emailed note.

""I think this is normal. Gold is a geopolitical hedge. bitcoin is a hedge against [traditional finance] issues such as bank collapses ... or de-dollarisation/U.S. Treasury sustainability issues."""
Community College Trustees Can Bolster Ties To Emerging Tech Hubs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shalinjyotishi/2024/10/03/community-college-trustees-and-ties-with-tech-hubs/,2024-10-03T10:17:01Z,"A variation of this article originally ran for the Association of Community College Trustee's Fall 2024 issue of Trustee Quarterly Magazine.

Industrial policy is back in the United States, and the community college sector is needed more than ever before. There has never been a more important time for community college trustees to understand and support their institutions' contributions to science- and technology-based economic development, emerging technology sectors, and regional innovation ecosystems.

Scientific and technological innovation spurred by federal and private investments in R&D and economic development is catalyzing job creation, augmentation, and elimination nationwide. Community colleges will be critical to reskilling and upskilling incumbent workers, expanding pathways for young people beginning their careers, and meeting employers' labor market needs in a way that also diversifies the workforce and the jobs that will comprise the future of work.

Community colleges have always been pivotal in providing accessible, affordable, and workforce-oriented career preparation in healthcare, skilled trades, manufacturing, and transportation industries. However, all across the country, community colleges are also evolving to meet the workforce needs of the future of work - jobs and industries catalyzed and shaped by emerging technologies.

Today, community colleges have expanded customized training, certificates, associate's degrees, apprenticeships, and even applied baccalaureates (available in 24 states) tailored to opening doors to jobs in industries incubated and shaped by artificial intelligence, biotechnology, green energy, and quantum technology -- and, as a result, creating inclusive pathways to careers that define the skilled technical workforce for the jobs of today and tomorrow.

Their role in the innovation economy will only grow due to a massive influx of federal investments from the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act, alongside the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. These bills have catalyzed new funding opportunities and the need for community college partnerships, job training, and sector strategy around emerging technology fields.

Notably, CHIPS created the first new arm at the U.S. National Science Foundation in over thirty years-the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships Directorate. Under the new division, NSF has significantly expanded funding for community colleges in emerging technology fields, building on the successes of NSF's Advanced Technological Education program, which has been in operation since 1994.

CHIPS also created new opportunities for community colleges at the U.S. Economic Development Administration, such as through the Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs or ""Tech Hubs"" program.

More than fifty community colleges are partners across the thirty-one Tech Hub designees which will receive more than half a billion dollars in funding to create jobs and companies around technologies of the future, like quantum, semiconductors and personalized medicine.

The more trustees understand these science and tech-focused industrial policy investments and how their states and economies can leverage the funds, the better positioned they will be to help realize the promise of the innovation economy for students.

New America's Future of Work and Innovation Economy is dedicated to the study and support of community colleges in technology-based economic development and for job training in evolving and advanced technology sectors.

This spring, I provided an overview of these new programs in a recent podcast episode for the Association of Community College Trustees. This story, which builds on article that appeared in the association's magazine, further explores how trustees could connect their institutions to emerging industries.

Why trustees are critical for the community college in the innovation economy

While presidents, deans, workforce leaders, and faculty all have critical roles in unlocking equitable pathways to good jobs resulting from R&D investments, trustees have an especially important role to play.

First, as stewards of an institution, trustees can partner with a president and leadership to take a ""forest view"" of the college's offerings and their alignment with the region's economic development goals and, trustees might be elected, political appointees, or otherwise have political, business, and community ties that could help reinforce their colleges' tether to the needs of their local economy.

Second, trustees offer colleges stability in a time of turbulence. Presidential turnover and retention are becoming a growing problem for all higher education institutions, including community colleges. According to an analysis by the American Council on Education in 2023, presidential turnover has reached its highest level since the association began tracking such data in 2006.

Generational transitions will also impact college leadership. According to a recent survey from the American Association of Community Colleges, more than half of sitting community college leaders indicate they plan to transition out of their position within the next five years, and one-third expect to retire in that timeframe.

Faculty and staff, too, are in a period of transition. A 2022 survey from the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources found that more than half of surveyed higher education workers plan to leave their roles. An EAB analysis has found that community colleges have faced a 13% staff decline from 2020-2022.

That leaves trustees among the last lines of defense to help a college take a long-term perspective. That viewpoint is especially valuable when considering technology-based economic development predicated on investments in emerging technology sectors and the innovation economy. Silicon Valley wasn't built in a day, and neither will new innovation hubs catalyzed by federal investments, the AI revolution, or other future technology-driven paradigm shifts.

Trustees have a critical role to play in understanding, supporting, and advocating for their institution's role in job training relating to emerging technologies and to excel as partners in ""regional innovation ecosystems"" and technology-based economic development to grow and retain high-paying jobs.

What trustees and colleges can do: Three case studies

We interviewed trustees of three community colleges on the leading edge as workforce partners for the innovation economy - MiraCosta College in California, Miami Dade College in Florida, and Harper College in Illinois. Our conversations focused on the college's work and what trustees could do to support their college's role in regional innovation ecosystems.

First, I spoke with Frank Merchant, a MiraCosta trustee since 2015, to learn about a capacity-building effort MiraCosta undertook to better prepare the college for the future of work.

Situated in the southern California biotechnology hub, MiraCosta College is a recognized leader in education for the future of work. For example, in 2022, MiraCosta launched the nation's first community college baccalaureate in biomanufacturing to meet the workforce needs of Fortune 500 biotechnology giants like Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. But MiraCosta's foresight has less to do with chance and more with strategy. MiraCosta was one of the first grantees of NSF's CHIPS-enabled new Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT) program, which it is using to scale internships and apprenticeships in the biomanufacturing and microelectronics sector. But MiraCosta's success has less to do with chance and more to do with strategy.

In 2019, MiraCosta College partnered with the Institute for the Future, a Palo Alto-based non-profit, to undertake an institution-wide training in ""futurist thinking"" methods. The president, members of its Board of Trustees, top administrators, students, faculty, and staff took part in a series of trainings on ""futurist thinking"" methods, meant to help them foresee long-term trends and assess the possible implications for the institution, students, and neighboring communities. The college used institutional immersion to take an entirely new long-view approach to its strategic planning and operating process.

Not everyone at the institution was bought into the trendy-sounding training. ""You have to convince people that the futures process thinking is not the flavor of the day but your savior. It was key that I and other trustees go through this entire training process to let everyone in the institution know that this is important,"" Merchant told me.

Merchant recommended trustees explore similar training approaches that help institutionalize a proactive approach to the innovation economy - emphasizing the value of data to drive decision-making. ""Proactive expansion of offerings across these emerging technology areas is something that board members can support.""

Next, I spoke with Roberto Alonso, a trustee of Miami Dade College. Miami Dade is one of the nation's leading community colleges in AI education, becoming one of the only institutions to offer credit and non-credit certificates, associate's degrees, and bachelor's degrees in applied AI. In 2021, the college named Antonio Delgado its first Vice President of Innovation and Technology Partnerships, who has gone on to serve as the first 2-year representative on NSF's Computer and Information Sciences Directorate Advisory Committee.

In 2024, Miami Dade was recently awarded a $2.8 million grant from the NSF to partner with Houston Community College and Maricopa Community College District to launch a consortium dedicated to scaling and improving AI education at 2-year institutions.

Trustee Alonso emphasized the importance of trustees in ensuring that their institutions not only meet employer demands but also prioritize ethics across emerging technology training. ""We are democracy's colleges. We are an institution that gives access to all students. If we don't give students the knowledge they need to use AI in a positive way, we won't be tackling the biggest need,"" Alonso told me. Alonso encouraged trustees to consider how their institution can foster technologists in the public interest. Miami Dade is a member of New America's Public Interest Technology Network, which cultivates tech professionals who are ethics-savvy.

Trustee Alonso, who also serves as a Miami-Dade County School Board member, encouraged fellow trustees to tether their institutions' work in regional innovation ecosystems to their local communities through their own relationships. While 70% of Miami Dade's booming AI enrollment is above 26 and 30% above 41, Miami Dade offers an AI summer camp for high school students to immerse in the college's applied AI curriculum at no cost. Additionally, Mr. Delgado, himself as the college's tech workforce leader, serves as a senior advisor for tech talent development to the Mayor of the City of Miami to foster town-gown relationships.

Lastly, I spoke with William ""Bill"" Kelley, Board Chair of William Rainey Harper College, located outside Chicago, Illinois. Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker has envisioned Illinois as a ""global quantum capital"" and recently Nestled in the heart of a booming quantum science and technology hub, buoyed by a recent half-a-billion dollar investment in quantum technology. Harper is well-aligned with the tech-enabled future of its region's economic development strategy.

In fall 2022, Harper launched the Innovation Accelerator, a new collaborative unit designed to focus specifically on emerging technology workforce training. Writing for the American Association of Community Colleges, Harper President Avis Proctor described how the accelerator is developing accelerated career pathways in cybersecurity, quantum computing, and cloud-computing.

""Under Dr. Proctor's leadership, we set aside $900,000 from our HEERF [Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund] funding to creat the Innovation Accelerator,"" Kelley told me. ""We complemented that funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, NSF, and other agencies.""

Harper was one of the first grantees of NSF's new CHIPS-enabled Enabling Partnerships to Increase Innovation Capacity (EPIIC) grant funding program which it is using to work with a consortia of 2-year and 4-year institutions to improve employer partnerships in quantum fields. Trustee Kelley recommends trustees look at how the entire institution can support its tech goals. Harper engaged its philosophy program to support its ethics course in AI. ""We had to reach out to different departments for how to work better together as well as the college's foundation,"" Kelley told me.

Policy to Empower Community Colleges

Trustees Kelley, Alonso, and Merchant aren't alone as college leaders supporting their institution's evolution to address the future of work, but they are among the early adopters. All three trustees emphasized the need for federal and state governments to better recognize the need and value of community colleges in the innovation economy. Policy innovations such as allowing community college baccalaureates, funding apprenticeship and quality short-term training, and funding upstart costs all came up as needs.

Federally, Congress has only appropriated a portion of the funding of the CHIPS & Science Act authorizations. In July 2024, four community college presidents, including the presidents of MiraCosta and Harper College, joined New America to publicly call on Congress to fully appropriate funding for NSF. NSF encountered a budget cut in March, hamstringing its support of community colleges. ""Getting the other half of the loaf would be huge for the next wave,"" Kelley quipped.

As the U.S. government advances the vision of CHIPS and a bipartisan approach to industrial policy, community colleges will be critical to a successful and equitable innovation economy."
Stop the insanity. Our national debt now tops $35 trillion...,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/stop-insanity-national-debt-now-tops-35-trillion,2024-10-03T10:06:48Z,"They know entitlement programs feature benefit promises far exceeding their tax base, but have done nothing to make them sound. Meanwhile, both parties demand more spending increases -- despite the national debt soaring to $35 trillion, or more than $100,000 for each American, rich and poor alike. Under rosy assumptions, over $20 trillion in debt is projected to be added over the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

TRUMP, HARRIS BLASTED FOR IGNORING EXPLODING BUDGET DEFICIT, AS ECONOMISTS PLEAD WITH BOTH TO 'GET REAL'

Some argue tax cuts are to blame for the soaring debt. But as data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows, revenue has remained largely stable while spending has grown significantly above prior levels.

Much of the growing debt is baked into the budgetary cake, and experts have long warned about rising costs when the Baby Boom generation retires. But growing Social Security payouts -- long ago engineered to rise faster than prices -- are only part of the problem. Soaring health spending, driven by the same demographic factors and compounded by exploding medical costs, is an even bigger challenge.

America's mountain of debt has been exacerbated by massive so-called emergency spending enacted by both parties. During the pandemic, legislation added over $5 trillion to the debt. Now the nearly $1 trillion in annual interest on the debt exceeds all federal spending on children, and defense spending, too.

Efforts to balance the budget are repeatedly dismissed. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, one of us regularly proposed and passed balanced budgets, only to see hope for such discipline overcome by a desire for ever-greater spending. Important-sounding commissions (including one dubbed the ""supercommittee"") issued detailed recommendations that were mostly ignored.

Experts produced reams of data showing nations deep in debt inevitably reach a financial crisis, even as proponents of modern monetary theory (MMT) argued no amount of spending is too great. According to MMT advocates, the federal government can always print more money.

Americans have already experienced where inaction and that illogic lead. During the pandemic, former Obama Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that massive new federal spending would lead to significant inflation, which is exactly what happened, with prices growing 20% since the start of the Biden-Harris administration.

The Federal Reserve's response led to the highest interest rates in two decades, helping drive the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home up by over $1,000. Lower-income Americans spend a greater share of their income on housing, so such rising costs are just one example of why they tend to suffer most from inflation and higher interest rates.

Yet despite expressing concerns about inflation, both presidential tickets propose even bigger deficits. In fact, they seem to be in a bidding war to make them worse. Former President Donald Trump proposed exempting tip income from federal taxes, and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly followed suit. Both ignored the 10-year costs of this proposal, which stretch into hundreds of billions of dollars.

Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance suggested more than doubling today's $2,000 child tax credit to $5,000, which Harris one-upped by proposing $6,000 payments in a child's first year. Senator Vance hasn't spelled out important details of his plan, but we know most of Harris's plan comprises bigger benefit spending instead of tax relief. Both proposals would cost over $1 trillion during the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

Neither campaign has a plan to cover the new costs. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, counting their economic effects, Trump's plans would increase deficits by $4 trillion versus Harris's $2 trillion. But that assumes Harris doesn't revive the massive spending plans she promoted as one of the most liberal members of the Senate. Her plans included a ruinously expensive Medicare-for-all proposal, along with $2,000-per-month stimulus checks for most Americans costing $21 trillion. If you believe a Harris administration wouldn't revive such proposals during the next economic crisis, you haven't paid attention to recent Washington policymaking.

While both campaigns suggest we can have higher spending and debt alongside lower prices and interest rates, recent experience suggests otherwise. So where does the buck really stop? That is, who will ultimately pay for all this?

The reality is every American will pay, especially those with modest incomes and younger Americans who will suffer the longest from higher taxes, inflation and interest rates. We should demand more from our leaders than promises of bigger giveaways, followed by empty handwringing about the soaring debt and financial pain that inevitably result.

Here's how Biden-Harris inflation will make returning to the office wildly more expensive,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-how-biden-harris-inflation-make-returning-office-wildly-more-expensive,2024-10-03T09:09:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Amazon just left a package on everyone's doorstep. Its CEO, Andy Jassy, is instructing corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office beginning Jan. 2. And, it's not a request.

The decision marks a significant shift from Amazon's earlier return-to-work stance, which required corporate workers to be in the office at least three days a week.

Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are two other large companies that are requiring five days a week in the office. In 2023 alone, 66% of workers say they're in the office five days a week and you can expect more employers across the country to follow suit.

The bad news is that it's going to be wildly more expensive to return to the office post pandemic and here's what you need to plan for in your family budget.

COMPANY PLANS TO TRACK WORKERS' LOCATIONS IN RETURN-TO-OFFICE CRACKDOWN

With 50% of people having not made a repayment to their student loans, credit card debt north of $1.1 trillion, and inflation taking a toll on the budgets of families across America, what can you expect for increased costs when your employer makes you return to work full time?

Workers spend on average $51 per day when they go to the office, which includes:

This doesn't include the crippling cost of child care. Overall, the difference for the average family will be an increase of $612 a month to be back in that cubicle because the boss says it's better for the company culture.

Prices are up substantially over the past four years under President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and if you can no longer work from home, here are some of the additional costs you might encounter and ways to offset them.

FORMER AMAZON ENGINEER SAYS COMPANY'S 5-DAY RETURN-TO-WORK POLICY CAUSES EMPLOYEES TO RETHINK JOBS

Fuel or Public Transportation: Daily travel to and from work will add costs for gas, parking, bus or train fares. Make sure to check your company benefit manual to see what deals or reimbursed expenses they have for employees.

Car Maintenance: More driving leads to wear and tear, increasing maintenance costs like oil changes, tires and repairs. This is the perfect time to get your car a complete checkup to make sure you don't run into unforeseen auto expenses.

Lunch: You may need to buy lunch more often, so it's best to meal plan at home as the cost for eating out is rarely less than $10 to $15 a pop.

How Democrats are targeting red seats in blue New York to help win back the House,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5119744/democrats-flip-new-york-house-races,2024-10-03T09:07:01Z,"New York Gov.

Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2022 with the help of a mini red wave in the blue state of New York.

Democrats lost five seats in suburban districts, mostly around New York City, as many in the party were caught off guard. This year top Democrats across the state have joined forces to try to win those seats back, potentially netting the four seats they need to win back control of the chamber.

The GOP formula in 2022 was a barrage of ads and attacks on Democrats on crime, immigration and border security. The targeted messaging energized the Republican base and depressed Democratic turnout.

Party leaders responded this year with an effort modeled on more traditional battleground states will help turn things around for them this cycle with both resources and a stepped up ground game.

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told NPR she realized the need for the coordinated effort when she asked what candidates were doing in the week heading into the 2022 midterms and got a puzzling answer.

""There were [check] no big rallies. There was no organized canvassing, there was no coordination at all amongst local candidates and House candidates,"" Gillibrand said.

Kathy Hochul, then the Democratic candidate for governor, was being attacked by her GOP opponent Lee Zeldin about rising crime rates and border security. Gillibrand says tens of millions of dollars in negative ads had a big impact on Democratic voters in suburban districts around New York City.

""We had the worst voter turnout in 10 years,"" Gillibrand said. Hochul won, but the wave of House losses caused Gillibrand to reach out to Democrats in Wisconsin -- a perennial battleground state -- to come up with a 2024 strategy.

""So the day after the election I said to my chief of staff: 'We have to do something differently. Let's create the first-ever coordinated campaign for New York.'""

Now, Hochul says the coordinated campaign is allowing Democrats to connect with voters in a way that hasn't been done before.

""We're making unprecedented investments, rebuilding Party infrastructure, and turning out voters to elect Democrats and flip the House majority in November,"" she said in a statement to NPR.

Gillibrand, Hochul, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and state party leaders have opened 40 offices in seven House districts and hired 100 full-time staffers. Republicans have just five similar ""battle station"" offices.

Democrats linked state and local party operations. That effort has allowed them to make over 2 million contacts with voters between knocking on doors and phone calls, according to a spokeswoman for Hochul.

The strategy focuses on a more sophisticated get-out-the-vote effort, but it also includes going on offense on the issues that hurt the party the most two years ago -- crime and immigration.

Gillibrand points to her first ad as an example. She says it lists ""what I've done personally to make New York safer"" -- and touts her work on addressing fentanyl and illegal guns. Her third ad focuses on reproductive rights.

The move to lean in on crime and border issues follows the blueprint Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi used in February, to win a special election of a seat previously held by GOP Rep. George Santos. Suozzi emphasized a bipartisan immigration reform overhaul proposal, and effectively flipped the script on an issue that has traditionally put Democratic candidates on defense. Party strategists say his message is a good model in other districts in the state.

But Republicans say they still have the upper hand when it comes to the issues that got them elected in the first place.

Long Island Republican Nick LaLota is one of the five House freshmen elected in 2022. LaLota says his party will likely be outspent this cycle but says voters trust the GOP on the core issues.

""Suburban New Yorkers want two big things: a secure border and public safety and a better economy and less inflation. While they have a lot of money in campaign dollars and a lot of field offices and volunteers, their deficit is on policy solutions to those two big areas.""

New York isn't a presidential battleground but LaLota says GOP nominee Donald Trump knows New York is crucial in the battle for the House. He had a rally last month. He told NPR Trump knows his campaign needs to keep House Republican seats in suburban New York.

""His presence there demonstrates that he wants a governing Republican majority to give him the policy he needs from Congress when he returns to the White House.""

Marc Molinaro is another freshman GOP lawmaker whose district stretches from the Hudson Valley to the Finger Lakes. He says House Republicans are a check on an otherwise blue state.

""The people I represent want a balanced approach to government. They know that single-party rule in New York has led to the highest taxes of any people in the country, crime and an open border, Molinaro said.

But ultimately, taxes may prove the decisive issue in these New York contests. Trump's 2017 tax bill capped a popular state and local tax break called SALT, effectively levying an increase on many New York homeowners. Republicans were pleased that Trump stressed at his New York rally that he'll revive it.

""I will cut taxes for families, small businesses and workers including restoring the SALT deduction,"" Trump vowed at his Uniondale rally.

LaLota said that public pledge helps make the case to other GOP lawmakers as they craft a possible tax bill when many of the Trump tax provisions expire in 2025. ""Way to put this on the table -- this is what suburban constituents in blue states want,"" LaLota said.

Molinaro says the GOP has to follow through on that promise.

""If we really mean to provide meaningful tax relief to middle-class families, that's got to include reestablishing the SALT deduction.""

Jeffries vows Democrats will bring back the tax break, and calls out Republicans having it both ways on the tax break.

""They were the arsonists who burned down the state and local tax deduction and they have no credibility in trying to pretend right now they will be the firefighters.""

Democrats argue that Trump will be a factor in the race, and that the GOP lawmakers' decision to stand with Trump at his recent rally and vote in mostly lockstep on legislation championed by hardline House Republicans will hurt them with independents and Democrats in New York.

But several GOP strategists familiar with the campaigns in these districts stress that these incumbents have worked to create their own brands, and some have made a point to call out some extreme GOP colleagues in the House.

Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, another Long Island GOP lawmaker Democrats are targeting, faces a challenge with his own personal issues taking front and center in recent weeks. The New York Times reported that he put his mistress and the daughter of fiancee on his office payroll, something not allowed by House ethics rules, and a possible campaign finance violation. D'Esposito argues he didn't do anything improper and that the story was a political attack.

Republicans hope to link their Democratic challengers to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was recently indicted on bribery and fraud charges. Lawmakers say his high profile case helps the GOP make their case against electing more Democrats to the House, but challengers in many of these House districts have called on Adams to resign.

Gillibrand waves off Adams as a factor in November House races. She says Democrats this year learned their lesson about engaging voters earlier on liabilities -- like crime -- and this new campaign focuses on the message and mechanics to get their supporters out to vote.

""Last cycle people felt depressed. This is about what we've accomplished, what we're actually doing to address their number one concern."""

Venezuela is in a highly tense political crisis, with the South American oil-exporting nation slammed by low crude prices, inflation, food shortages and violence.

Back in 2016, things were pretty bad in Venezuela. Grocery stores didn't have enough food. Hospitals didn't have basic supplies, like gauze. Child mortality was spiking. Businesses were shuttering. It's one of the epic economic collapses of our time. And it was totally avoidable.

Venezuela used to be a relatively rich country. It has just about all the economic advantages a country could ask for: Beautiful beaches and mountains ready for tourism, fertile land good for farming, an educated population, and oil, lots and lots of oil.

But during the boom years, the Venezuelan government made some choices that add up to an economic time bomb.

"Latino-Owned Business Revenues Grow, But Inflation Hurts Earnings",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rohitarora/2024/10/02/latino-owned-business-revenues-grow-but-inflation-hurts-earnings/,2024-10-02T21:47:00Z,"Revenues, credit scores and age-of-business of Latino-owned businesses all increased during the past 12 months, but expenses also rose, due to inflation.

Biz2Credit's annual Latino-Owned Business Study found that while revenues of Latino-owned companies increased (+11.6%), expenses rose more (+ 22.7%), resulting in lower earnings in 2023-24 than in 2022-23 (-$41.1K).

The analysis, released each year during Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15 - Oct. 15) examined the performance of small to midsized companies in the U.S. from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024. It looked at financial indicators including annual revenue, operating expenses, age of business, and credit scores of both Latino-owned and non-Latino-owned companies.

Revenues for small businesses rose overall, largely because of inflation. Earnings were down overall, but the average drop for Latino-owned businesses was not as sharp as for non-Latino-owned businesses. Earnings performance of Latino-owned firms outperformed the others.

1. The average annual revenue of Latino-owned businesses increased by 11.6% from $601,636 in 2022-23 to $671,360 in 2023-24. Meanwhile, the average annual revenue for non-Latino Businesses increased by 11.5% from $667,204 in 2022-23 to $744,027 in 2023-24.

2. Average earnings (Annual Revenue - Operating Expenses) for Latino-owned businesses dropped from $113,268 in 2022-23 to $72,168 in 2023-24, a drop of $41,100. Meanwhile, non-Latino-owned businesses declined from $159,365 to $94,237, a drop of $65,128. Overall, earnings across all businesses decreased by 40% year over year.

3. Operating expenses for Latino-owned firms increased by 22.7% from $488,368 in 2022-23 to $599,192 in 2023-24, resulting in earnings decrease of 36.3% for Latino firms. Meanwhile, operating costs for non-Latino-owned companies increased 28% from $507,849 in 2022-23 to $649,790 in 2023-24, resulting in a 40.9% drop in earnings.

4. The average personal (FICO) credit score* for Latino owned business increased from 641 in 2022-23 to 647 in 2023-24. In comparison, the personal credit score for non-Latino-owned business increased from 648 to 659 during the same timeframe.

7. The percentage of financing applications submitted by Latino-owned businesses, relative to the total number of submitted applications, increased slightly from 14.8% in 2022-23 to 15% in 2023-24. In 2024, financing applications by Latino-owned businesses increased 14.13% (year-over-year) compared to 2023. That surpassed applications by non-Latino owned businesses, which grew 12.78% year-over-year.

8. The funding rate for Latino-owned businesses stands at 32%, slightly higher than the 31% rate for non-Latino-owned businesses. The average funded amounts were $62,371 for Latino-owned businesses and $76,503 for non-Latino-owned firms.

9. Construction accounted for the largest industry category of Latino-owned companies examined in the study, followed by Other Services (except Public Administration), Accommodation and Food Services, Retail Trade, and Transportation and Warehousing.

10. By state, nearly one-quarter (24%) of funding requests from Latino-owned firms came from Florida, followed closely by California (19.4%), and then Texas, New York, and New Jersey.

The numbers prove that inflationary pressures significantly hurt the earnings of all small businesses in the last year, and Latino-owned firms were not immune. Profits for Latino-owned firms seeking business financing were down 36% on average, as a result.

Many factors combined, including increased labor costs, rising fuel prices, and overall inflation. Rents continue to climb dramatically, especially for businesses located in cities. Meanwhile, insurance costs have skyrocketed. Rising costs of labor, rent, and insurance are unavoidable, and there unfortunately does not seem to be an end in teh near future. They are significantly hurting small businesses.

Further, high interest rates also pinched companies that borrowed money for working capital or expansion. The good news is that the growth rate of inflation has been easing a bit, and the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates, thus bringing down the cost of capital.

Impact of Latino-owned businesses on the U.S. Economy

The U.S. is home to over 63 million Latinos, accounting for roughly 19% of the nation's population. Latinos contribute a staggering $3.2 trillion to the economy and own nearly 5 million businesses that collectively generate more than $800 billion annually, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI).

Further, Latino entrepreneurs are starting businesses at more than twice the rate of the general U.S. population. This increase has led to a higher proportion of new businesses being owned by immigrants overall. In 2023, immigrants were responsible for 36% of new business launches, up from 25% in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Latino immigrants significantly outpace other groups in business ownership, and they comprise 52% of all Latino-owned businesses. In contrast, only 7% of white-owned employer businesses are immigrant-owned, according to the SLEI. Further, Latino-owned businesses are set to revolutionize the U.S. economy, as Latinos are projected to make up 29% of the population by 2050 and contribute a staggering $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy, according to JPMorgan Chase.

As the Latino population grows, it becomes more and more of an indicator of the health of the U.S. economy. Business owners are hopeful that with inflation starting to ease, their revenues may again be on the upswing."
How CMOs Can Work With Influencers And Preserve Brand Safety,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/02/how-cmos-can-work-with-influencers-and-preserve-brand-safety/,2024-10-02T16:26:34Z,"What is human authorship? A decade ago, that was a straightforward and easy question to answer. In the days of generative AI, the definition is becoming much murkier.

Board game designer Jason Allen used AI image generator Midjourney to create an elaborate illustration of women wearing Victorian dresses and space helmets, attending a futuristic looking royal court, writes Forbes' Rashi Shrivastava. The image was not something the AI platform conjured from a simple prompt, though. Allen says he spent more than 100 hours giving it specific information to create the image he wanted. But when Allen tried to copyright the image, the U.S. Copyright Office denied his application because it lacked ""human authorship."" After reconsideration of the application was again rejected by the office, Allen sued the Copyright Office, asking a federal court to decide if it could be copyrighted.

At the heart of this case is a question of what creative, as a noun, truly means. Are the questions and indicators that prompted a computer system creative, or is something creative when only human hands and eyes have directly manipulated it? Midjourney and other AI platforms did not respond to Forbes' requests for comment, but Midjourney's website states that artists own what they create, but it also reserves the right to reproduce,license and distribute works created on the platform.

This lawsuit is also an interesting turnabout for AI companies, many of which are dealing with copyright litigation of their own. Authors, journalists, musicians, photographers and artists have sued big AI companies in the last year, arguing that the AI companies are illegally taking their copyrighted works to train their systems. The input, the creators argue, is all copyrighted.

Whether the output is copyrighted hasn't been discussed much until now. This litigation may not force AI platforms to reckon with that issue, since it only involves the Copyright Office. But it's a reckoning that is coming at some point. Some experts have said that copyright protections of data are the most important thing to regulate: There need to be rules governing who can use what and how, and ensuring that owners of copyrights can be paid.

As more brands use influencer marketing, there are more hazards to brand safety. I talked to Kevin King and Nicholas Spiro, chief revenue officer and chief product officer of the agency Viral Nation, about what CMOs should think about before starting to work with influencers. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

While inflation is finally trending down and the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates last month, these trends aren't fully recognized in consumer prices and wages yet. As a result, consumer confidence continues to weaken, with many Americans saying jobs are ""hard to get."" That attitude extends to what consumers spend. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that the National Retail Federation saw a 5% drop in back-to-school spending, which was at $39 billion this year. There was a 7% decline in back-to-college spending, which tallied $87 billion. And NRF predicts a 5% decline in Halloween spending -- from $12.2 billion last year to $11.6 billion this year. Census Department retail figures show that non-food-service sales only advanced 1.5% last month. That could be because of the still-high prices. A Bankrate study found that prices are 21.2% more expensive today than in February 2020.

This all puts more pressure on the upcoming holiday season. Predictions for holiday spending are beginning to trickle out, but there are a lot of question marks in the air, including a massive port workers' strike that began Tuesday and has crippled all shipping container cargo on the East Coast.

The NCAA's NIL policy, allowing student athletes to be paid for use of their names, images and likenesses, is extremely complex in practice. These complexities came to the forefront last week when UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka announced he was leaving the university's undefeated football team because of a $100,000 NIL payment he said he was promised, but never received. Sluka's agent has said the payment was offered to him verbally by an assistant coach. The payment in question would have come from an NIL collective, which is a nonprofit affiliated with a school that pools funds from donors, fans and businesses to pay student athletes for things like appearances.

The issue of payments from NIL collectives is already under legal scrutiny following an NCAA investigation into whether an $8 million payment from a NIL collective affiliated with the University of Tennessee for a high school recruit violated a rule barring NIL deals to attract students to certain schools. Attorneys general from Tennessee and Virginia filed for a temporary restraining order to stop enforcement of the rule, which was granted. Even though there does not seem to be proof of a concrete agreement in Sluka's case, it draws more attention to payments from NIL collectives -- especially because it's been criticized as an apparent state of permanent free agency, something that even professional athletes can't have.

Kate Spade New York has always represented luxury commercial fashion, but its clothing was only for relatively small sizes. The brand had some styles in XXL, but its size chart had a maximum waist circumference of 36 inches, less than the 39-inch waist of the average American woman. A new collaboration with online plus-size fashion brand Eloquii is extending Kate Spade to that market, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The Kate Spade looks, which are sold online and will be showcased in Kate Spade stores in New York and Los Angeles, have so far been a hit with customers, Eloquii founder and brand lead Julie Carnevale told Danziger. The clothes in this collaboration, which will continue at least through Valentine's Day, are not just larger versions of Kate Spade's main clothing lines, and are custom designed for plus-sized customers, featuring fabrics, patterns and cuts that are popular with Eloquii customers.

As Americans spend more time on social media, brands often want to partner with influencers who can showcase their products -- but it's hard to know if those influencers are 100% the type of people brands want to associate with. Marketing agency Viral Nation has technology that helps determine and maintain brand safety in today's world of social media voices. I talked to the company's Chief Revenue Officer Kevin King and Chief Product Officer Nicholas Spiro about the issue of brand safety. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity.

What are companies looking for today in terms of brand safety with their influencers?

King: Brands are recognizing they've got blind spots in the way that they approach brand safety. Going back to the rise of social, every brand was monitoring media. They probably had a corporate and public affairs group that was monitoring what the government was doing, but nobody was doing social media monitoring. It was a blind spot in brands' overall safety and reputational approach. Flash forward to today, every brand's starting to realize they've got a huge blind spot in the influencer space. There weren't really tools for influencer monitoring.

No two brands are the same in what their red lines are. They are obviously concerned about political leanings. In some cases, they're concerned about gun usage. In some cases, they're concerned about foul language or drug use. There is definitely a common suite of things that brands are starting to pay attention to in their monitoring.

Spiro: Broadly, we see quasi-low adoption of influencer marketing. Not that many brands have tried it. One of the biggest blockers for CMOs that understand the power is brand safety. They want to know that this is safe before they establish a relationship. Brand safety on the platforms can take a few different aspects, but often it's content adjacency. You don't want an ad to appear next to risky content. It's even more in the influencer space, because that's a true brand partnership. You've actually thought about them as a representative of yours, you've signed some sort of agreement, they're your partner. The escalations you might see are actually even riskier for brands.

Have there been many situations where brands were unpleasantly surprised by something that happened in an influencer partnership?

King: It's settling down a little bit. The influencers that are interested in partnering with brands have gotten much better at being cognizant of the world. They're being more careful on their end in a lot of cases. Overall, the space is getting safer as the influencers are starting to recognize where those guardrails are naturally from watching it.

On the brand side, though, I do see a lot of unpleasant surprises. It's because of that blind spot on influencers. You might look at somebody's Instagram feed from last week and it looks great and you want to partner with them, and you miss that when they were in college, they posted a whole lot of really negative stuff. The speed that surfaces is astonishing. It happens within hours. The social communities will make that connection really darn fast.

Spiro: The years of history [are] only increasing. [The year] 2008 was the hallmark in social media. Let's pretend you're sitting there in 2017. That's only nine years of history. At that point, it would be easier for them to scrub it. The whole memory of social media is going to be so much longer, so this in my mind is an increasing need. I think we'll all come back and think, wow, this was actually just the beginning of this, to the point when entire lifetimes have a social media history, which introduces all sorts of risk vectors.

What advice would you give to a CMO who is struggling with the whole concept of influencers and brand safety?

King: Every brand has a suite of tools that they're leveraging to make intelligent decisions. It's not just specific to brand safety. It's on measurement, their brand score, perception, sentiment, everything else. In a lot of cases, those tools and technologies that companies are using to make those evaluations don't evolve as fast as the social or influencer space is moving. Brands are still using a suite of tools that was maybe relevant some years ago, and hasn't picked up with the speed of change. They've got to really be constantly reevaluating those tools in their arsenal. Some of those tools sit in PR. Some of those tools sit in marketing. Some of those tools sit in HR. Some of those tools are sitting in corporate and public affairs. They're not bringing all those data sets together. If I was a CMO, I'd be cognizant of what are the current suite of tools available to me within my organization, and then where do I have blind spots that I can supplement that with to get a holistic picture?

Spiro: Understand that your reputation is one of your greatest assets, and it can be gone in an instant. I know it can be hard to wrap your mind around because it's not revenue, it's not immediacy, but there's that risk element.

Brands are trying to do it with their thumbs. They're trying to just scroll through a couple feeds, and that's not really feasible without the use of technology. There's a big-level-of-effort play. When you leverage technology, you're replacing a workflow of humans that are doing it worse, covering less, costing you a ton of money, because it's all these people and lawyers trying to somehow understand the background of an influencer.

This disabled woman built a career. A federal program that helped now penalizes her,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25453/social-security-ssi-disabilities-work-outdated,2024-10-02T16:25:32Z,"Tabi Haly defied expectations. She's a woman with spinal muscular atrophy -- also, a software engineer and a vice president at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase hide caption

Tabi Haly defies expectations. She's a woman with a progressive muscular illness; she can't move her body and she needs round-the-clock care from aides. She wasn't expected to go to college, or to get a job -- much less become a vice president at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.

Even staying alive and healthy defied expectations. ""People with spinal muscular atrophy like myself, living to my age already is a huge win,"" says Haly, who is 40.

Haly's success as a software engineer in New York City was made possible by a government program called Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. It gives Haly access to crucial medical coverage.

But now that same program is threatening to bring her success crashing down.

In July, Haly got a letter that shocked her. The Social Security Administration, the agency that runs the federal benefits program, wrote that she was not eligible for SSI, even though she'd relied upon SSI for almost 19 years.

By losing SSI, she would also lose Medicaid, her health insurance. Medicaid provides medical care -- from round-the-clock personal care aides to an expensive medicine -- that keeps her healthy and allows her to build a career.

""It's like my foundation's falling apart,"" says Haly. She appealed the decision to end her SSI. But she worries that without it, the career she's achieved will end. Even with a high-paying job, she says she can't pay for 24-hour aides and other high-cost medical care on her own.

She faces a big fall -- from a successful career to needing full-time care from family or, more likely she fears, moving into a nursing home.

SSI exists to provide a minimum income, and often health insurance, to people with significant disabilities. But an NPR investigation found that SSI often fails people with disabilities because its rules are long out of date and overly complex.

As a result, recipients like Haly run into decisions that seem bureaucratic and inconsistent but that threaten their ability to stay out of poverty, live independently and keep access to medical care.

Debora Wagner at Cornell University's Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability says Haly's frustration is not uncommon and shows the need to modernize SSI. ""My question is 'Who benefits in this situation? What's the benefit for us as a society of making it impossible for people with disabilities to work?'""

Haly is a software engineer and a team leader on development and coding projects for JPMorgan Chase & Co..

On an early morning this summer at her apartment in Manhattan, Haly, in her motorized wheelchair, prepared to lead back-to-back meetings on a new software project. Her personal care aide, Palone Ruddock, spent about 10 minutes getting Haly positioned in front of her computer.

Haly can't move her body. She needs an aide to help her move her arms and legs.

But with Haly's fingers placed on a large trackpad, she can control the computer and run her meeting.

Some of her work colleagues on the call know she's disabled. None, she says, have any idea of how disabled she is. Nor did any of the outside consultants this day at a second meeting, where she presented the coding project.

Haly needs assistance from personal care aides 24 hours a day. ""That's who gets me into my wheelchair,"" she says. ""They're my hands and feet.""

Those aides move her body several times an hour so she doesn't get painful bedsores. They suction the secretions out of her weakened lungs to keep her healthy.

Haly says those aides, seven days a week, cost about $300,000 a year.

Only Medicaid, the state and federal insurance for people with limited income that Haly gets through SSI, will pay for them.

Her company's health insurance wouldn't. The insurance that people get through their jobs doesn't cover long-term, in-home aides. Nor does Medicare, the government insurance for older people and some younger people with disabilities.

As a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, Haly makes a good salary. But even with a six-figure paycheck, she says she can't afford the health care that she needs.

In addition to the aides, Haly ticks off a list of her other medical expenses. Medicaid pays for a new, breakthrough medication for spinal muscular atrophy. She says that medicine alone, which she must keep cooled in the refrigerator, costs about $350,000 a year.

If she went on her employer's health insurance, a company spokesperson says it might pay for some or all of the medicine.

But there are other big expenses an employer's health insurance won't pay at all, like Haly's customized power wheelchair. At $35,000, it's as expensive as a small car.

In addition, Medicaid pays for wheelchair repairs and tens of thousands of dollars a year in physical, occupational and speech therapy.

""I would have to be a multimillionaire to pay for all this stuff myself,"" Haly says.

Ari Ne'eman, an assistant professor at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard who researches disability income programs, says: ""If you lose access to SSI, you lose access to the Medicaid services that keep you alive and thriving in the community. It's a question of life and death.""

SSI was created in 1972 to provide monthly benefit checks for millions of impoverished disabled and elderly Americans. In 2024, the monthly benefit is capped at $943 for one person and $1,415 for a couple. In addition, most who are eligible for SSI then qualify for health insurance through state Medicaid programs.

Today, SSI is a key benefit to 7.5 million people.

But SSI was created before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protected people with disabilities from discrimination in public places and at work. It was created before the 1975 law -- the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act -- that, for the first time, gave a right to a public school education for children with disabilities. Before then, some 1 million children with disabilities, the last group to get the right to schooling guaranteed, were excluded from many schools.

As the experiences and expectations for disabled Americans changed, SSI failed to keep up.

SSI was started with the assumption that recipients couldn't or wouldn't work in jobs where they could support themselves.

As a result, its out-of-date rules discourage work. Today, fewer than 10% of people on SSI do work, although many say they'd like to work and many would like to make enough to get off SSI.

Very few, like Haly, manage to build a career.

The rules make it hard to take even a part-time job. One rule says you can own only $2,000 in assets -- like bank savings or property. That limit hasn't changed since 1989.

For a couple, the asset limit is $3,000, creating a ""marriage penalty"" that forces many on SSI to avoid marriage or to try to hide it when they marry.

As a result of the cap on accruing assets, Haly, for example, is unable to contribute part of her salary or take her employer's match in the company 401(k) plan. Those retirement plans, which are now used by 70 million Americans, didn't exist when SSI and the asset limit were first created.

Over the years, Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service have set up programs where people on SSI can shield part of their income from the asset limit. But these programs -- ABLE accounts, Ticket to Work, PASS accounts -- are often complicated to set up and limited in their scope. The result: Only a tiny fraction of people on SSI use them.

In recent months, the Social Security Administration has simplified some rules about counting income, like excluding the government assistance someone on SSI receives for food and rent. But Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley noted to NPR that only Congress can make the most significant reform to SSI.

There's a fix to the asset limit that's been proposed, but stalled, on Capitol Hill. The SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act would raise the asset limit to $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a couple, in line with what the thresholds would be if they had kept up with inflation.

The bill has bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress and has been endorsed by business leaders, including Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. But the bill wouldn't address other outdated SSI rules.

One rule says that someone on SSI can't earn more than $65 a month. After that, a recipient loses $1 of benefits for every $2 they earn -- in effect, a tax of 50%.

""That's a higher tax rate than anyone faces on their federal income tax,"" says Ne'eman of Harvard. ""But when it comes to the most impoverished disabled Americans, that is the level of taxation functionally that people are facing when they try and enter the workforce.""

That $65 limit is the same as it was first set in 1972.

When Microsoft in 2020 decided to raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid employees to $25 an hour, the company was surprised to find that disabled workers -- largely ones with intellectual disabilities working in the cafeteria, as administrative assistants and other low-level jobs -- suddenly faced losing their SSI benefits.

Microsoft hired private benefit managers to advise every employee on SSI, according to Rylin Rogers, the company's disability policy director.

Many of those workers thought they'd need to ""step away from those jobs, good jobs that they had had for a very long time, which would have been a shame,"" says Dan Rutten with the Washington Initiative for Supported Employment, the nonprofit benefits advisory firm that was called in to help. Most of those disabled employees, guided by the advisers, found waiver programs or cut their work hours to balance their salary increases with SSI's rules.

Fifty years ago, when SSI started, making $65 a month got a person close to the poverty limit. ""It was already inadequate in 1972, but it wasn't laughable,"" says Ne'eman. ""Today we have a situation where the income offset really is frankly insulting.""

People on SSI who ""are having the greatest success working"" are the ones who run into the most problems with SSI's rules, says Jack Smalligan, who studies income benefits for the Urban Institute. ""So the message to beneficiaries is, essentially, that working doesn't pay.""

Haly makes too much to take a monthly SSI benefit check. She's one of a tiny number of beneficiaries who need to qualify solely to keep her Medicaid.

But this summer, Haly learned that she was about to lose that health insurance.

At first, Haly thought it was a simple clerical error.

Every year, she gets recertified for Medicaid. Haly says a caseworker for New York state comes to her home and asks a series of questions to determine that she is still disabled. Haly considers the process ""intrusive,"" given that she has a progressive neuromuscular condition that is incurable.

Usually, the process is automatic. But this spring, when the notice of her coverage renewal arrived, the line that she expected to say that her insurance would last until 2025 said 2024 instead.

The state of New York wasn't extending her Medicaid coverage, even though Haly was currently on SSI, which qualified her for that health insurance.

(A spokesperson for New York's Medicaid agency said rules around confidentiality limited its ability to discuss Haly's case. A spokesperson for Social Security noted confidentiality rules, too.)

Haly went to the Social Security office to straighten it out.

""They had no idea what I was talking about,"" she says. ""Zero.""

She says they offered to help her stop working and sign up for a separate benefit program, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), for people who can no longer work because of a disability.

She recalls: ""The person said, 'I can make you an appointment for SSDI, do you want to claim disability?' I said, 'No, I do not want to collect SSDI.'""

It took several weeks, she says, until she got an appointment to talk over her problem with a Social Security caseworker. Haly says he advised her that she needed to reapply for SSI.

She was reluctant to apply for a benefit that she already held, and had without question, for years. But the staffer was insistent, so she did.

Shortly after, she got a letter from Social Security with a short denial. It said she made too much money to qualify.

SSI's regulations are complex and confusing. Often, recipients find it necessary to hire a lawyer or a benefits manager with specialized expertise to negotiate the rules to stay eligible.

""The rules are so complicated that even the most educated, professional people cannot understand and follow the rules. It's heartbreaking,"" says attorney Wagner at Cornell.

For years, Social Security said Haly qualified for an exception to SSI's earnings limit, called a 1619(b) waiver. It refers to a part of the Social Security law that lets some disabled people earn money over the limit and still qualify for Medicaid.

Social Security's denial this summer turned all that upside down.

It ended her eligibility for SSI because of her growing income, which previously was excluded by the waiver. When she lost SSI, she lost the waiver that went with it. She can't use the waiver now or even reapply for it because the waiver is available only to people who Social Security says are eligible for SSI.

""It's a catch-22,"" says Haly, frustrated.

To be eligible again, Haly would need to impoverish herself and give up the aides and medical care she is unlikely to afford on her own, especially if she can no longer work.

Even then, to reapply for SSI and maybe get the waiver again could take months or even years.

So she's asked Social Security to reverse itself and return to what had been the status quo for years and allow her to stay on SSI, to keep her Medicaid and to keep working.

""My medical expenses are so much, hundreds of thousands a year,"" says Haly. ""Do you not want me to work then? Because I can be a VP at JPMorgan Chase. I pay a lot of taxes being a VP at JPMorgan Chase. Or I can just not work and collect.""

While Haly waits for a decision on her appeal, her Medicaid insurance is in place -- for now.

For a few days in early summer, without Medicaid, everything stopped. Her medicine was delayed. When her medical providers saw her insurance was halted, they canceled her physical therapy sessions and her wheelchair repair.

There would be few options, Haly says, if she loses her appeal to the Social Security Administration. She could stop working and apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. That comes with Medicare. But it would take at least two years to get it.

""Someone like me,"" she says, ""who is a person with a disability who needs full-time care, the only way to get that is in a nursing home.""

For businesses, there's a growing recognition of the value of hiring more workers with disabilities. One trend: The creation of cafes, coffee shops and other small businesses as places where disabled people can be hired to work alongside others without disabilities.

In St. Paul, Minn., attorney Shamus O'Meara opened a specialty popcorn business this year with his 26-year-old son Conor, who is autistic.

Conor O'Meara makes the popcorn and greets customers when they come in.

""When they see Conor,"" his father says, ""it's like, 'Conor, how are you!' It's a true joy to have him here. Everyone knows him. They call him the Mayor of St. Paul.""

The goal of Highland Popcorn (motto: ""Popcorn with Personality"") is to create a place where disabled people can find work.

But Shamus O'Meara says they quickly ran into barriers with SSI. Because of the $65 limit on monthly earnings and the $2,000 limit on assets, many of their employees, including Conor, need to limit their work to just a few hours, a few days a week.

That required Shamus, who hires both disabled and nondisabled workers, to find many extra employees to cover all the shifts.

Work is important to Conor, for social interaction and for the money he can earn.

He takes the bus to two other part-time jobs. At a nearby bowling alley, he cleans the scoring screens and sweeps up the cigarette butts outside. At a pizza restaurant, he buses dishes and wraps silverware in napkins. In addition, he volunteers at a community radio station and hosts a show where he talks about his life and about Minnesota's professional sports teams.

Conor says he'd like to work even more. ""I think Social Security should end that one limiting how many hours you work.""

Tabi Haly's bosses, too, are confounded by SSI's complex and stale rules -- and by the idea that a valued worker would go from a company vice president to having her career ended and possibly needing to move to a nursing home.

""Tabi contributes to our business in a very meaningful way. She's top talent,"" says Bryan Gill, who runs JPMorgan's office of disability inclusion. ""And I want more of Tabi's time contributing to our business.""

Gill says the financial services company makes an effort to hire people with disabilities because it's a way to find talented workers in a tight labor market.

""We do a lot of charity,"" he says. ""We have a lot of philanthropic efforts. This is not one of them. This is a business strategy imperative to the long-term success of this company.""

Haly also writes songs and has recorded two CDs. She started singing as a form of speech therapy to strengthen her weakened lungs.

In the lyrics to one song, ""Waiting in the Wings,"" she asks: ""Do they judge me by my talent? ...Treat me less than a human being? Is that what our life's meant to be?""

""Waiting in the wings means we're waiting backstage,"" she says, waiting for rights. ""What that means here in the States is that we have the liberty to pursue our dreams and live them. And not feel like there are all these barriers to get there.""

Haly says she only wants the chance to keep working and to keep her independence. But she needs to keep her SSI and Medicaid to make that remain her reality."

A federal program that helped now penalizes her for her success.,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/g-s1-25453/social-security-ssi-disabilities-work-outdated,2024-10-02T16:08:55Z,"Tabi Haly defied expectations. She's a woman with spinal muscular atrophy. Also, a software engineer and a vice president at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase hide caption

Tabi Haly defies expectations. She's a woman with a progressive muscular illness; she can't move her body and she needs round-the-clock care from aides. She wasn't expected to go to college, or to get a job-much less become a vice president at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.

Even staying alive and healthy defied expectations. ""People with spinal muscular atrophy like myself, living to my age already is a huge win,"" says Haly, who is 40.

Haly's success as a software engineer in New York City was made possible by a government program called Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. It gives Haly access to crucial medical coverage.

But now that same program is threatening to bring her success crashing down.

In July, Haly got a letter that shocked her. The Social Security Administration, the agency that runs the federal benefits program, wrote that she was not eligible for SSI, even though she'd relied upon SSI for almost 19 years.

By losing SSI, she would also lose Medicaid, her health insurance. Medicaid provides medical care-from round-the-clock personal care aides to an expensive medicine-that keeps her healthy and allows her to build a career.

""It's like my foundation's falling apart,"" says Haly. She appealed the decision to end her SSI. But she worries that without it, the successful career she's achieved will end. Even with a high-paying job, she says she can't pay for 24-hour aides and other high-cost medical care on her own.

She faces a big fall: From a successful career to needing full-time care from family or, more likely she fears, moving into a nursing home.

SSI exists to provide a minimum income and often health insurance to people with significant disabilities. But an NPR investigation found that SSI often fails people with disabilities because its rules are long out of date and overly complex.

As a result, it's common for recipients like Haly to run into decisions that seem bureaucratic and inconsistent--but that threaten their ability to stay out of poverty, live independently and keep access to medical care.

Debora Wagner at Cornell University's Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability says Haly's frustration is not uncommon and shows the need to modernize SSI. ""My question is: Who benefits in this situation? What's the benefit for us as a society of making it impossible for people with disabilities to work?""

Even her coworkers don't know

Haly is a software engineer and a team leader on development and coding projects for JPMorgan Chase & Co..

On an early morning this summer at her apartment in Manhattan, Haly, in her motorized wheelchair, prepared to lead back-to-back meetings on a new software project. Her personal care aide, Palone Ruddock, spent about 10 minutes getting Haly positioned in front of her computer.

Haly can't move her body -- she needs an aide to help her move her arms and legs.

But with Haly's fingers placed on a large trackpad, she can control the computer and run her meeting.

Some of her work colleagues on the call know she's disabled. None, she says, have any idea of how disabled she is. Nor did any of the outside consultants this day at a second meeting, where she presented the coding project.

Haly needs assistance from personal care aides 24 hours a day. ""That's who gets me into my wheelchair,"" she says. ""They're my hands and feet.""

Those aides move her body several times an hour, so she doesn't get painful bedsores. They suction the secretions out of her weakened lungs to keep her healthy.

Haly says those aides, seven days a week, cost about $300,000 a year.

Only Medicaid, the state and federal insurance for people with limited income that Haly gets through SSI, will pay for them.

Her company's health insurance wouldn't. The insurance that people get through their jobs doesn't cover long-term, in-home aides. Nor does Medicare, the government insurance for older people and some younger people with disabilities.

As a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, Haly makes a good salary. But even with a six-figure paycheck, she says she can't afford the health care that she needs.

But there are other big expenses an employer's health insurance won't pay at all, like Haly's customized power wheelchair. At $35,000, it's as expensive as a small car.

In addition, Medicaid pays for wheelchair repairs and tens of thousands of dollars a year in physical, occupational and speech therapy.

""I would have to be a multi-millionaire to pay for all this stuff myself,"" Haly says.

People with significant disabilities weren't expected to work

(Credit: CBS)

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

"High-End Fashion No More Durable Than Fast Fashion, Report Discovers",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookerobertsislam/2024/10/02/high-end-fashion-no-more-durable-than-fast-fashion-report-discovers/,2024-10-02T14:18:14Z,"Fifty years old and founded by Associated British Foods, the Primark fashion brand aims to provide affordable clothing choices for everyone. With 70,000 employees and 450 stores in 17 countries, the brand's accessibly-priced fashion once earned it the nickname 'Primarni' in the 2000s-a time when it featured alongside high-end fashion brands in British Vogue, Grazia, and other fashion publications. Now, glossy magazines are steering clear, as are most journalists-particularly sustainability ones.

Since then, Primark and other 'value-led' brands have felt the sharp end of social and environmental criticism as climate change and supply chain tragedies have thrust them into the spotlight, tarnishing them in a way that luxury brands falling foul of the same crimes hasn't (the most recent of such double standards being farmer exploitation by cashmere brand Loro Piana, whose jumpers retail for as much as $9000).

Yes, 'fast fashion' has become fashion's sustainability scapegoat, with luxury fashion brands pointing the finger and calling it the industry's culprit, including Antoine, son of billionaire LVMH-owner Bernard Arnault, who famously declared on stage at fashion's premier Sustainability Summit that luxury goods are ""sustainable by nature."" LVMH's emissions prove otherwise, but nevertheless, luxury brands have traded on the line that their expensive goods are of higher quality and last for longer compared to affordable 'disposable' fashion. Inconveniently for Arnault, new research by the Environmental Charity Hubbub, in partnership with the University of Leeds, conclusively refutes that.

In 2022, Hubbub and the School of Design at the University of Leeds designed a study funded by Primark to explore the relationship between garment durability and price. The study was built from existing durability guidelines in The Clothing Longevity Protocol by the UK-based NGO Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Circular Business Models. The research entitled Worn Out: Is Price an Accurate Indicator for Clothing Durability included performance testing, including textile abrasion, seam strength, fading, and shrinkage, combined with repeated washing and drying cycles in domestic washing machines to assess how the garments were affected by laundry. An iterative process for analysis of the results throughout the testing cycles was used to show how likely it would be for the owner to reject, return, or stop wearing a garment.

Alex Robinson, CEO of Hubbub, explained that ""the tests were developed independently and analyzed 65 clothing items across three categories [t-shirts, jeans, and hoodies]"". The items were segmented in price intervals of £10 ($13) for the jeans and hoodies and £5 ($6.70) for the t-shirts. Robinson explained that Primark's involvement extended only to ""what would be investigated in the research,"" and the study itself was designed, implemented, analyzed, and reported without Primark's involvement. So, what were the results?

For womenswear denim jeans, the most expensive products tested ($160 - $200) performed best and were ranked most durable. However, one product costing between $121 - $160 performed very poorly. The jeans priced between $30- $40 and $15 - $30 performed very well and were ranked second and third. Overall, the test results showed little difference in durability performance between the most expensive and the two lower-priced products, making up the top three rankings, even though the price difference was as much as $134 (£100) between the first and third garments.

Similar results were seen in the t-shirt tests, where two of the top three performing t-shirts for women and men were lower priced, costing under $6.70 or $6.70 - $13.30. ""There isn't a correlation between price and durability,"" explained Robinson, adding that another interesting finding had been consumer attitudes to clothing prices: ""Consumer polling showed not only do people believe that more expensive clothes are better quality, but that they are more likely to look after more expensive clothes."" Robinson concludes that ""a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs and may contribute to durability,"" meaning we maintain expensive clothes carefully, giving the false impression they are inherently better quality. ""This [research] proves all clothes deserve to be cared for,"" irrespective of price, says Robinson.

How did the research findings inform Primark's new durability framework, published this week, and what does the false 'low price, low utility' consumer belief mean for Primark as a 'low price' retailer?

Primark's durability framework is part of the Primark Cares Strategy, which spans products, planet, and people. The durability framework helps fulfill their commitment to extend the garment lifespan and facilitate care and repair, keeping clothing in use and out of landfill for longer.

WRAP lent its support to the framework, and its Director of Collaboration and Change said of their research, ""We found that extending the life of clothing by an extra nine months reduces carbon, waste, and water footprints by as much as 30%-each"" underlining a key rationale behind Primark's efforts; the brand, after all, has committed to Science Based Targets, including halving its emissions across the entire value chain by 2030. Despite the link between clothing care and extending its lifespan, the fashion industry has no universal standards for clothing durability, hence Primark's establishment of its brand-specific framework.

Since January this year, Primark's durability framework has been implemented with all its suppliers, adding around seven days to the production time due to extra testing. The framework includes physical testing and repeated washing (up to 45 times) that simulates domestic washing to ensure that the results reflect how clothing performs throughout its lifetime. Primark says some clothing items meet the required standard after testing and don't need any improvements, while others may need small tweaks, such as zip adjustments. They say the changes don't always mean producing a more durable product is more expensive.

Product Longevity and Partnerships Lead at Primark Cares, Vicki Swain, says the Primark team is ""now building a database of machine washable clothes statistics and working towards which [ones] to change"" to give optimal care advice to consumers and extend the life of each product. ""Over 50% of [Primark's sales] volume is 'basics' -- meaning everyday essential clothing -- including t-shirts, socks, joggers, underwear and hoodies,"" Swain explained, highlighting the importance of longevity in products worn regularly. Simultaneously, this statistic illustrates that half of Primark's sales are unrelated to 'trend-led' or seasonal fashion, calling into question popular commentary that assumes Primark is synonymous with disposable 'fast-fashion.' When probed, Primark revealed that ""More than half of our stock is perennial items always in stock, 365 days per year,"" meaning no inbuilt obsolescence. They add: ""Our market knowledge and operating model means we typically have very little unsold stock. Anything left is resold or reused via our charity partner. We also have a zero landfill policy"".

Lynne Walker, Director of Primark Cares, says, ""We are taking [sustainability] very seriously, and we are changing [our business]."" ""There is an element of future-proofing in relation to incoming European legislation, and we will be compliant."" Walker alludes to increased textile product regulation, including the new Ecodesign for Sustainable Product Regulation (ESPR) and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations. Regarding the latter, brands will pay a fee for each product sold on the market to offset the cost of waste handling when those garments are discarded.

Such EPR schemes can include an ecomodulation opportunity, whereby brands pay fewer fees if their products are more durable and made of lower-impact or recyclable materials, for example. Walker says Primark's new durability framework is part of the preparation for this new regulation but is also necessary to maintain the brand's 'license to operate' in the age of climate change and increased consumer concern about clothing's environmental impacts.

Walker says, ""Previously, it's been up to brands to [subjectively] pick and choose what tests to incorporate' regarding the durability of their products"" due to the absence of industry standards. Primark is a member of the Textiles 2030 initiative in the UK, a voluntary scheme with signatory brands committing to environmental targets and progress on the Textiles 2030 Circularity Roadmap. Bur Walker cautions: ""[Although] Textiles 2030 is about setting guidelines, it's not quick enough"". With the European ESPR already entered into law this year and digital product passports (containing product impact, care, and repair data) to follow, the UK's 2030 ambitions are somewhat off-the-pace for UK brands selling products in Europe.

While Primark has taken the plunge to publish its durability framework and extend the life of products, how might consumers respond? If behavior dictates that inexpensive clothes aren't cared for well, how should consumers be educated on better care practices for all clothes? Robinson believes ""we need a lot more public discussion about the impact and the value of our clothes because there isn't [significant] awareness about how to extend the life of our clothes."" Robinson calls for ""communication with the public and upskilling for simple repairs, bringing that [practice] back into the mainstream."" To that end, Primark has conducted over 50 in-store workshops teaching customers basic repair skills and has established a thriving community in the process.

With consumer attitudes skewed toward caring for expensive items and punishing cheaper ones, should Primark consider raising retail prices? Walker declares the retailer remains staunchly dedicated to offering affordable fashion for all, meaning that price inflation to garner improved garment care isn't on the cards. Primark's very low pricing does remain the elephant in the room when grappling with its environment and ethical sustainability credentials. Brands may produce a $9000 sweater unethically, but can a $5 t-shirt ever be produced ethically and sustainably?

A Primark spokesperson says yes, explaining in writing the elements of its business model that allow for such keen pricing. These areas of leanness include not selling online (and therefore removing the burden of expensive delivery and returns), comparatively tiny marketing budgets (instead relying on their 24 million-strong social media community to share and discuss the product), and placing very large orders with suppliers well in advance to achieve economies of scale, then adding a far lower retail margin for the brand compared to competitors.

Price is clearly not a proxy for quality, and no product can be considered ""sustainable by nature."" However, a challenge remains in shifting consumer perception and behaviors to care for Primark as carefully as it might Prada."
Smart Data Tactics Help Retailers Win In A Challenging Holiday Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2024/10/02/smart-data-tactics-help-retailers-win-in-a-challenging-holiday-season/,2024-10-02T14:04:43Z,"Holiday spending in 2024 is expected to show modest growth, with forecasts predicting increases ranging between 2% and 5% over last year. According to Deloitte, holiday retail sales in 2024 are expected to increase by 2.3-3.3%, which is slower than the 4.3% increase in 2023. This is notably lower than the growth seen in previous years, partly due to economic pressures such as inflation and election-year uncertainties. Consumers are expected to be more price-conscious, with a significant portion planning to delay their shopping until after Halloween and focusing on discounted items.

According to consumer data from Prosper Insights & Analytics, the retail landscape in the U.S. has been on a steady downtrend since the pandemic as Covid subsidies have run out, student loan payments resume, and shoppers grapple with higher credit card rates and lingering inflation effects.

Retailers: Adapt or else. For retailers, the expectation of a modest forecast conjures ghosts of holidays past where a poor showing in December created a hole that they would spend the next year digging out of, or in some unfortunate cases, accelerate a decline in the overall business.

So, in a holiday season that is likely to put many retailers in the red (and not the festive kind), retail chains must not only keep customers from defecting in search of a better deal, but to get them to spend more at their store and not at a competitor's.

To solve this conundrum means finding new ways to innovate, and there is ample room to do so through smarter use of data. To start, retail brands must acknowledge an inconvenient truth: Most of them operate with an outdated view of who their shoppers really are and what affects them most at a particular point in time. Market conditions that shape consumer attitudes are in a state of perpetual flux, and data that is months or even years old fails to reflect the deeper issues facing most consumers nor does it reflect the attitudinal shifts that naturally come with an ever-changing economic landscape.

All these factors can create blind spots for retailers who need a more strategic understanding of who is coming through their doors. Put simply, retail chains need to adopt a new model that goes beyond understanding what consumers buy, but why they buy what they buy and what matters most to them at that point in time.

According to Prosper Insights & Analytics, retail consumers are becoming more pragmatic in their shopping approaches, prioritizing cost savings over store loyalty and focusing on necessities over other forms of spending such as entertainment or travel.

Shoppers have clicked off. In an age where consumers guard their privacy more than ever and attention is increasingly fragmented across a range data-hoarding platforms, the task of wringing insights from consumer buying habits is not always an easy one. Worse, the industry is inundated with errant, fraudulent, or irrelevant data, making it harder for retailers to know which information to trust.

As if things were not difficult enough, data collection in more states is becoming stricter, with increased consumer protection laws leaving retailers with fewer places to mine meaningful shopper data beyond purchase histories and what is left of online tracking.

On a brighter note, reliable, high-quality customer data is out there, but without a compass, it is easy for Santa to get lost in the blizzard.

The art of looking forward, not backward. To uncover what's driving customer behaviors this holiday season, some innovative retailers are embracing what insiders refer to as ""zero-party"" and ""first-party"" data, which can deliver a richer view into what drives customer buying decisions.

Unlike data that is scraped from various sources, zero-party data is information provided willingly by customers during online account setups or through independent market research using questionnaires and light surveys. These surveys capture previously undiscovered attributes that yield clues about what motivates shoppers and how they act on these motivations. The big hurdle for retailers is how to turn this data into insights, insights into action, and action into results. The secret may just lie in how the data is applied.

When independent survey data is gathered that captures consumer preferences and behaviors, it can be compared against first-party databases to reveal subsets of lookalike shoppers for which a retailer may have been unaware. Rich, long-standing surveys that ask the right questions are the first part of this holiday recipe.

Understanding the specific motivations of these new audiences - or new twists on existing audiences - allows retailers to develop better, more targeted promotions that not only get shoppers off the couch, but get them in the store, spending more of their tight holiday dollars. Surprisingly, few retailers know how to take this extra step.

Dynata, a leading provider of insights, activation and measurement data, recognizes that many retailers struggle to turn segmentation data into effective media strategies.

According to Brad Brockhaug, Chief Commercial Officer at Dynata, ""This approach gives retail brands a clear path to identifying and activating new audiences, allowing them to successfully bridge the market-research-to-activation gap, building loyalty and connecting with their customers in more meaningful ways at an unprecedented speed.""

Scale new audiences to growth. The advantage here is that retail chains now have a way to apply these fresh insights by activating the media buys that can scale a specific message to a specific target audience. This is typically done across massive ad networks capable of reaching millions of shoppers. These ads can include tailored offers and promotions that resonate with new buyers they wish to attract.

Rather than just looking at past behaviors, Dynata empowers its clients to predict and solve future problems. By tapping into zero-party and first-party data, they help brands uncover new insights about customer motivations and behaviors that might otherwise go unnoticed. This consumer insights data offers a deeper understanding of what drives purchasing decisions.

Predicting the future. This new approach to discovering audience preferences and motivations gives retailers a powerful tool when preparing for the future. Continually refreshed behavioral data that reflects the latest consumer attitudes can be a much better predictor and influencer of where future trends are heading. When executed against timely research and scaled through advertising, insights can be gathered as late as Thanksgiving and still give retailers a powerful way to attract new shoppers. Now that sounds like a holiday gift any retailer would be happy to open."
Shaping Wealth: Experiential Investing Redefines The Luxury Standard,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carrierubinstein/2024/10/02/shaping-wealth-experiential-investing-redefines-the-luxury-standard/,2024-10-02T14:04:30Z,"In an age where innovation leads the way, maximizing opportunities is essential. As flexibility becomes the new luxury, a fresh way of experiencing luxury emerges, paving an innovative path that honors history by bringing back old values and valuables to a contemporary era where they are better appreciated, experienced, and more easily traded.

A unique investment route now taking shape, redefining how we engage with prestigious assets to make them not only cherished but also more profitable.

LUXUS, one of the world's first wealthtech startups specializing in luxury assets, is poised to enhance value and increase liquidity while enriching the immediate quality of investors' lives, making luxury accessible and relevant in a rapidly evolving landscape. It has just announced a $5M seed round led by ATX Venture Partners and joined by Christie's Ventures among other rather strategic investors to launch 'Thoroughbreds' and Pioneer Experiential Luxury Investing.

The idea was born from a realization of a former Blackstone executive: ""Traditional luxury investments were often dismissed, particularly in the U.S., as niche markets more associated with European wealth says founder Dana Auslander, who through her work in traditional investments noticed a growing disconnect: ""I felt that luxury was overlooked and underappreciated as a viable investment sector in the U.S. Fintech platforms for alternative assets like art, cars, and sports collectibles were thriving, but precious gems and jewelry, often considered 'passion assets,' remained underrepresented. We are here to fill this gap, focusing first on fractional investment opportunities before evolving into a broader model catering to ultra-high-net-worth investors and family offices.""

Her new wealthtech startup initially explored fractional ownership, even registering with the SEC to allow everyday investors access to precious gems. However, they soon found that the retail investor market was shifting. As consumer spending declined due to inflation, fractional ownership models also lost their appeal. ""We realized that the fees were incredibly high and the unit economics, while seemingly efficient, were actually quite the opposite."" This led to a swift pivot toward an accredited investor model that better aligns with the needs of family offices, where investors are both financially sophisticated and typically more familiar with and passionate about luxury experiences.

The wealthtech startup is now poised to expand its portfolio and Auslander is excited ahead of the next investment adventure. Literally. ""One of the most exciting new additions is the Thoroughbreds vertical, which taps into the deeply rooted connections between luxury and the world of horse racing."" ""Thoroughbreds are the ultimate symbol of luxury,"" she explained, pointing to brands like Porsche, Ferrari, and Hermès, which have all used the horse as a symbol of elegance and power.

Financial Returns and Life-Enriching Experiences

Luxury, which has traditionally meant owning rare, high-value assets is now redefined. ""Traditional luxury ownership is very expensive and often limited to purchasing with no real added value beyond the asset itself,"" Auslander explained. ""Now, you're not just buying a piece of jewelry or a rare gem. You're getting the chance to experience luxury in a way that enhances both the cultural and financial value of that asset.""

According to Auslander, this unique weathertech startup provides three main pillars, the 3-E's: Exposure, Education, and Experience. ""We offer exposure to the finest luxury assets at optimal prices, education from top-tier experts to inform purchasing decisions, and curated luxury experiences at globally renowned events like the Kentucky Derby or Royal Ascot. ""We give investors the best of both worlds: financial returns and life-enriching experiences.""

Active Asset Management

One key advantage the startup offers is active asset management. Unlike traditional luxury ownership, where asset value fluctuates on the open market, they collaborate with brands to enhance value over several years. Assets are eventually sold through traditional channels or auctions, delivering significant returns. ""We treat our newest offering, LEAF, the first fund to combine alternative assets with experiences, much like real estate investments, acquiring trophy assets, managing them, and selling after three to seven years,"" Auslander explained. ""This model democratizes access to valuable assets while aligning with the goals of ultra-high-net-worth individuals.""

LUXUS has deliberately cultivated a highly selective community of investors, focusing on accredited family offices and high-net-worth principals. Despite the global desire to own luxury, the company has made a point of not targeting retail investors, citing high customer acquisition costs (CAC) and the unsuitability of niche strategies for a broader audience. ""Our core audience is family offices and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. We believe these investors are not only financially savvy but also inherently drawn to luxury experiences."" The platform's community-building efforts have already led to meaningful connections among its members, with investors traveling together and sharing insights across sectors such as art, luxury, and culture. ""We screen and vet all our investors very carefully. We don't compromise on privacy or quality,"" she emphasized.

The Future of Luxury and Technology

More than luxury investments, Auslander claims it's about enhancing the experience through technology. The platform has developed a user-friendly tech stack that combines investment and experience activities into a seamless, frictionless journey. ""As far as we know, we're the first alternative asset manager to do this,"" Auslander said proudly.

Looking ahead, the company is also developing AI-driven tools to offer more personalized insights and opportunities for investors. ""We're always thinking about how we can improve and innovate. Technology is key to streamlining access to these exclusive assets and experiences.""

Flexibility Is the New Luxury: A Modern Path to Timeless Value

Ultimately, it seems it is more than an investment platform. It represents a broader shift in how people think about luxury and wealth management and how they can play an active role. With the rise of family offices and the transfer of generational wealth, it is now positioned to meet the needs of a new generation of investors, those who value experiences just as much as financial returns. As Auslander put it, ""The investor and the collector are the same person. If we can offer both roles in one platform, we've succeeded."""
Oil Prices Rise Again As Concerns About Middle East Conflict Escalate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/02/oil-prices-rise-again-as-concerns-about-middle-east-conflict-escalate/,2024-10-02T13:27:17Z,"Crude oil prices rose again Wednesday as traders priced in heightened concerns about violence in the Middle East.

Despite the recent bump, oil prices remain far cheaper than they were this summer, with Brent down 14% from its July peak, and far lower than the more than $100 per barrel it stood for much of 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""While the geopolitical risk premium rose on Tuesday...this premium remains moderate,"" explained Goldman Sachs oil strategist Yulia Zhestkova Grigsby in a Wednesday note to clients, adding it's ""likely"" due to an otherwise favorable setup for production.

Crude oil prices most directly make their way to consumers as they heavily influence gasoline prices, but they also can lead to higher prices across the board as higher production costs make their way to final prices of goods. The climb in oil prices may throw a wrench in the Federal Reserve's inflation fight, but the volatile commodity is still well within its normal range of the last year, amid demand concerns from China, the top oil consumer outside of the U.S., and a proposed increase in production from Saudi Arabia, the top oil producer in the Middle East."
Yellen Is Wrong About Financial Regulation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/norbertmichel/2024/10/02/yellen-is-wrong-about-financial-regulation/,2024-10-02T12:48:52Z,"One of the best ways to kill the vibe at any party is to bring up financial market regulation. Few people want to discuss the theory behind it, much less the details of our regulatory framework, and who can blame them?

On the other hand, most policymakers inside the beltway view this regulatory framework as sacred. They're happy to talk about it, but only if you want to expand it.

I'm positive, though, that only a select few members of Congress know many of the details. And if the rest did spend the time to dig in, they would recognize three things: There was no substantive deregulation of financial markets in the last century; regulating to safeguard financial stability was not invented after the 2008 financial crisis; and much of the theory behind the post-2008 regime is little more than wishful thinking.

For those interested, there is a great debate here.

On the establishment side, we have folks like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Even though she claims to have ""focused on financial stability"" throughout her career, she believes it was productive to enact ""new macroprudential policies focused on mitigating systemic risk"" in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

She argues that these regulations have ""strengthened the financial system,"" but she offers no direct evidence. (Yes, many banks have higher capital now versus 2007, but that could have been achieved without passing any new laws, much less the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.) And if those new regulations worked so well, it stands to reason Yellen should not have had to bail out uninsured depositors in three banks that failed in 2023. If that bailout was necessary to save the world from financial catastrophe, those regulations could not have work as advertised.

Yellen also believes in Dodd-Frank's Financial Stability Oversight Council.

For those lucky enough to be unaware, the FSOC is the multi-regulator council that is supposed to reduce future government bailouts by, among other things, identifying threats to financial stability. As hard as it is to believe, Congress decided that even though the United States already had more than 10 financial regulators who failed to even see a financial crisis coming, a good solution was to give those regulators even more responsibility.

Yellen recently argued that the FSOC was necessary to give regulators ""a more holistic view of and approach to risks."" Again, the idea that nobody was regulating systemic risk prior to the creation of FSOC, in a holistic way or any other way, is undeniably false.

Regardless, here's the kind of riveting risk analysis the FSOC produces. It's 2019 annual report stated that ""Firms with high levels of debt may be vulnerable to unexpected financial or economic events that may negatively affect their repayment and refinancing capacity."" Who knew?

And in 2022, with Yellen as Treasury Secretary, the FSOC warned that the commercial real estate market ""faces a more uncertain outlook given elevated inflation, rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and the potential for structural changes in behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

If it really is too much to expect the folks at the Fed and the FDIC to know about this uncertain outlook, Congress has all the evidence it needs to restructure the regulatory framework.

I'm much more aligned with my colleague, Mark Calabria, former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and former FSOC member. In his retrospective 2023 book, Calabria wrote ""This may be the FSOC's real strength, pointing out problems in our financial system for which none of its members bear any authority or responsibility.""

Although I do think the FSOC has been rather useless, I am still highly critical of the theory behind its creation. The last way to prevent large bailouts, for instance, is to have federal regulators pre-identify those firms they believe pose excessive systemic risk.

But that's what the FSOC is supposed to do.

The theory behind the FSOC is that regulators can impose regulations to prevent financial crises. But we already know that premise is false. Worse, we know that government policies tend to be a main contributing factor in virtually all such events throughout history.

That's all bad enough, but if we accept the theory behind the FSOC arrangement, we cannot possibly accept the theory behind the superiority of the free enterprise system.

It may not be so obvious, but the truth is that, if a massive bank were to fail, it would present no greater danger to people's ability to earn a living than the failure of a company like Walmart, Ford, or Home Depot. In each case, we're talking about millions of people's money and their ability to earn more of it.

If we accept the notion that financial firms cannot exist without heavy-handed regulation to prevent calamity, then we must also accept the same for nonfinancial companies.

More broadly, federal regulators should not be empowered to stop people from engaging in financial or economic activities the regulators believe are too risky. As I've argued for years, the mere existence of the FSOC is wholly incompatible with the functioning of a dynamic private capital market. Congress should eliminate it, reduce invasive federal regulation, and stop giving bureaucrats the power to micromanage financial risks."
6.5 Trillion Reasons Why This 6% Dividend Will Soar,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/02/65-trillion-reasons-why-this-6-dividend-will-soar/,2024-10-02T12:48:38Z,"Right now, there's $6.5 trillion in cash sitting on the sidelines -- and a big slice of it is about to drop straight into a select group of dividend stocks.

We're going to ""front run"" that cash wave today -- and set ourselves up for income (I'm talking 6%+ yields here) and gains as this cash wave starts to build.

In a sec, I'll name two dividend-payers sitting right in the path of this freed-up cash. One is a true ""dividend unicorn,"" shelling out an outsized 6% payout that grows. The other has doubled its dividend in just the last five years.

Let's start by breaking down that $6.5 trillion figure: It's the amount of cash in parked money-market funds today.

Here's why a big chunk of it is likely to shake loose: Rates on money-market funds float, and the Fed Funds rate -- which Jay Powell, of course, just started slashing -- has a strong pull on them.

As yields on money-market funds (and savings accounts and the like) fall, more ""new money"" will bypass them and go into dividend stocks instead. Meantime, today's money-market investors will ""stretch"" for higher yields and payout growth. Here again, dividend stocks will be the beneficiaries.

It's already happening:

Above you can see the rapid growth in money-market holdings since the Fed started raising rates in early 2022. Since the second quarter of that year -- or about two years ago -- the total has jumped a staggering 30%, to just over $6.5 trillion.

You can also see (at the top right), that the inflow has slowed. It's no coincidence that's happened as yields on money-market funds like the popular Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor Fund (VMFXX) flatline:

You can see the fund's yield stair-step higher as the Fed hiked rates to 5.25% to 5.5%, then go flat as the Fed held rates from mid-2023 till this month's 50-point cut.

Let me be clear: I'm not saying the entire $6.5 trillion is going to go into stocks.

Plenty of folks will always be drawn by the promise of a guaranteed principal. But even if money-market holdings simply drop back to where they were two years ago, we're talking about $1.5-trillion making a move here.

And that doesn't include new money that bypasses these lower-paying money-market funds. Or any freed-up cash in savings accounts and CDs as they mature.

In fact, this transition is already happening, and in a surprising place, too: riskier high-yield, or ""junk,"" bonds.

Check out these big gains from the corporate-bond closed-end funds (CEFs) we held in my Contrarian Income Report service from November 2023 to now:

These are big moves for bond funds, especially for our two municipal-bond funds, NEA and NAD. These gains happened in lockstep with the slowing flow into money-market funds, and this trade is still working in our favor -- though after these funds' strong runs, I do rate them as ""holds"" today.

While we wait, though, let's dive into those two dividend payers I mentioned earlier.

Our first stock, payment processor Mastercard (MA) is in the pole position not only as more cash moves into stocks but from another shift few people are talking about.

I'm talking about the rising odds we'll not get a soft or hard landing in the economy -- but no landing at all. In that setup, the economy ticks along and inflation comes back.

Not great, I know, and we discussed it in detail last Tuesday. The upshot is that government spending is out of control, outrunning tax receipts by almost $2 trillion.

Give me an extra $2 trillion and I'll show you a strong economy! But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation -- and overwhelm Jay Powell.

This is one reason why those bond funds I mentioned earlier are holds for now. As I said, the trade is still going our way, but we're watching it closely, as any move toward higher rates would hurt bond prices (as rates and bond prices move inversely).

But the other part of this story -- a humming economy -- is great for Mastercard (MA), which takes a slice of each payment that rolls down its network.

And talk about pricing power: The credit-card market is basically controlled by four companies: Visa (V), with a 53% share, Mastercard (MA), at 24%, American Express (AXP), at 20% and Discover Financial Services (DFS).

Mastercard doesn't win many income fans with its tiny 0.5% yield, but payout growth is the story here: This dividend has doubled in the last five years, pulling up the share price with it:

If you've followed me for a while, you know I talk a lot about the ""Dividend Magnet"" -- a stock's tendency to track its payout higher.

You can see it in action here. The current gap between the two is a snapshot of the stock's upside as it ""snaps back"" to the payout. The low payout ratio (Mastercard pays just 21% of free cash flow as dividends) virtually locks in further growth, even if I'm wrong and the economy does slow from here.

Mastercard is a great stock, but let's be honest, it'll take years for its payout growth to inflate the yield on a buy made today. That's where casino landlord Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) comes in.

Before you say it, yes, I know a casino stock might sound like an odd pick to attract money-market-fund investors. But I'm pretty sure a growing 6% dividend won't take long to convince them! And hey, if folks really are migrating to junk bonds from money-market funds, why not a stock like GLPI?

Plus, the stock has lots of strengths that make it far from a gamble (sorry, couldn't resist).

For one, it's diversified across the country, with 65 casinos in 20 states. That's key, because if the job market continues to slow, concerned workers might cancel their Vegas trip, but they'll likely still hit up their local casino.

Second GLPI's tenants are signed under ""triple-net"" leases that provide a stable, predictable income stream.

Moreover, under these leases, the tenant pays the full cost of running and maintaining the company's properties. Which is great news -- can you imagine what this electricity bill looks like?

But the real standout for us income-seekers is that as a real estate investment trust (REIT), GLPI is exempt from corporate taxes so long as it pays out 90% of its profits as dividends. The savings help fund that high payout.

And as mentioned, GLPI has been quick to share its rising cash flow through payout growth -- including special dividends (the spikes and dips in the chart below):

The REIT's regular dividend was cut in the 2020 lockdowns, but that's understandable and the cut was modest: just 14%.

And GLPI quickly got back to its winning ways, boosting the payout since. And as with Mastercard, we've got a powerful Dividend Magnet working for us here, too.

More payout hikes are likely. GLPI's revenue rose 6.7% in the latest quarter, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, the key REIT profitability metric) rose 5.6%. The company also pays an estimated 81% of the midpoint of its forecast 2024 AFFO as dividends, a reasonable amount for a REIT."
Wars And Strikes Put Market On Edge,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/02/wars-and-strikes-put-market-on-edge/,2024-10-02T12:40:53Z,"Jerome Powell Hints At Smaller Rate Cuts Amid Rising Uncertainty

Stocks got off to an auspicious start for October as tensions in the Middle East ratcheted higher and a dockworkers' strike injected and extra dose of volatility. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%. Small cap stocks were also hit with the Russell 2000 dropping 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the best performing industry, but it too was down 0.4%.

Tuesday morning began with a mixture of economic news that showed prices moderating further but a higher than forecast number of job openings in the most recent JOLTs report. However, markets barely had time to digest that data before escalating hostilities in the Middle East took center stage when Iran launched a barrage of missiles aimed at Israel. While damage was limited, the increasing hostilities sent November crude oil futures higher by as much as 5% before settling down some and closing up nearly 4%. Israel has vowed retaliation against Iran and the question now becomes, just how bad the situation will become. In premarket, oil is trading higher by more than 3%.

At the same time, back here at homes, workers from the International Longshoremen Association (ILA) went on strike shutting down ports along the East and Gulf Coasts. According to The Wall Street Journal the ILA unloads around 60%, or $588 billion, of all containerized trade that comes through those coastal ports. Ports will often shut down for things such as hurricanes and therefore, a day or two of closures would have a nominal impact on the economy. However, as the strike lingers, estimates range widely for just what an extended work stoppage would mean.

For markets, I think the most concerning aspect of an extended strike and conflict in the Middle East is the potential for it to reintroduce inflation at a time where it seems like the Fed may have actually achieved a soft landing. In his remarks Monday, Jerome Powell talked about further rate cuts but suggested they may not be as aggressive as September's half-point cut. Currently, the CME Fed Watch Tool is assigning a 63% probability of a quarter-point cut in November and 37% chance of a half-point. This is something I'm keeping my eye on.

Some individual stocks I'm watching include Humana. That stock is down in premarket trading by 24% as membership in high-rating Medicare plans is expected to fall. Apple is lower by 0.5% after analyst downgrades. Meantime, Home Depot is higher following an increased price target of $455 from Piper Sandler. That is up from $387. The narrative here is that with interest rates lower, homeowners will look at making repairs prior to putting their homes on the market. If that does turn out to be the case, I'll be interested to see if other companies such as Lowe's also see upgrades. Finally, shares of Nike are down 7% in premarket following their earnings. Revenues fell 10% and profits were down 28% year-over-year. The company also was unwilling to offer a full year forecast after recently replacing their CEO.

For today, markets will likely be preoccupied with the situation in the Middle East, and the slightly stronger than expected ADP payroll number. The conflict between Israel and Iran is very much in danger of becoming more widespread as we await the next move. Between China's slowing economy and resultant stimulus measures, a strike that could reignite inflation, the upcoming U.S. election, wars on multiple fronts, earnings season just over a week away and wide-ranging speculation as to the state of our own economy, it should come as no surprise that volatility is increasing. The VIX is trading near 19.5 in premarket and with Friday's employment report looming, I would not be surprised to see it hold here or potentially even increase. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."

Like many, I have watched in horror as countless friends in my former home of North Carolina have been unable to reach their loved ones.

Hurricane Helene wiped out communities and infrastructure in the Southeast, claiming more than 160 lives as one of the 10 deadliest storms in U.S. history, according to USA Today. AccuWeather estimates the damage will range between $95 billion and $110 billion.

It will be a long recovery, and the region is in need of support. To make sure your assistance gets to those who need it, be sure to check the credentials of potential organizations and use caution when donating to individuals to avoid any potential scams.

A few charities accepting Helene-specific donations include: the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen and Airbnb.org, which helps people find a temporary place to stay.

Alice Walton, America's richest woman, just reported her largest known charitable gift to date, including $249 million to help fund a new medical school in her name in her family's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Forbes estimates that Walton, the only daughter of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton, has now given away $1.5 billion in her lifetime, making her one of the 30 biggest lifetime givers nationwide.

Iran fired rockets at Israel Tuesday, the Israeli military said, potentially escalating the war in the Middle East as Iran took responsibility for the attack and warned it is only a ""first wave."" In a statement read on state television, Iran said the attack was retaliation for the killings of multiple Hezbollah leaders, according to the Associated Press.

Aerospace and defense stocks reached all-time highs, a grim market reaction to the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Defense stocks typically see gains during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts.

Fred Thiel, the CEO of major bitcoin miner MARA, spoke with Forbes about how it is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, as well as U.S. politics and the outlook for the crypto mining industry. He says that retail investors give small competitors too much credit for AI plays that will not pay off for years.

Since porn entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky purchased OnlyFans in 2018, it has gone from being a little-known U.K.-based company to earning $485 million in profits on $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023. Its popularity unleashed a massive payday for Radvinsky, who debuted on this year's Forbes 400 list with an estimated net worth of $3.8 billion.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has long ranked as either the richest or second-richest person on the annual Forbes 400 list, but even with his $107 billion fortune, he dropped to No. 9 this year, down from No. 6 a year ago. A major reason for his fall in the rankings is his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates, his wife of 27 years.

Less than 2,500 people live in the small town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, but it's also home to several rare mines for ultra-pure quartz critical to semiconductor production. Operations have been shut down for more than five days due to impacts from Hurricane Helene, according to the News & Observer, but even when mines can reopen, extensive damage to surrounding roads and rail lines is expected to disrupt global supply chains.

In his latest feud with a government official, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken issue with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch date delays and fines related to alleged SpaceX violations, escalating to direct attacks on agency administrator Michael Whitaker. The dustup could preview how Musk might tackle government efficiency while working in a possible Trump Administration, an idea the former president has floated.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, faced off in a mostly polite yet policy-heavy vice presidential debate Tuesday night. But one of the more tense moments was a heated back-and-forth related to the false claims Vance spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, leading CBS News to cut Vance and Walz's mics.

MORE: Forbes recently looked at how the two candidates compare on assets like real estate, pensions, salaries and more. Vance's earnings from his bestseller Hillbilly Elegy helped him amass an estimated $10 million compared to former public school teacher Walz's wealth of about $1 million.

A massive dockworker strike that began Tuesday comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, but experts are split on whether it will have a major impact on the economy. The strike could cost the U.S. economy between $3 billion and $4.5 billion daily, according to estimates from Jefferies and JPMorgan, but significant fallout would only occur if the strike lasts more than the ""base case"" of a ""few days,"" Bank of America analysts led by Nathan Gee noted.

TOPLINE Palantir, which builds software to help other businesses gather, manage and analyze their data, at first with secretive government agencies like the CIA and now also with commercial customers, had a banner year.

Palantir took off, with annual revenue increasing more than 20% over the last year to $2.5 billion, and it flipped the switch on profitability -- going from a net loss of $50 million in June 2023 to net income of $400 million a year later. The record year was capped by its addition to the S&P 500 in September.

The company's growth is in part because many of its data software products meshed with the wave of AI hype.

No surprise then that shares are up 134% over the past year, making Palantir the most expensive stock in the S&P in terms of revenue multiples -- more so even than chip design darling Nvidia. Palantir's meteoric rise has earned CEO Alex Karp a spot on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time, worth an estimated $3.6 billion, thanks to his Palantir stake and $1 billion or so in cash from stock sales as of September 1, the day we finalized net worths for our list.

But should it be that expensive, trading at a market valuation that's 36 times its annual revenue? Analysts aren't sure: only five of the 20 that cover Palantir give the company a ""buy"" rating, with the remainder split between hold and sell ratings.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria drew a parallel between the company and Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, when the EV company was trading at all-time highs in 2021. ""Tesla for a very long period of time traded well above any valuation or comparable metric that you could point to. The reason was people were really excited about the mission and about the prospects.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400, the definitive ranking of America's richest people, is important because enormous wealth comes with immense power, and the public should know who is doing what with their power,"" says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu.

""As such, Karp's addition to The Forbes 400 and Palantir's too-high valuation show that what he and his company stand for -- Western values, American defense and artificial intelligence -- are especially relevant in today's economic, cultural and geopolitical landscape. It's worth watching what happens with the ever-controversial, ever-secretive (despite being publicly traded!) firm in the coming months and years.""

LGBTQ+ people who undergo ""conversion therapy"" are more likely to experience poor mental health than those who haven't, a new study found. While scientifically discredited, the practice is still prevalent in some states:

149: The number of participants studied who had experienced conversion therapy aimed at altering their sexual orientation

23: The number of states that ban conversion therapy for minors, including Washington D.C.

1,320: The number of conversion therapy practices across 48 states and Washington, D.C., according to 2023 research from the Trevor Project

A slew of new retirement rules and changes to tax law will affect almost everyone. For instance, starting in 2026, employees 50 and older who are deemed 'high-earning' will only be able to make catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. And if you have money left over in a 529 college savings plan, a law went into effect this year allowing penalty-free rollovers from 529 plans to a Roth IRA.

"Mortgage Rates Today: October 2, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-02-24/,2024-10-02T11:59:00Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Today, the mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.70%, according to Curinos, while the average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.74%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.73%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) inched up to 6.70% from 6.65% yesterday. One week ago, the 30-year fixed was 6.68%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.71%. This time last week, it was 6.67%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At today's interest rate of 6.70%, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000 will pay $645 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. In total interest, you'd pay $132,181 over the life of the loan.

Today's 15-year mortgage (fixed-rate) is 5.74%, up 0.03 percentage point from the previous week. The same time last week, the 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.71%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.77%. It was 5.72% a week earlier.

A 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage with today's interest rate of 5.74% will cost $830 per month in principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage (not including taxes and insurance). In this scenario, borrowers would pay approximately $49,368 in total interest.

On a 30-year jumbo, the average interest rate is 6.73%, lower than it was at this time last week. The average rate was 6.74% at this time last week.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.73% will pay $647 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,855 and you'd pay around $997,627 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy -- including its interest rate hikes, which it's using to restrain inflation -- is the primary factor that's pushing long-term mortgage rates higher. The state of the economy and housing market also affects mortgage rates. As for what interest rate the lender might offer you, this depends on your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and credit score, both of which indicate your risk as a borrower.

Related: Mortgage Rate Forecast & Trends For 2024

Shop around and talk to various lenders to get a sense of each company's mortgage loan offerings and services. Don't go with the first lender quote you receive; instead, compare the best mortgage rate quotes to get a deal. In particular, consider what fees they charge, what fees they're willing to waive and what closing assistance they might provide. Make sure any special offers or discounts don't come at the cost of a higher mortgage rate.

Be sure to apply with each lender within a 45-day window. During this window, you can have multiple lenders pull your credit history without additional impact on your credit score.

Mortgage rates remain elevated, and the nation's housing supply remains limited. The low inventory is preventing house prices from dropping. Meanwhile, the combination of high mortgage rates and appreciated home values will continue to present an obstacle for many prospective homebuyers seeking affordable housing.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term."
"Gen Z: They Highly Value ""Values,"" But It's No Dealbreaker",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliadhar/2024/10/02/gen-z-they-highly-value-values-but-its-no-dealbreaker/,2024-10-02T11:49:50Z,"Gen Z, the 69.3 million U.S. teenagers and young adults who are expected to make up nearly a third of the U.S. workforce by 2030, may be the most idealistic generation since the Baby Boomers.

You remember the boomers, don't you? They're the workplace veterans who've been retiring at a rate of about 10,000 a day for the past several years. Gen Zers, in many cases, are filling their slots -- though the youngest Gen Zers are still in middle school.

The boomers have left their mark, not only on the workplace, but on society as well. They played a major role in the civil rights battles of the 1960s, spearheaded efforts to end the Vietnam War, and helped create the environmental movement, which spawned Earth Day in 1970 and, more recently, raised awareness of climate change, ""forever chemicals,"" and other concerns.

They also clashed with authorities on campus and elsewhere, often in defense of free speech, and they mainstreamed protest songs as folk music. Shy they weren't.

Now, fast forward to today's Gen Zers -- the boomers' grandkids -- who are equally passionate about certain issues: climate, diversity, equality, peace, sustainability.

But be cautious: because Gen Z itself is hardly a monolith. And many Gen Zers, still in their early teens, lack the knowledge and maturity to make informed decisions.

So, when I discuss what's valued most by Gen Z, it's important to note that I'm focusing on the working-age cohort, those 18 and older.

Many of these Gen Zers have expectations that were unusual in their grandparents' day: They want their employers to embrace their values, even when their employers have large, diverse customer bases and workforces that are divided on the issues that energize Gen Z.

One of the indisputable facts of life is that it's much easier to be idealistic when there's little or no cost -- when jobs are plentiful, for example, and the number of people seeking jobs is far less so.

This was the case after the pandemic when many Gen Zers were first entering the labor market. At the end of January 2022, for example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 11.3 million U.S. job openings. The number of unemployed individuals looking for work at the time, BLS reported separately, was just 6.5 million. In that kind of labor market, job candidates can be choosy about where they work.

And many were. Nearly half (44%) of Gen Zers indicated in one recent survey that they'd turned down job opportunities because they didn't align with their personal ethics or beliefs; 46% said they had changed jobs, or planned to, due to ""environmental impact concerns.""

As one Gen Z colleague told us, ""I think of company ethics as a minimum standard to meet ... to even consider applying.""

And climate and the environment are hardly Gen Z's only concerns. As another Zer commented: ""When choosing where to work, I looked at leadership: Is the leadership diverse? Do I see women? POC [People of Color]? What are their pipelines, support systems, mentorship?""

So, values count.

They count to the organizations hiring Gen Zers as well. As Ashley Grice, CEO of BCG Brighthouse, told me, ""When corporate values are embedded in the culture of an organization like muscle memory"" the organization is better able to ""unite towards one vision, a single set of strategies, a consistent set of messages.

""Embedded values act as guardrails that help us row in the same direction ... [and] facilitate mindful, quicker, and consistent decision-making, even in highly decentralized organizations."" Just as important, she reminded me, they give Gen Zers -- ""a generation trained in the art of working from an independent space and unabashed about expressing its point of view"" -- clear guidelines to consider, even as they seek kudos and hurrahs from their YouTube followers, Facebook and TikTok friends, and LinkedIn connections. Because virtually everything that happens in a Gen Zer's life is often on display on social media.

Consequently, many Gen Zers feel a heightened responsibility to ensure their choices are ethically defensible.

Fortunately, Gen Zers are not alone in their concern about values. Many (perhaps most) CEOs share similar concerns, and often similar values.

An insightful interview last December on Simon Sinek's ""A Bit of Optimism"" podcast drives the point home. Sinek's guest was Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, a company whose employee roster -- some 2.1 million worldwide, 1.6 million in the U.S. -- is larger than the populations of many countries.

McMillon has been with the company full time since 1991, but worked in a Walmart warehouse before that -- when he was a teenager.

Without putting it in so many words, McMillon made the point that company values evolve over time. Walmart's great leap forward occurred in 2005, when then CEO Harold Lee Scott Jr. mobilized the retail giant to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. ""Okay,"" Scott asked his team afterwards (which included McMillon by then), ""what would it take for us to be that company every day?"" McMillon's Walmart provides an answer.

McMillon says he has an advantage over many other CEOs because the Walton family ""still owns about half"" the company. ""They have a long-term view. They care about things like values and purpose. When I meet with them, they ask me about things like becoming a regenerative company, working on sustainability. How are our associates doing? Are we paying enough? Talk to me about healthcare."" While other CEOs are worrying about the next quarterly earnings report, McMillon can worry about ""taking care of people and pushing harder.""

There are lessons here for Gen Zers:

· The future is closer than you realize. Look at what McMillon was doing when he was your age.

· Be patient. Change usually occurs gradually. If you want your employer to move in a certain direction, get involved and help make it happen.

· Prioritize. Gen Zers are trying to become financially independent following a difficult inflationary period. A recent Cigna survey identified ""money worries"" as ""a major cause of stress"" among Gen Z. So, while you may be idealistic and issue-oriented, you also need to pay the rent and put food on the table. Perhaps that's why surveys consistently show that Gen Zers rank compensation above other job concerns. That's called prioritizing."
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

Economic Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/margooge/2024/10/02/project-2025-offers-a-false-choice-climate-action-vs-economic-growth/,2024-10-02T10:14:04Z,"When Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for a future Trump administration, came up in the presidential debate, Donald Trump equivocated, calling some of the ideas ""good"" and others ""bad.""

It's impossible to say exactly what policies a second Trump administration would pursue, but Trump embraced The Heritage Foundation's ""A Mandate for Leadership"" proposal in his first year in office. And in April 2022 he said Heritage was ""going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.""

One of Project 2025's most alarming proposals targets public health as it would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to set and enforce environmental standards. Before EPA was created, our country suffered pollution so bad that rivers caught on fire and our cities were choked by smog. EPA protections have cleaned up our air and water for 50 years and saved countless lives - the Clean Air Act alone prevented an estimated 230,000premature deaths in 2020.

These environmental protections are particularly important for low-income and marginalized communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution and environmental degradation. Biden's EPA climate policies focus on public health and environmental justice by strengthening emissions standards and regulating air pollution, and are on track to save 200,000 lives by 2050.

Rolling back these protections, as Project 2025 proposes, would reverse these gains and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Americans, causing 2,100 early deaths by 2030 by increasing air pollution - nearly as much as the total U.S. military deaths in the Afghanistan war.

Project 2025 targets climate initiatives implemented under the Biden administration. The authors falsely claim that EPA regulations are ""burdensome"" and stifle economic growth, particularly in transportation and energy. But that's not true. EPA policies drive innovation and growth.

In reality, the very rules Project 2025 seeks to dismantle have catalyzed unprecedented economic growth across America. EPA's climate policies -- combined with incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act -- have sparked unprecedented investment, particularly in clean energy and transportation. As of 2024, annual investment in new manufacturing hit $225 billion, a record high even after adjusting for inflation.

The electric vehicle market is a prime example. EPA vehicle tailpipe emissions standards, along with IRA incentives, have spurred $312 billion in EV and battery manufacturing, making the United States a global leader in clean transportation investments. Fueled by the incentives, the U.S. EV market grew 40% in 2023, to 1.4 million units.

These investments have tangible economic impacts, making the shift to clean technologies an engine of job creation and economic revitalization. EV and battery manufacturing has created 195,000 high-paying jobs from factories in Michigan and Ohio to tech development in California, directly boosting local economies in areas hit hardest by the decline of traditional manufacturing.

The IRA's economic benefits are so obvious that in July, 18 Republican Members of Congress wrote the Speaker of the House urging him not to repeal IRA provisions, saying ""energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country.""

Biden administration policies have also supercharged job growth in the renewable energy sector, cutting fossil fuel dependence and reshaping the energy landscape to benefit our environment and economy. The solar industry added nearly 16,000 jobs in 2023 to hit 280,000 total jobs, the highest level in history, and wind turbine service technician is the fastest-growing occupation in America. Meanwhile utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of electricity generation in the U.S., at $27-$29 per megawatt-hour. Compare that to oil and coal products, which along with oil and gas extraction have the highest indirect impact on inflation of any commodity in the U.S. economy

By 2023, renewables accounted for 21% of U.S. electricity generation, outpacing coal, which dropped to 16%. The Biden administration's policies, which include federal tax credits for solar and wind projects, are ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the global clean energy transition.

Clean energy is the future: It's cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels, providing long-term economic benefits that far outweigh the short-term profits of oil, gas, and coal. Failing to recognize this will drive our economy into economic stagnation - Moody's Analytics forecasts Project 2025 would trigger a recession in less than a year. That's not even considering Project 2025's climate change impacts, which would add 4.9 million metric tons of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, about the same as Germany emits every year.

Today, the United States' global economic competitiveness is at stake, more than ever. Following Project 2025's prescription risks the future of EVs, renewable energy, and green jobs. That would cede America's progress on national climate goals and hand over the global energy economy to China and Europe.

Clean energy accounted for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023, and global clean energy investment hit $1.8 trillion last year. America can tap this potential -- unless we let Project 2025 derail our progress.

China is already the world's biggest EV producer with about 60% of global sales and is also the largest EV exporter, accounting for 19% of EU sales. In clean energy, China invested $890 billion in clean energy in 2023, almost as much as total global fossil fuel investment. Falling behind in the clean economic race means losing out on trillions of dollars in future market opportunities and millions of lost jobs in booming industries.

The core environmental argument of Project 2025 -- that we must choose between climate action and economic growth -- is a false choice. It simply doesn't hold up.

Between 1970 and 2019, the Clean Air Act reduced air pollution from vehicles, factories, and other sources by 77%. If Project 2025's authors were correct, those historic environmental gains should have cost grave economic contraction. Instead, during that same time, U.S. GDP grew 285% and job growth rose 223%. By comparison, implementing Project 2025's energy provisions would cost 1.7 million lost jobs by 2030 while imposing $32 billion in new energy costs on American households.

Biden's climate policies are not a burden -- they are the foundation of America's - and the world's - green future. These policies have driven innovation, created jobs, improved public health, and ensured America remains at the forefront of the global clean energy transition.

Project 2025's attempt to dismantle these critical protections and reverse decades of progress is wrong - we cannot afford to turn back the clock on climate action. The economic stakes are too high, the environmental risks too great, and the opportunities for growth and prosperity too vast to ignore. The future belongs to those who invest in clean energy, transportation and manufacturing, innovation, and sustainability.

Biden's climate policies have laid the foundation for that future, and we must embrace it, not scrap it."
Should You Pick CVS Stock At $65?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/02/should-you-pick-cvs-stock-at-65/,2024-10-02T10:05:16Z,"CVS Health stock (NYSE: CVS) currently trades at $65 per share, 37% below its pre-inflation shock high of $102 seen in February 2022. In contrast, its peer - Walgreens stock - is down 78% over this period, amid falling profitability. The decline in CVS stock can also be attributed to its declining profitability, amid higher medical service costs for its Medicare business (Aetna). CVS, in August, cut its 2024 earnings outlook for a third consecutive quarter. For CVS, its medical benefit ratio, which refers to health care costs as a percentage of premium revenues, surged to 90% for the six months period ending June 2024, versus 85.4% in the prior-year period. Owing to the underperformance of its Medicare business, CVS announced the exit of Brian Kane, head of Aetna, and $2 billion in cost cuts. The company is considering strategic review options, including a spin-off of Aetna. [1] CVS acquired Aetna for $70 billion in 2017.

CVS stock was trading at $86 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and is now 24% below that level, compared to 50% gains for the S&P 500 during this period. The performance of CVS stock with respect to the index over the recent years has been quite volatile. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the uncertain geopolitical environment, could CVS face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a strong jump? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $102 means that CVS stock will have to gain 58% from here, and we don't think this will materialize anytime soon. We estimate CVS Health's Valuation to be $66 per share, close to its current market price. Our forecast is based on a 10x P/E multiple for CVS and expected earnings of $6.61 on a per-share and adjusted basis for the full year 2024. The 10x P/E ratio is slightly lower than the stock's 11x average P/E ratio over the last three years. A slight decline in the valuation multiple makes sense in our view, given the fall in profitability.

Our detailed analysis of CVS Health's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

Watch The Vice Presidential Walz-Vance Debate Live Here

2020 - early 2021: Increase in money supply to cushion the impact of lockdowns led to high demand for goods; producers unable to match up. Early 2021: Shipping snarls and worker shortages from the coronavirus pandemic continue to hurt supply. April 2021: Inflation rates cross 4% and increase rapidly. Early 2022: Energy and food prices spike due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fed begins its rate hike process. June 2022: Inflation levels peak at 9% - the highest level in 40 years. The S&P 500 index declined more than 20% from peak levels. July - September 2022: Fed hikes interest rates aggressively - resulting in an initial recovery in the S&P 500 followed by another sharp decline. October 2022 - July 2023: Fed continues rate hike process; improving market sentiments helps S&P 500 recoup some of its losses. August 2023 - August 2024: Fed has kept interest rates unchanged to quell fears of a recession and keep inflation in check September 2023: Fed cut rates by 50 bps and pointed to more rate cuts going forward

In contrast, here's how CVS stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis

10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index 9/1/2008 - 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08) 3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index 12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008)

CVS and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis

CVS stock saw a 30% decline between October 2007 (pre-crisis peak) and March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It surged post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $23 in early 2010, rising about 28% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

CVS Fundamentals And Financial Position

CVS Health's revenue rose from $292 billion in 2021 to $363 billion in the last twelve months, led by increased prescription volume, pharmacy claims, and drug price inflation. However, the company's operating margin fell from 5.2% in 2021 to 3.4% now, amid a rise in medical costs. Its TTM earnings per share of $5.62 compares with $5.95 in 2021.

Looking at the company's financial position, CVS' total debt rose from $76 billion in 2021 to $84 billion now, while its cash increased from $13 billion to $16 billion over this period. The company also garnered $8 billion in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. CVS' market capitalization stands around $79 billion and a debt levels of $84 billion implies a very high debt-to-equity ratio of around 106%. This indicates that the firm's financial position is not robust.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiment, we believe CVS stock is fairly priced at levels of around $65. If the company decides to split into two separate entities, it may unlock more shareholder value, and drive the stock price higher. Still, its large debt and high medical benefit ratio remains key risks in realizing any significant gains.

While CVS stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how CVS Health's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Beware Kamala's 'fair share' lie on taxes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/beware-kamalas-fair-share-lie-taxes,2024-10-02T09:14:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris tries to articulate her economic plans, it is clear that she intends to continue to spend more money, and in doing so, also wants to raise taxes, at least for some Americans.

Her attempt at an explanation includes one tired refrain, a carry-over from the Biden-Harris agenda: the wealthy aren't paying their fair share and we need to get them to pay more.

What the wealthy pay in taxes cannot be characterized as fair, but not in the way that Harris explains.

According to Treasury data, federal income taxes account for about half of government revenue. Of those federal income taxes, per the Tax Foundation, about half of taxpayers paid around 98% of that total.

IRS MIGHT TAKE MORE OF YOUR MONEY UNDER KAMALA HARRIS

As you dig into the numbers, they become even more ""unfair.""

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation's data from 2021 showed that the top 1% of earners made 26.3% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), yet they paid 45.8% of federal income taxes. One percent of the people paying almost 46% of taxes is definitely not fair, but Harris wants more.

When the data is expanded, the top 10% of earners had 52.6% of AGI, but paid 75.8% of federal income taxes.

The bottom 50% of earners had 10.4% of AGI, but only paid just more than 2.3% of federal income taxes.

HERE'S WHAT KAMALA HARRIS' TAX ARMAGEDDON WILL COST YOU AND THE US ECONOMY

And, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of U.S. households pay no federal income taxes at all.

Those who pay abundantly for the federal government and its ""services"" are berated by Harris and friends that they aren't paying enough, which is then voted into being by the people who carry little to none of the federal income tax burden. That sounds... unfair.

What is also unfair is the creep of tax collections and overspending.

For FY 2024, the U.S. government is expected to take in, primarily from taxes, almost $5.1 trillion. That's an increase of around 47% from five years ago. It's a staggering amount, larger than the GDP of every country in the world, other than the U.S. and China. Yet, it's still not enough and the government plans to run a more than $2 trillion deficit on top of that. That's... unfair.

And, while we are talking about unfair taxes, let's not forget that the massive inflation that the Biden-Harris agenda unleashed upon all Americans, stealing their purchasing power, making the cost of everyday living a struggle, and putting the ability to invest and get ahead out of reach. As famed economist Milton Friedman once said, ""Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation."" That sounds... unfair.

The government spends too much, and it takes too much, particularly from those who have been successful, painting achievement and success as a punishable offense and government dependence as a virtue. That doesn't sound American, that sounds socialist at best.

Yet, Harris will say that those who have done well need to be further penalized, while continuing to overspend and devalue the earnings of all Americans. And that's before layering on any of her ultra-destructive proposals on top of raising income taxes, which include higher capital gains taxes, unrealized gains taxes, and other economically illiterate and ruinous policies.

When it comes to the government, what is unfair is how much they are taxing productive Americans, how many Americans have no skin in the game, and how much government spending is creating a fiscal train wreck.

Calling out that unfairness needs to be done over and over again."
Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Conservative social media reactions pour in declaring winner of VP debate: 'This was a massacre',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservative-social-media-reactions-pour-in-declaring-winner-vp-debate-massacre,2024-10-02T08:11:16Z,"A panel of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents give a show of hands in support of either JD Vance or Tim Walz after Tuesday nights Vice Presidential Debate.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION'

""Very proud of JD for a stellar performance tonight,"" former presidential candidate Vivek Ramasawmy posted on X. ""And my condolences to Tim Walz - it was unkind for them to put him in this position.""

""JD Vance won big and demonstrated why he was a fantastic pick by President Trump,"" Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X. ""He skillfully contrasted Trump's record of peace and prosperity with Kamala's record of disaster.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""
Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Now they know more, and on the basis of Tuesday night's performance, Vance might have won over a few folks. With the race a dead heat, everything matters."
"Vance rips Walz on economy, says he's forced to 'pretend' Trump didn't lower inflation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-rips-walz-economy-says-hes-forced-pretend-trump-didnt-lower-inflation,2024-10-02T02:26:25Z,"Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports the latest on the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance ripped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the Democratic Party's economic record, remarking Walz has a ""tough job"" simultaneously defending Vice President Kamala Harris' ""atrocious economic record"" while attacking former President Donald Trump on the economy.

""Honestly, Tim, I think he's got a tough job here because you've got to play Whac-A-Mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did,"" Vance said Tuesday evening during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Vance was responding after Walz slammed the GOP ticket as one that protects billionaires with tax cuts and pledging that he's a ""union guy"" who wants to keep jobs in the U.S.

Vance continued by saying Walz has to juggle defending Vice President Kamala Harris' economic record while slamming Trump.

""And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries and housing unaffordable for American citizens,"" Vance continued.

""I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt, so that she could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense economic principles.""

The economy is a top voter concern this election cycle, ranking alongside issues such as the immigration crisis, abortion and national security.

""I hope we have a conversation on health care then, senator,"" Walz said as Vance wrapped up his points on the economy.

""Please,"" Vance responded.

The debate marks the first time the pair have squared off against one another, and will likely be the only vice presidential debate this cycle."

NEW YORK CITY - With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there's a lot on the line in the vice presidential debate.

While debates between the running mates are the undercard of a White House race and have rarely moved the need much in the past, when Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats' nominee, face-off on Tuesday, there will be heightened stakes.

2025 Drug Plan Premiums: Under Control But In Flux,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianeomdahl/2024/10/01/2025-drug-plan-premiums-under-control-but-in-flux/,2024-10-01T23:35:32Z,"One of the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act is to lower drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The biggest step toward that goal will be the implementation of the $2,000 cap on Part D out-of-pocket costs starting in January 2025. Nearly 19 million Part D enrollees could save $400 and almost two million with the highest costs could save, on average, $2,500 per year.

Last year, Medicare took a baby step toward that goal by eliminating the 5% coinsurance in the Catastrophic Coverage payment stage. This should save approximately 1.5 million enrollees about $3,100 each this year.

Both these initiatives are saving seniors money. However, the out-of-pocket costs they used to pay do not go away; they just fall to a different payer. Drug plans will now have to pay a much bigger portion of those costs and, in response, plans are making some changes. For example, a comparison of 2023 and 2024 plans found that over one-third increased the enrollee's cost sharing, and monthly premiums in three ZIP codes increased 2%-84%.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service had projected that the average total monthly premium in 2024 would decrease 1.8% and premium stabilization measures would limit the growth of the base beneficiary premium to 6%. So, how was it possible for premiums to increase significantly? Simple answer: The monthly premium that enrollees pay is not addressed in the premium stabilization program. CMS has four different premiums, each with its own purpose, and these all mush together to create the monthly premium.

IRA initiatives, including the $2,000 cap, will save 18.7 million enrollees, on average, $400. Because this is a much more significant impact than elimination of the 5% coinsurance, CMS is rightfully concerned about the variation in premiums between stand-alone Part D plans and MA-PD plans (Medicare Advantage plans that include drug coverage). CMS noted that, ""The resulting premium changes could create disruptive enrollment shifts in the prescription drug plan market during the initial implementation of the IRA benefit improvements."" In other words, the significant increases in premiums for stand-alone Part D plans could lead enrollees to switch to MA-PD plans. (The average monthly plan premium is $18.50, while many plans have no premium.)

In response, CMS is conducting a voluntary premium stabilization demonstration that consists of three elements.

Note these important points about this demonstration.

On October 1, the Medicare Plan Finder revealed the 2025 Part D drug plans. On first glance, it appears the premium increases are somewhat under control but the marketplace is really being tossed around. Here are some findings from my quick scan of 10 ZIP codes around the country.

Although the full impact of the Part D benefit design changes is unknown, drug plan enrollees are in for a crazy ride. I plan to do a deeper dive on the premiums and costs but let this serve as a wake-up call. If you don't check out your plan, you will likely be in for some unpleasant surprises in 2025. For example, those who are have plans that are disappearing will be enrolled automatically in another plan, unless they make a change before December 7. Others face a significant change in premiums.

I was asked recently what everyone should do differently during this most important Open Enrollment Period. My response, ""Study the Annual Notice."" Historically, only three of 10 have paid attention. Let's all try to do a better job."
Byron Donalds spars with 'Breakfast Club' hosts over Harris' economic record: 'You sure you want to go there?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/byron-donalds-spars-breakfast-club-hosts-over-harris-economic-record-you-sure-you-want-go-there,2024-10-01T23:15:48Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to the border and her insistence that she will fix the immigration crisis as president.

Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., accused Vice President Kamala Harris of breaking the economy during a heated exchange on ""The Breakfast Club,"" where he sparred with hosts over her role in handling the current inflation plaguing the U.S.

A discussion on Tuesday's episode of the show devolved into a fiery exchange between the lawmaker and the hosts after he blamed Harris for the failed economic policies of the Biden administration.

""I would argue we're not really thriving right now. This inflation, which by the way was brought to us by Kamala Harris, has really slowed people down from being able to excel,"" Donalds said.

VP HARRIS' TIE-BREAKER VOTES IN THE SENATE WERE KEY TO INFLATION-BOOSTING BIDEN POLICIES: EXPERT

""By Kamala?"" host Charlamagne Tha God replied. ""She's vice president. There's still a president.""

""Oh Charlamagne,"" Byron said, reminding listeners that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act in 2021.

""She broke the tie that started this inflation that has hurt so many people in our country,"" Donalds said.

Guest-host Angela Rye dismissed Byron's argument as ""not true.""

""You sure you want to go there?"" the Florida Republican shot back, pulling out a pamphlet of ""facts"" from his suit jacket to back up his claim as Rye tried to speak over him.

Donalds argued that experts anticipated ""massive inflation"" if the American Rescue Plan was passed.

""That's what happened,"" he said.

""The problem we have in our economy today is that prices have gone up massively, wages adjusted for inflation is down, people's pocketbooks are hurting,"" he continued.

Donalds asked co-host DJ Envy, whether he would hire someone who broke a house to fix more houses.

When Rye wondered how his question was pertinent to the topic at hand, Donalds shot back, ""Chill, Angela.""

CRITICS BLAST HARRIS' GRASP OF INFLATION, ATTACK ON BUSINESS AHEAD OF POLICY SPEECH: 'LUNATIC BEHAVIOR'

""Because I'm bringing facts...so now you don't want to do it anymore? C'mon Angela, that's not right. I want to have a fact-based conversation,"" Donalds said.

Donalds posted a clip of the exchange on X later Tuesday, writing ""Democrat economists warned her it would cause inflation. And it did...It caused 20+% inflation. It created a cost-of-living crisis. It crushed hardworking Americans. Kamala broke our economy.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Biden in the past has called assertions that the American Rescue Plan's substantial spending might have been a cause of the skyrocketing inflation ""bizarre,"" waving away the accusation.

Defense Stocks Hit All-Time Highs Amid Middle East Escalation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/defense-stocks-hit-all-time-highs-amid-middle-east-escalation/,2024-10-01T19:35:38Z,"In a predictably grim phenomenon tied to outbreaks of global violence, aerospace and defense stocks climbed to record prices in an otherwise down day for the stock market, as Wall Street reacted to the latest escalation in the Middle East by anticipating larger contracts for military suppliers.

5%. That's how much prices for international oil benchmark Brent crude oil rose Tuesday by about 1:15 p.m. EDT, which would have been by far the largest single-day gain of 2024, according to FactSet data. The oil surge moderated quickly, with Brent up less than 1% by 3:15 p.m. EDT.

Defense stocks typically gain during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts, which often grow when allies like Israel and Ukraine are at war. Tuesday's market backdrop evoked unpleasant memories of the setup in late 2021 and 2022, when supply chain issues and military conflict (Russia's invasion of Ukraine) caused global inflation to surge and stocks to fall as central banks rolled out growth-stifling interest rate hikes to slow price increases. But economists largely believe the U.S. port strike won't have the same impact on inflation as the 2021-22 supply chain snags.

Wall Street's fear gauge rose to its highest level in three weeks Tuesday, as the CBOE volatility index (VIX) climbed 10% as traders dealt with new concerns in addition to fears about a potential U.S. economic slowdown. But ""although the VIX is edging higher it remains sufficiently just below 20 to suggest that markets...do not yet envision an all-out military scenario"" in the Middle East, noted LPL Financial's chief global strategist Quincy Krosby in a Tuesday note to clients."
How The Accountant Shortage Impacts CFOs And Financial Hires,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/01/how-the-accountant-shortage-impacts-cfos-and-financial-hires/,2024-10-01T16:48:57Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

Driving technology, embracing of the strategic importance of a company's financial functions and an emphasizing corporate sustainability are all transforming the CFO's job. But they're also reshaping other jobs in a company's financial operations. A new report from EY zooming in on the financial controller's position found that 86% of people in that role expect significant changes in their career in the next five years. The majority of controllers told EY they expect their role to shift from one focused on value protection -- paying attention to internal controls and regulatory compliance -- to one that looks for value creation -- using technology, strategy and data to find new opportunities and recommend new policies.

""The controller of the future will be a trusted partner to the CFO right across the transformation spectrum,"" Mike Verbeck, EY Global deputy vice chair for Assurance, said in the report. ""They will create value in their capacity as analysts, collaborators, innovators, storytellers and leaders of talented teams, as well as in their capacity as accounting and compliance experts.""

The report makes clear that this is seen as a natural evolution of the controller's role, fitting with how most companies utilize their financial teams in the foreseeable future. But it's also clear that the report found technology -- including AI -- gives the controller the ability to pivot toward more of a focus on strategy and opportunity. The report found that nearly nine in 10 controllers already use AI, which is powerful on two fronts. It can do many of the basic tasks controllers spend their time on now, and also leverage data to find powerful insights.

EY suggests that controllers take advantage of the opportunity to look for value-creation opportunities by embracing data and AI and inspiring team members to see themselves as problem solvers. CFOs should empower their controllers, and also provide training in future-focused skills that build on technology use and responsibilities to climb the ranks at a company. And the CFO should also focus on an innovative and transformational spirit in potential new hires to work under the controller.

Regardless of how financial roles are created and recruited, the entire financial sector is struggling to find talent. Many college students today aren't pursuing accounting degrees, and even fewer are becoming CPAs. That makes recruiting for any financial position harder, from junior-level to CFOs. I spoke with Keith Giarman, president of the private equity and principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about how this shortage is impacting things right now. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Unionized port workers on the East Coast began their first strike in more than 45 years at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, stopping trade traffic at ports in Baltimore; Boston; Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami; Houston; Mobile, Alabama; New Orleans; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware. About 45,000 union members represented by the International Longshoremen's Association want a wage increase of 77% and a ban on new automation as part of their new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), the organization that represents shipping companies. West Coast port workers earn over $30,000 a year more than their East Coast counterparts. Union members are refusing to meet with the USMX until their wage demands are met.

The strike could have fast and far-reaching impacts on the U.S. economy, with some analysts projecting it costing $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion a day. If the strike continues for long enough, it could impact consumer prices and the availability of goods. President Biden has urged the two sides to resolve the issue quickly and fairly, sending Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to meet with USMX on Monday. While Biden can defer the strike for 80 days through the Taft-Hartley Act, he said over the weekend he will not ""because it's collective bargaining.""

While West Coast ports remain open, Boeing machinists remain on strike. The 33,000 unionized employees at the aerospace manufacturer's Pacific Northwest facilities rejected Boeing's ""best and final offer"" last week. From the union's social media posts, the sticking point appears to be the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan, which the company did away with in favor of a 401(k) plan in 2014, according to Quartz. It's unclear from media reports what's happening currently with negotiations, but according to KING5, Boeing released a statement Monday saying it is ""committed to resetting our relationship with our represented employees and negotiating in good faith and want to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We are prepared to meet at any time.""

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened last month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Tuesday morning, 38.4% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

The stock market on the whole is responding well, however. The first nine months of 2024 were the S&P 500's best start to a year since 1997, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. The S&P's year-to-date gain is 20.3%, and the other markets have also fared well this year: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12% in the first three quarters of 2024, and the Nasdaq is up 20%. Buoying the markets so far are last month's interest rate cuts -- insurers, home builders and utilities saw some of the best returns in recent months -- and optimism-fueled AI stocks.

Last week, the Chinese government announced several broad measures to boost its economy, which has been sputtering and looks unlikely to meet its government's annual growth target. The multi-pronged effort includes an interest rate cut from China's central bank, a potential capital injection into its biggest banks to increase lending capacity and governmental economic stimulus, reports Forbes' Derek Saul. Chinese stocks traded on U.S. markets rallied on the news and have continued to trade higher.

However, the rally -- and any benefit to China-based businesses -- may be short-lived for those in the U.S. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan Chase strategists said that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, it's likely to slow down. Trump has campaigned on strict trade policies toward China, including a tariff of 60% or more on all Chinese goods, phasing out imports of essential goods and revoking China's most favored nation trade status. Vice President Kamala Harris has said in her campaign that she wants to enact policies that ensure the U.S. keeps its economic foothold above China, but she has not presented anything specific that is as restrictive. Analysts believe Harris will continue the Biden administration's approach of more targeted Chinese economic policies, including limiting imports and exports from high-tech industries.

As the nature of work has changed and new fields related to finance have cropped up, there's been a shortage of accountants on all levels -- especially with fewer young people opting for accounting degrees, and even fewer choosing to work at traditional firms and pursue the CPA path. This has immediate and potential long-term implications for finance departments and CFOs. I talked to Keith Giarman, president of private equity and the principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about what it means. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

It's hard to find the right talent today. What are companies doing to keep the talent they have?

Giarman: A lot of the compensation has gone north. It is a different level skill set that [companies] are asking for. There are a few [qualified employees], and they know that. They know that their price tag and their market value have gone up. Especially in private equity, where they've got a hopefully three-year timeline to improve operations and sell a company, they have to have the absolute best and invest in that role. They're working with the CFO more than the CEO.

For everybody else [in finance], if you accept my logic, there's fewer of them. Whether it's somebody running FP&A or somebody lower down in the organization, you've got to pay up.

That doesn't fix it, though, because people come for more than money. [Companies] have to create great working environments and be more flexible, including remote [work]. As a company, we have the same challenges. We've tried to create an environment for our research and associate staff where we emphasize things like wellness and the things that the younger generation wants to focus on and feel good about in terms of the community they're building around them. If you're not doing those other soft HR things, all the money in the world isn't going to make a difference. They'll stay for a couple of years, and they'll go.

Much of the attention of the accountant shortage is focused on lower-level employees. Are you seeing related challenges with recruiting CFOs?

The answer is a very loud yes, with an exclamation point. The CFOs who will make the cut, where the client will not bend on the requirements, seems like [there are] fewer and fewer as we move along.

It's also dependent on the cycle of the market. CFOs have been in assets in private equities for a while. We're finally starting to see the Fed lower interest rates. There could be some exit liquidity opportunity in a year or two. If more transactions are getting done, there's more folks who have proven themselves: They're able to flourish in these environments and get the job done. We haven't been in that for the last 12 to 24 months.

When we do a CFO search today, something that might've taken 90 days can take 180. There's a timing issue with candidates. There's a compensation issue. There's a flexibility issue in terms of where they are in the investment cycle, too, because if you're going to sell the company in two years, are you going to expect somebody to move their entire family on a plane three hours away?

The good news is at that level, you're thinking about wealth creation and longer-term things that take care of your family and your career.

What Is The Consumer Price Index  And How It Impacts Investing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/what-is-cpi-consumer-price-index/,2024-10-01T16:40:33Z,"The Consumer Price Index ""is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services,"" according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which issues the monthly report. In this article, you will learn about how the CPI is put together, the different types of CPIs and the part it plays in investing trends and monetary policy.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average fluctuation over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of what consumers typically buy and use, such as food and beverages, housing, clothing, transportation, medical care and entertainment, and the sales and excise taxes consumers pay. The CPI does not include income or Social Security taxes. Nor does the CPI report investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate and life insurance because those items are not day-to-day consumption expenses.

Because of the ways the CPI data on those items is applied, it affects nearly all Americans.

The CPI has three major uses, according to BLS. They are as an:

The BLS describes the CPI as a ""measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of consumer goods and services."" It also publishes other economic indexes, broken down by region, population and goods, but the one most widely quoted and consequential is the CPI-U, usually called simply the CPI, which covers the purchases of urban consumers and reports each month. A second large survey is the CPI-W, which is a monthly accounting of the average change in the prices that urban wages earners and clerical workers pay for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

To measure data, the BLS continuously collects information to come up with the CPI and other indexes. Its data collectors go in person or work through the Web and with apps to contact thousands of retail stores, service establishments, rental units and doctors' offices, all over the country to compile information about prices on thousands of items used to track and measure price changes in the CPI; it also records prices of some 80,000 items each month representing a ""scientifically selected sample of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services purchased.""

The list of items and services in the CPI basket include the following.

The indexes from BLS have many breakdowns. To better evaluate costs, the BLS presents the CPIs in two ways. They are:

It ""represents all goods and services in the report; in other words, 'the whole shebang,' "" wrote Britannica Money. ""It represents the average inflation rate across the entire economy.""

It ""strips out food and energy prices. Why? Food and energy prices tend to be more volatile than other products in the CPI mix,"" noted Britannica Money. Weather, international prices and geopolitics impact those two product categories. Even some economists at the Federal Reserve choose to leave them out of the equation to come up with a more constituent view on price inflation.

BLS publishes a family of price indexes covering regions and specific industries, which include the four Census regions, nine Census divisions, two sizes of city classes, eight cross-classifications of regions and size-classes and for 23 local areas as well as those for the major groups of consumer expenditures, such as food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communications, and other goods and services for items within each group, and for special categories, such as services. By studying sectors, too, the BLS is able to make educated guesses about the economic state of industries.

It also collects prices for goods and services in 75 urban areas and from about 23,000 retail and service establishments and data on rents from some 50,000 landlords or tenants

The CPI has wide-ranging implications for hundreds of millions Americans and the government, including Congress, the White House and the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve, as well as for Wall Street and investors.

The CPI is used to help adjust income eligibility for levels of government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increase, poverty measures and consumer and commercial rent escalations. ""CPI indexes are used to adjust income eligibility levels for government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increases, poverty measures, and consumer and commercial rent escalations,"" according to the BLS.

According to Cooke Wealth Management LLC, because the CPI gauges inflationary trends, ""it can lead investors to anticipate higher consumer goods and services prices in the future. This expectation can lead to adjustments in investment portfolios, potentially reducing stock market prices due to anticipated reduced purchasing power and demand.""

Dan Raju, CEO of the brokerage platform Tradier, told me that the recent Fed rate cut coupled with CPI movements have led to market volatility and posed a surprise for his traders, who didn't expect an interest rate cut until the inflation rate hit 2%, as suggested by the Fed. ""Lower interest rates typically encourage borrowing and spending, which can lead to increased market activity, but also heightened risk. For our clients, this means a potential for higher returns, but with amplified volatility,"" he added.

The ups and downs of inflation impact the various asset classes differently.

""When the CPI rises and inflation concerns increase, capital often shifts from bonds to stocks or other inflation-resistant assets, such as energy infrastructure, commodities and real estate,"" Jon DuPau, managing director at SuperDex, told me.

""Bonds have an inverse relationship with interest rates, and companies who utilize lending or discretionary spending may experience some uncertainties. Investors reassess the growth potential of companies under inflationary pressure. With CPI considerations, investors may seek safer, more conservative assets as a hedge,"" John Jones, investor advisor representative, at Heritage Financial, told me. Bonds can provide that hedge.

During the early years of the Biden-Harris administration, both the CPI and PPI (Producer Price Index) statistics reported monthly by the U.S. Government were running at nearly 30-year highs,"" Adam Ferrari, CEO of Phoenix Capital Group, noted.

He added that, ""This erosion of value has resulted in elevated home prices, stock market valuations and hard assets like gold and other industrial metals also reaching higher levels. Overall, elevated CPI levels in the U.S. economy has caused investors to seek reprieve in hard assets like real estate, gold or even oil and gas properties.""

""Retreating prices for some commodities are contributing to lower inflation today,"" according to U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Rob Haworth, the bank's senior investment strategy director noted that although food and energy prices rebounded in early 2024 and were ""raising inflation risks,"" prices later in the year leveled off a downturn in the inflation rate.

""The Consumer Price Index in the United States averaged 124.59 points from 1950 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 314.80 points in August of 2024 and a record low of 23.50 points in February of 1950."" according to the tradingeconomics.com from data reported by the BLS.

""Investors must carefully analyze CPI reports, considering that government-released numbers are often revised later, potentially creating credibility issues,"" Chris Hite, regulatory compliance manager at Nurp LLC, the software company that develops algorithmic software for Forex trading, told me.""A nuanced approach is key. Looking beyond headlines to understand core trends is vital. Some assets, like commodities, real estate and inflation-protected securities, can hedge against inflation. However, high inflation and sticky interest rate hikes can negatively impact stocks and bonds.""

The CPI is meant to paint the economic picture in broad strokes, so by its very nature, it doesn't address individual variations. In a post, the economic site Quickonomics addressed what it views as the CPI's four limitations.

They are:

The Federal Reserve Board has long looked for trends in the CPI to help to formulate fiscal and monetary policy and gauge inflation. However, in January 2012, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted PCE [personal consumption expenditures price index] as its primary measure of inflation over CPI.""

James Bullard, former president of the St. Louis Fed, wrote in 2013 that the PCE, issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is a better way to gauge the prices that consumers face and determine inflation rates than the CPI.

Market reactions mean that investors can get spooked by the unexpected, or even the expected, which can be a number of events, including the CPI report. Most recently, in August 2024 when the latest report came out, stocks were ""briefly plunging as much as 743.89 points, before ending with its biggest intraday comeback in almost two years,"" according to MarketWatch. Other times, the CPI has virtually no impact on the market.

When you hear the results of the monthly CPI, you're getting a short-hand version of what's happening in the economy and what the average person is dealing with financially. Of course, the CPI doesn't present a nuanced picture, but it can suggest to you and the U.S. government when prices are static, falling or rising and where to make adjustments."
GOP leader says Vance 'absolutely prepared' for VP debate showdown with Walz,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-leader-says-vance-absolutely-prepared-vp-debate-showdown-walz,2024-10-01T15:50:59Z,"NEW YORK - Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley is confident that Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is ""absolutely prepared"" for Tuesday night's vice presidential debate showdown.

Vance, former President Trump's running mate on the GOP 2024 ticket, will face off in New York City with Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota in the one and only debate between the two running mates.

""You look at everything he's done since he was named as the candidate. He's been preparing, he's been talking with the press, he's been out there, he's been moving around and talking to the American voters. So, he's very ready to have this conversation,"" Whatley emphasized in a Fox News Digital interview hours ahead of the debate.

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep told Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor was in debate camp ahead of the showdown to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters, ""She wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error White House race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there will be heightened stakes at the running mate debate, which is traditionally seen as a second-tier event in the presidential campaign.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head match-up between the principal candidates and this is the last meet-up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

Most political pundits said Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

And there's a precedent from 12 years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Whatley, the former RNC general counsel and former North Carolina GOP chair who's a close ally of Trump, told Fox Digital that Vance's debate mission is to ""deliver the message"" to voters across the country.

Whatley argued that ""if you look at the Democrats, they don't just have messenger problems, they have message problems. The polices that they're pushing right now are not popular with the American people.... I think on every single one of these issues, the Republican ticket is the ticket of strength, the ticket of common sense, and I feel really great about where we're going into tonight.""

The RNC chair also said that when it comes to Vance's game plan for the debate, ""I think he's going to talk about the issues that the voters care about and those are the issues like inflation, like the southern border, like prices at the grocery store and at the gas pump. That's really what people care about. That's what we're going to talk about.""

Part of the Harris campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

For weeks, they've painted Walz as a regular guy who will be facing off with the Ivy League-trained Vance. What they don't mention is that Walz won six House races and two gubernatorial elections.

The Trump campaign's playing the same game.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well-prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

But Trump seemed to undercut this campaign's argument, charging in an interview with Kellyanne Conway's Fox Nation program ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne"" that Vance is ""going up against a moron. A total moron, how she picked him is unbelievable.""

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable."
Could Dock Worker Strike Spike Inflation? Experts Are Split.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/could-dock-worker-strike-spike-inflation-experts-are-split/,2024-10-01T15:08:19Z,"The massive dock worker strike beginning Tuesday comes at an inopportune time for the U.S. economy, as the potential uptick in shipping prices comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, though experts are split on whether the strike will have a major impact on inflation and the economy more broadly.

""The port strike could disrupt the data, essentially creating a smoke screen for the Fed when trying to stick the soft landing,"" wrote Essaye. The strike crucially comes two weeks after the U.S. central bank initiated the first interest rate cuts since March 2020, essentially declaring victory over inflation. The Fed has signaled it intends to continue cutting, meaning its toolkit is far more limited to stifle another inflation outbreak.

How an extended strike impacts retailers as the holiday quarter kicks off. UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan wrote Monday retailers had already adjusted import activity in ""anticipation of supply chain disruption"" from the strike.

The East Coast accounts for 40% of U.S. shipping container volumes and about 5% of global volumes, according to Bank of America. The port-related inflation concerns evoke bad memories of the late 2021 supply chain snarls which came as ports globally dealt with significant backlogs due in part to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers. That contributed to the global inflation crisis, and inflation peaked in 2022 at a 41-year high of more than 9% in the U.S."
Does Baxter Stock Offer Any Room For Growth?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/01/does-baxter-stock-offer-any-room-for-growth/,2024-10-01T12:11:29Z,"Baxter stock (NYSE: BAX), a healthcare company, currently trades at $38 per share, more than 50% lower than the level seen in February 2022. BAX stock has fared worse than its peer - Becton, Dickinson & Company stock, down 7% over this period. BAX stock has been weighed down lately amid falling profit margins and a sale of its Vantive Kidney Care business this year at a price lower than the street estimates. BAX stock was trading at around $60 in early June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and is now 36% below that level, compared to over 50% gains for the S&P 500 during this period.

Notably, BAX stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last three years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the uncertain geopolitical environment, could BAX face a similar situation as it did in recent years and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $83 implies that BAX stock will have to gain around 115% from here, and we don't think that will materialize anytime soon. In fact, we think BAX stock is appropriately priced. It currently trades at 1.4x trailing revenues, aligning with its average P/S ratio of 1.4x over the last six quarters. Notably, the $41 average of analysts price estimate for Baxter also reflects just 5% upside from here.

Our detailed analysis of Baxter's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how BAX stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

BAX stock declined from nearly $28 in August 2008 (pre-crisis peak for Baxter) to $20 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying it lost 26% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $24 in early 2010, rising about 15% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

Baxter Fundamentals Over Recent Years

Baxter's revenue rose from $12.1 billion in 2021 to $14.8 billion in 2023, driven by increased demand for advanced surgery products. In December 2021, Baxter completed the Hillrom acquisition, which added connected care offerings, including Smart Beds and patient monitoring products, to Baxter's existing portfolio of acute, nutritional, renal, hospital, and surgical care products. However, the company's operating margin declined from 11% to 3% between 2021 and 2023. Baxter sold its Vantive Kidney Care business to Carlyle, a private equity investor, for $3.8 billion, lower than the street expectations.

Does Baxter Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

Baxter's total debt decreased from $18.3 billion in 2021 to $13.3 billion now, while its cash decreased from around $3.7 billion to $2.1 billion over the same period. The company also garnered $1.2 billion in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. The company will also receive $3 billion in proceeds from the sale of its Vantive Kidney Care business. The high debt burden is a near-term risk that the company faces. The company's market capitalization has shrunk to $19 billion now, and a debt level of $13 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of 68%.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe Baxter stock is fairly priced, with limited upside potential. The stock could rebound if the profitability improves. Still, a high deb burden remains a key risk factor.

"In Nevada, Latinos could pick the next president. They aren't sold on either candidate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25479/nevada-latino-voters-trump-harris-culinary-union,2024-10-01T12:02:30Z,"LAS VEGAS -- Walking out of a grocery store in a Latino neighborhood on the east side of the city, Flor Elena Fernandez says she's wrestling with who to vote for in this year's election.

The 36-year old housekeeping manager worries about the cost of food. She worries about the cost of living.

""We're all waiting for what is going to happen, especially us Hispanics, says Fernandez, who is originally from Cuba. ""The economy is bad. We're waiting to see what happens.""

Her one and a half year old son, dressed in a red Flash superhero shirt is riding in the cart. Her mom also walks along, smiling knowingly.

Flor Maria Parra, Fernandez' mother, explains that she's already decided.

""Yes, for Kamala Harris,"" Parra, explains. ""At least with Hispanics, she defends the Hispanics a lot, while Trump throws them out.""

Around 1 in 5 voters in the Silver State are Latino. Now, that's more political power than the group has in almost any of the other 7 key states in the electoral college count.

President Biden barely eked out a victory in Nevada, in part by winning 60% of the Latino vote, but polls suggest Trump has stronger Latino support than previous Republican campaigns.

It's here in Las Vegas where Trump unveiled his plan to eliminate taxes on tips, seen as a direct pitch largely to Latino workers who make up the backbone of the state's casino and hospitality industry.

Looking to regain their advantage, the Harris campaign is spending $3 million in Spanish-language radio this month, which it says is the largest investment in Hispanic media ever.

The Democrats have also launched their not-so-secret weapon in the state -- an army of service workers from the Culinary Workers Union who have been helping deliver the party victories for several elections.

Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, admits Nevada, ""to be honest, should be Trump territory.""

""At the end of the day, we're competitive, and we outwork everybody,"" he said, adding, ""there's a pathway to win if we really can get workers talking to workers face to face at the doors.""

That's exactly what they do. Thousands of cooks and servers and room cleaners will take a leave of absence to knock on doors, six days a week for Harris and the Democrats. The Culinary Union will help cover their missed wages as they undertake this different kind of work.

The Trump campaign is also increasing its efforts to reach Latino voters. In Nevada, it's hosting Spanish phone banking sessions, postcard writing nights and trainings for local volunteers.

Tony Fabrizio, Trump's lead pollster, argues that Harris' team is spending so much money on Latinos because they've lost so much ground within the community, especially in Nevada and Arizona.

""I don't care whose national poll you look at -- even yours, from NPR -- it is really very clear that she is underperforming with Hispanics, not only nationally, but in these two key states,"" Fabrizio said.

Back at the supermarket, views of Trump are widely mixed. Alfredo Alcasar is a maintenance worker. He says he doesn't like how Trump talks about Latinos.

""I don't like to be minimized. Trump always minimizes us, he said. ""And why, if we've done nothing bad? All we've done is try to contribute to the country as best we can.""

But Pedro Fernandez, a carpenter -- who is not related to Flor Elena and her mom -- is less worried about Trump's rhetoric and more concerned about inflation and the cost of living.

""We've been here 18 years, and when Trump was in power, the economy was stronger,"" he said.

As for Flor Elena Fernandez, she's torn. It will be her first time voting after recently becoming a citizen, and she wants to make the right choice. She agrees the economy is bad, but she also sees her mother's perspective.

""We know that she has a plan, but we don't know how good it will be,"" Fernandez says of Harris."
How This Luxury Sake Brand Is Applying French Winemaking Techniques,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelking/2024/10/01/how-this-luxury-sake-brand-is-applying-french-winemaking-techniques/,2024-10-01T11:12:04Z,"While traditional sake blending is used for practical purposes and cost efficiency, the practice of ""assemblage"" focuses on enhancing the qualities of each component.

Heavensake, a luxury sake brand founded in 2017 on the concept of cultural exchange between Japan and France, has been making waves in the sake industry since introducing the concept of assemblage, a winemaking technique that enhances the flavors of individual components in a blend, to the Japanese rice wine.

Led by Régis Camus, an eight-time International Wine Challenge (IWC) Sparkling Winemaker of the Year, Heavensake worked with sake master Naohiko Noguchi while crafting a trio of rare sakes.

""The power of assemblage to enhance and elevate flavors is something that can accelerate their progress by years,"" Camus said via email. ""We're proud to say that we were the first to introduce assemblage to high-end sake, and it's rewarding to see the industry embrace its beauty.""

The collaboration between Camus and some of Japan's top breweries -- including Katsuyama Brewery, Niizawa Brewery and Noguchi -- has been integral to Heavensake's progress. Camus and Noguchi previously worked together to create the Noguchi Prestige sake, a bottle that showcases the potential of assemblage in high-end sake.

""When I met him, it was instantly a mutual respect between two masters,"" Camus said.

Noguchi Prestige, crafted by Camus and Noguchi , will be available in March 2025 for $1,000. The Label Azur Junmai Ginjo by Katsuyama is available now for World Sake Day on October 1, for a suggested retail price of $39. The Label Noir Junmai Daiginjo by Niizawa will be available in November for $92.

The introduction of assemblage to sake-making has been a carefully executed process. Camus described his initial collaboration with Dassai, especially, as a pivotal moment for Heavensake.

""They understood the concept and how it worked in champagne making, but they were unsure how it would translate to the world of sake,"" Camus said, adding that success of this experiment paved the way for further collaborations, leading to the creation of these new, premium sake blends.

Assemblage, as applied in winemaking, focuses on combining different wines to create a final product that is greater than the sum of its parts. Camus uses this approach with sake to bring out unique and vibrant flavors. Unlike traditional sake blending, which is often used for cost efficiency, Camus said assemblage enhances the qualities of each component.

""In sake-making, the challenge was determining how much of an impact assemblage could have,"" he said. ""We start with existing sakes -- typically five to ten different types -- and begin the process of trial and error, much like alchemists.""

Introducing assemblage to an industry steeped in tradition has not been without its challenges. Initially, many sake experts were skeptical about whether the technique could add value to premium sake. Even John Gauntner, a renowned sake expert and co-founder and content editor of the sake-only magazine Sake Today, was doubtful.

""John saw it through the lens of traditional blending, but when he tasted the final product, he was completely astonished,"" Camus recalled, stating that it was this moment that helped turn skeptics into believers.

Heavensake's blends have been designed to elevate the perception of sake on the global stage. The brand has also focused on the visual presentation of its products, partnering with the Arita Porcelain Lab to create artistic ceramic bottles for their limited-edition sakes.

""For us, it's absolutely essential to create harmony between the visual and artistic aspects of the product and the liquid itself,"" Camus said, explaining this attention to detail helps distinguish Heavensake in a market where most sake bottles share similar designs.

Heavensake's expansion into the U.S. market is a critical part of the brand's strategy. Through events, tastings and consumer education, Camus hopes to showcase the versatility and complexity of sake to a broader audience. This educational approach is expected to play a key role in changing the way consumers experience sake.

One key point he emphasizes is the importance of using a wine glass when drinking sake.

""As we embark on this U.S. tour, one of the most important aspects for us to communicate is the use of a wine glass when drinking sake,"" he said about visiting the United States in October.

""By using a wine glass, you can truly appreciate the complexity of the assemblage and all the subtle notes of high-end sake,"" Camus said. The traditional ochoko cups, often used to serve sake, he explained, limit the experience by not allowing drinkers to fully engage with the aroma and flavor.

While sake has generated more interest among U.S. consumers in the last several years, sales recently have suffered. In 2023, Japanese sake exports experienced a notable downturn after 13 consecutive years of growth, driven by global economic factors, including recession and inflation, which affected the two key sake export markets: China and the United States. The total value of sake exports in 2023 was 41.08 billion yen (approximately $275 million, down 13% year-over-year), with a volume of around 29,000 liters (down 19% year-over-year).

Regardless, as the brand looks to the future, Camus is optimistic about the potential for sake to reach a larger international audience.

Camus pointed to the global rise of other spirits, such as tequila, as an example of how targeted marketing and product storytelling can elevate a category.

""The total export value of sake from Japan to the rest of the world is only around $300 million,"" Camus noted. ""Given the beauty and potential of this magnificent drink, that number should be three to five times higher."""

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.58%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.56% and 4.23% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.73%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.99% and 3.71% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.39%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.24%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-the-25-wealthiest-people-in-america/,2024-10-01T10:02:49Z,"was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer's rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list:

One of Sam Walton's eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family's third generation still sit on Walmart's board: Jim's son Steuart Walton (Lukas' first cousin) and Rob's son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman.

""On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,"" Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, ""we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win."" His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023.

Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump's reelection bid.

Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France.

In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he's backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024.

In August, their Mars Inc. announced it's gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg's) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M's and Kind bars. It's the company's biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations.

Yass' fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group -- and Yass' share of profits -- based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna's estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass).

In June, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father's 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA's New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Rob Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings' estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Price"" strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman in early September from L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022.

Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family's charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell's net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively.

Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer -- a phenomenon termed ""Jensanity."" Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since.

The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges.

The Microsoft cofounder's rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he's set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy.

""Damn, I'm fired up!"" exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers' new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion.

Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51

A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin's Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet's sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google's continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months.

More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America's first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett -- the nation's greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving -- donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed.

It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm's shares up 12% to record highs. He's spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion-plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David's media production company.

No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He's $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness.

Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami's ""billionaire bunker"" island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year.

Tesla's self-proclaimed ""technoking"" tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk's new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected."
The Richest Woman In America 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/10/01/the-richest-woman-in-america-2024/,2024-10-01T10:02:35Z,"or the ninth time in a decade, Alice Walton-the only daughter of late Walmart founder Sam Walton-is the richest woman on this year's Forbes 400 ranking of the wealthiest people in America.

With shoppers flocking to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Prices"" to escape high inflation, the retailer's stock is up 41% since the 2023 Forbes 400, pushing the 74-year-old Walton's net worth to an estimated $89.2 billion, up from $66.5 billion. She is $15 billion richer than the second-richest woman in the U.S., Julia Koch -- who inherited 42% of privately held conglomerate Koch, Inc. (formerly known as Koch Industries) from her husband David Koch (d. 2019), and who briefly took Walton's title as America's wealthiest woman in 2022.

Walton, who ranks No. 15 on The Forbes 400 overall, is now within spitting distance of becoming the second-ever female centibillionaire. L'Oréal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who is a citizen of France, joined the $100 billion club in June but fell to around $88 billion on September 4, when Walton briefly surpassed her to become the world's richest woman for the first time since May 2022. (Bettencourt Meyers reclaimed the title on September 26, with an estimated $92.6 billion fortune.)

Despite selling more than $28 billion of Walmart stock over the past decade -- and giving away more than $11 billion of the retailer's shares -- Sam Walton's heirs still own nearly 45% of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth, due to significant stock buybacks that have prevented the family's stake from being diluted. Forbes estimates that three-quarters of the clan's stock is split almost evenly between Alice Walton and her siblings Jim (No. 13 on this year's list, worth an estimated $95.9 billion) and Rob Walton (No. 14, $94.3 billion). Most of the rest of the Walton family fortune belongs to the heirs of their brother John Walton (d. 2005): his widow Christy Walton (No. 48, $16.4 billion) and their son Lukas Walton (No. 25, $33.9 billion).

The youngest of Sam Walton's four children, Alice Walton was 12 years old when her father opened the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962. She worked briefly at the family retailer, as a buyer of children's clothes, after graduating from Trinity University in Texas in 1971, before taking a job in New Orleans as a stockbroker for E.F. Hutton. Walton returned to Bentonville during the 1980s to run investment operations at her family's Arvest Bank, before launching a lending and brokerage shop of her own called Llama with $19.5 million of family money. When Llama shut down in 1998, Walton moved back to Texas and shifted her focus to curating art.

She chaired the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville for a decade, before handing the reins to her nephew Tom Walton's wife, Olivia Walton, in 2021. Alice is credited with founding the museum, which sits on 120 acres and features works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keeffe, after realizing there wasn't anything like it within 300 miles of her family's hometown. Nearly all of the $1.6 billion it cost to open the facility in 2011 came from trusts in the names of her late brother John Walton and mother Helen Walton (d. 2007).

Alice Walton has ramped up her own philanthropy over the past decade, however, pouring more than $5.7 billion into five family charitable foundations that have doled out more than $1.1 billion of her funds to date. That includes an estimated $380 million gifted through the Walton Family Foundation (which her parents founded on Walmart's 25th anniversary in 1987) to organizations focused on education reform, the environment and the region surrounding Bentonville. It also includes more than $375 million that Alice's Art Bridges Foundation has spent acquiring and loaning out works of American art to more than 230 museums across the country -- including the Art Institute of Chicago, the MoMA in New York City and the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. -- since its founding in 2016.

Walton is also seeking accreditation for a new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine in Bentonville that will ""enhance traditional medical education with the arts, humanities, and whole health principles."" If all goes according to plan, the school will enroll its inaugural class of four-year MD candidates in 2025.

""Over the past several years, I've founded new organizations focused on the arts as well as health and well-being,"" Walton said in a press release announcing her retirement as chair of the Crystal Bridges museum in 2021. ""I'd like to focus more fully on my board chair roles at these entities."""
JD Vance's time on the trail has often been overshadowed by self-made controversy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5060281/vp-debate-jd-vance-haitian-migrants-abortion-childless-cat-ladies,2024-10-01T09:10:12Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance speaks to a crowd during a rally at the Berks County Fairgrounds on Sept. 21, in Leesport, Penn. Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images hide caption

Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has been an aggressive messenger for Donald Trump's campaign vision for the future and is a constant fixture on the trail, doing interviews and taking questions from the press.

But in the 11 weeks since Vance joined the GOP presidential ticket, that message has been overshadowed by controversy -- often of Vance's own making.

His acceptance speech in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention was heavy on biography and nodded towards a more polished take on Trump's often dire rhetoric.

""My friends, tonight is a night of hope,"" he said. ""A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren.""

Vance's selection came at a moment when Trump was leading in key battleground polls after President Biden's poor debate performance and the GOP was rallying around Trump after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The freshman Ohio senator was viewed as the MAGA heir apparent to the party's future.

But in the run-up to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, there have been two conflicting forces at work on the trail: the message that Vance wants to get out, and what actually sticks.

Take his first solo campaign rally in his hometown, just days after the RNC, where he delivered a populist speech vowing to help lift up ""forgotten communities all across our country.""

""We're going to fight for every single worker in this country,"" he said. ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to put a good dinner on the table and send your kids to whatever vacation and whatever school you want to.""

But another line that broke through to the public -- and not for good reason -- was a comment about Diet Mountain Dew.

""Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,"" he said. ""I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too.""

In the days that followed, Trump struggled to quickly pivot his campaign message to address Vice President Harris after President Biden dropped out of the race, but Vance was quick to fill in the gaps to question her record and make her the focus of attacks on immigration, inflation and other top Republican issues.

When Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and the pair embarked on a swing state blitz, Vance was there, too, countering the Democratic message with the case for a Republican presidency.

""It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States,"" he said in Philadelphia.

But Vance's rapid ascension in politics means he has relatively less experience as a campaigner, delivering stump speeches or handling the intense scrutiny on past and present statements.

So the prebuttal tour came as Vance was also dealing with uproar over old comments he made deriding Democrats in charge as quote ""childless cat ladies.""

""It's not a criticism of people who don't have children,"" Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly. ""I explicitly said in my remarks despite the fact the media has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.""

But the damage was done, as Vance's old comments provided Democrats an opening to attack the GOP ticket as sexist and out of touch.

Then, there's more recent remarks, like a weeks-long inflammatory crusade against Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio that Vance has sought to use as a cudgel to attack Democrats over immigration.

""The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,"" Vance said in a Sept. 15 CNN interview. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

State and local Republican leaders in Ohio have rejected claims made by Trump and Vance about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The city's mayor told news outlets that Vance's staff knew the conspiracies about eating pets were false before Trump uttered the lies on the debate stage last month.

Several times, Vance has also staked out policy positions for the ticket that Trump has later disagreed with or shot down, like when Vance said that Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

Where Trump offered a ""concept of a plan"" for health care, Vance answered a question after a Raleigh, North Carolina campaign speech with more details of how Republicans would overhaul health insurance risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, a broadly unpopular proposal.

Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Vance has also been prolific when it comes to messaging campaign goals, frequently doing media interviews, delivering speeches and taking questions after most every stop -- prioritizing local journalists.

But those Q and A sessions can turn contentious, with the crowd often booing questions from journalists as Vance takes the opportunity to paint himself as a pugilist for Trump, whether it be queries about interest rate cuts or questions about the campaign's support of North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who allegedly called himself a ""Black Nazi"" among other things on a porn forum more than a decade ago. (Robinson has denied the allegation.)

Vance, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps, regularly lectures reporters about what he perceives to be unfair coverage of him and frequently directs them to ask Harris questions instead.

Even in more casual campaign settings, Vance has struggled at times to connect. At one stop at a doughnut shop in Valdosta, Georgia, an employee was awkwardly put on the spot by the candidate -- she then asked not to be filmed on camera. On another visit to a Pennsylvania sandwich shop last weekend, Vance was left standing outside in a parking lot after some initial confusion because staff at the shop were never given advance notice of his visit.

All of these things have contributed to Vance having the lowest favorability rating on this year's presidential ballot -- and one of the lowest of any VP pick in recent history."
'Economy way better under Trump': Black voters share if they were better off 4 years ago,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/economy-way-better-under-trump-black-voters-share-were-better-off-4-years-ago,2024-10-01T09:09:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

""I want be biased, but I want to say I think its time for history to be made. I just think that its going to be a woman president,"" Detroit resident Mandela said.

""Trump. Them [stimulus checks] was fire tho,"" east side Detroit resident Keandre said. ""Definitely, when Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower."""
How young Republicans and Democrats are whipping up votes in key districts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123646/donald-trump-kamala-harris-georgia-election-young-voters,2024-10-01T09:06:16Z,"A member of the Young Republicans fills out a postcard asking for support for GOP candidates in Georgia. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

In a bustling restaurant in northwest Atlanta, roughly a dozen young Republicans are surrounded by pitchers, chips and salsa, chatting and laughing as they fill out postcards.

""Anybody need a drink?"" calls Winslow Jones, the president of Atlanta Young Republicans.

The group has met for what they're calling Margaritas and Mailers, and today they are handwriting postcards asking for support for two down-ballot GOP candidates running in nearby districts.

""Margaritas help,"" Jones laughs. ""This is an environment where people can come and connect with likeminded people.""

As election day nears, all eyes are once again on Georgia and its 16 electoral votes. And this time, one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention: millennials and Gen Z.

Voters under 44 years old will make up about half the eligible voting population in the U.S. this fall, according to population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. NPR traveled to Atlanta to see how different groups of young organizers are approaching this moment.

At the Young Republican meet-up, Jones points to the intellectual diversity among its members, including the varying opinions on former President Donald Trump.

""I think across the board there can be mixed feelings about Trump,"" she says. ""But I think what we're all united on is this is a much bigger picture here that we need to look at ... issues that are affecting people at large.""

Jones says the issues resonating with younger conservatives like herself include the economy, the U.S.-Mexico border and crime.

Nearby, Jacquelyn Harn is also busy writing postcards. She's the chairwoman of the statewide group, Young Republicans of Georgia.

""We're excited for a change,"" Harn says when asked about Trump's 2024 run. ""We want the life that we had four years ago when President Trump was president. And his policies -- his conservative policies -- we need those back, and we want those to be able to achieve our version of the American dream again.""

Harn says young people have been hit hard by the economy and inflation. She points to housing and the fact that she can't afford to buy a house because she's ""paying rent out the wazoo every month."" And she doesn't see that changing if Kamala Harris wins.

""She's saying day one, she's going to fix the housing crisis and the pricing and inflation,"" Harn says. ""She's had three-and-a-half years to do that, so no one's buying it.""

Yet while younger Republicans in Atlanta are mobilizing, young conservatives in general are becoming increasingly rare, says Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.

""Since the Obama years, the youth vote really has sided with the Democratic presidential candidate more often than not,"" Swint told NPR. ""The only question has been, what's the size of that turnout for the Democratic candidate?""

Back at the Margaritas and Mailers event, NPR asks Harn if it's harder for Republican groups to fire up younger voters who may be watching Harris, who is nearly 20 years younger than Trump and has landed high-profile endorsements likely to resonate with young people, like from Taylor Swift.

Harn says she isn't fazed: ""Taylor Swift is a billionaire who doesn't have to worry about how much groceries costs ... you can't tell me she relates to the average person around this table tonight. So if the best they can do is a celebrity endorsement that is not relatable at all, I don't see what they're doing.""

In the two months since President Biden stepped aside and Harris took the top of the ticket, Democratic groups in Georgia have shifted their campaigning into overdrive.

""Things just got crazy out of nowhere,"" says Davante Jennings, the president of Young Democrats of Georgia. ""Like, more people involved, more support, more work, more canvassing, more text banking. But it's good.""

When we meet Jennings recently at the Atlanta headquarters of the Harris-Walz campaign, he is joined by a dozen 20-somethings all typing on laptops set up on white folding tables, surrounded by pizza boxes. At the front of the room, a screen shows dozens more joining via Zoom. This is a joint text banking event, co-hosted by Young Democrats of Georgia, Men4Choice and Reproductive Freedom for All.

For organizers like Jennings, the goal is to hold onto the wave of enthusiasm Harris' candidacy generated and use it to mobilize all Georgians. At this event, they sent about 64,000 texts, all aimed at a very specific group: men of color, 27 to 50 years old.

""The backbone of the Democratic Party is the Black vote, which is why the Republicans are heavily focused on Black men specifically,"" Jennings says. ""When we show up ... elections seem to kind of flip. And right now it's not 100% guaranteed that we're going to get all of the Black vote.""

Jennings is also acutely aware of how seemingly small moments can build momentum. He just took over as the Young Democrats president from Parker Short, who recently went viral for lip-syncing Kendrick Lamar at a Harris rally in Atlanta. Jennings says the group got a lot more inquiries from potential organizers after that.

Yet while the Harris-Walz campaign is leaning hard into online messaging, embracing memes and viral moments on platforms like TikTok, political science professor Bernard Fraga of Emory University says it may have its limits. It's one thing to have that support from young people online, he says, it's another to turn that into ballots.

""It still remains to be seen whether the Harris campaign can continue that momentum all the way into November and make sure that Gen Z and younger voters are mobilized and active participants in our democracy,"" he told NPR.

Outside of campaigning for either party, a swathe of nonpartisan groups operate in Georgia and are working to simply make sure young people are politically engaged.

Among them is Rise, a nonprofit organization specifically targeting Gen Z students. It recruits ambassadors and pays them $3 for every person they get to pledge to vote. We met Rise's Georgia organizers recently in an area of Atlanta that includes a number of HBCUs, like Morehouse, Spelman and Clark Atlanta University.

In a presentation to a group of college students interested in becoming ambassadors, Rise's leaders tell them to highlight issues that are likely to resonate.

""How many folks in here have been impacted by gun violence?"" asks Aunna Dennis, Rise's director of Georgia. Nearly every hand in the room goes up.

Dennis tells NPR the aim is to mobilize millions of young voters across the country, but specifically in Georgia.

""We got 12 million voters here in this area alone, we have over five million registered voters. And we can unleash the youth wave on each of these campus communities,"" she says. ""That's a win for us.""

Meanwhile, at Kennesaw State University, nonprofit Poder Latinx has come to campus for National Voter Registration day. On the campus lawn, organizers are handing out pins, stickers, drinks -- even bottles of Tajin -- waving students over to the tent and encouraging them to register. By the end of the day, 81 new voters had registered, taking the total to more than 1,100 since Poder Latinx started doing this in March.

One of the students that came by the table was 19-year-old Iambianze Jackson. She told us she is planning to vote for Harris this November, but is less than enthusiastic.

""She doesn't really explain her policies well,"" Jackson says. ""She mainly talks about tax cuts for the middle class but like, she doesn't really have policies.""

And then Jackson says something we heard from a few people in this battleground state: The election can't come fast enough.

""I'm ready for it to be over,"" Jackson says with a laugh. ""I'm ready for the results to come out so we can just proceed from there, whatever happens."""
Jimmy Carter becomes first president to turn 100,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jimmy-carter-becomes-first-president-turn-100,2024-10-01T08:11:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Democrat President Carter turns 100 years old on Tuesday, earning himself the distinction of being the first president to ever live for an entire century.

Carter, the nation's 39th president, has been a man of several firsts. He was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital, was the first Naval Academy graduate to become president, and he was the first president to make a formal state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa, among other firsts. Now, Carter is the first U.S. president in history to make it to 100 years old.

Carter remains under home hospice care in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, where he has lived since the culmination of his presidency in 1981. This upcoming February marks two years in hospice for the former president who has outlived his wife, Rosalynn. She died last year at age 96.

JIMMY CARTER'S GRANDSON SAYS FORMER PRESIDENT IS 'COMING TO THE END'

""It's funny, President Carter has accomplished so much and rarely ever fails. But the one thing that he's not been good at is hospice,"" said Jill Stuckey, a family friend of the Carters for more than 30 years and the superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Park in Plains. ""He keeps living, and we are so thrilled about that fact. So, if he was to not be good at anything, we're glad it's hospice.""

When asked what Stuckey thought differentiated Carter from other past presidents who have lived into old age, she said it was ""tenacity.""

""He and Mrs. Carter were concerned about living as long as they possibly could, being as healthy as they possibly could, so they could help as many people as they possibly could,"" Stuckey told Fox News Digital. ""They have eaten right every single meal. They have exercised every single day. They are just relentless in taking care of themselves so they can live as long as they possibly can to take care of others. And that's what President Carter is proving today, that all those things make a difference.""

JIMMY CARTER'S FAMILY REVEALS HOW PRESIDENT FELT ABOUT BIDEN QUITTING, WHICH DNC SPEAKER STOLE THE SHOW

Stuckey said that events commemorating Carter's milestone 100th birthday have been going on in Plains since Saturday, when the town held its annual peanut festival.

""We celebrate peanut harvest season here in Plains, and it happens to coincide with President Carter's birthday every year, so we kind of combine them,"" Stuckey said.

She also indicated that Tuesday, on Carter's birthday, several other events commemorating his birthday will take place in Plains, including a naturalization ceremony for 100 new citizens at Plains High School, where both Jimmy and Rosalynn attended.

After the ceremony, there will be a flyover to honor the former president, organized with the help of Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro. In the late afternoon, Plains will also host a ribbon-cutting ceremony for new statues dedicated to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

Meanwhile, in celebration of Carter's birthday, volunteers in St. Paul, Minnesota, gathered to build 30 new homes over five days. Participants reportedly included country music stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood.

""You're one of the most influential statesmen in our history,"" President Biden said in a video released ahead of Carter's birthday on Tuesday.

Over the weekend, Grand Ole Opry member and country music legend Charlie McCoy played a special rendition of ""Georgia On My Mind"" to honor the former president.

WHY JIMMY CARTER IS THE FATHER OF THE POST-PRESIDENCY, SAW THE POWER OF HIS STATUS

""I remember the first time I saw him, and I was in awe, and the feeling's always been there. You can be around presidents all the time, but the first time is the most meaningful,"" said Cathie Skoog, a former member of the White House Communications Agency. ""He didn't care what people thought. He did what he felt was right for the country.""

Carter's presidency was marked by efforts to preserve the environment, advance human rights and propel the American education system to new heights. Carter overhauled the civil service system, deregulated the airline industry to spur competition, and created the Energy and Education departments. It was also Carter's administration that required both seat belts and airbags in cars.

However, Carter's presidency was also marked by trials, including high inflation, an energy crisis and failed negotiations to win the release of dozens of American hostages taken captive in Iran. Carter's Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, eventually resigned in protest of the administration's handling of the hostage crisis.

Amid the Iranian Revolution going on at the time, oil prices in the U.S. rose substantially. In July 1979, Carter blamed Americans discouraged by soaring inflation and the energy crisis for losing confidence in the country.

""The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us,"" Carter said in his speech. ""For the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people do not even vote. The productivity of American workers is actually dropping, and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world.""

""We must face the truth, and then we can change our course,"" he continued. ""We simply must have faith in each other, faith in our ability to govern ourselves and faith in the future of this nation. Restoring that faith and that confidence to America is now the most important task we face."""
What To Expect For Interest Rates From The November Fed Meeting,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/01/what-to-expect-for-interest-rates-from-the-november-fed-meeting/,2024-10-01T06:52:00Z,"On November 7, the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to again lower interest rates after an initial cut on September 18. Markets currently expect a 0.25% reduction in interest rates to 4.5% to 4.75%. However, a larger 0.5% reduction is possible depending on reported economic data over the coming weeks.

The FOMC will meet November 6-7 announcing its interest rate decision at 2pm E.T. on November 7. It is slightly unusual that the decision will be announced on a Thursday rather than the typical Wednesday. This will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30pm. Economic projections are released at every other meeting, and were last updated on September 18, so they will not be updated at the November FOMC meeting. Minutes of the meeting, offering greater color on the decision making process, are then typically scheduled to be released 3 weeks later.

The FOMC is currently appears to be dialing back restrictive monetary policy as inflation is now clearly within sight of their 2% target, and the labor market has seen broadly rising unemployment over the past 12 months, albeit from low levels.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index showed 2.2% annual inflation to August 2024, or 2.7% with food and energy price trends excluded. That's down significantly from the peak levels of 7% in summer 2022, which prompted the FOMC to raise rates aggressively. In addition, even at the best of times, the FOMC has been unable to hold inflation precisely at 2%. As such, deviations of around one percent from target are historically quite typical.

The unemployment rate is 4.2% for August 2024. That's up from around 3.5% for much of last year. Unemployment still remains at low levels by historical standards and the FOMC has expressed confidence in the job market, seeing a return to greater balance, rather than the start of ongoing weakening. Nonetheless, even relatively small rises in unemployment have often bought recessions historically.

As Powell said on September 18. ""We know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even.""

As always the FOMC will watch incoming data closely before their next meeting. Perhaps the most significant of many reports will be two jobs reports on October 4 and November 1. Here the FOMC is generally comfortable with some cooling in the jobs market, but is looking to avoid a more abrupt rise in unemployment that could signal a recession.

For inflation, key data points will come with the Consumer Price Index for September on October 10, and the PCE inflation release also for September on October 31. The broad expectation here is that inflation should continue to trend toward 2% and won't bring cause for alarm. However, jobs data may prove more significant in shaping the FOMC's thinking. If there is a further rise in unemployment, then the FOMC may be prompted to make larger interest rate cuts to counter recession risk.

It is highly likely that short-term interest rates are cut again on November 7, according to fixed income markets. Yet, it is unclear how large the cut will be, with a 0.25% cut viewed as more likely than 0.5%. However, there's ample time for that to change. More fundamentally, markets are assessing how low interest rates will ultimately go. Currently, short-term interest rates could be around 3% by late 2025, but markets project a broad range of outcomes, implying that anything from 2% to 4% is possible."
72 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/72-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-10-01T04:07:10Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' media strategy heading into November.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 72 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August last month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

From Climate Purist To Climate Pragmatist: The Case Of Kamala Harris,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakashdolsak/2024/09/30/from-climate-purist-to-climate-pragmatist-the-case-of-kamala-harris/,2024-10-01T03:25:01Z,"How should we assess whether a politician is pro-climate, anti-climate, or somewhere in between? We probably look at what they say and what they do. If so, we might be witnessing a climate policy convergence between Democrats and Republicans, much more than what is typically acknowledged. This means that some liberals are no longer climate purists and some conservatives are no longer climate skeptics. They are becoming climate pragmatists.

The rise of climate pragmatism is visible in different forms. Some liberals recognize the tension between decarbonization on the one hand and jobs, inflation, and energy security on the other. Consequently, they have softened the rhetoric on ending reliance on fossil fuels. At the same time, conservatives recognize the inevitable shift away from fossil fuels because solar and wind are economically competitive. Seeing the writing on the wall, they are supporting climate-friendly industries.

While climate pragmatism might reflect political opportunism, we view it as a positive development that negates ""litmus test politics,"" and facilitates policy progress. Kamala Harris of 2024, in a sharp deviation from Kamala Harris of 2016-20, epitomizes the emerging climate pragmatism.

Kamala Harris' Evolving Climate Positions

In 2016, California's Attorney General Kamala Harris sued the Obama administration over permitting hydraulic fracturing. In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. In the 2020 Presidential primaries, Candidate Harris said, ""I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.""

Fast forward to September 2024. In the TV debate with Trump, she supported fracking and even took credit for the largest increase in oil production in history: ""I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking ... We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history...""

Now consider another policy issue: Electric Vehicles (EVs.) In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act, which required ""the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a zero-emission passenger vehicle standard. Specifically, the bill sets a schedule for increasing the percentage of zero-emission vehicles a manufacturer delivers for sale, culminating in a requirement to sell only zero-emission vehicles from 2040 on."" In 2024, she does not support the EV mandate.

Critics might call this opportunism. Instead, we suggest that she is a climate pragmatist who is not bound by ideological litmus tests, and who is open to changing policy positions in response to political imperatives and economic opportunities. She is a politician, not an ideologue -- and this is a good quality if we want policy progress in a polarized world.

Harris is not alone in evolving into a climate pragmatist; she is joined by a growing cadre of Republicans and Democrats.

Republicans and Climate Skepticism

Republicans are supposed to be an anti-climate party. Historically, many have questioned climate science -- and a handful probably continue to do so. They support investments in fossil fuel exploration, extraction, refining, and pipelines. Trump is a vocal supporter of coal. Not a single House or Senate Republican voted for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In recent years, Republican Attorney Generals and Congressional leaders have pursued companies supporting the pro-climate ESG metric alleging that these companies are neglecting their fiduciary duties, or unlawfully colluding to impose liberal agendas.

And yet, Republican Governors are supporting renewable energy. Texas leads the country in utility-scale wind and solar. Indiana's Governor Holcomb is an outspoken champion of renewable energy. Republican Governors (but for South Dakota's Governor Noem) are actively courting EV, solar, and wind manufacturing industries which have received generous federal subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats and Fossil Fuels

Democrats are supposed to be the pro-environment party that seeks vigorous climate action. Many of them sponsored the Green New Deal Resolution in the U.S. House and the Senate. They enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest infusion of federal monies in climate policy.

And yet, the Biden-Harris administration celebrates the rise of America as an energy superpower, driven primarily by fracking. It allowed Alaska's Willow Project despite vocal opposition from environmental groups and Biden's pledge of ""no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period."" It supports the massive investment in LNG pipelines and terminals for exporting fracked gas. Leading Pennsylvania Democrats, Governor Shapiro and Senators Casey and Fetterman do not support a fracking ban either. Alaska's lone House Member, Mary Pelota, a Democrat, claims credit for pressuring the Biden Administration to approve the Willow project. Ohio's Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown wants to overturn the EPA rule that limits greenhouse gas emissions from power plants as well as the vehicle tailpipe emissions rule.

In sum, ideological purity might have become less salient in driving climate policy. Instead, politicians are responding to local/state-level factors, a good development because it bridges the democracy deficit. Democrats from fracking states support fossil fuels. Republicans from a state with wind and solar potential support renewable energy. Hopefully, voters will reward climate pragmatism and policy evolution. They will assess politicians not by what they said in the past, but by what they say now and importantly, what they do. With this yardstick, Democrats and Republicans will have additional incentives to embrace climate pragmatism and work together on climate issues."
Here's How To Help Those Impacted By Hurricane Helene,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/09/30/heres-how-to-help-those-impacted-by-hurricane-helene/,2024-10-01T02:59:24Z,"Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations -- like checking to see that the organization has its paperwork in order -- are good rules to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

Over the weekend, many of my friends were worried about their children, parents, and other loved ones. Hurricane Helene brought flooding rains to parts of the southeast, including western North Carolina-the result was widespread power outages, washed-out roads, and a lack of cell phone service. At least 133 deaths have been attributed to the storm, and days later, hundreds are still searching for their loved ones and millions are without power. It's clear that recovery will be slow.

If you want to know what you can do to help out, here are a few tips:

Cash is king. While you may want to send food and other items, the infrastructure may not support those donations. Many organizations have been clear that cash, or cash equivalent, is preferred. Keep receipts if you intend to claim those donations on your tax return.

Be smart. Be wary of personal solicitations on your doorstep or over the phone. Make sure that gifts made by checks or credit card gifts are secure. And don't send money by text or using apps like Venmo without verifying the organization and contact information. If you don't want to donate online or by text, most organizations have alternatives, like donation forms that you can mail together with a check. Never send cash through the mail.

Check credentials. Check out the credentials of a potential charitable organization before you donate. If you're looking for a tax break, you can always confirm their charitable status through the IRS website using the TEOS Search Tool. You also can confirm your charitable status by calling the IRS (toll-free) at 1.877.829.5500. Keep in mind that churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques are considered de facto charitable organizations and are eligible to receive deductible donations even if they're not on the list (some exceptions apply, so be sure and ask if you're not sure). Forbes also maintains a list of charities -- you can check out our Top Charities 2023 list here.

Use caution when donating to individuals. For federal income tax purposes, you can only deduct contributions to qualified tax-exempt charitable organizations. Donations to individuals are never deductible for tax purposes, even if the individuals are really deserving. If the tax deduction is important to you, consider working with an organization that provides disaster relief (there are some listed below). But there's another, non-tax reason to use caution: money solicited for individuals could be part of a scam (like this one) and even if it's not, the money might not be spent as advertised. Once you hand over the cash, you have no control over its use.

Rely on oldies but goodies. There's nothing wrong with new charitable organizations but there is something to be said for those that have been around for a while. Brand new organizations may not have the facilities in place to offer the most effective relief, or they could be scams. Use caution before handing over your cash.

Pay attention to the rules and keep good records. The rules for charitable giving apply even in extraordinary situations, although sometimes those rules may be tweaked to allow for more generosity. Be sure to document your gifts and get receipts -- the IRS requires that you do so for tax purposes, and having the information available is handy if you want to follow up with another donation. Don't hesitate to ask the charitable organization or your tax professional if you have questions.

If you want to help but aren't sure where to start, tax-exempt charities that have indicated they are accepting Helene-specific donations include:

(Please note that these are not endorsements of a specific charity. If you're not a fan of those organizations listed, many other charities would welcome your support.)

As you consider which organizations might make the best use of your gifts, don't forget to consider the impact that your charitable donations might make on your taxes. Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations -- like checking to see that the organization has its paperwork in order -- are good rules to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

If you want to make sure that your charitable donations count for tax purposes, you have to follow a few rules. A tax deduction for charitable giving isn't guaranteed just because you're feeling generous. Here's what you need to know:

Itemize. To claim a charitable deduction on your tax return, you must itemize your deductions.

Choose carefully when donating. Remember, only donations to qualified charitable organizations are deductible.

Get a receipt -- even for cash. As a best practice, always ask for a receipt. Almost any charitable organization will happily offer you one. You don't have to submit this documentation along with your tax return, but you need to be prepared to provide it in case of an audit. Cash donations, no matter the amount, must be substantiated by a bank record such as a canceled check or credit card receipt, clearly annotated with the name of the charity or in writing from the organization. The writing must include the date, the amount, and the organization that received the donation.

Don't overlook payroll deductions. Your employer may participate in a charitable giving program that allows you to make contributions directly from your paycheck. If you make a contribution by payroll deduction, record-keeping requirements require that you retain a pay stub, form W-2, or other document furnished by your employer that shows the total amount withheld as a charitable donation, along with the pledge card that shows the name of the charity. For federal workers, a pledge card with the name of a Combined Federal Campaign will meet these requirements.

Pay attention to the value of any donor incentives. A charitable donation is deductible only to the extent that the donation exceeds the value of any goods or services received in exchange. If you make a donation and receive something in exchange -- anything from a coffee mug to a plated dinner -- you can only deduct the cost of your donation less the value of the item received. If you're not sure of the value of an item or service received after a donation, just ask. Most charitable organizations will do the math for you and document the value of your donation on their thank you letter or receipt.

Consider donating appreciated assets. Donating property that has appreciated in value, like stock, can result in a double benefit. Not only can you deduct the property's fair market value (so long as you've owned it for at least one year), but you will also avoid paying capital gains tax. Normally, appreciated assets are subject to capital gains tax at disposition -- whether by selling or gifting -- but there's an exception for donations to charitable organizations.

Don't forget about retirement assets. Typically, if you want to make a donation from your IRA, you'd have to withdraw those funds, pay the tax, and then make the donation. There is an exception: a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) allows you to roll funds directly from your IRA to a qualified charity. Those amounts can be used to satisfy your required minimum distributions (RMDs) for the year, and the amount donated is excluded from your taxable income -- you won't even have to itemize to do it. The total amount of QCDs that you can exclude from your gross income increased to $105,000 in 2024, up from $100,000 in 2023.

You can't deduct the value of your time. The IRS does not allow a charitable deduction for volunteering your services, even if you can easily put a dollar amount on your time. So if, as an architect, you usually charge $350 per hour and use that time to help a qualified charitable organization, you're allowed a deduction of $0 -- that's not a typo. The same rule applies whether you're a lawyer, doctor, artist, nurse, accountant, or writer at Forbes.

You can deduct expenses related to volunteering. While you can't deduct the value of your time, most out-of-pocket expenses relating to volunteering are deductible so long as they're not reimbursed to you or considered personal. Out-of-pocket charitable expenses that might be deductible include parking fees and tolls; other travel expenses; uniforms or other related clothing worn as part of your charitable service; and supplies used in the performance of your services. For 2024, the rate for mileage driven in service of charitable organizations is just 14 cents per mile. The rate is currently fixed by Congress and is never adjusted for inflation -- which is why it hasn't budged in years, even though gas is more expensive. As with other donations, keep good records for out-of-pocket expenses -- documentation is critical.

Document the value of your gift. Good records are always important when it comes to charitable giving, but even more so when it comes to donations of noncash items. You can generally take a deduction for the item's fair market value -- the price a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller. If you're self-documenting the donation because it's less than $500, be specific, noting the description and condition of the items. If you contribute property worth more than $5,000, you must obtain a written appraisal of the property's fair market value. If you make noncash contributions (generally over $500), you may also be required to fill out one or more parts of Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions.

Limits may apply. The amount you can deduct for charitable contributions is generally limited to no more than 60% of your AGI. Your deduction may be further limited to 50%, 30%, or 20% of your AGI, depending on the type of property you give and the type of organization you give it to.

Contributions are tax-deductible in the year they are made. That means that to make your gifts count during the tax year, they should must be made by December 31. Contributions made by text message are deductible in the year you send the text message if the contribution is charged to your telephone or wireless account. Credit card charges -- even if they're not paid off before the end of the year -- are deductible so long as the amount is captured by year-end. Similarly, checks written and mailed by the end of the year will be deductible for this year even if they aren't cashed in 2023. And, good intentions don't count: making announcements that you intend to donate assets will not qualify for a deduction in the current tax year unless you make good on the pledge during the year.

As of the time this article was published, the IRS had not yet announced tax relief for those impacted by the storm, including extending the time to file for those individuals and businesses expected to file tax returns in October. The tax community expects that this will change and the Forbes tax team will provide an update once it is available."
"Harris' ""Opportunity Economy""  Closes The Economic Gap With Trump",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/30/harris-opportunity-economy--closes-the-economic-gap-with-trump/,2024-10-01T01:18:25Z,"With just over 30 days left until the presidential election, Kamala Harris is emphasizing an ""Opportunity Economy"" as a centerpiece of her campaign. Although Donald Trump held a substantial polling lead over Joe Biden on economic issues, Harris is now virtually even with Trump on economics. What's in her program that's closing the gap?

Harris' economic vision continually emphasizes the middle class -- not the poor, or minorities, or immigrants. They aren't central to her message and policies. Her campaign website says ""she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans."" And the ""Issues"" page on her website leads, in big bold letters, with ""Build An Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs For Families.""

Why ""lower costs for families?"" Because the biggest economic problem faced by Joe Biden -- and still faced by Harris -- is inflation. An August CBS News poll found that ""76% of registered voters said it (inflation) was a major factor in their choice for president."" And in May, an ABC News poll found Trump trusted over Biden on inflation ""by a margin of 14 percentage points.""

Inflation was driven by the Covid-19 pandemic's ""supply shock,"" with disruption to supply chains, the economy, and prices. The inflation rate has been trending downward, with the current rate of 2.5% the lowest since February of 2021. But consumers remain heavily scarred by the pandemic inflation, which reached an annual rate of 9.1% in June of 2022, a rate not seen since the oil shock inflation of the early 1980s.

Harris doesn't duck away from inflation. Her program calls for bringing down housing costs by building more, but also for ""legislation to outlaw new form of price fixing by corporate landlords."" Another major provision would ""take down bad actors and bring down costs,"" calling for the ""first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.""

Economists are skeptical about these policies. Yes, investors buy many homes to rent them out. But the vast majority of housing investors are small local landlords, not big corporations.

And even some Democratic economists don't endorse the attack on price gouging. Jason Furman, chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, says ""this is not sensible policy...there's no upside here, and there is some downside."" But economists like Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts argue that large and powerful firms took advantage of the pandemic shock to raise prices and generate profits beyond covering their costs -- what she calls ""sellers' inflation.""

Of course, Harris is running for president, not leading an economics seminar. And her attacks on price gouging are very popular. A new poll for The Guardian did a blind test of Harris' and Trump's economic ideas, and found Harris had ""four of the top five most popular proposals."" The most popular of twelve policies tested in the poll? A ""federal ban on price-gouging food and groceries.""

That's one reason Harris' has closed the ""trust gap"" with Trump on the economy. A recent Morning Consult poll found Harris and Trump were equally trusted on the economy, a major gain for the Democrats compared with Biden's double-digit polling gaps with Trump.

Harris' economic plan goes well beyond managing prices. She promises to continue (and perhaps expand) Biden's support for US manufacturing, using trade policy (including tariffs) and subsidies to support critical industries like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy. She ties these to other specific policies to lower energy costs and help with the climate crisis.

Although Harris endorses strategic, limited tariffs, she opposes Trump's plan to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 to 20%, and on imports from China by 60% or more. She calls this a ""tax"" on American households, and economists agree with her. Economists at Goldman Sachs, the Peterson Institute, the Tax Foundation, and the Tax Policy Foundation all find Trump's draconian tariffs would slow the economy, penalize households, and cause higher inflation.

Harris also want to focus on care work, both for children and for the elderly, as important for the economy. Better care would help workers -- the vast majority of them women -- better balance care responsibilities and their careers. And it would help the women workers who provide paid care work while suffering inadequate wages and working conditions.

Although commentators criticize Harris for not providing enough detail on her economic policies, her proposals are a model of clarity compared with what Trump offers. The New York Times reports Harris has distributed an 82-page booklet on her proposals, compared to Trump who has ""coughed up a string of four- or five-word slogans promising tax cuts, some of which his advisers cannot fully explain."" '

Harris also is battling complex economic views held by voters. In spite of continued job creation, rising real wages, slowing inflation, and continued GDP growth, consumer confidence is sending mixed signals. September's Survey of Consumers from the University of Michigan rose 3% above August, ""as consumers' expectations for the economy brighten."" But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index suffered its largest drop ""since August 2021"" between August and September.

We're in the home stretch of the election, so don't expect significantly more policy details from Harris. Rather, she will continue emphasizing economic security and opportunity for the middle class, contrasting her optimistic vision against a bleaker and less coherent approach from Donald Trump. So far, that's working in her favor."

Waiting For The September Jobs Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/30/waiting-for-the-september-jobs-report/,2024-09-30T23:00:40Z,"The September jobs report will be pivotal for markets. Payroll gains have slowed over the past two years, while the unemployment rate has been rising on-trend. With the Federal Reserve on the verge of more interest rate cuts, the jobs report will be a key data point informing markets of future Fed policy actions.

Investors, analysts, and policymakers are watching economic data releases closely for Fed implications. One of the most important economic data reports of the month will be the U.S. employment situation report released on October 4 at 8:30 a.m. ET. This report, which is informally called the jobs report by economists, has the potential to move foreign exchange, equity, bond, and commodity markets.

The unemployment rate has risen from 3.5% in September 2022 to 4.2% in August 2024. While the unemployment rate has risen, net monthly payroll gains have slowed. In August 2024, only 142,000 net new jobs were added for the month. Directional changes in September labor data will have the power to move markets, especially if the jobs report tips the balance of risks for the Fed's dual mandate.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. While the labor market is close to full employment, prices are not yet low and stable. Additionally, recent Fed statements and remarks have acknowledged the growing balance of risks in the economic outlook, including the downside financial market risks to both parts of its dual mandate.

While year-on-year inflation rates have slowed, they remain above the Fed's 2% target. August 2024 year-on-year inflation rates were 2.5% for CPI and 3.2% for core CPI, with year-on-year total PCE inflation up 2.2% and core PCE up 2.7%. These rates are unlikely to fall to the Fed's 2% target this year. However, they have been falling on-trend, and they are likely to fall to the Fed's 2% target next year. Given the currently elevated levels of year-on-year inflation, the Fed is likely to tread carefully in its rate cut policies.

A Fed interest rate cut of 0.25% is likely on November 7. However, a rate cut of 0.5% would be more likely if the labor market weakens significantly -- or if the U.S. presidential election outcome is unknown by the time of the November 7 Fed decision.

Potential Market Implications Of The Jobs Report

A solid September employment report with payrolls above August levels with an unemployment rate at or below 4.2% is likely to signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which would likely support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, a solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it would assuage concerns about recession.

A weak September employment report with payrolls below August levels with an unemployment rate at or above 4.3% would signal that larger interest rate cuts are more likely. This would, in turn, likely weigh on the greenback and bond yields. However, a weak report could still have mixed to bearish implications for equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices, because downside risks could exacerbate concerns about recession.

In anticipation of the September jobs report, a number of other labor market data releases will be watched closely this week, including September ADP payrolls, August Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data, and weekly jobless claims."
How Brands Can Get Their Share of the $1.59T Holiday Sales Projection,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradsimms/2024/09/30/how-brands-can-get-their-share-of-the-159t-holiday-sales-projection/,2024-09-30T22:49:56Z,"The U.S. presidential election and year-end holidays are converging fast, bringing inflation, cost of goods, and general economic pressure to the forefront of many consumers' minds.

According to research from Bankrate, 33% of consumers plan to spend less on holiday shopping than last year, and nearly a quarter say the cost of holiday shopping will stress their budgets. While Deloitte is still forecasting a moderate increase of 2.3-3.3% in overall holiday sales - totaling around $1.59 trillion - the pace is slower compared to last year, when they predicted a 3.5-4.6% increase during the same months.

Facing varied consumer spending mindsets and the unknown economic impact of the election, marketers are under pressure to get the next few months right.

Every good business knows that planning for the holiday season starts long before the first Christmas-themed advertisement hits television screens. And any savvy marketer knows it's best to get their brand top of mind well before that. Brands with strong loyalty programs in place, supporting a two-way conversation with consumers throughout the year, are already poised to be on shoppers' go-to gift lists.

Year-Round Value

According to Campaign Monitor, in 2018, over 116 million emails were sent on Black Friday, 106 million on Cyber Monday, and 95 million on Thanksgiving. Consumers are bombarded with content daily, and getting them to open your brand's email - especially during the holiday season - is a challenge. Unless, you've already established your emails are worth reading.

While loyalty programs involve far more than email campaigns, the bar is often low in this medium, making it a prime spot to surprise your customers with something truly entertaining. Dollar Shave Club has created custom cartoons, Birchbox used gamification, and Doulingo leaned into hyper-personalization, charting its users' learning progress with the same precision as an NFL analyst.

Crafting content that doesn't just feel like another ad can help put the odds in your favor when consumers are already overwhelmed by their inboxes. With Deloitte predicting e-commerce will be a key driver of holiday sales this year, up around 8% compared to last year, digital channels are a good place to connect with consumers.

Smart, Strategic Rewards

Building a rewards program that works for both consumers and a brand's bottom line is a science and an art. But when executed well, a rewards program can drive spending throughout the year, positioning your brand at the top of the consideration set when holiday budgets are set. In fact, YouGov found that 65% of consumers in the U.S. and United Kingdom planned to leverage loyalty programs to help save money during the 2023 holiday season.

As more brands have reprioritized loyalty, consumers are joining more programs. According to eMarketer, the average U.S. consumer had 9 active loyalty program memberships in 2023 compared to 6.7 in 2019. To stand out, brands need to prioritize their consumers and explore creative new ways to reward them. Delta, for example, partnered with Starbucks so that members could earn more SkyMiles through Starbucks purchases - a notable perk for those who regularly buy coffee and need to book holiday travel when prices are particularly high.

The Megaphone Effect

When a brand forms a strong connection with one consumer, it's already begun building connections with that consumer's friends and family. Research from Nielsen shows that 88% of consumers trust recommendations from people they know more than any other marketing channel, and McKinsey & Company found that word of mouth is the primary factor behind 20-50% of all purchasing decisions.

As gift list suggestions for the ""Guy Who Has Everything"" or ""It Girl"" start popping up all over social media and other platforms, the best list to be on is that of a consumer's close, personal connections. Even if a loyalty program participant doesn't purchase from your brand this holiday season, you've increased the likelihood that they will suggest your brand to a friend-or a few.

The battle to top consumers' 2024 holiday lists started a year ago. Brands that have built loyalty and cultural relevance have a big head start, and those with an effective loyalty program will see its returns as they convert sales before the year ends."
Groundbreaking Study Demonstrates Clinical Benefits Of Planting Trees: The Green Heart Louisville Project Reveals How,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrist/2024/09/30/groundbreaking-study-demonstrates-clinical-benefits-of-planting-trees-the-green-heart-louisville-project-reveals-how/,2024-09-30T21:28:27Z,"As a doctor and conservationist, I have a natural curiosity about nature and about health. Last month I traveled to Louisville, Kentucky for a groundbreaking announcement on how inextricably intertwined the two are. And why that's important to you and me.

Though many of us intuitively understand that spending time in nature is good for us, there has been a lack of rigorous scientific research to prove it -- until now.

On a sunny day in late August, we gathered at the University of Louisville to share the results of painstaking research that first began back in 2017. The clinical investigation, designed in partnership with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, set out to answer the question, can trees improve our health? The answer, I discovered is: yes. In fact, based on what I learned that day, we might even consider trees as medicine!

Thanks to the Green Heart Louisville Project, the science now confirms that increasing trees in a neighborhood can yield measurable health benefits for residents.

This project set out to test this hypothesis through a collaboration of universities and local leaders, with the financial and advisory support of The Nature Conservancy (TNC), on whose Global Board I sit. I first learned of the research when my wife Tracy and I were seated next to Dr. Aruni Bhatnagar, head of the University of Louisville's Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute and principal investigator on this unique project, at a TNC dinner in 2018. I remember thinking, can daily exposure to trees strategically placed in a community actually change blood chemistries of the body?

Here's how the intervention of tree and shrub planting worked and what was found.

The Green Heart Louisville Project is the first longitudinal clinical trial to test a ""greening intervention"" in the same way a new pharmaceutical intervention is tested. Trees are the medicine. This study is groundbreaking because while other studies have found an association or correlation between nature and well-being, the Green Heart Louisville Project is the first to scientifically and quantitatively measure the impact that an increase in trees and shrubs in a neighborhood can have on human health.

After years of data collection and analysis, the Green Heart Project is building a scientific case for the powerful connections between the health of our planet and the health of all of us.

So what was the groundwork for this intervention? It began as a partnership with The Nature Conservancy, Washington University in St. Louis, Hyphae Design Laboratory, and others, under the visionary leadership of the University of Louisville's Aruni Bhatnagar, Ph.D. It was launched as a first-of-its-kind project in 2017 to study whether, and to what extent, living among greener surroundings contributes to better health. The National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences awarded the University Louisville funding to support the research. The Nature Conservancy raised substantial money for the trees, and dedicated expertise to the planning, implementation, and maintenance of the greening effort.

Key to the success of the effort was philanthropist Christina Brown, whom the Kentucky branch of The Nature Conservancy dubbed the ""Godmother of Kentucky."" Christy, a longtime friend to my wife Tracy and me, has dedicated her life to advancing health, nature, and sustainability in all the communities she touches. The interconnecting influences that comprise health and wellbeing are captured in the illustrative emblem of ""The Circle of Health and Harmony,"" (see figure) closely associated with her many endeavors and proudly worn as a lapel pin by so many advocates around the country. This tool emphasizes how environmental health is central to all well-being. It was Christy's commitment that provided the inspiration and foundational funding for the Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, whose mission is to investigate all aspects of health and their interrelationships, and it was her support that laid the groundwork for the Green Heart Project to come to fruition.

With this robust backing, the project began with baseline health data collection from over 750 study participants. The Nature Conservancy led several contractors and nonprofit partners, including Louisville Grows, on a multi-year effort to plant more than 8,000 trees and shrubs - most of them evergreens - in designated intervention areas in four neighborhoods in South Louisville. The work focuses on neighborhoods that had fewer trees compared with more affluent parts of the city. The neighborhoods are mixed racially and ethnically: 54 percent White, 29 percent Black, and 11 percent Hispanic. A busy highway runs directly through the neighborhoods -- providing an unhealthy baseline of air pollution. The comparison control areas of these neighborhoods did not receive trees from the project.

Project team members maintained the trees after planting to promote their survival, growth, and impact. Picture these South Louisville neighborhoods being gradually hugged by a growing mix of pines, hollies, arborvitaes, magnolias, dogwoods, oaks, and more.

Nearly seven years since the official launch of the Green Heart Louisville Project and nearly two years since tree planting concluded, the first phase of clinical study results are in - and they are promising.

How a ""Greening Intervention"" Improved Individual and Public Health

The researchers found that participants living in the neighborhoods of the greening intervention had, post-planting, lower levels of a widely recognized blood marker of inflammation (C-reactive protein) strongly associated with risk for cardiovascular disease, as well as diabetes and some cancers.

The precise etiology of this dramatic reduction of blood inflammatory measures is yet to be determined. Hypotheses currently being investigated include the degrees to which trees filter air pollution that could harden coronary arteries, whether trees improve sleep and reduce stress by buffering ambient roadway noise, how efficiently various species of trees absorb harmful pollutants, and what chemicals are released by trees that physiologically lower stress hormone levels.

Why is this significant? Because it means that adding trees to a neighborhood may reduce community members' risk of heart disease and other chronic, costly, and fatal diseases. The study demonstrated a significant decrease in the inflammatory blood marker. The clinical manifestations and direct impact on the heart, lungs, and other organs will be measured in the next phase of study.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and globally. And in Louisville alone, heart disease costs the city an estimated $650 million a year. If we could re-direct even a small amount of those costs towards prevention through a prescription of trees, it would reduce healthcare costs significantly over the long term. And save lives.

The Nature Conservancy raised and invested $8.7 million for this project and played a fundamental role in implementing the greening efforts. TNC, the largest conservation entity in the nation, is committed to applying scientific research at the intersection of conservation and human health. TNC is grounded in the belief that human health is intrinsically and intimately tied to the health of our planet.

In addition to improving the body's health, we already know that trees reduce heat, provide wildlife and pollinator habitat, decrease stormwater runoff, increase property values, and lower utility bills. Psychologists have observed that stress levels and depressive states are less in greener sections of urban areas.

Indeed, when viewed in its totality, no pill or medicine provides as many ancillary benefits as does nature.

The Green Heart Louisville Project should give us hope, because it is a scientifically tested, replicable model for investing in nature in cities in the U.S. and around the world. It's a biological and economic reason to proactively bring nature to the cities. When I share this exciting news with others, they frequently ask what they can do as individuals. My answer is:

First, help spread the word. We live in an era of information overload, and even critical research and findings fail to get the attention they deserve. People should know about these important findings because they have such a demonstrable impact on our individual health and well-being.

Second, I encourage others to become engaged and advocate for investments in nature with elected officials and other decision makers. The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act makes substantial monies available to local communities for planting of trees. Most community leaders are not aware of this resource for better health.

Nature is essential infrastructure, too often taken for granted. But now we know it can make us healthier. Our local, state, and federal budgets need to reflect the reality that our environment and the nature around us affect our health in tangible, economically beneficial ways.

Thanks to the dedicated efforts of all those who contributed to the Green Heart Louisville Project, we now have a proven reason to advocate for increasing trees and green spaces in cities as a key strategy to improve individual and community health - while also making our cities cooler, more beautiful, and more welcoming places to live in and raise our families."
Economists And Regular Americans Dangerously Disagree About Presidential Candidates' Proposals,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hershshefrin/2024/09/30/economists-and-regular-americans-dangerously-disagree-about-presidential-candidates-proposals/,2024-09-30T20:05:53Z,"Regular Americans and professional economists sharply disagree about the merits of key economic policies being put forward by the country's two Presidential candidates. This is extremely important because while professional economists seek to identify rational policies, regular people are psychologically limited in their abilities to engage in rational economic analysis.

Economic analysis is complicated, detailed, and uses sophisticated techniques. Most people lack the requisite skills to understand the analysis; and therefore, they resort to intuitive ""sniff tests."" These sniff tests are sometimes effective; but, not always, and it is the ""not always"" situations that can be dangerous.

The votes of regular Americans will decide the winner of the presidential election, not the recommendations of professional economists. Some might believe in the principle known as ""the wisdom of crowds,"" but that principle breaks down when the issues involve judgmental tasks that are emotionally laden.

An example where regular Americans and professional economists disagree is former President Trump's proposal that the U.S. levy a tariff of up to 20% on all imported goods. According to a survey administered by the Wall Street Journal, 47% of regular Americans surveyed support this proposal, despite no professional economist surveyed doing so.

Standard economic analysis indicates that tariffs harm the general public, even though they may benefit a few special interests. Tariffs work by imposing taxes on imported goods. These taxes are paid by the consumers of those goods, not the foreign companies or countries selling the goods. The point of these taxes is to reduce the cost advantage enjoyed by foreign competitors, thereby forcing Americans to buy ""made in America"" that is more expensive to manufacture, or of lower quality than what comes from abroad, or both. Remember, Trump is talking about imposing a 20% tariff on all imported goods!

The 47% of Americans who favor Trump's tariff proposal appear not to understand the economics of tariffs. Their intuitions are more likely influenced more by the language they hear from Trump, which is laden with emotion. For example, Trump describes tariffs as ""beautiful."" He avoids describing tariffs as taxes on American consumers, but instead says that tariffs ""will take in hundreds of billions of dollars into our Treasury and use that money to benefit the American citizens.""

The psychological elements in Trump's pitch for tariffs are highly germane, and apparently effective. The word ""beautiful"" has a positive spin, what psychologists call ""positive affect."" Avoiding the description of tariffs as a tax is an example of psychological salience, or the lack thereof: out of sight out of mind. The statement about billions of dollars flowing into ""our Treasury"" that will ""benefit the American citizens"" is intended to create a false image in which the 47% view themselves as being the beneficiaries of the alleged flows into the Treasury, rather than special interests.

Trust is the overarching psychological principal at work in Trump's communications about tariffs, and of course other campaign issues. The academic framework for the psychology of trust suggests that Trump's followers trust him because of four reasons.

1. They regard him as a friend, not a foe. He does tell them he loves them.

2. They regard him as having integrity, and believe his statements that the accusations against him in the courts are a witch hunt.

3. They judge him to be competent, and believe him when he says that, as president, ""I took in from China hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs, and I had no inflation.""

4. They view him as predictable; and indeed, he routinely delivers the same basic messages.

Behavioral economics use the term ""nudge"" for interventions designed to alter people's behavior. The nudge framework has several components, such as ""incentives/feelings"" and ""mapping of actions to consequences."" Dark nudges are interventions that harm people, even though on the surface they appear to be beneficial. In respect to tariffs, dark nudging helps people feel as if our country is socking it to China. It helps think that doing so adds billions of dollars to the Treasury. However, the nudge is dark because the tariffs will do much more harm than good for the country.

Vice President Harris has proposed penalizing companies that engage in price gouging for food products. The Wall Street Journal reports that although 72% of regular Americans support this proposal, only 13% of economists do so.

Standard economic analysis focuses on the role that prices play in aligning demand and supply. Prices naturally tend to rise in the wake of a shock that either reduces supply or increases demand. Suppressing price changes typically creates market inefficiencies by reducing the motivation for producers to increase supply and for customers to reduce demand.

The 72% of regular Americans who support Harris' price gouging proposal appear not to understand the subtleties associated with the dynamics of equilibrium pricing. Research in behavioral economics finds that people instead focus on a perceived lack of fairness when the price of key products rise after the occurrence of an unfavorable event. The term ""gouging"" is emotionally loaded, and implies the violation of a right people assume they have.

Harris' economic plan, for lowering costs and creating what she calls an ""opportunity economy,"" states the following:

""Vice President Harris and Governor Walz's proposal -- like many of the laws already on the books in 37 states -- will go after nefarious price gouging on essential goods during emergencies or times of crisis. When an emergency strikes, the American people deserve to know the government can take on bad actors that take advantage of a crisis to excessively jack up prices.""

The details of Harris' proposal are vague, but her plan references the existing state laws that are on the books. Her plan suggests that she plans to introduce national legislation along the same lines.

Psychologically, Harris' proposal might redirect attention away from voters' perception that the economy is weak, and that inflation remains a threat. To be sure, the inflation experienced during the Biden presidency badly stung most regular Americans. They are still feeling the pain, still experiencing the fear of a resurgence in inflation, and by associating Harris to Biden, in her role as Vice President, connecting her to that pain and fear.

Nevertheless, the economy is currently performing well. The rate of economic growth is normal, the odds of an imminent recession are low, the unemployment rate is low, and inflation is coming down. The Federal Reserve is reducing interest rates, which sets the stage for future growth. Still, for many regular Americans, psychologically, it is the past inflation that is salient, not the state of the current economy: They find themselves experiencing the ""peak-end rule.""

Economists are right about the negatives of both Trump's tariff proposal and Harris' price gouging proposal. The gut instincts of regular Americans' psychology on these two issues are simply off.

The net costs to Trump's tariff proposal are much larger than to Harris' price gouging proposal. Imports are continuous, and therefore high inefficient tariffs are continuous. Moreover, Trump's proposal applies to all imports! In contrast, price gouging in response to emergencies is intermittent, and confined to a few products.

Economists have more disagreement with Trump than with Harris. In the Wall Street Journal survey, economists and regular Americans disagree more about proposals put forward by Trump than about proposals put forward by Harris.

In going to the polls this year, regular Americans should carefully reflect on where their gut instincts might lead them, lest they get what they wish for."
Biden's old backyard now a key Pennsylvania battleground filled with 'purple' votes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-old-backyard-now-key-pa-battleground-filled-purple-votes,2024-09-30T20:05:23Z,"SCRANTON, Pa. -- While northeastern Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County has been a Democratic stronghold in state and federal elections, voters on the streets of the old coal mining region say the area runs ""purple"" and will likely be a nail-bitter of an election.

""It's not as blue as people think. It's more purple underneath because people are afraid to say anything around here because they think that there's going to be retaliation. That's an old thing that goes back generations around here,"" David Kveragas told Fox News Digital from a pizza shop on the main drag of Scranton as a storm sloshed rain across the Wyoming Valley last week.

Lackawanna County is home to cities and towns such as Scranton, Carbondale and Throop, mixing cityscapes backdropped by factories of a bygone era, and dotted with suburbs and expansive farms. The county has long voted blue in state and national elections, last throwing its support behind a Republican in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan's blowout election when he won each state except Washington, D.C., and Minnesota -- the home state of Reagan's competitor that year, Walter Mondale.

The county has trended right in recent elections, however, teeing up a heightened election battle that will likely help determine how the key battleground state will swing come Nov. 5.

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AS SCRANTON LOOKS BACK ON NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Between 2000 and 2012, Democratic presidential nominees earned between 56% and 63% of the vote, U.S. News and World Report found. That standard fell below 50% in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unsuccessfully ran against former President Donald Trump, but still carried a win for the Democratic Party's ticket even with the lessened support.

President Biden was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware. Biden's hometown status likely helped boost his popularity among locals in the 2020 election, winning 53.58% of the vote to Trump's 45.23% that year.

As the election cycle comes down to its final five weeks, Fox News Digital spoke to voters on the streets of Scranton to ask about their top election concerns and who they will cast their ballot for come November. Fox News Digital received a mixed bag of responses, with some voters proudly declaring Vice President Kamala Harris' support of abortion access earned their vote, while Trump supporters said voters only need to look at their pay stubs from the 2016-2020 era compared to today to determine their ballot choice.

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice? I'm not here to knock Trump or any candidate. But as a woman of Puerto Rican descent, I feel it's really important for us to really sit and discuss the pros and cons of each candidate. But especially as a woman,"" a local mom named Adrianna, who is supporting Harris in the election, told Fox News Digital.

BIDEN CLAIMS TO SEE THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE EYES OF SCRANTON, NOT WALL STREET

Adrianna is a mom to a young boy and said that inflation issues and childcare issues have rocked her day-to-day life as she has tried to find a daycare for her son for more than a year. When asked if she believes Harris will correct inflation if elected as president after serving as vice president for three and a half years, she responded, ""I hope so.""

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice?"" - Pennsylvania mom Adrianna

Adrianna said that while inflation concerns her, abortion is her top voting issue.

""I believe nobody should tell a woman what to do with her body, especially -- not to sound sexist -- but a man. I think that should be an individual decision that a woman should make,"" she said.

PENNSYLVANIA LEADERS IN BOTH PARTIES TALK GROUND GAME AS GOP SEEKS TO UNDO DEM GAINS: 'MASSIVE SHIFT'

For Trump supporters, the economy, inflation, national security and immigration came in as top concerns for voters.

""The price of gas is a big issue with me. I do a lot of driving. And I remember back in the day, you know, when you got $20, it'd fill up your gas tank. It's just going up and up,"" Trump supporter John Soentgerath told Fox News Digital.

""With all due respect to my Democratic friends, I have a lot of them, [under] this previous administration there has been less take-home pay. The prices of gas [is] up, food. And I like to eat like anybody else. You tell me any mother or father that doesn't want to put food on the table for their kids, give them treats, ice cream, goodies and things of that nature,"" Soentgerath added.

Larry West of Scranton told Fox News Digital from a bus stop near The Marketplace at Steamtown that Trump earned his vote for his national security platform as wars continue raging in Ukraine and Israel, saying Harris appears ""weak"" on foreign affairs.

""I'm voting for Donald Trump. And I just believe that as far as globally, I don't feel that Kamala Harris has what it takes to represent the United States globally. Like especially with all that's going on with Russia and China,"" West said.

I don't feel that Kamala Harris has what it takes to represent the United States globally. - Scranton voter Larry West

Kveragas told Fox News Digital that he is an independent who ""voted against Hillary"" in 2016, before becoming a Trump supporter while evaluating the 45th president's record in office.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA SAY WORKING CLASS WILL SUPPORT HER

""He straightened out the economy. He got the border under control. He cut regulations. He did pretty much everything you would want a -- a realistic person would want -- a president to do. So with this election, it's primarily the economy, obviously. My retirement was up 40% under Trump. I lost the 40%, plus another 20% under Biden. So things are terrible there. The border, which we're being overrun. Obviously, it's not just a matter of jobs. It's a matter of housing and crime fighting, fentanyl, which has run rampant. Fentanyl is killing more people than guns,"" Kveragas said.

On the flip side, a Harris supporter who identified himself as Michael told Fox Digital that ""women's rights"" is his top priority this election cycle.

""I believe that every woman should have a choice to make their own decision,"" he said.

Michael explained that the economy and inflation have also affected his life, saying that he works two jobs to pay the bills and that expenses were much cheaper a decade ago. When asked if he feels Harris is better equipped to handle the economy over Trump, Michael argued that while Trump is a ""businessman,"" he will ""ruin the country.""

""Donald Trump, he is a businessman, yes. But he's going to ruin the country. He's going to ruin it. And Kamala Harris, you know, she is more steady-handed. She doesn't think with an iron fist, and we don't need that. We're not trying to go to war with China. [We're trying to] actually progress in this life. That's the only thing that we do in this life is to share information and progress,"" Michael said.

GOP GAINS VOTER ADVANTAGE IN PENNSYLVANIA SWING COUNTY NEAR BIDEN'S BIRTHPLACE

Trump's and Harris' campaigns have respectively heaped loads of attention on the Keystone State this year, with both candidates repeatedly visiting the massive state, from its rural areas in the rolling hills to industrial cities in the coal and rust belts that run across the state.

Fox News Digital spoke to both a Trump campaign volunteer and a Harris campaign volunteer, who both work to register Lackawanna voters, door knock and motivate residents to cast a ballot.

Susanne Green is a Trump campaign volunteer and former Democratic voter who began supporting Trump and Republicans in the last decade.

BIDEN'S HOMETOWN SPEAKS OUT ON BIDENOMICS

""I grew up in a Democrat household. Here in the valley in Lackawanna County, we believed in 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you could do for your country,'"" Green told Fox Digital, quoting President Kennedy's powerful inaugural address in 1961. ""And it really does choke me up some because it's truthful.""

Green said that her politics have not changed, but that the Democratic Party has morphed into something she can no longer identify with.

""I haven't changed. The Democrat Party changed. I was a Democrat. I registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and I voted Democrat in every election until 2016, when I really saw that that wasn't the direction that our country needed. Our country really needs to really get back to patriotism and believing that our country is great,"" she said.

ARMED SERVICES REPUBLICANS, WHITE HOUSE PUSH BACK AGAINST CLAIMS THAT ZELENSKYY'S PA VISIT WAS 'POLITICAL'

Green said that when she speaks to locals about the election to motivate them to vote, many Democratic voters will balk at the GOP's abortion platform. Green said she explains to such voters, most notably suburban women, that Republicans for Choice has long been a powerful vote in the party and that the GOP is not working to place a wholesale ban on abortion.

""I think we can all agree, or most of us can agree, that it should be legal and rare,"" Green said in a hat tip to the famous Bill Clinton formulation that abortions be ""safe, legal and rare,"" a sentiment that has since been purged from the party's platform in favor of more lax abortion access.

""That's how most women that I talk to in my experience over my whole lifetime have said that we wanted abortion to stay legal, but rare.""

Andrew Cutillo, a Harris campaign volunteer in Lackawanna County, spoke to Fox News Digital via a phone call this week and said that he has supported Harris since her campaign launch this summer and touted the VP as someone who can ""intuitively"" connect with Northeastern Pennsylvania voters based on her middle class upbringing.

""Kamala Harris is someone who, you know, intuitively understands what it's like to grow up or live in Northeast Pennsylvania and Scranton, Pennsylvania, as she grew up middle class. Her kind of focus has been on building a strong middle class,"" Cutillo said. ""Her focus is on supporting families and understanding what families and communities need, that they can live their lives, that they can not worry about paying grocery bills, not worry about paying all the expenses that come with just trying to raise your family.""

Cutillo added that when he's out door-knocking or speaking with traditionally Republican voters, including his own dad, people have pulled away from Trump because they are ""concerned for democracy,"" and view Harris as a potential president who would ""govern for the people who don't agree with her, too.""

He said despite the fevered political focus on Scranton and Pennsylvania at large this election cycle, Republican and Democratic neighbors in Northeastern Pennsylvania have and will remain friends no matter how the election shakes out despite any portrayal of ""divisiveness"" in the battleground state.

Voters in the area remarked that they have been inundated with campaign efforts, with West saying he's ignored some of the door knockers.

""I'm flooded with ads, flooded. They have knocked on the door. But I didn't answer the door because I saw what it was. But we are definitely bombarded with ads,"" West said.

Soentgerath said that he's seen ""a big push from both sides. And again, with all due respect to either side, the bottom line is, if you want change, get up, go to work and pull that lever on Nov. 5.""

While Michael remarked that while he hasn't seen ""too much out here yet,"" he noted he has seen more Trump ads than Harris ads.

""So that just means we need to work harder,"" Michael said.

Tony Monopoli is a Scranton native who has since moved to another key battleground state, Georgia, and told Fox News Digital that he is supporting Harris in the election. Monopoli was visiting Scranton with his brothers and spoke to Fox News Digital outside of the Lackawanna County Courthouse, where there is a veterans memorial.

""I think her plans to support small businesses by offering a $50,000 tax credit for small business owners is a big deal. I think her plan to offer $25,000 in first-time homebuyers' assistance is a big deal, given the cost of homes today. And also, the $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a child's life is a big deal,"" he explained of his support of Harris.

Fox Digital asked Monopoli if he's seen more or less campaigning efforts from either candidate in Pennsylvania vs. Georgia, where both candidates are also heavily campaigning for votes.

TIKTOK CREATOR ROASTS OPRAH, HARRIS FOR FEATURING HER IN TOWN HALL INTERVIEW: 'I DO NOT SUPPORT HARRIS'

""I'd say it's about the same,"" he said. Remarking that he hasn't ""really seen any different"" in either area.

Pennsylvania will again serve as a key battleground state this election cycle as former President Donald Trump and President Biden are anticipated to face a rematch in a state that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016, and elected Biden in 2020 at a 1.17% margin.

For Soentgerath, he encouraged voters to do their own homework before casting their ballots, leaning on his concerns over the economy, he said voters should simply review their pay stubs from just a few years ago to help determine their vote.

The Fiscal Impact Of Mass Immigration On U.S. And European Taxpayers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/the-fiscal-impact-of-mass-immigration-on-us-and-european-taxpayers/,2024-09-30T19:56:58Z,"A year ago, I shared with you my thoughts on the immigration crisis, both here in the U.S. and Europe. At the time, there was speculation that international bad actors may be at least partially to blame for the record numbers of immigrants pouring across the U.S. Southern Border and arriving by boat in Southern Europe. Below is an update to the story.

Immigration is once again making headlines (has it ever stopped?), and it's not just the sheer numbers that have people talking. Concerns about mass immigration -- both legal and illegal -- have dominated political and economic conversations in the U.S. and Europe.

Although the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. has eased significantly in the past 12 months, the underlying challenges remain. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. stands at 14 million, a huge increase from just a few years ago. The share of foreign-born residents is now over 14% of the total population, its highest level since the early 1900s, when waves of immigrants came from Italy, Poland and elsewhere.

Today, the new arrivals are straining resources in ways that directly impact the American taxpayer and investor alike.

Let's take Springfield, Ohio, as a microcosm of what's happening across the country. You've probably heard that this town of 58,000 has recently seen a large influx of Haitian asylum seekers, leading to skyrocketing housing costs and a sharp rise in the cost of living. The median rental price in Springfield jumped 43% in just one year, according to Zillow. Locals are feeling the pinch at the pump and the grocery store as inflation ripples through their economy.

It's not just prices that are going up. Health care providers are stretched thin, as more translation services and additional staff are needed to accommodate the growing population. In September, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced $2.5 million in state support for Springfield, but the burden on local taxpayers is undeniable.

We're seeing similar stories play out across the U.S. as towns and cities grapple with the surge of new arrivals. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams, recently indicted on federal corruption charges, reported last summer that the city expected to spend $12 billion over the next three years on housing, food and health care for recently arrived immigrants. To cover these costs, the city plans to cut services across the board -- sanitation, public education, even the police force. The fiscal strain is real, and it's hitting Americans where it hurts most.

What's happening in the U.S. is mirrored on a much larger scale across Europe. Over the past decade, 29 million immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- have poured into the region, overwhelming an already dysfunctional immigration system. Concerns about public safety and inadequate integration policies have led to widespread public unrest. Just look at the riots in the U.K., where immigration has emerged as a defining issue.

Investors should be paying close attention. Western Europe, traditionally known for its social safety nets and generous welfare systems, is struggling to accommodate this massive population influx. Europe's current situation is a reminder that unchecked migration, without the proper systems in place, can lead to long-term fiscal challenges.

Having said all that, it's important to recognize the value of legal immigration. With fertility rates having fallen well below the replacement level -- or 2.1 children per woman -- the U.S. and Europe face the prospect of near-zero population growth. Legal immigrants, then, play an essential role in maintaining productivity and supporting programs like Social Security.

The hard truth is that the U.S. and Europe face declining populations and a shrinking tax base. I believe the solution lies in smart, sustainable immigration policies -- ones that emphasize legal pathways and prioritize integration."
3 Lessons For Investors From Vanguard Founder John Bogle,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesmoss/2024/09/30/3-lessons-for-investors-from-vanguard-founder-john-bogle/,2024-09-30T17:57:47Z,"When Vanguard Group founder John Bogle created index investing, it helped provide investors with a streamlined and low-cost way to buy broader market-tracking mutual funds. His contributions made such a lasting impact that there is an official Boglehead® community that holds conferences, writes books, and runs an informational forum with "". . . more than 120,000 registered members who have made more than six million posts.""

Warren Buffett once said, ""If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle."" Though he died in 2019, his lessons continue to light the path toward a financially secure and happy retirement. Reviewing them is a healthy exercise for all those trying to make their hard-earned savings outpace inflation over time.

""Ask yourself: Am I an investor, or am I a speculator? An investor is a person who owns business and holds it forever and enjoys the returns that U.S. businesses, and to some extent global businesses, have earned since the beginning of time. Speculation is betting on price. Speculation has no place in the portfolio or the kit of the typical investor.""

This sentiment aligns with the idea that time in the market generally beats timing the market. It doesn't feel good to see the market drop, and it's a natural human urge to want to withdraw funds until the coast is clear. But, in this case, leaning on the perspective of history is typically more valuable than survival instincts. Timing the market would require a crystal ball, and those don't exist. Market recoveries average a 30% rise in the first 30 days of that movement. Sure, the entire process is more gradual, but the first fraction of that recovery time, on average, makes the difference. Missing out on those gains can enormously damage your overall portfolio.

Reviewing S&P 500 data from 1995 through 2023 provides 29 years of evidence. Folks fully invested saw a compound annual growth rate of 8.4%, meaning the money typically doubled about every nine years. Missing the best five days out of those 29 years had a devastating impact: the return dropped to 6.6 percent, a 21% lower annual return. It worsens from there -- missing the best 30 market days dropped the return to 2.0%.

Take John Bogle's warning to heart. The risk of missing out on the market's best days is too high to attempt that nearly impossible tightrope act.

""The greatest Enemies of the Equity investor are Expenses and Emotions.""

Good habits are one of the most effective ways to overcome life's challenging moments. As they plan for retirement, investors are beset by a long list of concerns, not least of which is an unpredictable equity market. And no matter how poorly a portfolio performs, life's expenses seem to rise. It takes courage to stay invested, and one helpful technique to cap equity exposure at a more tolerable level is to diversify with some percentage of safety-type assets, such as fixed income and cash. Specifically, racking up three years' worth of dry powder can be highly constructive.

In finance, dry powder refers to the cash reserves a company or individual maintains to meet obligations during economic stress. It equates to the various ways to fill your Cash (savings, money market, certificates of deposit) and Income (treasuries, municipal and investment-grade bonds) buckets.

Follow these two steps to figure out how much you might need.

Take your annual expenses (food, home, auto, medical, charitable giving, travel, core pursuits, taxes) and subtract your guaranteed or recurring income (Social Security, pensions, annuities, rental properties, deferred compensation, etc.). If you need $100,000 per year, and your guaranteed income from Social Security and pensions is $50,000, your portfolio requires you to cover $50,000 annually. That is your income gap

Multiplying the income gap of $50,000 by three years shows a need for $150,000 of dry powder in your portfolio.

Running the scenario in reverse helps illustrate. Say your portfolio has $1 million, with $400,000 designated to the dry powder category. Your income gap is $40,000. Dividing $400,000 by $40,000 reveals you have 10 years of dry powder ready to cover yourself during high-stress periods.

For many, dry powder is an important psychological tool for sleeping well at night. Or, as Bogle might put it, it can protect against expenses and emotions. Preparing for volatile times by fortifying a reliable structure helps to prevent your nest egg from cracking when the world shakes.

""The greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan. Stick to the good plan.""

Some future retirees worry so much about selecting the wrong plan that they never get around to picking one at all. Listen to John Bogle and accept that no plan is perfect. Adjustments can always be made later, so just get started.

There's a common adage that it's better to be lucky than good. Unfortunately, luck doesn't last as long as your retirement savings need to. So, stop searching for the ancient alchemy or secret potion. There are multiple paths to accumulating wealth, but none are shortcuts. While time, patience, and planning may not sound sexy, the financially secure, happy retirement they could create sure does.

You may prefer to draw your own blueprint. Here's a link to an interactive financial planner that pairs happy retirees' lifestyle habits with the financial benchmarks to potentially fund them. A financial advisor can also help you formulate your portfolio allocation and budget strategy based on future spending goals, inflation protection, risk tolerance, and probabilities of financial success. All it takes is some personal reflection and a little research to find the right fit.

John Bogle's idea helped limit Wall Street's control over making money from American workers' hard-earned productivity. Future retirees willing to practice the disciplined patience it takes to allow their money to outpace inflation over time increase their probability of accumulating wealth sufficient to fund their needs, wants, and desires throughout their golden years.

John Bogle reinvented the wheel, but his teachings are valuable reminders that you don't have to. Design a slow and steady retirement plan, and let that wheel's momentum carry you to a happy retirement."
What The Latest Fed Decision Means For Businesses And The Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/franksorrentino/2024/09/30/what-the-latest-fed-decision-means-for-businesses-and-the-economy/,2024-09-30T16:47:57Z,"The latest decision by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates marks a significant turning point for the U.S. economy. While many consumers have been eagerly anticipating lower rates, it's important to understand that a rate cut doesn't necessarily signal good news for the broader economy. In fact, it reflects a cooling of economic activity, a slowdown that businesses need to navigate carefully. While the cut itself was widely expected, its impact on businesses and consumers extends far beyond simple monetary policy.

The current economic environment remains a crucial period for understanding the implications of the Fed's actions and why it may be a great time to capitalize on new opportunities before further economic shifts occur.

Understanding the Real Impact of Rate Cuts on the Economy

Lower rates can ease borrowing costs, they also come with broader implications that the consumer should be prepared for. Many are quick to celebrate reduced interest rates, but it's essential to remember that this also means a reduction in returns on savings, affecting both individuals and businesses with large cash reserves.

What's more, the recent rate cut points to a broader economic transition, one where we are starting to see a downtick in economic activity. The latest jobs data will have been a key indicator for the Fed to make the decision to cut rates. The goal now is for them to continue following the data and making the necessary decisions to achieve the soft landing that is within reach.

Why Now is Still the Time for Opportunities

Despite the slowing, businesses are in a prime position to seize opportunities. Lower borrowing costs make capital more accessible, particularly for industries like real estate and construction. The window for securing favorable financing remains open, but waiting too long may result in missed chances as market conditions stabilize.

Businesses that act now will benefit from improved liquidity and the availability of capital. This is not the time to hold back -- if you're planning to expand, invest, or grow, now is the time to make those moves. We are still very much in a robust economy, productivity is strong with a 2.5% annual rate vs. prior estimates of 2.3%, inflation is easing, and technology continues to offer new paths for growth. The key is recognizing that opportunities exist even in slower growth environments.

The Role Community Banks Play

In uncertain times, community banks play a critical role in providing stability and access to capital. For small and mid-sized businesses, community banks remain committed to relationship-based lending, offering the support that larger institutions may pull back on when things get tough. At ConnectOne, we've seen firsthand how these relationships can be the lifeblood of a business during challenging times.

Recent mergers in the banking sector, such as ConnectOne's own merger with First of Long Island, point to a trend of consolidation that strengthens the foundation of community banks. This isn't just about survival, it's about creating a stronger, more resilient banking industry.

Just as in banking, businesses may find opportunities to partner in order to achieve scale, take on new business lines or expand their talent base. As M&A activity continues, the banking landscape will shift, offering more robust services and improved capital access for businesses. The rise in mergers signals confidence in the long-term health of the U.S. economy, even as the broader environment eases.

--

The Federal Reserve's rate cut is more than just a policy move -- it's a signal that businesses need to recalibrate and plan strategically for a slower but more stable economic environment. While the headlines may focus on the rate reduction, the real opportunity lies in how businesses respond. Those who understand the benefit of moving swiftly to secure financing or making smart investments will be better positioned to thrive. The road ahead may not offer the rapid growth of previous years, but with the right strategy and foresight, businesses can continue to capture significant opportunities and set the foundation for long-term success."
Maryland Court Ruling Threatens To Shut Down Gulf Of Mexico Production,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daneberhart/2024/09/30/maryland-court-ruling-threatens-to-shut-down-gulf-of-mexico-production/,2024-09-30T16:39:14Z,"A single unelected judge in Maryland has managed to jeopardize approximately 2 million barrels of crude oil production per day from the Gulf of Mexico -- representing 15% of U.S. production and a critical element of global supply.

The ruling, sparked by a lawsuit led by environmental activist groups, has cast a cloud over one of the most critical pillars of America's energy security. The court's decision, which effectively nullifies a broad-based 2020 environmental study, could freeze both current operations and future investments. If Congress does not act swiftly to restore regulatory stability, the consequences for U.S. energy independence, national security, and consumer affordability could be serious.

In August, the court ruled that the National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) 2020 ""biological opinion,"" which served as the legal foundation for oil and gas producers' leasing permits in the Gulf, failed to adequately assess potential impacts on endangered species.

The ruling was a victory for environmental groups like the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity, which argued that the original assessment violated the Endangered Species Act by underestimating the environmental effects of oil spills on local wildlife, such as sea turtles and the Rice's whale.

The court ordered the NMFS to conduct a new environmental analysis by December 20. However, the agency has already indicated that the process could stretch into early 2025. In the meantime, the ruling has created a regulatory limbo that threatens to grind U.S. offshore oil production to a halt. If the deadline passes without a new assessment in place, the existing legal framework for thousands of active licenses in the Gulf could collapse. Without the foundation provided by the 2020 biological opinion, oil producers would be forced to consult individually with federal regulators for every new project, resulting in a bureaucratic bottleneck that could delay or cancel operations entirely.

Samuel Rauch, the NMFS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Regulatory Programs, has said the ruling would ""likely disrupt the efficiency and predictability of ESA regulatory processes, and also likely undermine the conservation measures.""

The implications of this ruling go far beyond the courtroom and the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. has worked tirelessly over the past decade to achieve a degree of energy independence, which has translated into significant geopolitical leverage. American oil production has shielded the nation from the volatile swings of global energy markets and reduced reliance on imports from countries like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Russia.

The Gulf of Mexico plays an essential role in maintaining this energy security. Oil extracted from the Gulf accounts for roughly 15% of U.S. crude production, and the region has been a bedrock of domestic energy supply for decades. Shutting down or even delaying production would not only disrupt the supply chain for refiners but would also disincentivize further investment in the U.S. energy sector. In an already uncertain global energy market, this could have devastating effects on energy prices.

As oil prices rise, so too will the cost of gasoline, heating oil, and a wide range of goods that depend on petroleum-based products. American consumers, already facing historically high inflation and economic uncertainty, will be hit hardest. Meanwhile, the reduction in U.S. oil production will benefit countries that don't have America's best interests at heart. Nations like Russia and Iran, which rely on oil revenues to fund destabilizing activities around the world, stand to gain from any disruptions to U.S. energy output.

Ironically, halting U.S. offshore production could also lead to an increase in global greenhouse gas emissions -- the very problem that environmental groups claim to be addressing. A report dating back to the Obama administration concluded that oil produced from the Gulf of Mexico has a lower carbon footprint than many foreign alternatives. If U.S. producers are forced to scale back operations, global demand for oil will not disappear. Instead, it will be filled by higher-emitting sources, such as oil from Russia or the Middle East, where environmental regulations are far less stringent. This would be a step backward in the global fight against climate change.

The geopolitical consequences of diminished U.S. oil production cannot be overstated. For years, the U.S. has used its status as a top oil producer to exert influence on global energy markets. Domestic energy production has allowed the U.S. to impose sanctions on adversaries like Russia and Iran, without worrying about supply shocks. Reducing U.S. oil output weakens this leverage and strengthens the hand of authoritarian regimes that use energy revenues to fund anti-American activities, including military aggression and cyberattacks.

Increased energy dependence also has direct national security implications. If U.S. production declines, the country will be forced to import more oil from foreign producers, some of which operate in regions plagued by instability and conflict. This reliance on foreign energy puts the U.S. at the mercy of global events beyond its control, leaving it vulnerable to supply disruptions or price manipulation.

This situation exposes a glaring vulnerability in the American legal system -- one that allows a single district judge to upend national energy policy. Environmental lawsuits like this one are a key part of a larger strategy by activist groups to use the court system to achieve policy goals that they have been unable to advance through legislation. While protecting endangered species is undeniably important, the current case demonstrates the urgent need for judicial and regulatory reform.

Congress must step in to stabilize the regulatory environment. The NMFS's 2020 biological opinion was a sound administrative ruling, and insulating it from legal vulnerabilities should be a priority. Lawmakers should also consider broader permitting reform to streamline the approval process for energy projects, ensuring that legitimate environmental concerns are addressed without jeopardizing national energy security. Judicial reform, as part of a larger permitting package, could help prevent future cases where a single court decision places the entire nation's energy supply at risk.

Some members of Congress have already floated the idea of judicial reforms that would limit the ability of lower courts to issue sweeping rulings that have far-reaching national consequences. Such reforms should be seriously considered, as they could help ensure that important administrative decisions -- like the NMFS's 2020 assessment -- are not easily overturned by a single court. A balanced approach would safeguard environmental protections while also ensuring that essential energy projects are not unduly delayed.

The United States cannot afford to let its energy policy be dictated by individual court rulings. As the world faces increasing geopolitical uncertainty, domestic energy production is more important than ever. A stable and reliable supply of energy is not just a matter of economic prosperity but of national security. Congress must act swiftly to restore regulatory certainty and protect the U.S. energy industry from activist-driven legal challenges.

At stake is not only the future of Gulf oil production but the stability of energy markets, the well-being of American consumers, and the nation's geopolitical standing. Failing to address this regulatory vacuum will have far-reaching consequences for the country and the world. Congress has an opportunity -- and a responsibility -- to ensure that U.S. energy policy remains robust, predictable, and secure in the face of future challenges."
"Crypto VC Funding Picks Up As Investors Target Infrastructure, DePINs, And Decentralized AI",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/30/crypto-vc-funding-picks-up-as-investors-target-infrastructure-depins-and-decentralized-ai/,2024-09-30T16:39:02Z,"Despite lingering market uncertainty, 2024 has seen a significant uptick in crypto venture capital, with over $2.2 billion raised across 24 funds.

After a sluggish 2023, crypto venture capital is slowly bouncing back. As of July 2024, over $2.2 billion has been raised across 24 funds, according to data from PitchBook, putting the market on track to surpass last year's $2.6 billion total.

""We've seen an upward trend quarter over quarter for the last three,"" says Robert Le, a senior analyst at PitchBook. ""I still think we're somewhat in a capital-constrained environment. Typically, venture investments in crypto follow the performance of publicly traded tokens. In March of this year, the market recovered to 93% of its previous cycle's peak in total market cap. However, we're still far from seeing the same level of venture capital investment as before, particularly the $30 billion raised in the last cycle. Many investors felt burned by the failures and losses in that period, so they're much more cautious about deploying capital now.""

Macroeconomic challenges such as inflation and rising interest rates have curbed investments in riskier assets like crypto. But, according to Banafsheh Fathieh, co-founder and general partner at Lightspeed Faction (Faction collaborates with Lightspeed Venture Partners Faction, but operates its $285 million fund independently), the crypto industry has undergone a necessary correction. With the excesses of the last bull run behind them, investors are returning, albeit cautiously. Fathieh highlights that early-stage investments -- now accounting for roughly 80% of activity -- are seeing renewed interest. The exuberance of 2021, she adds, created market distortions, but the current environment reflects a healthier and more deliberate approach to growth and innovation.

Key Narratives

As the market recalibrates, investors are eyeing specific sectors poised for growth. Infrastructure, particularly within the Solana ecosystem, is seeing renewed interest. ""Solana is taking market share from Ethereum and others,"" says Matthew Graham, founder and managing partner at Ryze Labs (formerly Sino Global Capital). ""We're going to see more consumer-facing apps with real product-market fit emerge, and Solana's technology is well-positioned to support that shift.""

Graham emphasizes the potential in consumer applications that fuse gaming with practical utility, citing examples like fitness apps such as STEPN. However, he warns that investors be mindful of the source of revenues. Whether returns are generated through tokens, equity, or hybrid models, understanding the nuances of these financial structures is critical for long-term success.

Venture capitalists are also excited about DePINs (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) that coordinate machines and devices like Helium, a blockchain-based wireless network; Hivemapper, a decentralized mapping network that aggregates road-level imagery and data; and GEODNET, a blockchain-based project focused on improving location data accuracy. ""All of those guys have started to show some ability to go to market on demand. We need to see that continue to grow,"" says Rob Hadick, general partner at Dragonfly Capital.

The potential of decentralized AI is also drawing attention. While some speculate on decentralized networks replacing cloud giants like AWS or Azure, Fanizadeh is more cautious: ""To be candid, I don't think that will happen, but there are a few places where crypto is not an optional piece of technology but a critical piece.""

AI developers often cite access to computing power as their primary hurdle. Fanizadeh points to innovations like decentralized GPU marketplaces, which allow idle computing resources to be pooled for AI workloads (one example is Lightspeed Faction's portfolio company Hyperbolic Labs). Another area ""where crypto becomes quite interesting is where cryptography enables a verification layer where it can ensure things like data integrity, model integrity. That can create sort of a verification and authentication mechanism for everything that really feeds in into AI"" (Faction's verification-focused plays include Nexus and Space and Time).

Rethinking Late-Stage Investments

Late-stage investments, which saw inflated valuations during the last bull run, have been subject to greater scrutiny. ""There's been a recommitment to being more thoughtful about how much and at what price to put capital into,"" says Dragonfly's Hadick. ""While seed-stage valuations have remained somewhat elevated, later-stage unicorns have traded at steep discounts. For non-token equity businesses, we're seeing 60% discounts, maybe even lower, depending on the company. We've seen Chainalysis [blockchain intelligence firm], Fireblocks [custodian and blockchain infrastructure provider] trade at 70% discounts. For some, like OpenSea [an NFT marketplace, threatened to be sued by the SEC], there's something like a 90% discount.""

Despite these markdowns, Fanizadeh believes that quality companies will rebound as the economic environment shifts. ""Even if you have a contraction on the multiple side, if they are good businesses -- and many of them are -- they'll have some time to recover,"" she says. ""As the interest rate environment changes, you'll start to see the equity side return to more normalized multiples."" In the meantime, investors are focusing more heavily on seed-stage opportunities, where the potential for growth -- and risk -- is more palpable.

What's Next?

PitchBook's Le predicts an influx of first-time fund managers. ""Over the next year or two, we're going to see many of these new funds come to market, marking a new cycle of innovation,"" he says. The emphasis will be on sustainable, long-term growth rather than short-term hype.

The cyclical nature of the crypto market, as tracked by PitchBook, often mirrors bitcoin's halving events, which cut the rewards for mining bitcoin by half. Historically, peaks in crypto fundraising have aligned with these cycles, with notable surges in 2014, 2018, and 2022. Writes Le ""If these historical trends continue, we anticipate another fundraising peak in 2026, aligning with the next expected major cycle in the crypto market."""
How To Set Realistic AI Expectations And Goals For Your Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/09/30/how-to-set-realistic-ai-expectations-and-goals-for-your-business/,2024-09-30T16:38:51Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers.

Executives are vital to provide leadership to businesses, but they aren't the only ones. Boards hold an equally important role. Though most boards sit more on the advisory side, members' knowledge and opinions on company strategy, policy and who a company's management should be can dramatically shape its outlook and finances.

Executive search firm Spencer Stuart published its annual Board Index earlier this month and found that many boards are slowly making evolutionary changes to better reflect today's business realities. The operative word is ""slowly."" The study found there's more that needs to be done -- and fast -- to bring boards more in line with companies' needs. Fewer than a third of CEOs told the firm they feel their company has the board it needs to address the issues they're facing. And among boards, about a quarter say they have one or more members who should no longer be there because their skills and expertise are outdated. Yet many board members stick around for a long time. Only 58% of S&P 500 boards got a new member in 2024, and the turnover rate for board members is about 7% to 8%.

Spencer Stuart offered some advice for shaking up a stagnant board, other than the directive that board members need self-awareness to know when their service is no longer useful to the company. The entire culture behind board membership should be built around the board's mission as a dynamic group committed to the company and its shareholders. Third-party evaluations into boards -- and individual members -- could assess their effectiveness. And adopting formal policies to promote turnover -- including term limits, maximums or post-full-time-job-retirement requirements -- could also help push the awareness that the board should be constantly refreshed.

In terms of incoming board members, Spencer Stuart found modest gains in many expertise and diversity-related factors. Nearly three in 10 new board members have financial expertise -- up three points from last year -- and the largest proportion of new board members come from tech or telecommunications backgrounds. Just over a third of board members appointed last year were first-time members, and 14% of those were younger than 50 -- all of these statistics are up 3% from 2023. The one place that saw a sizable gain was the number of new female board members with financial backgrounds: 34% appointed this year came from finance, while just 25% in 2023 did. However, that large step forward came with a small step back: The number of new women board members was down -- representing 42% of new members this year, as opposed to 46% last year.

Even though generative AI has been talked about by the business community for almost two years, there are still many unrealistic expectations about what it can do for a company -- often among board members who don't have much technical knowledge. I talked to Krishna Sudheendra, CEO of digital transformation company UST, about what CEOs need to know about setting realistic expectations and goals for AI. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened earlier this month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Monday morning, 38.6% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

One of the reasons for this month's rate cuts was the weakening job market, as the unemployment rate rose to 4.2% in August. That sent consumer confidence numbers down this month -- from 105.6 in August to 98.7 in September, far below consensus economist forecasts of 104. Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement that consumers are concerned with fewer work hours, slower raises and fewer job openings, even though the labor market on the whole is healthy.

The Justice Department sued Visa last week, arguing that the financial services giant violates antitrust laws with its debit card business. Visa accounts for nearly 60% of U.S. debit card transactions, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said it has ""unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market."" While most consumers don't see these fees broken out when paying for items, businesses must pay them. Garland said Visa's conduct affects ""the price of nearly everything."" The National Retail Federation, which has long pushed for more controls on transaction fees charged by credit and debit card companies, supported the lawsuit but said in a statement this is ""just the tip of the iceberg.""

In a statement shared with several media outlets, Visa general counsel Julie Rottenberg said the lawsuit ignores that Visa is one of many competitors in the debit market. ""When businesses and consumers choose Visa, it is because of our secure and reliable network, world-class fraud protection, and the value we provide.""

WeightWatchers' bad year just got worse. On Friday, CEO Sima Sistani abruptly left the company, effective immediately. Forbes senior contributor Edward Segal writes this is yet another big hit for a company that has been trying to rebrand itself as people's relationship with weight, health and weight loss drugs are in significant flux. As more people have turned toward weight loss medications -- including Ozempic and Wegovy -- membership and confidence in the company has fallen. Longtime WeightWatchers advocate, client and board member Oprah Winfrey even left the company, selling her stock and exiting its board in February. In March 2023, under Sistani's leadership, WeightWatchers bought Sequence, a digital health platform that could prescribe weight loss medications, for $132 million. But the company has accelerated in the wrong direction, with its stock down more than 90% in 2024 alone, currently trading at less than $1 per share. The interim CEO is board member Tara Comonte, former CEO of TMRW Life Sciences.

Nearly two years after ChatGPT ignited massive interest in generative AI, many companies have been working to bring AI-powered solutions to their companies. But the hype around AI is still huge, and CEOs need to understand realistic expectations for the technology. I talked to Krishna Sudheendra, CEO of digital transformation company UST, about how companies can be realistic about the benefits and return on investment they can get from AI. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Are expectations for what AI can do right now in the short term out of hand? Or do you feel like everybody kind of has the right expectations and ideas?

Sudheendra: Right now, especially if you look at the boards and the investors, they feel AI is this magic wand. AI has been around. Generative AI and content generation [is] new, and the power, because of the new semiconductor chips and all the technologies coming together, has been enhanced. But right now, many people think that it is this magic wand that is going to bring my cost down dramatically. Companies are announcing, 'We are going to take out $3 billion in cost because of AI,' or 'We are going to enhance our market value by $XXX+ because of AI.'

Where you can really see it in action is in your productivity tools. How can you re-look at your ways of work, whether it's your software development cycle, core generation, internal productivity or call center operations. You can bring in generative AI technologies to really make things productive. We have seen in order of magnitude 20% to 40% reduction in cost and improvement in efficiency. Those are the real use cases that are getting into production.

But there are a lot of pie-in-the sky use cases which are not really getting out there. Yes, there are POCs [proofs of concept], but nobody is really ready to get things into production.

There are regulations that need to come into play. There has to be a complete governance layer in terms of ethics. All of those are yet to be formed and, without that, we cannot really have a mass adoption of AI, especially helping businesses to grow or significantly enhance their customer experiences.

How can the people inside of the business who grasp the concept of AI temper expectations for the boards, the investors and people who just see ""the magic wand?""

It's all about starting small, setting realistic expectations and showing the results. I have seen CIOs, CTOs and some of the smart technologists saying, 'Let's look at how we can really improve our software engineering using AI.' Or our call center performance, our supply chain operations or their operational performance, using document, vision, analytics and so on -- bringing all of these technologies together. They have been able to show some early results.

They have to set realistic expectations with their board, saying there is still a lot of work that needs to be done bringing all the data together, putting things onto the cloud. A lot of the digital transformation is incomplete today. Otherwise, AI is bound to hallucinate and give you wrong results.

A realistic expectation needs to be set: As we start, where can it be applied, and when would we get results? And then clearly show a larger, longer roadmap to the board and investors saying, 'Here's my AI roadmap. This is what I'm achieving today, realistically. This is the art of possible. We need to get our digital transformation in place. We need to get our resources in place. We need to get the investments in place, and here is a way to get there.'

How do you build your roadmap from what can be done today to what can be done in the future?

Every company needs to have an AI strategy. The thought leaders, the technologists, the architects, the business leaders within the company need to come together. Today, the awareness of what AI can do is very limited. I think there needs to be an AI education for the board [and] the senior leadership team. They have seen their children in high school, trying cool things on ChatGPT. That can solve smaller problems, but to apply AI in an enterprise and really look at business strategy.

Such an education should lead the businesses to have AI strategy. When UST did a survey, it was very evident that there is [a] lack of talent in the market. External experts need to come in to define what an AI strategy will look like. Then every company can build its own, which will also include a significant portion of digitizing their current environment. Companies have not even completed their digitization roadmap, and [it] will become an integral part of the AI roadmap.

Most importantly, the regulation needs to catch up. Whether it's healthcare, retail, [or something else,] industry leaders need to help formulate some of the regulations. Regulation and governance need to go hand-in-hand while defining the AI strategy for the future.

'Whoever gets elected': Vulnerable Dem Tester digs in heels on not endorsing Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whoever-gets-elected-vulnerable-dem-tester-digs-heels-not-endorsing-harris,2024-09-30T16:02:54Z,"Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance of the race and what issues matter most to voters as he fights to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., is continuing to defend his decision not to endorse in the 2024 presidential race ahead of his tough re-election, but the Democrat's opponent suggests his ""record"" signals support for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Tester recently revealed that he would not be making an endorsement in the presidential race in order to focus on his re-election, despite being a key player in Harris' recruitment to the Senate.

Tester served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) from 2015 to 2017, leading the efforts of the campaign arm to elect Democrats to the chamber when Harris first announced her senatorial aspirations. And after Harris launched her California Senate bid, the Los Angeles Times reported in January 2015 that, according to an adviser, Tester was one of the players who encouraged her to run.

Asked again about withholding an endorsement, Tester's response was that he would work with or hold accountable whichever presidential candidate gets elected.

KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONE

""Unfortunately, my opponent would rather talk about a national race that will be decided by the people of Montana. Whoever gets elected to the U.S. president, I can guarantee you one thing, just like all previous ones, I'll work with them when they're doing good things for Montana, and I'll hold them accountable when they're not,"" Tester told MTN News in an interview.

NEW YORKER SPENDS LARGE PART OF KAMALA HARRIS ENDORSEMENT REBUKING BIDEN: HE 'STOOD IN THE WAY'

Tester endorsed Harris when she was selected as President Biden's 2020 running mate. ""My friend @KamalaHarris is a proven fighter and an excellent pick for Vice President. As VP, I'm confident she will continue to fight for working families across this country. Looking forward to supporting her and @JoeBiden in November,"" Tester wrote in an August 2020 post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Montana Republican nominee and Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who endorsed former President Trump in the presidential race, suggested that Tester's voting record is his endorsement for Harris.

""Jon Tester votes with Kamala Harris 95% of the time. His voting record is his endorsement of the failed Harris agenda, and every time Montanans needed him to stop the insanity in Washington, he was the deciding vote to further her progressive liberal agenda,"" a spokesperson for Sheehy for Montana told Fox News Digital.

""That same agenda has made costs for things like groceries and gas skyrocket, it's brought us record high inflation, and has given us a wide-open southern border that has brought crime and deadly drugs into our communities. Tester also voted to allow benefits for illegal immigrants paid for by the American taxpayer - a hallmark of the Harris agenda. We can't afford to re-elect Jon Tester because his voting record in Washington proves he's changed and is and will continue to support the radical America Last agenda.""

Tester is running for re-election in red state Montana, a race that could likely determine which party controls the chamber, and recent polling and political forecaster predictions suggest that Sheehy is currently leading the race just weeks before Election Day.

A recent AARP survey found that Sheehy is leading by six percentage points in a head-to-head matchup against Tester. His lead against Tester widened to eight points in a multi-candidate field that included the state's Green Party and Libertarian candidates.

Nantucket group appeals to Supreme Court to end offshore wind projects and protect endangered whales,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nantucket-group-appeals-supreme-court-end-offshore-wind-projects-protect-endangered-whales,2024-09-30T15:05:31Z,"FOX Business' Lydia Hu reports on President Biden's wind farm plan opposed by Maine's fisheries. New England Fishermen's Stewardship founder Jerry Leeman explains how the plan poses a risk to marine life and the industry, saying 'it'll cripple us.'

A group of Nantucket, Massachusetts, residents are appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court in their challenge to the industrialization of parts of the Atlantic Ocean, where they say offshore wind farms - developed with the blessing of the federal government - are putting an endangered whale species at risk.

The group, Nantucket Residents Against Turbines, argues in its petition to the high court that ""the federal government has lost sight of its statutory obligations to conserve endangered species that will be directly affected by the construction of thousands of wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean.""

They argue that the federal agencies that authorized the leasing of the water area to wind turbine companies excluded certain data in their analysis to the benefit of offshore wind development.

""Despite the agencies' explicit statutory duty to consider all 'best information available,' regarding the impacts its actions might have on an endangered or threatened species and those habitats, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), did not consider the cumulative impacts of other planned projects when they authorized and issued permits to construct the Vineyard Wind 1 Project.""

MAINE LOBSTERMEN CATCH BIG COURT VICTORY AGAINST BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S 'EGREGIOUS' REGULATIONS

The petition to the high court is the latest swell in a surge of opposition to offshore wind development that was fast-tracked at the behest of the Biden-Harris administration, which has incentivized a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore energy by 2030.

Pursuant to that goal, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which President Biden signed into law in 2022, gave millions in tax breaks to green energy production deals.

Vineyard Wind, a joint venture between foreign entities Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, is the nation's largest offshore wind energy project off the New England coast - 15 miles off Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The project was one of the first beneficiaries of the IRA.

Vineyard Wind boasted of a $1.2 billion ""first-of-its-kind tax equity package"" for commercial scale offshore wind with three U.S.-based banks, calling it ""the largest single asset tax equity financing and the first for a commercial scale offshore wind project.""

""The Vineyard Wind 1 Project is the first of the government's 'coordinated steps' to construct about 30 wind turbine projects along the Atlantic seaboard that, when built out, will have thousands of turbines covering millions of acres of federal submerged lands,"" the petition states.

""Vineyard Wind LLC has constructed, or partially constructed, 47 of the 62 approved wind turbines, with each turbine spaced one nautical mile apart. Once fully constructed, each turbine stands 853 feet above the water and is almost three times the size of the Statue of Liberty.""

The petition notes that 47 turbines so far have ""already begun to adversely impact the Nantucket community, the ocean environment, and marine species' habitat.""

""Although not considered in any environmental impact analyses, problems with the turbines have also already begun. In July 2024, a large portion of a 350-foot fiberglass and PVC blade broke off one of Vineyard Wind's turbines into the water, and pieces of the blade washed ashore and littered the beaches of Nantucket,"" it notes.

'RUINED BY NEGLIGENCE': DAVE PORTNOY BLASTS NANTUCKET WIND FARM AFTER BROKEN BLADE SHUTS DOWN BEACHES

The petition argues that around the time of the Vineyard Wind 1 Biological Opinion, BOEM had issued over 25 offshore wind leases (on which one or more projects will be built). However, in the Biological Opinion, NMFS openly stated that it did not consider the cumulative impacts of those projects.

The North Atlantic right whale, which has been on the brink of extinction for more than 100 years, will ""bear the brunt of the federal government's shortcutting of the environmental review process,"" the petition argues.

""Despite the obvious effects that constructing wind turbines all along the North Atlantic Right Whale's migratory route and now year-round habitat will have, the agencies evaluated only the impacts caused by the Project itself and ignored obvious impacts from all the other projects planned in the Atlantic Ocean,"" it states.

The petition argues that the Supreme Court should hear this case to decide a circuit split between the Ninth and First Circuit decisions on the matter, which conflict with one another.

""Petitioners ask this Court to grant review of the important issue presented in this petition to resolve the split among the circuits and provide guidance to lower courts that will soon be facing the identical issue on how to conserve endangered species while seeking to achieve renewable energy objectives,"" it states.

Between the fishing industry arguing that offshore wind production unduly prohibits their business, to unprecedented whale deaths and the Nantucket blade disaster, criticism has mounted in recent months.

However, despite public favor dwindling, government officials are still pushing for record areas of the Atlantic Ocean to be industrialized.

Earlier this month, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healy announced the single largest procurement of offshore wind in the state's history by pursuing purchase agreements with SouthCoast Wind, New England Wind and Vineyard Wind II.

Rebecca Tepper, the secretary of the state's office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, said the state said, ""offshore wind is our future, and it is vital that we build that future today.""

LOCAL FISHERMEN SLAM BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S NEWLY UNVEILED PLANS TO INDUSTRIALIZE GULF OF MAINE

""By going big now with projects, we are going to lead the nation in the global race for developers, vessels, materials and expertise,"" she said.

As to why wind energy production is undeterred by environmental warnings and concerns, Annie Hawkins, executive director of Responsible Offshore Development Alliance, says that offshore wind companies and government agencies are working hand-in-hand.

""For a long, long time now, we've had the tail wagging the dog in terms of the wind developers, energy companies and utilities, as well as investment banks and everyone else pushing forward offshore wind from a private sector perspective and from an economic interest investment. It's far outpaced the environmental look and thought around offshore wind,"" Hawkins said.

""It's no surprise to me that because this whole thing has been set up from the relationships to the staffing of the offshore wind companies. There's a real revolving door with federal and state agencies and offshore wind companies. The whole thing has been set up for a very, very fast takeover of the oceans. So they're just going to keep pushing no matter what happens,"" Hawkins said.

A recent report by the Cato Institute found that while the offshore wind industry earns some of the biggest tax breaks, its ""high costs, which require substantial -- and increasing -- taxpayer and ratepayer subsidies, will raise electricity rates and reduce electricity consumption.""

The report also warned of the economic deficits from the offshore wind.

""It is impossible for a system of green energy tax credits and other subsidies to increase economic growth,"" the report concluded. ""

""Forcing consumers and taxpayers to subsidize offshore wind jobs at a cost of several millions of dollars per job each year -- far more than the workers will be paid -- cannot increase overall economic growth and employment,"" it stated.

"The Startup That Wants To Automate Boring, Rote Work",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenamcgregor/2024/09/30/the-startup-that-wants-to-automate-boring-rote-work/,2024-09-30T14:15:51Z,"In this week's Future of Work newsletter, a look at the platform using AI to replace dull work responsibilities, an interview with PwC about customized benefits and more.

This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate.

f you've heard the constant drumbeat that AI is expected to ""free people from the boring parts of their jobs"" and wondered if it's really happening, you might want to listen to these guys.

Forbes' Rashi Shrivastava profiled conversational AI platform Moveworks, the $2.1 billion company making tens of millions in revenue by automating dull workplace tasks such as troubleshooting IT issues or submitting PTO requests. Moveworks is used by some 5 million employees at over 350 companies like Hearst, GitHub, Toyota and Salesforce, Shrivastava reports, while amassing more than $300 million in venture capital from high-profile backers like Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. CEO and cofounder Bhavin Shah says AI startups ""won't work unless you actually tackle all of these gritty, ugly, messy problems, because that's actually what makes the world work.""

Meanwhile, Forbes senior writer Richard Nieva profiled billionaire Duolingo founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, who, late last year, decided not to renew the contracts of about 10% of the company's contracted workforce who did translations and lesson writing. ""Our stance as a company is that if we can automate something, we will,"" von Ahn told Nieva of the dismissals. ""A full-time employee's job is very hard to automate. But we had some hourly contractors who were doing pretty rote stuff."" Nieva's story digs into von Ahn and Duolingo's efforts around AI and his optimistic view that AI can bring high-quality education to the masses.

Both stories are reminders that all these discussions about AI's impact on jobs, and on how people work, are not just related to the future of work -- they're happening now. These tools are changing how people deal with administrivia on the job. Some rote jobs are getting replaced -- yet there's optimism for how AI can help many others. How leaders deploy it will play a big part of how it makes an impact -- for good or for ill.

Consumer confidence fell in September by the largest amount since August 2021, according to a monthly survey released last week by the economic research firm Conference Board. The index, which checks Americans' temperatures on a host of economic issues, such as expected inflation and job prospects, hit its lowest level since June. The proportion of respondents expecting higher incomes and more jobs available decreased last month, while the percentage of individuals anticipating worse business conditions rose, Forbes' Derek Saul reported.

While Boeing continues negotiations with its striking union workers, another strike ""looks unavoidable,"" writes contributor Mark Faithfull. Today, a six-year master contract between the International Longshoremen's Association -- the largest union of maritime workers in North America -- and the United States Maritime Alliance is due to expire. The contract includes six of the 10 busiest U.S. ports, handling more than 13 million containers annually, and could impact U.S. retailers as they enter their busy holiday shopping season.

Amid increasingly quiet corporate support for diversity and inclusion, a cohort of civil rights organizations called on CEOs and board members of major companies to maintain their commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack. Signed by 19 organizations -- including the NAACP, the National Organization for Women, the League of United Latin American Citizens, Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation -- the open letter says that ""a small, well-funded, and extreme group of right-wing activists is attempting to pressure companies into abandoning their DEI programs.""

Employee well-being and the crush of child care costs were two major themes at the Forbes Future of Work Summit earlier this month, with several panels digging into what HR leaders can do to help battle burnout, improve meeting culture and provide child care benefits at a time when workers' stress and heavy workloads remain stubbornly high. Two particular highlights: Moms First founder Reshma Saujani telling the story of how she asked GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump about child care costs and his platform, and a trio of thought leaders (Atlassian's Annie Dean, Work Time Reduction's Joe O'Connor and author Brigid Schulte) sharing what more employers can do to make structural changes that prevent overwork and address the root causes of burnout.

The concept of personalized or customized benefits -- such as flexibility in retirement benefits (some might choose matching contributions toward student loan payments, while others might want a larger 401(k) match) -- has been gaining ground in recent years. The top request from workers for improving compensation, according to consulting firm Mercer's Global Talent Trends study, is to have more types of rewards and the chance to personalize the rewards they get.

That employee request was one reason professional services giant PwC recently shifted how it rewards employees when they reach certain milestones. Rather than handing out rewards when people are promoted, the firm has made the benefits tenure-based, giving out awards at the 3-, 6-, 10- and 15-year milestones (and every five years after that), as well as giving workers more choice about what kind of reward they receive. Options include a paid wellness-oriented vacation in Hawaii or a conservation-driven trip to South Africa to help with wildlife protection -- as well as cash rewards (PwC would not share the size of the cash rewards, but said they had to be at least equivalent to such paid retreats or international trips). Forbes spoke with Kimberly Jones, PwC's talent strategy and people experience leader, about the shift. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.

What problem are you looking to solve here? Is this addressing a retention issue?

I wouldn't describe it as a problem that we're trying to solve. It really was trying to position our firm for the future and respond to what we hear from our employees. It's an opportunity to show more appreciation and recognition for time of service at PwC. It's a very demanding environment, and so we're always trying to be very focused on how to promote well-being.

Are you taking anything away in offering this? Is the money going here instead of somewhere else?

I wouldn't describe it as taking something away, but replacing something that we had before. It's a way to be able to recognize more people -- not just people who've been promoted in any given year. We have repurposed that program. The program we have now is also more personalized because we are offering a choice of rewards.

I'm hearing about companies trying to help people feel like they're getting ahead in their careers at a time when there's less turnover and promotions are harder to come by. Is this aimed at addressing that issue?

Like I said before, it is not a particular problem we're trying to solve. We've been working on this for a couple of years now, so it predated [the current job market]. Overall, the strategy is meant to make our environment the best that it can be to hopefully positively impact retention, of course. But more than that, to help people to enjoy their day-to-day as much as possible in what's a really demanding environment.

Do you have other ways you're customizing your benefits?

We have a menu of different options, and people can choose from those options. What we hear from our people is all of that is great and nice, but honestly, what they value most is flexibility day-to-day. And so we focus quite a lot on trying to be able to find that balance and give them flexibility, whether it's through contract work weeks or reduced schedules or just working with your team to figure out ways to honor personal commitments.

Speaking of flexibility and how important that is to employees, I've read headlines about the U.K. PwC arm tracking workers' locations to look at return-to-office behavior. Is that used in the U.S.?

It is not. Two separate firms, the way that we're organized. Our U.S. policy has not changed. We have hybrid work. People can work with their teams to figure out where they want to be, whether it's in the office or the client site or working remote that day. We do encourage people to be in person, and we emphasize the benefits of being in person. But no, we're not tracking [location] or doing badge swipe [tracking].

A new survey of CEOs by KPMG found that despite a significant decline in confidence about the global economy over the past decade, top business leaders are still optimistic about growth, senior contributor Jack Kelly reports.

72%: The proportion of CEOs who are confident in the world economy's direction, down from 93% in 2015

92%: The percentage of CEOs who plan to increase their workforce in the next three years, the highest since 2020, according to the new outlook report

Dividends Don't (Usually) Lie,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2024/09/30/dividends-dont-usually-lie/,2024-09-30T13:17:29Z,"Geraldine Weiss, who died two years ago at age 96, was a successful investment newsletter writer at a time when few women were prominent in finance. She wrote a book called Dividends Don't Lie.

Weiss's investment strategy was to invest in stocks with a dividend yield above that stock's own historical average. It's a contrarian strategy, based partly on the premise that the company's stock may be temporarily depressed, pushing up the dividend yield.

Gurufocus.com, one of my favorite investment web sites, maintains a screen that looks for such stocks. Its title is ""Historical High Dividend Yields.""

To qualify, a stock must have gone 15 years or more without reducing its dividend. The yield must be at least 4%. And the company must have at least $2 in profits for each dollar in pays out in dividends, reducing the risk of a dividend cut.

From that screen, I've selected five stocks to recommend today.

One of the largest regional banks, U.S. Bancorp. (USB) is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It maintains branches in 26 states, mostly in the Midwest and West.

The stock hit a high of $63 about three years ago, and has subsided to about $45. The Federal Reserve's campaign in 2022-2023 to raise short-term interest rates (in an attempt to kill inflation) hurt many banks by raising what they must pay on deposits.

Now the Fed is headed the other way, and I think the banking industry will have an easier time in 2025 and 2026. US Bancorp yields 4.3% in dividends, which is about a point and a half above its normal level.

People think of car companies as manufacturers. But to some degree, they are simply assemblers, putting together an array of sub-assemblies made by parts manufacturers.

Magna International Inc. (MGA), based in Aurora, Ontario Canada, is one of the largest auto parts companies in the world. It makes chassis, roofs, seats, electronics and other parts. General Motors, Mercedes and BMW are among its customers.

The stock is down almost 28% this year even though revenue and earnings were up. The dividend yield is 4.4%, which is almost double the 10-year median.

Carrying a freakishly high dividend yield of 13.6%, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) is a troubled company and a potential turnaround story. The stock has descended from more than $96 a share a decade ago to barely above $9 a share now.

Back in 2014, Walgreens acquired Boots, a leading British chain. That big bite ended up giving the company indigestion. Debt has gradually grown, and now is 2.4 times the company's net worth.

The drugstore industry has problems, including stingier reimbursement from insurers on drug sales, competition from online retailers, Walmart and Target, and a rise in merchandise theft.

Those problems seem severe but not insurmountable. The stock, pummeled badly, now sells for less than five times earnings. The sky-high current dividend yield compares with a ten-year norm of about 3.3%.

UGI Corp. (UGI), based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It also operates in eight countries outside the U.S., including Austria, France Poland and Switzerland.

The company was founded in 1882 and took its current name in 1968. The initials came from its previous name, United Gas Improvement Corp.

One of UGI's units, AmeriGas Propane, is the largest propane marketer in the U.S.

UGI's current dividend yield, 6.0%, is more than double its typical yield over the past ten years.

Originally known as a barrel maker, Greif Inc. (GEF.B) now makes many kinds of industrial packaging, notably steel, fiber and plastic drums. Headquartered in Delaware, Ohio, Greif now operates in 36 countries.

After a few years of mediocre profitability, Greif has posted a strong return on equity (15% or better) in five of the past six years. The dividend yield is 4.5%, compared to a ten-year median of 3.3%.

I usually include in every column how the approach I'm writing about has done in past years. I can't do that today, as this is the first time I've written about the strategy of buying stocks with dividend yields above their own historical average.

I'll let you know in a year how the stocks discussed in today's column panned out.

Disclosure: A hedge fund I manage holds call options on Walgreens Boots Alliance. In 2007-2011, when I ran a mutual fund (Dorfman Value Fund, later named Thunderstorm Value Fund), U.S. Bancorp served as the custodian and fund administrator."
More China Stimulus And A Looming Port Strike,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/09/30/more-china-stimulus-and-a-looming-port-strike/,2024-09-30T12:32:09Z,"U.S. Chipmakers Fall On China's Potential Chip Sector Investments

As we head into the final day of both the month and quarter, stock index futures are trading down slightly in premarket. On Friday, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. However, the Russell 2000 gained 0.7% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher by 0.5%. For the quarter, the S&P is up over 5% through Friday and over 1.5% for the month. The Nasdaq Composite is up over 2% for the quarter and 2.2% for the month.

One of the more interesting stories that I'm watching is what is taking place in China. With the Chinese economy struggling, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has unleashed a plethora of tools aimed at stimulating the economy. Some of these I've already discussed, but they include a lowering of mortgage rates, funding for buying stocks by institutions and also assisting with share buyback programs. As a result, Chinese stocks have rallied sharply and are up another 8% Monday. It's the best performing day for China's market since 2008. While the stimulus measures are showing initial strength, as I mentioned on Friday, this is a major attempt at boosting markets and should it fail, I'm not sure what more China has to offer in terms of stimulus tools. Therefore, I'm very focused on whether or not stocks can hold their gains or if this is simply a short-term rally in a bear market.

On a side note, U.S. chipmakers are indicated lower in premarket trading. One of the potential concerns with respect to China's stimulus efforts is they may choose to begin heavily investing in their own chip sector. That could in turn lead to greater competition and cheaper alternatives as companies forge ahead with Artificial Intelligence (AI) related investments.

Back here at home, there are a number of significant newsworthy items. I'll start with the looming strike on the East Coast. The International Longshoremen's Association is set to go on strike tonight at midnight if a new contract isn't accepted. There are some 45,000 workers who could potentially strike, shutting down ports from Maine to Texas. According to The Wall Street Journal, the strike would impact imports of food, vehicles, heavy machinery, construction materials, chemicals, furniture, clothes and toys. The economic impact could cost the U.S. economy an estimated $3.8 - $4.5 billion per day. Companies that could be impacted by a strike include Walmart, Caterpillar, General Motors and others. This is definitely a situation worth monitoring, especially as we head into the holiday shopping season. Also, should the strike go on for an extended period of time, it could reintroduce inflationary pressures.

There are a couple of companies in the news this morning, starting with Stellantis. The automaker is warning on their forecast for gross profit margins. As a result, that stock is down 13% in premarket. I'll be curious how other automakers react to the Stellantis news, as well as the looming ports strike. AT&T is selling their 70% stake in DirectTV business to private equity firm TPG for $7.6 billion. At the same time, DirectTV announced this morning that they reached an agreement to purchase Dish, which is owned by EchoStar. The details are a bit complicated, but essentially result in DirectTV assuming $9.75 billion of Dish's debt. And lastly, shares of CVS are higher in premarket trading by 3%. The company is being pressured by activist shareholder Glenview Capital to make changes aimed at creating greater value.

In the broader economy, we are heading into what could be an interesting period. This is a heavy week for economic data with the theme being jobs. Tomorrow, we'll get the latest report on job openings and then Wednesday, a look at private, non-farm payroll hires. However, Friday will be the big day with the latest unemployment figures scheduled for release. I'll have more on that in my Wednesday piece.

For today, I'm watching the VIX which had a late day run on Friday. The VIX is up 2% in premarket and given the geopolitical issues as well as economic news coming, I can't say I'm too surprised. In addition, we're just under two weeks away from the beginning of earnings season and a month away from the election. Not to mention, October markets have a history of throwing child-like temper tantrums. Therefore, there are a lot of potential catalysts floating around and I think it's fair to suggest we could be in for some choppy trading. Like I suggested last Friday, it may be a good time to review your holdings and how your portfolio is positioned as we head into the final quarter for the year. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
"Fear, Greed And The Whisky Market",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marklittler/2024/09/30/fear-greed-and-the-whisky-market/,2024-09-30T11:03:05Z,"With whisky prices falling sharply from their 2022 highs, is this a sign of market decline, or a unique opportunity to capitalize on the current downturn?

It's fair to say that 2024 has not been a stellar year for whisky investors. Whether you are dealing with casks or collectible bottles, prices have weakened compared to the giddy highs of 2022.

The critical question for whisky investors is, do these changes signal the collapse of the secondary whisky market for good? Or are the shifts a sign that the whisky market is maturing. The ups and downs now more closely reflect the natural cycles of more traditional investments, and that means we can learn from them.

It is largely accepted that traditional investment cycles are driven by fear and greed. CNN even has its own carefully calculated and often cited Fear and Greed Index.

In the index a dial resembling a speedometer swings from ""Extreme Fear"" to ""Extreme Greed."" Where the needle rests depends on such things as market volatility, market momentum, the demand for safe havens such as US treasury bonds and the degree to which hedge fund managers are shorting shares.

The index is often cited as a ""contrarian tool"" whereby ""excessive fear"" is taken as a sign to buy -- as stocks may be undervalued -- while ""excessive greed"" in the market can signal a time to sell potentially overvalued stocks.

In the stocks and shares markets a wealth of data spanning decades can be used to map out the investment cycle. For the experienced contrarian investor, ""Extreme Fear"" isn't a reason to panic but to search for the significant opportunities to be had.

The secondary whisky market is much younger. It has been thrust into the spotlight relatively recently as an alternative asset class and many investors are not experienced in whisky or classic investments. In this case how can we be sure the current fluctuations aren't a modern equivalent of tulip mania and instead are just the first significant downturn in a market that will run and run?

I believe there are several compelling reasons to view whisky, whether in a bottle or a cask, as a robust long term investment. Whisky is a tangible asset. Whether it is a bottle that you hold in your hand or a cask stored in a warehouse it can be seen, touched and moved. Also, whilst we know that the quality of the liquid itself isn't necessarily what drives the value, it does serve a (enjoyable) purpose and has an inherent value.

Most collectable whisky bottles are a finite supply -- either limited editions or no longer produced. They are also continuously consumed and bottles are occasionally broken -- sometimes on the same night! Additionally, its growing reputation as a luxury item and status symbol further enhances its appeal.

Finally, it has an accepted and favorable tax treatment. Bottles are taxed under the more generous capital gains tax regime for chattels, while casks are widely considered a wasting asset and are currently entirely free from capital gains tax.

Recently, I was shown The Cycle of Market Emotions chart by Russell Investments that is well-known in traditional investment circles. I was struck by its relevance to my day-to-day work as a whisky broker and its application to recent changes seen in the secondary whisky market.

I would argue that since 2015 the secondary whisky market has been through two of these cycles. The first cycle began with optimism in 2015 and reached peak euphoria in 2018. The second cycle of optimism began in 2020 and reached its peak in 2022. While the drop following the second peak has been bigger, both reflect changes seen in the larger economic and political climate and mirror cycles of fear and greed.

In 2015 you could buy a bottle of Macallan Private Eye for $1,800. This was up from less than $1,200 in January 2013 and represented an increase of more than 2,000% since the bottle's release in 1996 (for £36). The emerging whisky market was a place of conservative optimism. People were making money slowly, carefully, consumers were nervous, but excitement was building.

Fast forward to 2018 and that same bottle of Private Eye was worth over $4,700 at auction. And it wasn't just that one bottle. The market wasn't slow, it didn't require patience; just throw money at a bottle and make $1,000 in 12 months. It was the get rich quick scheme of dreams, and I'd argue, at this point driven completely by extreme greed.

In 2018 Macallan opened its new distillery and visitor center. Macallan Genesis was released to mark the event. Available exclusively from the distillery, the release and opening made national news because the police had to be called to manage traffic for people trying to get to the shop to buy the bottle. Lucky/savvy buyers re-sold Genesis instantly for between $3,000 to $4,000 profit.

This was peak euphoria and peak greed. The moment was epitomized by the performance of the Macallan 1926, whose price jumped from five figures to the first million dollar sale in less than 12 months.

It wasn't just Macallan bottles seeing these jumps in value. Releases from the likes of Springbank saw similar crazes. In addition 2018 was the first year whisky was recorded for The Knight Frank Luxury Investment index and 40% per annum returns and 582% returns over ten years made headlines and captured hearts.

The slowdown following the 2018 peak lasted around 12 to 18 months. There were potential geopolitical and economic factors that may have caused knock-on effects in the whisky market. From the significant correction in the stock market in Q4 of 2018 to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019 that fueled concerns about the stability of this important whisky consuming region. Then as bottle prices softened investors that had jumped in to make quick money got scared and start to sell, this drives prices down further and we switch from greed to fear.

We see the markers of despondency and skepticism emerging though the end of 2019 and start of 2020. Then as the effects of the Covid pandemic hit, alternative assets started to rebound, Cryptocurrencies and NFTs exploded into mainstream media. Suddenly greed returns to the table as everyone becomes interested in alternative assets. In addition 2020's lockdown conditions across much of the world meant we had an optimistic and enthusiastic pool of buyers with spare capital and the even more unusual spare time. Hope, relief and greed dominated as prices began to rise once again.

Optimism gave way to excitement as prices continued to rise through 2021. Externally covid vaccines began to roll out globally and it was a period of unprecedented financial stimulus that was not just confined to alternative assets. Ultra low interest rates drove investors toward more lucrative places to store their savings and meant consumers had more spare cash. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs became almost mainstream thanks to heavy features in the media and the success stories shared across online communities.

The heady highs of this cycle were perhaps best summarized by the Folio 1. During the previous cycle, the price of the first release in the Macallan Archival series had reached around $3,000. At the time this was a 800% rise over the three years since its release. In March 2022 a bottle of Folio 1 sold for $23,000 (including hammer).

I'd argue that moment marked peak ""euphoria"" alongside maximum ""extreme greed"" in the most recent cycle. Prices across the market capped through 2022 and then began to fall through 2023.

What I saw at the time and is even more clear now was that these rises were largely for bottles that shouldn't have been that valuable at the time. There is no reason for the Folio 1 to have been worth so much more than many older and rarer bottles that were available. Instead the prices reflected that the new buyers flooding the market had been buying based on greed rather than knowledge.

Fear of losing money exacerbated the fall, but external economic factors also played a large part. The Russian invasion of Ukraine marked the start of a harsh shift in the financial situation for many of the people who had been inflating prices for bottles like the Folio 1. These modern bottles are where we have seen the biggest shift as the knock on impacts of cost-of-living crises and worldwide inflation has rolled through all markets.

Compare for example the price change for the Folio 1: $23,000 to $12,000. Versus the Springbank Local Barley 1966 Sherry cask, which reached $15,000 in August 2022 but actually peaked in March 2023 at $20,000 (for a bottle with no box), when the market was technically slowing. Of course, comparing two bottles does not show a trend. It does still emphasize the importance of making educated investments regardless of which market you are involved in.

If I had to choose where the whisky market sits currently on the graphs above, I would suggest somewhere around despondency toward skepticism and mild fear toward neutrality. Since May 2024 market prices have stabilized. We are no longer seeing the drop in the market that had been sustained since January 2023 -- prices are not rising, but they are not falling either. External economic factors are also showing signs of easing pressure; with inflation rates dropping and interest rates beginning to see cuts.

There is lingering economic uncertainty thanks to the continuing war in Ukraine and the growing disputes with Israel. However caution is a natural part of recovery as investors learn and grow with each cycle.

In terms of the whisky market it appears that we are at the floor in the market. For the brave and educated, contrarian investor, the combination of leveling prices alongside lingering fear can make this a prime time to buy.

Almost everyone has heard the old adage ""buy low, sell high"" and I think most people will agree it makes sense. So why don't we do it? Why aren't we excited that the changes in the whisky market means we can buy Macallan Private Eye for $4,000 when it was $11,300 two years ago, or Springbank 1919 50 year old for $12,000 when it was $32,500 12 months earlier?

The answer I feel lies in people's expectations. Alternative assets are exciting when they can get you rich quickly, but when the market is down, fear drives people to caution. People far more experienced than I am have made similar observations.

Jeff Bezos once asked Warren Buffett, why, when his ""buy low sell high"" philosophy is so simple, doesn't everyone just copy him? Warren replied: ""Because nobody wants to get rich slowly.""

Rising markets allow us to experience ""getting rich quick"" and it feels amazing. When the market eventually cycles the fall is almost always quicker than the rise. Gains made over two to three years can be wiped out in two to three months and it is painful for the investor. The shock can mean they lose their appetite for investing and sell up. Many whisky investors have recently experienced this.

However, market patterns suggest prices will eventually fall so much that they become almost irresistible. The first intrepid investors will begin to return, stimulating the market and prices begin to stabilize then rise. Excitement will then begin to rise and percolate outward. Greed begins to outweigh caution. Thus the cycle begins again.

From the data in the Mark Littler Index I would infer that we are nearing the tipping point. My advice for now would be to keep your eyes open for bargains whilst the market is depressed. They are certainly out there. And when optimism kicks back in and prices begin to rise you are already there to benefit. I would expect prices to rise quickly and you'll be able to take satisfaction in having invested well for the long term."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 30, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-30-24/,2024-09-30T10:59:40Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Shopping for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are infamous for paying puny interest rates. But this isn't always the case. Many online banks and credit unions likely pay rates 10x higher than your neighborhood bank.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay much higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the trade-off is you may have to meet strict conditions laid down by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's below last week's 0.26%.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Fed Rate Cut: Will Prices Ever Go Back To 'Normal'?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-rate-cut-impact-prices/,2024-09-30T09:45:00Z,"Inflation may have (nearly) returned to normal. But prices don't feel normal.

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September as inflation has moved closer to its 2% target. This was the first rate cut since the onset of the pandemic and might be a turning point in the Fed's years-long battle to get prices under control.

Despite the Fed's move, though, average Americans are feeling downright crabby about the economy, according to recent surveys, even as wages have climbed. With the prices of many goods and services still much higher than before the pandemic, it'll likely take much longer for prices to not seem so out of hand.

""Eventually we will adapt,"" says Moody's Analytics economist Matt Colyar. ""But it's going to take time.""

The Fed's preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out food and energy costs, was up 2.7% in August over the past 12 months and has declined sharply from levels in 2022. The central bank expects inflation to hit 2.2% next year before dropping to its 2% target in 2026.

So inflation is under control, right?

Well, the pace of price growth may have slowed, but it amassed a lot of damage in its wake. Another inflation metric, the more widely covered consumer price index (CPI), shows that prices gained 22% between January 2020 and August 2024.

Wages, though, have risen as well.

While prices gained 22%, weekly earnings went up by almost 24%, according to monthly data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, median annual household income hit $80,600 in 2023, per the Census, up about $3,000 from 2022.

""People are getting paid more, and paying more,"" says Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, a financial services company that supports financial advisors.

Still, that doesn't mean all families aren't feeling the financial burn.

Earnings, after adjusting for inflation, dropped in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In fact, the typical family made $81,210 in 2019 (using today's dollars), or about $600 more than in 2023.

Even if families saw their paycheck rise above inflation in 2024, it's not surprising that many are more pessimistic about their finances than economists might expect.

The Gallup Economic Confidence Index has shown a negative number since July 2021, while the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence survey dropped to a nearly two-year low this August.

While concerns about inflation would likely improve if it continued to hew more closely to 2%, American spirits could be dampened if the labor market continues to slow down.

That was the rationale behind the drop in consumer confidence in August, per the Conference Board, and the Fed deciding to cut rates during its September meeting.

Even though price growth is decelerating, inflation is still above the Fed's target. It'll likely take many months, if not years, of stable prices for consumers to feel secure.

Below is a more detailed look at three major areas of your budget to see just how long that may take.

Gas and grocery prices tend to be volatile; that's why economists look at inflation metrics that exclude them. Since 2020, though, they've vexed consumers.

A gallon of gas cost $2.57 heading into 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, compared to $3.19 now on September 23. That's a 24% increase, which largely tracks wage growth.

Gas fell to $1.77 in April 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic shutdowns, and hit $5.00 in June 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine before falling to its current level.

But it's difficult to say what is and isn't normal when it comes to gas prices.

Between the end of 2014 and 2020, a gallon of gas never rose above $3. However, it cost more than $3 for almost all of the time between 2011 and 2014.

Therefore the price of gas, in its twists and turns, has been entirely normal, albeit higher than many would like to spend.

The August CPI report showed that grocery prices gained 2.1% over the past 12 months, signaling that food prices were becoming more normal.

But zooming out from that report shows just how much more expensive your grocery shopping has been over the past four years compared to recent history.

The cost of nearly every major food item, save tomatoes, rose faster between August 2020 and August 2024 than between August 2016 and August 2020.

Eggs are a particularly glaring example: A dozen eggs cost $1.46 in 2016, $1.33 in 2020 and now $3.20.

Your grocery bill will need many more months of low inflation to feel more normal, but you shouldn't expect prices to ever go back to 2020 levels.

While groceries and gas are constant reminders of price changes, neither bears as much weight on your finances as home ownership: Nearly two-thirds of Americans own a home, according to the Fed's 2024 Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households.

Purchasing a home was largely affordable in the years between 2009 and 2020, according to a Forbes Advisor analysis of the Atlanta Fed's Home Ownership Affordability Monitor, thanks in large part to low mortgage rates following the Great Recession.

The tide turned in 2022, though, as mortgage rates soared following the Fed raising interest rates to tamp down inflation.

Prices also climbed thanks to a lack of available homes for sale, says National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun.

""We have had a lack of housing supply, which is why prices increase so much faster than income growth,"" Yun says.

Many existing homeowners are unwilling to give up their low mortgage rates and are staying put. Meanwhile, builders have been cautious with construction for new homes when so many potential buyers are priced out.

The good news is that borrowing costs have fallen from recent highs -- the average 30-year fixed rate was 6.09 in mid-September compared to 7.8% in the fall of 2023. And they may have a bit further to drop in the near future.

""Rates will probably be around 6% by the end of this year,"" Yun says. ""Next year they might be slightly under 6%, maybe 5.50%.""

Just don't expect the abnormally low mortgage rates that spurred so much demand in the early part of the pandemic to come back anytime soon."
MIKE POMPEO: Kamala Harris would crush families with big-government price controls,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mike-pompeo-kamala-harris-would-crush-families-big-government-price-controls,2024-09-30T09:12:34Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

When a politician promises to use government power to force ""lower prices"" and ""transparency,"" you should expect the opposite outcome. Under the Biden-Harris administration, families have faced skyrocketing costs on everything from groceries to prescription drugs, yet Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed on the campaign trail that the best way to fix this is to insert even more federal control into every corner of our economy. Here's why these policies would be so devastating and lead to even higher costs for Americans.

While Harris has largely avoided the press and declined to publish policy plans on her website, she recently gave a speech outlining her economic priorities in three key areas: food, healthcare, and housing. An examination of her proposals shows that they would all be disasters.

Harris began her remarks by acknowledging that under her tenure as vice president, ""a loaf of bread costs 50% more"" and ""ground beef is up almost 50%."" She's right -- and anyone who has been to the grocery store has seen similar price increases for eggs, cereal and many other staple foods.

HARRIS DROPS MILLIONS ON PRIVATE JET SPENDING DESPITE CALLING CLIMATE CHANGE AN 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT'

But instead of taking responsibility for the out-of-control government spending and failed policies that actually caused these increases, Harris instead proposed passing the ""first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food."" Under this ""ban,"" bureaucrats in Washington would get to decide what constitutes gouging -- or, in other words, what they think the price should be.

Banning ""price gouging"" is not a new or novel idea -- it's just that when the Soviet Union was still around, we called it by its proper name: price controls. Federal bureaucrats at the Federal Trade Commission would decide a ""fair"" price for bread in Pittsburgh or milk in Topeka.

Price controls don't work for very simple and sound reasons. Grocery stores operate on very thin profit margins, often just a few percentage points. So, when a federal bureaucrat tells them they must sell bacon for less than what it costs them to purchase it, they simply won't sell bacon.

Smaller stores that rely on sales of such products to survive would go under. Customers would be left with fewer options to buy bacon at all. And as stores stop selling bacon, there would be less of a market for farmers and ranchers to produce it, reducing supply and pushing prices even higher -- as competition and incentives collapse. This isn't just theory. We literally saw it happen to the Soviet Union.

The price hikes we're seeing under the Biden-Harris administration are driven by inflation across the market, not by suddenly greedy grocery store owners. The solution is to return to responsible, limited government and a pro-growth economic platform -- not impose ruinous price controls that would set a course toward total implosion of our economy.

Harris's healthcare proposals have received less attention but are just as damaging. She criticized pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) -- the companies that negotiate lower drug costs on behalf of employers and other purchasers of healthcare coverage.

I ran small businesses in Kansas and, having seen the high cost of prescription drugs for employees, I know the importance of these negotiations, and the savings they produce. Harris's attacks on PBMs follows years of anti-PBM policies from the current administration, particularly from Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan.

While transparency sounds appealing, what she's really proposing is for PBMs to disclose publicly -- including to all drug manufacturers -- the savings they secure in negotiations.

Disclosing this information would be good only for the biggest drug manufacturers. It would allow them to gain a government-created upper hand in knowing which drugs they can discount less, ultimately meaning higher prices for patients.

Imagine if grocery stores had to disclose to food manufacturers the prices they paid to other manufacturers. This would effectively end negotiations and set one price for everyone -- a higher price. And just as it would be harmful for grocery stores, forcing PBMs to reveal their negotiated prices would allow pharmaceutical companies to raise costs for patients.

Additional proposals targeting the market-based, cost-saving role of PBMs have been touted by Harris allies in Congress. These proposed government mandates would eliminate market-based incentives that produce savings through competition and negotiation, hiking healthcare costs for employers and consumers by billions of dollars each year, while artificially increasing drug company profits.

Healthcare costs have already risen under the Biden-Harris administration. Government intervention would drive them even higher, making it harder for American businesses to offer cost-effective prescription drug coverage, and increasing costs for consumers and taxpayers.

Finally, Harris turned to housing costs, a fitting focus given that average mortgage rates have nearly tripled since the Biden-Harris administration took office. She proposed preventing landlords from setting ""artificially high rental prices,"" which might sound appealing -- until you consider that this means federal bureaucrats would decide what constitutes a ""fair"" rent.

The price hikes we're seeing under the Biden-Harris administration are driven by inflation across the market, not by suddenly greedy grocery store owners. The solution is to return to responsible, limited government and a pro-growth economic platform -- not impose ruinous price controls that would set a course toward total implosion of our economy.

If federal bureaucrats control housing costs, it would discourage homebuilders from entering the market. Why would builders invest their capital and time constructing homes if, after making that investment, a federal official could arbitrarily decide its valuation? Fewer homes being built would lead to even higher prices for both renters and homebuyers.

The consistent theme in Harris's economic approach is clear: she believes the government knows better than the free market, and that putting the government in control will somehow lower prices.

Every leftist leader promises that just a little more government intervention will lead to better outcomes -- but common sense and history tell us this approach doesn't work. You can't fix problems caused by socialism with more socialism. Americans should reject these reckless policies come November."

The price of gold today, as of 9:08am, was £1,979.52 per ounce. That's down 0.58% on yesterday's closing price of £1,991.14.

Compared to last week, the price of gold is up 0.55%, and it's up 4.16% from one month ago.

The 52-week gold price high is £1,997.34, while the 52-week gold price low is £1,879.61.

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation."
Senate GOP teams up to take on Harris policy pitfalls in pre-election video series,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-gop-team-up-take-harris-policy-pitfalls-pre-election-video-series,2024-09-30T08:45:55Z,"FIRST ON FOX: Senate Republicans teamed up to lay out their closing arguments against the Biden-Harris administration and its policies in a new video series that addresses the border, the high cost of living and foreign policy.

Featuring more than 20 Republican senators, the Senate Republican conference is releasing a three-part video series with specific emphasis on Vice President Harris amid her run for the presidency on Monday. The videos will take viewers through the years of President Biden and Harris' administration, reminding them of past blunders.

One video focuses on the southern border crisis, with Republican senators appearing on site at the border cut between footage of Harris responding to concerns over her administration's inaction.

AS LEADER RACE LOOMS, JOHN THUNE TAKES SENATE MAP BY STORM TO BOOST GOP CANDIDATES

It notes Harris was put in charge of addressing the root causes of the border crisis and stemming the flow of migrants to the southern border by Biden as the administration's ""border czar."" However, in recent days, both members of the media and Democrats have suggested Harris was never actually tasked with managing the border crisis or in the position of border czar.

Another video serves as a reminder of the enduring global crises and conflicts that began under the Biden-Harris administration, including the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia's attack on Ukraine and terrorist group Hamas' attack on Israel.

KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONE

High prices and Americans' struggles to make ends meet is addressed in the third video, and the evolution of the administration's explanations for inflation is laid out. Footage of Harris touting ""Bidenomics"" is featured. The administration quickly stopped mentioning Bidenomics after the phrase proved unpopular.

SENATE PASSES FUNDING BILL WITHOUT SAVE ACT, AVOIDING POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said, ""This series shows Americans a clear timeline of Kamala Harris' failures. They will see how Harris' tie-breaking vote led to record-high prices - 20% higher than when Harris took office. They will hear how Harris' open-border policies led to more than 10 million illegal immigrants pouring across the border. They will see how Harris played a pivotal role in the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to the death of 13 Americans.

The video series comes after the departure of the Senate for a month-long recess. Lawmakers won't return until after the November election. It serves as a final argument from the Republican conference against the Biden-Harris administration's policies and leadership while also looking to pin that record on downballot Democrats seeking election or re-election.

Republicans are favored to take the majority in the Senate, keeping all of their current seats and adding seats in West Virginia and Montana. This would put them at a 51-member majority, but there are several additional contests that are considered within reach, giving them a chance to expand on it."
Bank Of Japan's Job Just Got Even Harder,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/09/30/bank-of-japans-job-just-got-even-harder/,2024-09-30T08:21:24Z,"No one was arguably more surprised by Shigeru Ishiba being named Japan's prime minister than the head of the nation's central bank.

That news Friday surely left Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda with seriously mixed feelings. On the one hand, Ueda now has an ally in Ishiba, who wants the BOJ to continue hiking interest rates. This is rather at odds with much of the rest of the Japanese political establishment.

Ishiba's worry is that holding rates at zero for so long has left the yen chronically undervalued. That, over time, has damaged household confidence and warped corporate incentives in dangerous ways

And he's absolutely right. Since the late 1990s, the most constant policy from government to government was keeping the yen weak for trade advantage. Then, in 2012, Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party retook power and turbocharged the weak exchange-rate policy.

At the time, Japan's then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hired Haruhiko Kuroda to supersize the BOJ's balance sheet in fateful ways. From 2013 to 2023, Ueda's predecessor gorged on bonds and stocks as never before. By 2018, the BOJ's balance sheet topped Japan's entire annual GDP.

Since April 2023, it's fallen to Ueda to normalize interest rates. On July 31, Ueda's team hiked benchmark rates to the highest since 2008. Global markets reacted in wildly negative fashion, a sell-off that spooked Ueda.

Earlier this month, Ueda was summoned to the parliament by anxious lawmakers. They recall that last time the BOJ tried to end quantitative easing and get rates as far away from zero as possible. It resulted in a recession and the BOJ backtracking. By 2008, QE and zero rates were being restored.

Since the July 31 decision to hike rates to 0.25%, Ueda seemed to scale back on this hawkish rhetoric. One issue was the Ministry of Finance suggesting that deflation might not be dead after all.

Ishiba's premiership, on paper, might seem a gift to Ueda's normalization plans. Along with worrying about inflation -- which is well above the BOJ's 2% target -- Ishiba loathes the developing-nation vibe that accompanies Tokyo's beggar-thy-neighbor policies.

Ueda, it seems, now has political cover to hike rates without strong blowback from the ruling LDP. What could be better than Japan's new prime minister having your back?

The problem is, though, Ueda might be having cold feet all his own about Japan Inc.'s readiness for tighter monetary policy. For one thing, the economy is losing altitude as China's slows.

The latest indicator of that is industrial production, which disappointed investors considerably in August. The 3.3% drop from the previous month was much deeper than feared. Production is now more than 10% below 2017 and 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic. Nor do business forecasts going forward offer much optimism.

""The bleak data poses a dilemma for the Bank of Japan and the government,"" says Stefan Angrick at Moody's Analytics. ""The central bank is determined to raise interest rates. And Ishiba ... has signaled a preference for tighter fiscal policy. But the poor run of data complicates these plans.""

In Angrick's view, the ""sharp drop"" in production is a bad omen for third-quarter GDP, while household finances are ""stretched,"" bankruptcies are up and external demand is ""weak."" Given the subdued backdrop, he says, ""a premature turn towards tighter monetary and fiscal policy would be an added drag on the economy. At worst, they could precipitate a broader downturn.""

Ishiba is also a proponent of fiscal restraint, including tax increases. That could bode ill for corporate confidence, which is hardly what Tokyo wants amid efforts to boost wages. The whole idea behind the BOJ's reflation efforts these last 11 years was kicking off a ""virtuous cycle"" of wages gains. Higher pay, it was hoped, would boost corporate profits and lead to even fatter paychecks.

All bets could be off if Ishiba is tightening fiscal policy. The BOJ is left with a daunting dilemma. Does Ueda push on with higher rates, unsure how those steps might reverberate through the economy? Or does he pause rate hikes for now, possibly drawing the ire of Japan's rather outspoken new leader?

Most central bankers would love a scenario where their nation's top leader runs interference for rate moves that might enrage many politicians, investors and households alike.

Yet given the times in which he's presiding over the BOJ, and the unique range of challenges on the horizon, it's not clear Ueda is happy about this political turn of events. And a fast-moving narrative, too. On Monday, Ishiba said he plans to call a general election on October 27.

It's quite a quandary, one that reminds us why Ueda has what's arguably the least enviable job in global economics."
Austrian far-right party wins national vote but its chances of governing are unclear,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25385/austria-election-far-right,2024-09-30T04:50:52Z,"VIENNA -- The Freedom Party secured the first far-right national parliamentary election victory in post-World War II Austria on Sunday, finishing ahead of the governing conservatives after tapping into anxieties about immigration, inflation, Ukraine and other issues. But its chances of governing were unclear.

Preliminary official results showed the Freedom Party finishing first with 29.2% of the vote and Chancellor Karl Nehammer's Austrian People's Party was second with 26.5%. The center-left Social Democrats were in third place with 21%. The outgoing government -- a coalition of Nehammer's party and the environmentalist Greens -- lost its majority in the lower house of parliament.

Herbert Kickl, a former interior minister and longtime campaign strategist who has led the Freedom Party since 2021, wants to be chancellor.

But to become Austria's new leader, he would need a coalition partner to command a parliamentary majority. Rivals have said they won't work with Kickl in government.

The far right has benefited from frustration over high inflation, the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also built on worries about migration.

In its election program, titled ""Fortress Austria,"" the Freedom Party calls for ""remigration of uninvited foreigners,"" for achieving a more ""homogeneous"" nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an emergency law.

The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of Western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany. Kickl has criticized ""elites"" in Brussels and called for some powers to be brought back from the European Union to Austria.

""We don't need to change our position, because we have always said that we're ready to lead a government, we're ready to push forward this change in Austria side by side with the people,"" Kickl said in an appearance alongside other party leaders on ORF public television. ""The other parties should ask themselves where they stand on democracy,"" he added, arguing that they should ""sleep on the result.""

Nehammer said it was ""bitter"" that his party missed out on first place, but noted he brought it back from lower poll ratings. He has often said he won't form a coalition with Kickl and said that ""what I said before the election, I also say after the election.""

More than 6.3 million people were eligible to vote for the new parliament in Austria, an EU member that has a policy of military neutrality.

Kickl has achieved a turnaround since Austria's last parliamentary election in 2019. In June, the Freedom Party narrowly won a nationwide vote for the first time in the European Parliament election, which also brought gains for other European far-right parties.

Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders, whose party dominates the Netherlands' new government, congratulated the Freedom Party on social network X Sunday. So did Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the Alternative for Germany party.

The Freedom Party is a long-established force but Sunday's result was its best yet in a national parliamentary election, beating the 26.9% it scored in 1999.

In 2019, its support slumped to 16.2% after a scandal brought down a government in which it was the junior partner. Then-vice chancellor and Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache resigned following the publication of a secretly recorded video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor.

The leader of the Social Democrats, a party that led many of Austria's post-World War II governments, positioned himself as the polar opposite to Kickl. Andreas Babler ruled out governing with the far right and labeled Kickl ""a threat to democracy.""

While the Freedom Party has recovered, the popularity of Nehammer's People's Party declined sharply compared with 2019. Support for the Greens, their coalition partner, also dropped to 8%.

During the election campaign, Nehammer portrayed his party, which has taken a tough line on immigration in recent years, as ""the strong center"" that would guarantee stability amid multiple crises.

But crises ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resulting rising energy prices and inflation also cost it support. The government also angered many Austrians in 2022 with a short-lived coronavirus vaccine mandate, the first in Europe.

But the recent flooding caused by Storm Boris that hit Austria and other countries may have helped Nehammer slightly narrow the gap as a crisis manager.

The People's Party is the far right's only way into government, and now holds the key to forming any administration.

Nehammer repeatedly excluded joining a government led by Kickl, describing him as a ""security risk"" for the country, but didn't rule out a coalition with the Freedom Party itself -- which would imply Kickl renouncing a position in government. But that looks very unlikely with the Freedom Party in first place.

The alternative would be an alliance between the People's Party and the Social Democrats -- with or without the liberal Neos, who took 9% of the vote.

A final official result will be published later in the week after a small number of remaining postal ballots have been counted, but those won't change the outcome substantially.

About 300 protesters gathered outside the parliament building in Vienna Sunday evening, holding placards with slogans including ""Kickl is a Nazi."""
New Red Lobster CEO Offers A Key Lesson To CEOs On Reviving A Company,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2024/09/29/new-red-lobster-ceo-offers-a-key-lesson-to-ceos-on-reviving-a-company/,2024-09-30T01:51:34Z,"In business, much like in sports, success is far from guaranteed. Even when a company is thriving, healthy paranoia is a necessity, as external factors such as geopolitical shifts, inflation, and evolving customer preferences, amongst others, can derail progress. Nowhere is this more evident than in U.S. restaurant chains like Hooters, TGI Fridays, and Red Lobster, all of which have struggled in recent years.

Red Lobster, an iconic brand that originated in 1968, has faced a steep decline -- so much so that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few months ago. Restaurants remain open, with 93 of them closing. The company has reportedly accrued estimated liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion, with $24.4 million owed to distributor Performance Food Group, according to CNBC. Key performance metrics, including guest visits, have declined by approximately 30% since 2019.

Several factors contributed to this downturn: inflationary pressures, rising minimum wages in half the U.S., high lease costs, increasing competition, and executive missteps and initiatives -- like turning the popular ""Endless Shrimp"" promotion into a permanent daily menu item, resulting in even more losses. As noted by CNN, this isn't the first time a miscalculated promotion has hurt the chain -- an ""Endless Crab"" deal in 2003 led to a $3.3 million loss in just seven weeks. With such mounting pressures and needing to reinvent themselves, Red Lobster is turning to a new CEO.

New CEO Damola Adamolekun, appointed by the private equity firm Fortress Investment Group, has been tasked with leading the turnaround. Adamolekun, a 35-year-old who previously led P.F. Chang's to a successful resurgence before leaving the position in 2023, has taken an unconventional approach to his new role at Red Lobster. Before formally stepping in as CEO, he visited various Red Lobster locations across the U.S. under the radar. As the Wall Street Journal reported, this undercover work gave him a firsthand look at operations, employee challenges, and customer experiences -- without the usual CEO filter that is nearly impossible to scrub. This type of undercover work, which can also be described as on-the-ground leadership, is an approach that offers a critical reminder for CEOs and leaders who are dealing with a crisis or attempting to revitalize their company, culture, and brand.

During his visits, Adamolekun discovered that customers ""just want quality food in a comfortable setting and to connect with the history of the brand,"" as he shared in the previously referenced Wall Street Journal article. While this might seem obvious, it is a necessary reminder for CEOs. In the complexity of daily business, it's easy to stray from the fundamentals that made a brand successful and accumulate unnecessary complexity that leads to poor decision-making and slow reaction to changing circumstances.

As businesses increasingly rely on technology, data, and artificial intelligence to steer their decision-making, there is still incomparable value to operating with boots-on-the-ground leadership. The numbers can tell one story, but firsthand experiences offer a deeper, unfiltered view of what's genuinely happening within an organization and, thus, what's being reflected on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has long advocated for this approach, frequently visiting and interacting with various partners and aspects of the business to stay on top and ahead of everything.

When leaders operate with this kind of direct engagement, they build stronger connections from the top down and, ultimately, better synergy between leadership and frontline workers. By stepping into Red Lobster locations incognito, Adamolekun gathered valuable insights and demonstrated to his current (and future) team members that leadership isn't removed from the day-to-day. This approach improves trust, aligns teams with leadership, and improves the customer experience, positively impacting the bottom line.

Like Starbucks, which has seen its new CEO refocus the company on its core identity and rebuild from the inside out, Red Lobster's new leadership team aims to rebuild from the inside out. Reviving an iconic American brand isn't going to happen overnight. Still, there's hope for a turnaround as Adamolekun and the rest of the team seem to be honing in on the basics:

It's not everything that's needed for a company's comeback, but often, keeping things simple is precisely what's required to steer momentum in the right direction."
Gaming Increases Salary And Career Success. 3 Reasons It Works,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2024/09/29/how-gaming-boosts-salary-and-career-success/,2024-09-29T21:59:02Z,"If you want to increase your salary or achieve success in your career, gaming may be the perfect strategy. There is evidence that gaming as a child is linked with better pay and more promotion as an adult -- and you can accomplish similar results with continued gaming as well.

It's a tough job market today and there is tons of competition not only for the best roles, but also the best projects and promotions. Employers are looking for those with brilliant thinking and problem-solving skills in addition to people who embrace tech and who can cope with all of the current challenges.

Gaming can set you apart and cause you to shine, so you can reap the rewards of your efforts.

Lots of us apparently played video games as children, with 89% who report they played and 96% who believe their experience has had a positive effect on their lives, according to a survey and sentiment analysis by Prodigy.

Play has been linked with productivity as well. In particular, when coworkers played video games together, they increased their productivity by 20% according to an academic study at Brigham Young University.

Gaming can have powerful effects on your career as well. Those who played video games as children were 71% more likely to have received promotions recently. In addition, they earned an average of $5,451 more in annual salary compared with those who didn't play, based on Prodigy's data.

Gaming is a big deal for children who played, but it can also continue to drive positive outcomes for adults -- and it has big benefits for your career.

Interestingly, 63% of people say gaming helped them with stress relief, relaxation, entertainment and fun, based on Prodigy data.

These are huge advantages, because 88% to 61% of people are fearful of everything from job loss or inflation to information war, according to Edelman's Trust Barometer Global Report. In addition, 84% of all employees reported they were stressed, and 98% of Gen Z respondents said they were burned out, based on data from Cigna,

The ability to manage stress, relax and rejuvenate is critical for your wellbeing and also for your ability to contribute over time -- and ensure your ongoing resilience. All of this is very good for your career success.

Another advantage of gaming: 45% of those who played video games report increased technological literacy, according to Prodigy. This too has huge career implications.

The world of work is changing significantly based on technology -- and the integration of AI into all kinds of work. Predications about AI suggest its use in the U.S. will grow to 117 million users in 2025 -- based on natural language processing, robotics, machine learning and more. This is in addition to the 882% increase in the use of Chat GPT.

AI won't take your job, but someone using it will. As a result, comfort and acumen with technology will be currency for your career in terms of the ability to embrace it for your role and incorporate it in your career. Gaming can set you up for success.

Perhaps the most significant advantage with gaming is its effects on all kinds of thinking processes. According to the Prodigy data,

Work has become increasingly complex, fast-moving and challenging with new problems coming up all the time, and the need for new innovations ever-present.

The ability to think strategically, solve problems creatively and bring new perspectives based on curiosity and strong cognitive skills will matter in who succeeds in their work.

And the ability to work through problems and lean into the future will make work more rewarding as well. Again, gamers will be well-suited for this reality.

You can apply the benefits of gaming individually or as a team (think: gaming over your lunch hour with your colleagues).

You can also leverage gaming as an organization. As an example, a global manufacturing company has established a gaming community. The employee resource group meets monthly for game nights that include not just video games, but also board games and even chess and Dungeons and Dragons. They also have a team that competes in esports events against other companies.

The membership in the group continues to grow because people are sustaining and growing their capabilities, but also because they appreciate the community, the camaraderie and the inclusivity that result from the time together and the supportive experiences. They also say it's a demonstration of positive culture.

Of course there are plenty of ways to build your skills, but gaming is a terrific path to success."
4 Strategies To Lead Change Effectively Even If You Lack Confidence,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2024/09/29/strategies-to-lead-change-effectively/,2024-09-29T21:58:55Z,"Leadership is a huge challenge -- but leading through change can be especially difficult and even tumultuous. Plenty of leaders are going through transitions with their organizations, but the majority also lack confidence and feel uncertain about their capabilities to get through successfully.

The risks are high, because of the shifts we face -- from the competitive and economic landscape to the shifts in information, talent and work. All of these increase the demands on leaders, and in particular the demands to lead through the overwhelm, ambiguity and complexity.

Change is ubiquitous, with 80% of leaders reporting that change is part of their long-term vision and 96% planning to dedicate more than 5% of revenue to change projects in the next 3 years, according to a survey of 1,000 leaders and 5,000 workers at 1,000 companies by Accenture.

In addition, according to Accenture, most leaders have experience with change, with 95% saying they've gone through two or more transformations in the past three years. But despite their experience, they lack confidence in their own change management capabilities and so do their employees.

And this lack of confidence about change is happening in the face of shifts in work and the workforce itself -- with 100% of c-suite leaders anticipating significant changes in the workforce. So the people who will need to embrace, lead and execute change are themselves changing, based on the Accenture data.

Leaders are under tremendous demands and pressure as they move their organizations forward every day. But it's possible to be especially successful with your change management process by keeping four elements in mind.

As you face into the future and lead change -- especially if you lack confidence or certainty -- you'll need to continually build your competence. In deciding whether to follow a leader, people assess your competence -- even if they do it subconsciously.

They will be enthusiastic to go in your direction when they know you have a command of context, conditions, systems and solutions -- and when you have a commitment to continuing to learn, grow, adapt and improve as the world changes.

Read voraciously and seek formal learning opportunities as well. Seek alternative points of view. Look for those who are successful and use them as a guide and a model for your own behaviors.

Also concentrate on how you'll build organizational change readiness and competence, continually developing people so that you raise the capability of the company as a whole.

When deciding whether to follow and trust a leader, people also assess your warmth and compassion. They want to know whether you care and to what extent you are humane.

When leaders demonstrate empathy, it's the right thing to do, period. But in addition, when people perceive you to be empathetic, they are more likely to be innovative, engaged and stay with the company. They are also more likely to feel the company is inclusive and respectful of work-life needs.

Unfortunately, speed can impede empathy and compassion. When you're in a hurry, it's easy to just plow forward. But you can slow down to speed up and attend to people and their needs -- so they have the support they need to contribute and build their resilience.

Give thought to how people may be thinking or feeling -- and be curious about people in terms of what makes them unique and the gifts they bring. Pay attention to people and check in with them, asking questions and offering resources when they need support.

Another important element of leading through change -- even if you lack confidence -- is commitment. Especially when you're facing uncertainty or feeling unsure, it can be tough to stay the course. Certainty is impossible, so you'll need to keep your foot on the gas, even if you can't clearly see all the way to your destination.

You may establish a new initiative, not see results fast enough, and want to pull back. But be sure to stick with things long enough to give them time to succeed. Start something new and give people the chance to learn, execute, monitor and improve.

And before you start something, be sure you have enough in your patience bank to stay the course. Going through change takes tremendous investment of time, energy, people, dollars and more -- so before you start, ensure you can commit.

Also plan for how you'll monitor not just outcomes, but your progress along the way, so you can change course when it's actually necessary.

As you lead change, you'll also need to be courageous.

People are tremendously fearful today, with 88%-61% globally who report they are worried about information wars, job loss, inflation, political uncertainty, global uncertainty and more, based on the Edelman Trust Barometer Global Report. This is important because people may be showing up with an underlying level of fear, and they are likely looking to their work for a point of continuity and stability -- at the same time you're transforming.

But it's possible to make progress despite fear. After all, courage isn't the absence of fear, it is the ability to move forward in the face of fear.

Be smart about examining the pros and cons of your destination and then proceeding wisely. You'll never eliminate risk, but you can assess it and mitigate it. Consider all the risks you face related to your transformation -- assessing their likelihood and the potential severity of the consequence.

Then, put plans in place to deal with potential negative issues. If something is unlikely or has minor consequences, you may not invest in proactive solutions, but if something is very likely or very severe in its effect, you'll take proactive action to head it off or to prepare for how you'll deal with it.

Also use courage to develop and communicate a vision that motivates people (and yourself). Ensure you have a strong business case for where you're going. Set clear expectations for what you need from individuals, teams, the organization and yourself to succeed.

The overwhelm and pressure that leaders face are extreme today, but you can lead change even if you lack confidence and even as you face ambiguity.

Admit where you're weak and build your capability. Be intentional, engage others, monitor and continuously improve -- and stay the course for the terrific results you'll see through your transformations."
70 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/70-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-09-29T17:26:24Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' media strategy heading into November.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 70 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Under pressure to sit down for a substantive interview after weeks of stonewalling, Harris finally ended her interview drought last month in Georgia when she was joined by running mate Tim Walz for a pre-taped piece with CNN's Dana Bash that was a far cry from a traditional press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August earlier this month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey earlier this month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

Mortgage Rates 29 September 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-29-09-24/,2024-09-29T15:36:44Z,"Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steading interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Cooling and steady inflation has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.61%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.33% and 4.26% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.73%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.94% and 3.71% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.48%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stand at 7.22% today, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Halifax's house price report (published 6 September) reported that average property values in August were 4.3% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.3% when compared to July. Halifax, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in August at £292,505 - up from £291,268 in July.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
How To Mine Bitcoin: A Guide For Beginners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin/,2024-09-29T15:03:04Z,"Bitcoin mining validates transactions and creates new coins using powerful computers to solve complex puzzles. This guide breaks down the process for beginners, covering essential equipment, software and economic factors. It will explore solo, pool and cloud mining options, discussing their pros and cons.

You'll learn about mining profitability, hardware choices, energy costs and regulatory considerations. By the end, you'll understand the fundamentals of bitcoin mining and how bitcoin works to be better equipped to decide if it's a venture worth pursuing in today's competitive environment.

Understanding bitcoin mining is essential to grasp how the system works, as it's the process by which transactions are verified and new coins are created. Bitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million coins, with new coins introduced through this mining process.

This cryptocurrency allows for direct online payments without intermediaries, offering potential for lower transaction fees compared to traditional online payment mechanisms. Bitcoin's value is determined by market demand, leading to its price volatility. Bitcoin is considered one of the best solutions due to its decentralized nature, limited supply and global accessibility, providing financial freedom and potential for long-term value growth.

When a user initiates a Bitcoin transaction, it's broadcast to the network and placed in a pool of unconfirmed transactions. Miners then select transactions from this pool to include in the next block.

Each transaction is verified using cryptographic signatures to ensure the sender has the necessary funds and authorization. Once verified, the transaction is added to a block, which is then mined and added to the blockchain, making it permanent and irreversible.

The blockchain serves as a public ledger, recording all Bitcoin transactions. This transparency allows anyone to view transaction history, though user identities remain pseudonymous.

Bitcoin miners play a crucial role in maintaining the network's integrity and security. They use specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems, a process that validates transactions and adds new blocks to the blockchain.

Miners compete to solve these problems first, with the winner receiving newly minted bitcoins as a reward. This process, known as proof-of-work, ensures the network's security by making it computationally expensive to attack or manipulate.

Miners also help regulate the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. The mining reward halves approximately every four years, controlling inflation and maintaining Bitcoin's scarcity.

Bitcoin mining is the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency's network, ensuring its security and functionality. This section explores the mining process, explaining its mechanics, the concept of proof-of-work, rewards structure and the remaining supply of mineable bitcoins.

Bitcoin mining is the process of validating transactions and adding new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain using computational power. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, with the winner earning the right to add the next block and receive newly minted bitcoins as a reward.

This process serves two crucial functions: it secures the network by making it prohibitively expensive to attack, and introduces new bitcoins into circulation at a controlled rate. Mining requires significant investment in specialized hardware and energy consumption.

Proof-of-work is the consensus mechanism used by the Bitcoin network to validate transactions and create new blocks. It requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems that demand substantial computational power.

The difficulty of these problems adjusts automatically to maintain a consistent block time of about 10 minutes, regardless of the total network mining power. This ensures the network's security by making it extremely costly and time-consuming for attackers to alter the blockchain.

PoW also prevents double-spending by requiring majority consensus for transaction validation, making fraudulent activities computationally impractical.

Bitcoin miners are incentivized through two primary mechanisms: block rewards and transaction fees. Block rewards are newly created bitcoins awarded to the miner who successfully adds a new block to the blockchain. Currently, this reward stands at 3.125 bitcoins per block.

Transaction fees, paid by users to prioritize their transactions, provide an additional income stream for miners. As the block reward diminishes over time due to Bitcoin's halving events, transaction fees are expected to become the primary incentive for miners.

The combination of block rewards and fees aims to ensure the network's long-term sustainability by incentivizing miners to continue securing the blockchain even as the supply of new bitcoins decreases.

As of September 2024, approximately 19.5 million bitcoins have been mined out of the maximum bitcoin supply of 21 million. This leaves about 1.2 million bitcoins yet to be mined.

The rate of new bitcoin creation slows over time due to halving events, which occur roughly every four years. The next halving is expected in 2028, further reducing the block reward. Given this declining rate, the last bitcoin is projected to be mined around 2140. The time to mine one bitcoin varies greatly depending on the miner's hardware and the network's overall hash rate.

Successful Bitcoin mining requires specific hardware and software. The days of mining with a standard computer are long gone. Today's miners need powerful, specialized equipment to compete effectively. This section outlines the essential hardware and software components for Bitcoin mining, helping beginners understand the technological requirements of this venture.

Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are the gold standard for Bitcoin mining. These devices are designed solely for mining and offer superior performance and energy efficiency compared to general-purpose hardware. Popular ASIC models include the Antminer series from Bitmain and the Whatsminer series from MicroBT.

Graphics Processing Units were once commonly used for Bitcoin mining but are now primarily employed for mining other cryptocurrencies. While less efficient for Bitcoin, they offer more flexibility as they can be repurposed for other tasks or cryptocurrencies.

Central Processing Units are no longer viable for profitable Bitcoin mining due to their low hash rates compared to ASICs. However, they're still used in some altcoin mining operations.

Mining software connects your hardware to the Bitcoin network and allows you to participate in the mining process. Popular options include CGMiner and BFGMiner, both open-source programs that support a wide range of mining hardware.

For those new to mining, user-friendly options offer a simpler interface and the ability to rent out computing power. These platforms can be a good starting point for beginners. Specifically, there are two main types of user-friendly mining options:

A Bitcoin wallet is essential for storing your mined coins. Hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor offer the highest security for long-term storage, while software wallets provide more convenience for frequent transactions. Always prioritize security when choosing a wallet.

Establishing a Bitcoin mining operation involves several key steps: selecting appropriate hardware, installing and configuring mining software, joining a mining pool and setting up a secure wallet. Each component plays an important role in creating an efficient and profitable mining setup. Let's explore these elements in detail to help you start your mining journey on the right foot.

Selecting the right hardware is critical for a successful mining operation. The primary consideration is the hash rate, which measures the number of calculations a device can perform per second. Higher hash rates increase your chances of solving blocks and earning rewards. However, this often comes with increased power consumption, so energy efficiency is another factor.

Consider the upfront cost of the hardware and its expected lifespan. Mining equipment can become obsolete quickly as technology advances and mining difficulty increases. Research the track record of different manufacturers and models, paying attention to reliability and customer support. At the moment of writing popular ASIC models like the Antminer S19 Pro or the Whatsminer M30S++ are often good choices for their balance of performance and efficiency.

ASICs generate significant heat and noise, which may require additional cooling solutions and soundproofing measures. Ensure your electrical infrastructure can handle the power demands of your chosen hardware to avoid overloads or safety hazards.

Once you've secured your hardware, the next step is setting up your mining software. Start by choosing software compatible with your hardware and operating system. Download the software from official sources to avoid malware risks.

Configuration involves entering your mining pool information, including the pool's URL and your worker name. You'll also need to set your wallet address where mining rewards will be sent. Many software options allow you to fine-tune settings like fan speed and power consumption to optimize performance and efficiency.

Ensure your computer's firewall allows the mining software to communicate with the pool. Some antiviruses might flag mining software as malicious, so you may need to add exceptions. Regular updates are crucial for security and performance, so set up automatic updates or check for them frequently.

While solo mining is possible, joining a mining pool significantly increases your chances of earning consistent rewards. Mining pools combine the computational power of multiple miners, sharing rewards proportionally based on contributed work. This approach provides more stable income, albeit with a small fee to the pool operator.

When choosing a pool, consider factors like pool size, fee structure and payout thresholds. Larger pools offer more frequent payouts but may have higher fees. Smaller pools might provide larger individual rewards but less frequently. Research the pool's reputation, uptime and customer support.

Most pools require you to create an account and set up workers, which are essentially names for your mining devices. You'll need to configure your mining software with the pool's address and your worker credentials. Many pools offer detailed statistics on your mining performance, helping you optimize your operation over time.

A Bitcoin wallet is essential for storing your mining rewards securely. Choose between hardware wallets for maximum security or software wallets for convenience. Hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor offer offline storage, protecting your funds from online threats.

When setting up your wallet, securely store your recovery phrase - typically 12 or 24 words. This phrase is crucial for recovering your funds if your device is lost or damaged. Never share this phrase with anyone. Regularly update your wallet software to ensure you have the latest security features.

Bitcoin mining offers various approaches, each with unique advantages and challenges. Understanding these methods is crucial for newcomers to make informed decisions. This section explores three primary mining strategies: solo mining, pool mining and cloud mining. Each method caters to different investment levels, technical expertise, and risk tolerances.

Solo mining involves independently attempting to solve Bitcoin blocks. Miners use their own hardware and resources, competing directly against the entire network. If successful, solo miners receive the full block reward and transaction fees. However, the odds of solving a block alone are extremely low due to the network's high difficulty.

This method requires substantial computational power and can lead to inconsistent income. It's generally not recommended for beginners or those without significant resources.

Pool mining combines the computational power of multiple miners to increase the chances of solving blocks. Participants contribute their mining power to a pool and share the rewards proportionally based on their contributed work. This method offers more frequent, albeit smaller, payouts compared to solo mining. Pools typically charge a small fee for their services. Pool mining is often the preferred choice for individual miners seeking more consistent returns.

Cloud mining allows individuals to mine bitcoins without owning or operating mining hardware. Users purchase mining contracts from companies that manage the hardware and mining operations. This method eliminates the need for technical knowledge and upfront hardware costs.

However, cloud mining contracts can be risky. They often have high fees and may not be profitable in volatile market conditions. Careful research is essential to avoid scams and ensure the legitimacy of cloud mining providers.

Secure your mining operation by:

Be vigilant about scams, especially in cloud mining. Stay informed on latest security practices.

Bitcoin mining legality varies globally. In the U.S., it's generally legal but state regulations differ. Some countries ban mining; others encourage it.

Miners often must register operations and comply with AML and KYC regulations. Tax implications are significant: mined bitcoins are taxable income, and selling may incur capital gains tax.

Consult legal and tax professionals familiar with local cryptocurrency regulations. Stay informed about regulatory changes.

Key risks include:

These factors can quickly turn profitable operations into loss-making ventures.

Bitcoin mining requires significant investment, technical knowledge, and ongoing management. Success depends on efficient operations, cost management, and adaptability. While challenging, mining remains vital for network security and decentralization. Thorough research and cautious decision-making are essential before entering this competitive field."
Opinion | The problem with Harris' 'pragmatic' economic approach,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-economic-policies-republicans-rcna173019,2024-09-29T14:11:43Z,"Kamala Harris said she won't be ""constrained by ideology"" when looking for ""practical solutions to problems."" Good luck with that.

Vice President Kamala Harris has begun rolling out the economic policies her administration would enact should she take office next year. In her big speech on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, she promised to be ""pragmatic"" in her economic approach. Harris added, ""I believe we shouldn't be constrained by ideology and should instead seek practical solutions to problems.""

It's a seemingly noble sentiment as these things go. Harris' pitch is one that tries to toe the line between populist and moderate in hopes of triumphing over former President Donald Trump. What better way to do so than by promising to give serious consideration to ideas that come from the other side of the aisle? But looking at the proposals her campaign has put forward so far, it's hard to see just what solutions she intends to lift from conservative ideology -- or if there are even any GOP ideas left that are worth appropriating as her own.

In one of the most frustrating misconceptions that refuses to die, and despite ample evidence to the contrary, many polls still show voters think Trump would have an edge over Harris on handling the economy. We can chalk that up at least in part to short-term memory loss of the Trump administration's chaos, along with frustration with the inflation that skyrocketed post-pandemic and has only now tapered off. Accordingly, Harris has tried to keep her distance from President Joe Biden, even as large parts of the policy document her team dropped on Thursday are carryovers from his ""Bidenomics"" proposals.

In promising to be pragmatic and listen to ideas from all comers, Harris is trying to tamp down on the perennial false claims from Republicans that she's a secret socialist. The easiest way that past Democrats have found to do this has been to find the most palatable conservative policies that could appeal to a broad swath of the country and claim them for their own. (It's a process that you never see go the other direction, absent a few of Trump's wilder swings that have zero backup from the rest of his party.)

But that was an easier task for previous Democratic presidents, who had more options for centrist compromises given where the Republicans were starting from. When crafting the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama eschewed more progressive policies like a single-payer system in favor of ripping off GOP Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. The ""Romneycare"" hybrid market model for health care was itself first put forward by the Heritage Foundation of all places, long before Republicans turned on it in 2008.

The prior Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was especially keen to undercut GOP talking points by swiping their most popular ideas in the process of ""triangulation."" Of course, ""popular"" doesn't always mean ""good."" Yes, Clinton's welfare reforms were a compromise, one that moved the country to the right economically without fully dismantling government assistance like many conservatives would have preferred. But it came at the cost of adding needless hurdles for millions of Americans to jump over to access vital assistance.

In contrast, it's not clear what big ideas Harris thinks she'll be able to import from the right in her term. There's surely not anything in the pages of Heritage's Project 2025 that will become the same kind of major policy focus for her. The closest to that may be the pitch for a new kind of universal savings account that my colleague Ryan Teague Beckwith identified as one of the few suggestions in the giant document worth giving serious consideration.

There are a few smaller things that could be on the agenda. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania issued an executive order removing requirements for a four-year college degree from most state jobs, which has been held up as a potential example for Harris to crib from. In her speech on Wednesday, Harris touched on changing up permitting and ""cutting red tape"" for new small businesses. Both have a certain conservative flavor, but aren't necessarily coded as wholesale right-wing propositions.

If anything, the closest example of taking on a conservative economic idea as her own would be the proposal to end taxes on tips that Trump floated this summer. Her team has worked to try to refine the concept from a naked ploy to win over service workers in Nevada into an actual policy. It's still not exactly a sure winner, though, politically or economically speaking.

It could be then that Harris' promise to be open to ideas from all ideologies is less about her administration's policy than election-year politics. As a bit of rhetoric, it likely sounds great to those few remaining undecided swing voters that she will have an open mind and not be beholden to left-wing economic models. But if she gets into office and finds that the GOP's ideas would all either raise prices for consumers, require giving the wealthy even more money, or turn out to be just plain impractical? Well, you won't be able say she didn't try to find some wheat among the chaff at least."
What Is Ethereum And How Does It Work?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-is-ethereum-how-does-it-work/,2024-09-29T13:08:12Z,"Ethereum is a decentralized platform enabling the creation of decentralized applications using blockchain technology. This article explores Ethereum's purpose, operation, history and key components, providing insights into its ecosystem and future developments.

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that allows developers to build and deploy dApps and smart contracts without third-party interference. It extends the blockchain's capabilities beyond digital currency, enabling programmable agreements and applications across various industries.

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a digital currency and store of value, Ethereum introduced smart contracts -- self-executing code that automates agreements when predetermined conditions are met. Its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), powers transactions and computational services on the network, facilitating a wide range of applications from decentralized finance to NFTs. The ether spent to power transactions is known as 'gas' and is the cost of using the network.

Ethereum was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, aiming to expand blockchain's potential beyond financial transactions. Alongside co-founders Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin, Ethereum launched in 2015 after a successful crowdfunding ICO campaign. An ICO is an initial coin offering, something that is rarely seen today due to regulatory concerns. However, Ethereum pioneered the methodology leading to a spree of ICOs throughout the 2016-2017 bull run. The platform also introduced the Ethereum Virtual Machine and a programming language for smart contracts, marking a significant advancement in blockchain technology.

Ethereum's inception brought about a new era of decentralized computing, enabling developers worldwide to create applications that operate without centralized control. Further, its open-source nature fostered a robust community, contributing to its rapid growth and adoption.

Today, there are several EVM-compatible chains, including BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and many others. These chains chose to build on Ethereum's achievement to create a network of blockchains capable of communicating in a similar fashion.

Ethereum is as a decentralized blockchain network which enables its smart contracts and dApps to run without downtime or censorship at the protocol level. It utilizes a distributed ledger to record transactions and state changes in smart contracts.

Developers write smart contracts using languages like Solidity, which are compiled to run on the EVM. Transactions and computations are validated by network participants (nodes) and secured through consensus mechanisms. Ether serves as the medium for compensating validators and facilitating network operations.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers securely and transparently. Each block contains a list of transactions, linked cryptographically to the previous block, forming an immutable chain.

Ethereum leverages blockchain to store and execute smart contracts, extending the technology's utility beyond simple value transfer. This enables applications in DeFi, e-commerce, supply chain management, voting systems, prediction markets, and more, ensuring that smart contracts and dApps are tamper-proof and operate as programmed.

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with terms directly written into code. They automatically execute when predefined conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. Even when all permissioned users such as admins are removed the code can continue to run indefinitely with no entity able to shut them down.

On Ethereum, smart contracts are fundamental, facilitating activities like token issuance, lending and decentralized exchanges. They enable programmable, trustless agreements, revolutionizing industries by introducing new business models and streamlining processes.

Decentralized applications run on a network of computers rather than a single server, leveraging blockchain for transparency and security. dApps operate according to their smart contracts, functioning without centralized oversight.

For example, even a dApp that is banned by a government can't be shut down or have its access denied without admin rights to the code. While internet service providers may work with authorities to make it harder to access the dApp there is no way for it to be fully censored.

Ethereum has historically been the primary platform for dApp development due to its support for smart contracts and developer tools. However, other Layer 1 blockhains such as Solana, and Ethereum Layer 2 chains like Polygon, Avalanche and Base have increased in popularity due to lower fees and faster transaction times.

dApps are disrupting traditional industries by providing decentralized alternatives in finance, gaming, social media and supply chain management, enhancing user control and fostering innovation.

While both Ethereum and Bitcoin utilize blockchain technology, they serve different purposes and offer distinct features. The following sections highlight key differences and use cases to understand how these digital assets differ.

Bitcoin was designed as a digital currency and store of value, focusing on secure peer-to-peer transactions. Ethereum, however, is a programmable platform that is Turing complete, extending its capabilities beyond transactions.

Ethereum's block time is shorter, allowing faster transaction confirmations. It also now employs a different consensus mechanism and has a flexible monetary policy compared to Bitcoin's fixed supply.

However, Ethereum originally launched with a similar Proof-of-work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, allowing network participants to mine ether using graphics cards. The protocol has since migrated to a more energy efficient proof-of-stake system.

Bitcoin is commonly used for censorship resistant peer-to-peer transactions and as a hedge against inflation. Its primary use cases involve payments, remittances and investment.

Ethereum supports a vast ecosystem of applications, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations. Its versatility allows developers to create innovative solutions across various industries. Many view Ethereum as digital oil compared to Bitcoin's digital gold narrative.

Additionally, Ethereum allows for tokenization of data meaning that both digital and real world assets can be represented by on-chain tokens for value transfer. Essentially, Bitcoin is a simple but elegant globally distributed monetary system while Ethereum is a decentralized computer with the ability to digitize value in many forms.

Ethereum's ecosystem encompasses components that facilitate its functionality and growth. Key elements like the Ethereum Virtual Machine and other recent upgrades contribute to its adaptability and scalability.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum. It acts as the decentralized computer executing scripts across the network. The EVM enables developers to run code of arbitrary complexity, ensuring consistent behavior across the network.

By providing a secure environment, the EVM ensures smart contracts do not interfere with each other. It supports multiple programming languages and is integral to Ethereum's ability to support complex decentralized systems.

Ethereum 2.0 was an upgrade aimed at improving scalability, security and sustainability. It introduced a shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus and shard chains to increase transaction throughput.

The upgrade enhanced the network's capacity, reducing congestion and fees. Transitioning to proof-of-stake lowered energy consumption and promoted a decentralized validator ecosystem. Eth2 included a series of upgrades transforming the network's infrastructure.

The upgrade, along with an additional change causing a percentage of gas to be burnt with each transaction led to Ethereum becoming deflationary. Since The Merge the total supply of ether has decreased by 160,923 ETH, around $418 million. This reduction created an inflation rate of -0.066%.

Had Ethereum kept its proof-of-work mechanism the supply would have grown by 7,903,486 ETH, equivalent to around $20.5 billion and an inflation rate of 3.2%.

Consensus mechanisms are crucial for blockchain security and operation. Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake marked a significant evolution in how the network reached agreement on transactions.

Proof-of-work requires miners to solve complex puzzles to add new blocks, consuming substantial energy. Bitcoin and the original Ethereum network used PoW.

Proof-of-stake replaces miners with validators who stake ether to participate in block validation. Validators are chosen based on the amount they stake, reducing energy consumption and aligning economic incentives with network security.

Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022 through a process known as The Merge, combining the original Mainnet with the Beacon Chain. This eliminated energy-intensive mining, reducing energy consumption by approximately 99%.

The transition improved network security and sustainability while maintaining Ethereum's core functionalities. It set the stage for future scalability upgrades within its roadmap like sharding.

Ethereum wallets allow users to interact with the network, manage ether and tokens, and access dApps. Wallets include hardware wallets like Ledger, software wallets like MetaMask, web wallets and mobile wallets.

When choosing a wallet, consider security features, ease of use, dApp compatibility, NFTs, and support for multiple tokens. Hardware wallets offer enhanced security by storing private keys offline, while software wallets provide convenience but may be more vulnerable to cyber threats.

Users should also decide between custodial wallets, where a third party holds private keys, or non-custodial wallets, providing full control over funds. Balancing security with accessibility is key.

Ethereum faces challenges such as scalability issues, where high network usage leads to congestion and increased fees. While upgrades aim to address this, full implementation is ongoing.

Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose risks, as flawed code can be exploited, leading to financial losses. Regulatory uncertainties also may impact adoption and operation in various jurisdictions.

Competition from other blockchain platforms offering similar capabilities presents a challenge, potentially drawing users and developers away from Ethereum. Most recently, Layer 2 blockchains like Base have started to gain considerable traction. As a result, the number of daily transactions on Ethereum mainnet have stagnated. This has led to Ethereum's supply to increase as less gas is burnt, causing it to become slightly inflationary once again.

Ethereum's future involves upgrades to improve scalability and usability. Post-merge developments focus on implementing shard chains, increasing transaction throughput and efficiency.

Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimistic Rollups reduce congestion by processing transactions off-chain. These enhancements aim to support a growing ecosystem of dApps.

Continued innovation in DeFi, NFTs, AI and new applications will likely expand Ethereum's influence. Its adaptability and active community position it as a leading force in blockchain technology.

Further, Ethereum's development roadmap extends beyond The Merge, outlining five key phases aimed at enhancing the network's capabilities.

As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has described, these stages include The Surge, focusing on scalability improvements through sharding and layer 2 solutions; The Scourge, addressing decentralization concerns and economic centralization risks; The Verge, aimed at simplifying block verification and improving data storage efficiency; The Purge, designed to reduce computational costs for node operators; and The Splurge, encompassing various smaller upgrades to ""fix everything else.""

These phases are part of a long-term vision to create a more scalable, secure and sustainable blockchain ecosystem. While the exact implementation timeline remains fluid, each stage represents a critical step in Ethereum's evolution, potentially reshaping the network's performance and utility in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

Ethereum is a versatile platform extending beyond digital currency to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its evolution to Proof-of-stake is seen by many as progress toward scalability, security and sustainability.

Ethereum continues to develop through upgrades and innovations and it remains foundational in driving advancements in DeFi, digital assets and blockchain applications. However, the increase of EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchains have reduced mainnet activity. Further, competition from chains like Solana raise questions as to whether it will be able to retain its dominant position in the longer term."
"Bold Ideas, Big Impact: Lisa Zarzeczny On Building Your Vision",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/09/29/bold-ideas-big-impact-lisa-zarzeczny-on-building-your-vision/,2024-09-29T10:03:20Z,"Entrepreneurs today face a rapidly changing landscape filled with both opportunities and challenges. As inflation rises, economies shift, and ecosystems evolve, the pressure to succeed can feel overwhelming. Yet amid this uncertainty, boldness and innovation remain critical to building something lasting.

One place that encourages these values is the Elevate Festival, where entrepreneurs and innovators come together to inspire one another.

Lisa Zarzeczny, cofounder and CEO of Elevate, is a testament to the power of bold ideas and the drive to turn vision into reality. Her story offers inspiration for anyone with a dream, especially entrepreneurs navigating today's challenging landscape.

Lisa's early days with Elevate were far from glamorous. With only four employees in the first year, the organization started small. But from the outset, the vision was anything but. ""We shot for the stars from the very beginning,"" Lisa recalls.

Her experience teaches an important lesson for anyone starting out: you don't need everything figured out from day one. Instead, focus on the long-term vision, and take bold steps toward it, even when the resources are limited. It's about knowing where you want to go and having the courage to move forward, even when the path isn't fully clear.

The key to turning big ideas into reality lies in ambition. ""Fortune really does favor the bold,"" Lisa says. Amid uncertainty, whether it's economic instability or the challenges unique to 2024, having the ambition to pursue large, transformative goals is crucial.

While the challenges of today's entrepreneurial landscape are real, Lisa encourages founders to trust their gut and stick to their vision. ""It's difficult to be a founder right now with inflation, the economy, and a shifting ecosystem,"" she acknowledges. But the path to success is rarely straightforward. ""You have to be patient with the process, and above all, stay bold in your vision.""

Lisa is passionate about empowering women to take on leadership roles, especially in industries where they have historically been underrepresented. ""A country and world that continues to thrive is one where women are in leadership positions,"" she explains. For Lisa, this isn't just about gender equality. It's about ensuring that the best ideas are at the table, and those often come from diverse leadership.

Her message to women entrepreneurs is clear. Lead with confidence, take risks, and pursue your boldest ideas. The journey may come with challenges, but by stepping into leadership, women are reshaping the future of innovation.

Lisa's advice to anyone with a bold idea is simple. Take the leap. ""You'll never regret trying it,"" she says. While it's easy to get stuck in fear or overthink the risks, not trying is the real regret. Whether the idea works or not, the act of pursuing it can open doors and change lives in ways you never expected.

Her experience serves as a reminder that the scariest ideas are often the ones worth pursuing. It's through embracing fear, taking risks, and learning from both successes and failures that real progress happens.

Lisa's story is not just about building a successful platform for innovation; it's about the power of dreaming big and staying bold, even when the odds are uncertain. Her boldness allowed her to attract huge impact to the stage at Elevate, securing guests like Michelle Obama. The presence of such influential figures reflects the power of vision in making a global impact.

Ultimately, the Elevate Festival is a place where entrepreneurs can come together to be inspired. It's designed to provide founders with the confidence and knowledge they need to build amazing companies. ""We want Elevate to be a place where people can come, be inspired, and leave with the tools they need to turn their bold ideas into successful businesses,"" Lisa explains.

Through the festival's talks, panels, and community-building opportunities, Elevate continues to inspire entrepreneurs to think bigger, act bolder, and make their visions a reality. Whether you're just starting out or scaling a business, Elevate is about igniting that boldness and pushing entrepreneurs to take their next big leap."
Pennsylvania leaders in both parties talk ground game as GOP seeks to undo Dem gains: 'Massive shift',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-leaders-talk-very-exciting-ground-game-gop-seeks-undo-dem-gains-a-massive-shift,2024-09-29T08:13:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Pennsylvania Republican leaders said they are optimistic about their chances to make the Keystone State the one that puts former President Donald Trump over the finish line, while a top Democrat suggested otherwise, laying out how his party is on a path to victory.

State Sen. Cris Dush, a Brookville Republican, who noted he represents seven of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, was asked about the one big blue swath in his district - Centre County, home to Penn State University.

Dush's district covers all-or-parts-of Jefferson, Elk, Cameron, Centre, Clinton, McKean and Potter counties in Pennsylvania's lush northwestern forests.

With Republican activist Scott Presler targeting Centre as part of his statewide GOP voter registration push, Dush said the prospect of flipping Centre County is ""actually getting very exciting.""

Dush noted neighboring Clinton County, home to Lock Haven, was solidly Democratic until the Trump era. ""They just went over 3-to-1 Republican.""

CRISS-CROSSING PA TO REGISTER VOTERS, SCOTT PRESLER SAYS HE'S MOVING THE NEEDLE TO FLIP KEY COUNTIES RED

""This is a massive shift that's coming in rural Pennsylvania... and part of it is that my working class, middle-age and senior constituents are seeing what's happening to their jobs and with inflation and this craziness,"" he said.

""With a man now being able to be called a woman: that kind of stuff too. They've just finally had enough.""

At a recent fair in his district, Dush said he was heckled by a young Democrat while speaking to a crowd that included many Gen-Z people. Instead of engaging, he told the crowd the reason the man was upset was that he is one of many who cannot afford to own a home, a car or other ""American Dream"" mainstays.

""And I'm getting applause from the kids,"" he remarked.

In several of Dush's redder counties, Democrats like Sen. John Fetterman performed better than most last cycle - while GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz still won the areas outright.

In that regard, Dush was asked if that was an aberration or if the areas are truly trending toward the Democrats.

""The fact that they're putting such restrictions on the development of businesses in the northern tier and western Pennsylvania: There's not a state in the United States that doesn't have a Steelers bar in it, and that's because working-class kids have become our best export. I want them back,"" he said.

Farther east, near the New Jersey border, the Lehigh Valley was once home to a booming steel industry immortalized by Billy Joel's 1981 hit ""Allentown.""

PA TOWN ROILED BY TALK OF MIGRANT HOUSING IN CIVIL-WAR-ERA ORPHANAGE BUILDING

Since then, the area has been through several years of transition after the mills and some shopping districts closed. Slowly, it has regained some footing as a warehousing hub, with its vicinity to New York and Philadelphia.

State Sen. Jarrett Coleman, R-Parkland, represents the western half of the Valley, centered around Lehigh County - where Republicans have come within a razor's edge several times of flipping the congressional seat currently held by Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa.

For many years, the seat was held by anti-Trump moderate Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., and before that, then-Rep. Pat Toomey, and before him, moderate Democrats.

Coleman said he predicts a good year for Republicans in Lehigh County, noting how neighboring Bucks County - part of which he also represents - flipped to majority-GOP registrants through the work of people like Presler.

The economy is a major issue in the district, he noted, as Fox News Digital discussed its industrial past.

""I think that's because I believe the GOP has done a better job connecting with folks over those kitchen table issues,"" Coleman said.

""The one that's kind of come up a lot lately has been homeownership,"" he said.

He noted Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed assistance for homebuyers, while at the same time floating taxation on unrealized gains.

""So on one hand, she'll help you buy the house, and of course, that will just be [via] tax dollars to help subsidize the down payment... then the administration will tax you out of [it] as the house grows in value.""

""That's not a solution. That's another example of the government creating a problem and then trying to swoop in and say they've saved the day.""

In a statement, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella added that the GOP is ""on offense in Pennsylvania.""

""The Keystone State is a deep GOP well of flippable seats and ground zero to grow our House majority,"" he said, adding several vulnerable Democrats running for re-election do not speak truthfully of their records on the border, inflation and crime.

While he believes Philadelphia and Pittsburgh will ""play well"" for Harris, Coleman said he has never seen such enthusiasm for the GOP ticket in areas like the Lehigh Valley and key mid-state areas.

""Can the rural vote come back, and can we make up for the votes of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh -- and will there be enough folks in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia who are waking up? But I think it's going to be a question of whether everywhere else can get motivated enough.""

One man who believed otherwise is Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street.

Street, a state senator and son of popular former Philadelphia Mayor John Street, suggested Democrats are the ones whose ground game has been unmatched.

""We've had over 40,000 volunteers signed up since Kamala became our nominee for president. Vice President Harris has inspired people. We've had we've had people knocking on doors, canvass launches, over 50 offices opened [in PA],"" Street said.

""People are just super excited about supporting Vice President Harris. So yeah, we're seeing lots of energy, lots of engagement, and the vice president has sort of set the world on fire,"" he quipped.

When asked about the candidates appearing to focus in recent weeks on key areas of the state, Street said Harris has been all over the Commonwealth.

When asked about both candidates frequenting Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Street noted there is a key congressional race there between Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., and Republican Rob Bresnahan.

""It's also hometown territory for Senator Casey,"" he added.

When asked about Republicans claiming they are making inroads in Centre, Bucks, Luzerne and the Lehigh Valley, Street said he has not seen such evidence.

He noted that in Centre - the Penn State county - Democrats added a second state representative in Paul Takac, and that Northampton County is now as Democratically-controlled as its bluer-counterpart, Lehigh.

However, Street said that shift may not be because there are more Democrats in those areas, but because the Republicans have departed from their longtime moderation.

He contrasted Trump-type politicians with past Republicans who have performed well statewide, like Sen. Arlen Specter and Gov. Tom Ridge.

Pennsylvanians of both stripes also largely supported moderate Democratic Govs. Ed Rendell and Robert Casey - the incumbent U.S. senator's father, he said.

""Our Republicans and Democrats statewide have never been that far apart from each other. Democrats are still pretty much where we always were,"" Street said.

Fox News Digital also reached out to the Harris campaign for an interview."
"Trump, Harris blasted for ignoring exploding budget deficit, as economists plead with both to 'get real'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-blasted-ignoring-exploding-budget-deficit-economists-plead-both-get-real,2024-09-29T08:13:48Z,"Vice President Harris discusses her tax plan with MSNBC host noting how she rarely directly answers questions.

Economists told Fox News Digital that the economic proposals former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have put forward would continue to increase the nation's already ballooning budget deficit, noting that neither candidate seems particularly concerned with fiscal responsibility.

Neither Trump nor Harris has released dedicated policy plans for addressing the nation's deficit. Trump's 16-point policy plan on his website mentions the word ""deficit"" once.

Meanwhile, Harris' economic platform does mention the deficit several times and says Harris is ""committed"" to fiscal responsibility, but only suggests increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations as a solution.

""I think the reason neither candidate is really talking about fiscal responsibility is because neither candidate is fiscally responsible,"" said Tax Foundation senior economist Erica York. ""Both have left a lot of details unspecified, so there's questions still about how Harris's spending policies would stack up. Would Trump really repeal all of the green energy tax credits? Would he really impose all of the tariffs he's promised?""

When asked what message York had for Trump and Harris when it comes to the deficit, she told them to ""get real.""

HARRIS CALLS TRUMP 'ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSERS EVER' DURING ECONOMY SPEECH IN KEY BATTLEGROUND

""We face several challenges on the fiscal policy front, from debt and deficits to the need to compete with China, to the need to encourage entrepreneurship and work, and neither of the tax policy visions being outlined right now really come close to providing an answer to those challenges,"" York said.

Meanwhile, Kimberly Clausing, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, echoed York's concerns, adding that she ""does not think there's been enough attention on the deficit this campaign season.""

""I don't know whether to blame the candidates or the American attention span,"" Clausing said. ""Candidates have an incentive to cater to what the population wants to listen to, but there doesn't seem to be a big drumbeat in favor of fiscal responsibility. And that's a big contrast from some prior elections in at least my lifetime, where that issue was much more prominent.""

So far, in fiscal year 2024, the government is running a cumulative deficit of $1.9 trillion, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center's ""Deficit Tracker.""

Revenues, meanwhile, have increased 11% through last month. The revenue increase, according to the deficit tracker, is largely the result of an increase in individual and corporate taxes, higher interest rates and a 20% decrease in individual income tax refunds. Trump's economic proposals include extending tax cuts, reducing the corporate tax rate and exempting tips, overtime pay and social security benefits from one's taxable income. Despite his plan to generate revenue through tariffs and repealing green energy tax credits, economists say it will not be enough to balance out the lost revenues from Trump's tax cuts and other economic proposals.

Research from the Tax Foundation, a tax policy nonprofit in the nation's capital, estimated that Trump's deficit impact would be roughly a $4 trillion increase over ten years.

TRUMP, HARRIS SPENDING PLANS COULD WEIGH ON THE US ECONOMY, ANALYSIS SHOWS

However, according to Heritage Foundation economist Richard Stern, it is government spending and not tax cuts that are the real culprit when it comes to the ballooning deficit.

""Though tax cuts can increase the deficit, it returns that money to the people that earned it. Deficit increases from more spending, on the other hand, means that the government is stealing even more and suppressing growth even more intensely,"" Stern said. ""Deficits created by way of tax cuts and spending increases are not the same. Tax cuts grow the economy and shrink deficits as a share of the economy, whereas more spending strangles the economy and stunts growth.""

The Biden-Harris administration's fiscal year 2024 budget proposed the highest sustained levels of spending in U.S. history, according to Republicans on the House Budget Committee. The committee also pointed out that the administration's plan to add $82.2 trillion in spending over ten years, is 18% more than the historical average of the past half century.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold. She has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

Overall, the Tax Foundation calculated that Harris would grow the deficit by roughly $1.5 trillion over ten years.

BIDEN PLEDGES $7.3B IN 'CLEAN ENERGY' SPENDING WITH NATIONAL DEBT AT $35T

Among the deleterious downstream effects of an ever-growing deficit, according to Clausing, are increased interest rates and reduced creditworthiness for the country, which can be problematic at a time when global tensions are on edge.

""If a new crisis comes along, whether it's a pandemic or a national security crisis or a big recession, which are sometimes caused by things beyond our control. You know, those kinds of crises are really difficult to respond to without fiscal space,"" Clausing said. ""If you're starting from a point where you're kind of maxing out the credit card, it's a little harder to respond to these emergencies.""

Currently, China and Japan are the United States' two largest foreign creditors.

When reached by Fox News Digital, the Harris campaign declined to comment.

The vice president was endorsed this week by more than 400 left-leaning economists and former policymakers who served under Democrats. Additionally, Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist with the New York Times, insisted this week that Harris will be able to get much closer to balancing the national budget than Trump.

When it comes to the electorate, voters have usually told pollsters they have more confidence in Trump than Harris when it comes to the economy, but reports have indicated Harris is gaining some of that ground back more recently. Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only five points in a recent Fox News poll, and just two points in an AP/NORC survey.

""Dangerously Liberal Kamala Harris' budget would add $17 trillion to the national debt by 2034 and also includes a $4.9 trillion tax hike -- the largest in history -- which would cost every American family nearly $40,000 per year, on top of the costs of record-high inflation,"" Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. ""Thanks to Kamalanomics, families are already struggling to afford gas and groceries, and President Trump will continue to highlight how Harris' budget will compound these difficulties on hardworking Americans."""
A far-right party is looking for a historic election win in Austria,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/far-right-party-looking-historic-election-win-austria,2024-09-28T19:48:16Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Austria's far-right Freedom Party could win a national election for the first time when Austria votes on Sunday, tapping into voters' anxieties about immigration, inflation, Ukraine and other concerns following recent gains for the hard right elsewhere in Europe.

Herbert Kickl, a former interior minister and longtime campaign strategist who has led the Freedom Party since 2021, wants to become Austria's new chancellor. He has used the term ""Volkskanzler,"" or chancellor of the people, which was used by the Nazis to describe Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Kickl has rejected the comparison.

CONSERVATIVE AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR TO STAY IN COALITION WITH LEFT-WING GREENS DESPITE CONTROVERSIAL VOTE

But to achieve that, he would need a coalition partner to command a majority in the lower house of parliament.

And a win isn't certain, with recent polls pointing to a close race. They have put support for the Freedom Party at 27%, with the conservative Austrian People's Party of Chancellor Karl Nehammer on 25% and the center-left Social Democrats on 21%.

Still, Kickl has achieved a turnaround since Austria's last election in 2019. In June, the Freedom Party narrowly won a nationwide vote for the first time in the European Parliament election, which also brought gains for other European far-right parties.

In the 2019 election, its support slumped to 16.2% after a scandal brought down a government in which it was the junior coalition partner. Then-vice chancellor and Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache resigned following the publication of a secretly recorded video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor.

The far right has tapped into voter frustration over high inflation, the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic. It also been able to build on worries about migration.

""You don't really feel safe in your own country anymore. But then you're being branded as right-wing just because you think about safety of your own people, the kids and women,"" Margot Sterner, 54, said at a Freedom Party campaign event this month.

In its election program, the Freedom Party calls for ""remigration of uninvited foreigners,"" and for achieving a more ""homogeneous"" nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an ""emergency law.""

Gernot Bauer, a journalist with Austrian magazine Profil who recently co-published an investigative biography of the far-right leader, said that under Kickl's leadership, the Freedom Party has moved ""even further to the right,"" as Kickl refuses to explicitly distance the party from the Identitarian Movement, a pan-European nationalist and far-right group.

Bauer describes Kickl's rhetoric as ""aggressive"" and says some of his language is deliberately provocative.

The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany.

The leader of the Social Democrats, a party that led many of Austria's post-World War II governments, has positioned himself as the polar opposite to Kickl. Andreas Babler -- who is also mayor of the town of Traiskirchen, home to the country's biggest refugee reception center -- has ruled out governing with the far right and labeled Kickl ""a threat to democracy.""

While the Freedom Party has recovered, the popularity of Nehammer's People's Party, which currently leads a coalition government with the environmentalist Greens as junior partners, has declined since 2019.

During the election campaign, Nehammer portrayed his party, which has taken a tough line on immigration in recent years, as ""the strong center"" that will guarantee stability amid multiple crises.

But it is precisely these crises, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resulting rising energy prices, that have cost the conservatives support, said Peter Filzmaier, one of Austria's leading political scientists.

Under their leadership, Austria has experienced high inflation averaging 4.2% over the past 12 months, surpassing the EU average.

The government also angered many Austrians in 2022 by becoming the first European country to introduce a coronavirus vaccine mandate, which was scrapped a few months later without ever being put into effect. And Nehammer is the third chancellor since the last election, taking office in 2021 after predecessor Sebastian Kurz -- the winner in 2019 -- quit politics amid a corruption investigation.

But the recent flooding caused by Storm Boris that hit Austria and other countries in Central Europe brought back the topic of the environment into the election debate and helped Nehammer slightly narrow the gap with the Freedom Party by presenting himself as a ""crisis manager,"" Filzmaier said.

The People's Party is the far right's only way into government.

Nehammer has repeatedly excluded joining a government led by Kickl, describing him as a ""security risk"" for the country, but hasn't ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party in and of itself, which would imply Kickl renouncing a position in government.

The likelihood of Kickl agreeing to such a deal if he wins the election is very low, Filzmaier said.

But should the People's Party finish first, then a coalition between the People's Party and the Freedom Party could happen, Filzmaier said. The most probable alternative would be a three-way alliance between the People's Party, the Social Democrats and most likely the liberal Neos."
RFK Jr mocks Kamala Harris' favorite phrase with audience call-and-response at Michigan rally,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-mocks-kamala-harris-favorite-phrase-audience-call-and-response-michigan-rally,2024-09-28T12:58:45Z,"Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. reacts to the Trump-Harris ABC News Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: ABC News)

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. involved a rally audience in a call-and-response joke at his Michigan rally this week.

Kennedy spoke at the Falk Productions manufacturing facility in Walker, Michigan on Friday -- participating in a campaign event hosted by Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump.

During the rally, Kennedy mocked Vice President Kamala Harris for her frequent references to having been born in the ""middle class"" when asked to respond to a difficult question.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""All you have to know is seven words, and you never have to admit to doing anything wrong again,"" Kennedy told the Michigan audience. ""And you know what those seven words are? 'I was born in the middle class.'""

Kennedy instructed the rally-goers to repeat after him in a series of back-and-forths.

""The next time your boss asks you why you were late for work, what are you gonna say?"" Kennedy asked.

""I was born in the middle class!"" the audience responded.

""I was born in the middle class!"" the audience responded.

""That's all you have to know and you don't have to answer any questions!"" Kennedy joked.

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance also referenced the vice president's tendency to bring up her middle class roots during a rally earlier this week.

""They ask Kamala, of course, because she's the vice president and she is the reason why we have sky-high inflation and a wide open border, 'What are you going to do? What is your specific plan to solve the inflation crisis that's making it unaffordable to buy groceries and housing?' And Kamala will say, 'Well, did you know that I grew up in a middle-class family? I had a very nice lawn back there in Berkeley, California,'"" he continued. ""It's like, 'Well, that might be true. What the hell does that have to do with lower inflation?'"""
Why the price of eggs is on the rise again,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5126581/egg-prices-bird-flu,2024-09-28T12:06:35Z,"Eggs are cleaned and disinfected in January at the Sunrise Farms processing plant in Petaluma, Calif., which had seen an outbreak of avian flu. Terry Chea/AP hide caption

The price of eggs is back on the rise, after significant bird flu outbreaks among egg-laying chickens.

Prices have risen 28.1% in the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the average price for a dozen large, grade A eggs was $3.20 in August.

More than 100 million ""wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard or hobbyist flocks"" have been infected with bird flu since January 2022, according to the CDC.

Prices have spiked in recent weeks due to a large bird flu outbreak at two Colorado chicken farms in July. That, paired with higher consumer demand, is contributing to the sticker shock many Americans may be experiencing in the aisles, experts say.

Some of the most severe outbreaks of bird flu -- highly pathogenic avian influenza, or (HPAI) -- happened in 2014 and 2022.

More than 50 million birds died in the 2014-2015 outbreak, while more than 100 million birds have died since the outbreak that started in 2022. It has become the most deadly HPAI outbreak in history.

Amy Hagerman, an associate professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, says table egg-laying chickens seem particularly susceptible to HPAI, likely because the virus can spread quickly in their close quarters.

""Table egg-layer facilities tend to be very large, and so you can lose a million or 2 million birds on a single facility, because this is a highly contagious virus,"" she says.

The most recent spike in cases happened in July, when millions of cases were reported in Colorado.

David Ortega, the chair of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, says farmers must take ""precautionary measures in the operations. And when an outbreak is acting quickly, that is really necessary ... to prevent this from spreading to nearby operations.""

The U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests a number of biosecurity measures for poultry farmers, including hand-washing, minimizing visitors at facilities, changing clothes before and after handling poultry, and closely monitoring flocks for signs of illness.

When outbreaks occur, farmers can apply for financial assistance from the USDA to repopulate their flocks.

Bird flu is the main culprit for the increasing price of eggs, though ""inflationary pressures"" are also at play, says Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board.

Higher prices for fuel, packaging, labor and feed can trickle down to the cost of the finished product -- and be passed on to consumers.

""Egg farmers are price takers, not price makers, and the volatility that we're seeing is reflecting a number of factors that are completely outside the control of the egg farmer,"" Metz says.

Plus, while the supply is impaired, demand is still high.

Metz says retail demand for eggs has been up for 18 consecutive four-week periods, even during the summer, when people typically eat fewer of them.

""I think the good news here ... is that Americans love their eggs,"" she says.

Michigan State University's Ortega says current food prices are a culmination of events over the last few years, including the bird flu outbreak, the coronavirus pandemic and international conflicts.

""So, no, that doesn't mean that prices are coming down necessarily,"" he says. ""It just means that they're not increasing as quickly.""

Hagerman of Oklahoma State says, ""I think that part of the challenge is if grocery prices still feel kind of high relative to where they were three or four years ago, then that additional increase on top of that just feels that much worse as a result.""

Bird flu is unpredictable, so it's hard to say how it may continue to affect egg prices.

However, evidence suggests surges typically happen in the spring and fall, as birds migrate. Additionally, when bird flu outbreaks happen, flocks have to be repopulated. For chickens, that can take four to five months, Ortega says.

If the outbreaks continue into the holidays, egg prices may increase, as demand is higher for baked goods, he adds.

Hagerman says restaurants may start charging more for egg dishes or change their menus, and consumers may start to substitute eggs for other proteins, such as meat and seafood.

""What we really need is for there to not be any more outbreaks in table egg layers, in order to see those prices come back down,"" she says.

Metz of the American Egg Board says there is some hope, as wholesale prices for eggs have dropped 30% in the last few weeks, which usually signifies retail prices will follow in coming weeks.

""Eggs are one of the most affordable proteins money can buy, even at these slightly elevated prices,"" she says. ""I think it's really important to emphasize that."""
'Not American': Rural and urban voters in crucial battleground state alarmed by violent political rhetoric,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rural-urban-voters-crucial-battleground-state-violent-political-rhetoric,2024-09-28T08:09:33Z,"Rural and urban Pennsylvania supporters spoke with Fox News Digital on their thoughts on 2024's intense political rhetoric and what issues are driving their vote.

During a swing through Central Pennsylvania, Fox News Digital spoke with several voters in urban and rural areas, and got their take on the effects of charged political rhetoric among other topics.

In Wakefield, the rural community just north of the Maryland line, Marsha Peterson co-owns Peterson's Grocery Outlet with her husband.

Asked about the level of political rhetoric, Peterson said the left has spent years on a drumbeat of telling Americans former President Trump ""is a danger and he must be stopped.""

""Then, you see people on social media laughing and saying they wouldn't have missed [shooting] him,"" she said. ""They want words to matter - but only the right's words.""

SHAPIRO BLASTED FOR SIGNING MISSILE ALONGSIDE ZELENSKYY IN BIDEN'S HOMETOWN

Closer to home, Peterson said the affordability crisis has been a major issue for both her and her customers.

""We run a little mom-and-pop little grocery store, and we absolutely see the difference in price increases from one administration to the next, even with COVID [considerations], things were not this high,"" she said.

Outside a large flea market off US-222, Eric Beezer said the issues at hand have driven him to run for state office in Lancaster City.

The Republican said he originally was facing off with 34-year incumbent State Rep. Mike Sturla, but noted the senior Democrat suddenly withdrew from the race in August.

He said he hopes his top issues of affordability, housing and keeping taxes low will resonate with voters in the otherwise heavily-Democratic stronghold.

""Lancaster's issues are the same as most of the country,"" Beezer said.

Sam and Kate Mylin of Willow Street, Pa. offered their take while visiting Quarryville, saying the negativity in politics has to stop.

""Especially people and politicians saying [Trump] is a threat and he needs to be taken out and stuff like that,"" said Sam, a retired artist. ""That's is wrong. That's just totally wrong. That's not American.""

Meanwhile, Kate Mylin questioned the veracity of claims inflation is going down. She noted disparities in costs as of late.

CRISS-CROSSING PA TO REGISTER VOTERS, SCOTT PRESLER SAYS HE'S 'MOVING THE NEEDLE' TO FLIP COUNTIES RED

""Gas goes down. But then your eggs are $5 for a dozen? Give me a break.""

Sam Mylin added he wants to hear the truth from politicians as to whether our troops truly are not at war.

""We have more wars right now than we ever had. And supposedly the troops aren't in a combat zone, but I see that they are. And it's all lies, man. It is. It's all lies coming from the left. And it's really dishonest itself,"" he said.

""The other thing is the affordability of housing for people is ridiculous. So something's got to change,"" he added, noting he and his wife are supporting Trump.

Tim Gochenaur and Michelle Williams of rural Christiana traveled west into East Drumore Township to visit the Solanco fairgrounds.

Both believed political rhetoric played a part in Trump being targeted twice for assassination.

""They're inciting these people,"" Gochenaur said. ""Somebody might be off a little bit to start with and that pushes them in that directions.""

Asked about electoral fairness, Williams said the tabulations will be ""as fair as they allow it to be - the system should be fair.""

""The way that the laws are put in place, it's meant for integrity. And that's a founding principle of our of our country -- for there to be an appropriate and proper vote. But if that is not carried out, then it will not be a fair election.""

On the other end of Harrisburg Pike, in the namesake capital city, a man who goes by ""Minister Fifty"" spoke out while waiting for a bus by the Hilton hotel downtown.

""Is that a rhetorical question?"" Minister Fifty responded when asked about political rhetoric inciting malign behavior.

""Common sense tells us, of course, it's having an effect - any type of unsavory communication is never going to be helpful,"" he said.

""So when we resort to things other than the issues and then we get animated in a dark way toward other people or non-issues, then things get clouded and things get deflected and then we lose sight of what the true goal is.""

""We also have an opportunity to show the world and everyone else that America is built on decency..."" Minister Fifty countered.

He added he believes the election will indeed be fair, calling the national structure ""too big to fail.""

Lisa, of Harrisburg, said she is a proud ""Black lady for Donald J. Trump,"" in her words, said that when it comes to political rhetoric, it is important to ""maintain a blessed attitude"" and remember ""the golden rule - do unto others as they would do unto you.""

""Both sides can really use just more tolerance towards the other side,"" said Lisa, who declined to appear on camera but agreed to have her comments recorded audially.

""I'm rooting for the best candidate to win,"" she said.

Pam Hower, a former Republican who was out enjoying a twilight trip along the Susquehanna River trail, said she became disaffected with the GOP over its ""crazy rhetoric"" but added there may be something to be said on that front on both sides.

She said Trump has ""hurt a lot of people"" with claims of migrants eating pets in Ohio, and - as a person with a disability - was horrified at a situation from Trump's first bid wherein he was accused of mocking a New York Times reporter who suffered from a congenital skeletal condition.

Trump, however, denied the claim, saying he didn't know of Serge Kovaleski's disability, and only effected his ""groveling"" manner in the situation he had been describing.

Hower said disability issues as well as Medicare and Medicaid solvency are key to her vote.

She added that while she has gone hunting with family members and grew up around legal firearms, she disagrees with the availability of semiautomatic rifles given the amount of school and public shootings in recent years.

""My daughter is a speech therapist in an elementary school. I'm terrified for her. And I know that that has an impact on the way she thinks going into the schools. And I don't want her to have to be afraid every day,"" she said.

""I don't have a problem with guns because I grew up with them. I have a problem with assault rifles. I have a problem with access to them,"" she said.

When asked about the housing crisis, Hower said one aspect of it is being missed by the media and the candidates. As a person with a disability, only about 5% of new housing is required to be wheelchair accessible, she said.

""So we are in a critical stage of lack of housing in this country. In Pennsylvania, it's really terrible. But across the country for people with disabilities [as well].""

""I'm hoping for Kamala. I'm doing everything I can because [Trump] scares the heck out of me,"" she said.

Rudolph of Harrisburg said virulent political rhetoric is ""typical.""

""I think each year that the antics get dirtier. And so what are we fighting for? And I really don't understand the whole process because everybody knows -- the smart people know anyway -- that the popular vote don't elect the president. It's the electoral college,"" he said.

As for some of the threats on Trump, Rudolph suggested some aspects may have been ""staged"" because the Republican is a ""good marketer.""

However, Rudolph also praised some of Trump's work in his first term:

""He made us stand up to China. And so he has some good ideas. But his rhetoric is causing division among the people. And that's not a good thing because, you know, I've got White friends. I got Black friends, I got Green friends, I mean,"" he riffed."
Markets May Start To Focus More On Trade,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/09/28/markets-may-start-to-focus-more-on-trade/,2024-09-28T07:24:05Z,"The Boston Tea Party is an early example of how a trade dispute can reshape an economy (Boston) and foment political change. It is iconic enough that the first presidency of Donald Trump was prefigured by the rise of the Tea Party as a disruptive force in Republican politics.

With the presidential election not far off now, tariffs form the spear-end of Donald Trump's economic strategy, potentially because he can implement them unilaterally (without the approval of the Senate). In addition, many of his acolytes, from Robert Lighthizer to Peter Navarro, are 'trade' obsessed, and have recently published books like 'No Trade is Free' to underline the ways in which they would re-order the international trade system.

In addition, other members of the Trump entourage such as Robert O'Brien, the National Security Adviser (2019-21) has in the July edition of Foreign Affairs Journal invoked the idea that American can bring peace to a disordered world through 'strength'. In this vision, strength comes in the form of 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and export controls, a message that has repeatedly been emphasised by Trump himself.

In that context, a second Trump presidency could begin with a trade war, and a verbal assault on the currencies of ostensible allies that have weakened in recent years, such as the yen. American consumers and potentially the bond market might pay the price of tariffs (we wrote last week that Trump wanted to fund the development of a sovereign wealth fund with revenues from tariffs).

Trade wars are generally not successful, and while Trump may have in mind America's trade spats with Japan (1987), the weight of past trade disputes going back to the Smooth Hawley Act suggest that there are better ways to guard American economic power. China could respond with measures that cripple supply chains for at least a couple of years. In this scenario, a trade confrontation between the US and China would decisively shatter the axis of globalisation as we know it, and finally render the WTO (World Trade Organisation) obsolete.

A US-China trade war might have many other consequences.

One might be the rise of populous south Asian (and southeast Asian) from India to Bangladesh to Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, with Singapore as their organising locus. Many of these countries are urbanising and rolling out infrastructure, most of them need but distrust China, and in most cases aspire to closer commercial ties to the USA. Tariffs on China by the USA will accelerate supply chain de-risking by Western multinationals towards these countries, though this could well complicate their relationship with China.

A second consideration is Europe. The EU has been caught by surprise by the consequences of several Biden administration policies - the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act - which illustrates that US international trade policy is usually made with a view to domestic politics. A second Trump presidency should be no surprise to Brussels, and there is a small but important team of officials working on a policy response to a potential trade war on Europe by Trump. Europe's trump card may lie in its role as a partner with the US against China. It will be difficult for Washington to reshape trade relations with China, Europe and potentially Japan by taking each one on. Stymieing China is better done in collaboration with Japan and Europe, and Trump should really see the constraints of the policy situation that faces him.

A second Trump presidency will be different to the first in the sense that he has had time to prepare for it, and crucially, his supporters have had four years to concoct a policy strategy ('2025' seems to have dropped out of headlines). In the same way, a Harris presidency comes with deeper reserves of policy experts, and to a large sense on the international trade and economic outlook, the Harris case represents 'more of the same' in terms of the techn0-strategic economic policy that is currently pursued by the White House.

An idealised, and though I like the idea a lot, too lofty rendition of this policy is Walter Russell's Mead's September Foreign Affairs essay entitled 'The Return of Hamiltonian Statecraft' which argues for the notion of 'enlightened patriotism'.

In this context, a Harris White House would use trade and investment policy to laser focus on America's race with China for global supremacy. Driving Chinese economic and investment activity further inwards might be one goal, and ironically anything Washington can do to make Chinese public life more closed and repressive, the better (because it curbs innovation and wealth creation).

At the same time, the US and Europe, would both pursue parallel strategies of 'strategic autonomy' or what Trump refers to as 'strategic national manufacturing' focused on sectors like defence, new computing power (quantum, AI, data storage and management), batteries and new power sources and revolutionary medicine. Europe's challenge is to find a way of reducing long-term energy costs.

Kamala Harris, who has trialled a few incoherent policies (taxes on unrealised capital gains, price controls) is likely to be more constrained in her fiscal policy - because her government is likely to instinctively focus more on tax and spending changes, for which she will need the help of the Senate (which in turn could tilt towards the Republicans). As such her fiscal policy will focus on not increasing the national debt, and like many other governments, encouraging the private sector to work with government to build out strategic technologies.

I am so far surprised that markets do not seem to price in uncertainty over trade policy, possibly because they are more focused on falling interest rates in the US, Europe and China. However, the next month will start to reveal how seriously financial markets take economic rhetoric of each of the presidential candidates."
"As Election Looms, Medicare Premiums Will 'Remain Stable' For 2025",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2024/09/27/as-election-looms-medicare-premiums-will-remain-stable-for-2025/,2024-09-27T22:20:25Z,"The Biden administration said ""average premiums, benefits, and plan choices for Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will remain stable in 2025.""

The announcement Friday afternoon from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) comes ahead of open enrollment when tens of millions of seniors will begin next month to choose or change their Medicare benefits for next year.

""Enhancements adopted in the 2025 MA and Part D Final Rule, as well as payment policy updates in the 2025 MA and Part D Rate Announcement, support this stability and increase enrollee protections and access to care for people with Medicare,"" CMS said. ""In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act is reducing prescription drug costs and delivering more comprehensive benefits than ever before, including an annual $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.""

To be sure, billions of federal dollars were spent under what has become the Biden-Harris administration's signature legislative achievement of the last four years, the Inflation Reduction Act. Seniors will get more specifics during the upcoming ""Medicare Open Enrollment, which runs from October 15 to December 7.

Next week, private health insurers that administer Medicare Advantage health plans and Medicare drug plans will unveil an array of options that seniors will be able to choose from. It remains unclear, however, until most of these plans release specifics of their offerings starting Tuesday when these insurers unveil co-payments and related cost-sharing of the products they are selling during open enrollment for 2025.

But Biden administration officials don't expect seniors to be disappointed.

""In 2025, average premiums and benefits for Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Part D prescription drug program are expected to remain stable, and Medicare enrollees will have access to a wide range of affordable Medicare coverage options,"" said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure.

Seniors are encouraged to review their many options, which a KFF analysis reported earlier this week that they don't often do.

""Medicare enrollees will have robust coverage choices in Medicare for 2025, and these options include vital enhancements to make sure that plans meet the affordability and coverage needs of people with Medicare,"" said Meena Seshamani, MD, PhD, CMS Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare. ""These improvements include capped annual out-of-pocket costs for drugs at $2,000, more complete access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment services and increased protections from predatory marketing and improper prior authorization practices."""
"How To Save $15,000 In A Year",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/how-to-save-15000-in-a-year/,2024-09-27T15:27:17Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Saving $15,000 in a year is a goal worth setting, and if you reach it, you will have saved more than the national average.

According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the national per capita disposable personal income in July 2024 was $62,245, and the personal savings rate was 2.9%. Based on this data, Americans were able to save around $1,805 per person in July.

Hitting that $15K target and progressing toward your long-term financial goals will take consistency and a solid plan. Here's how you can do it in a year.

Saving $15,000 in a year means putting away at least $1,250 a month. Before attempting to do so, take a look at your finances and subtract your monthly expenses from your take-home pay to determine whether this goal is achievable. If not, you either have to decrease your monthly expenses or increase your income.

Here are a few expert tips to help you increase your monthly disposable income, accelerate your savings rate and reach your $15,000 goal.

""The biggest tip I have to increase your savings is to automate wherever possible so that you are not relying on willpower alone,"" says Kendall Meade, certified financial planner at SoFi. If you struggle with impulse spending, set up direct deposit so that a portion of your paycheck goes directly to savings, removing the temptation to spend the money instead.

Let's say you park your savings in Ally's high-yield savings account. To automatically put away $1,000 a month, log in to the mobile app and set up recurring monthly transfers directly from your checking account. This way, you'll stay on track with your money goals without having to remember to make a transfer.

Check out our list of the best high-yield savings accounts to grow your funds and speed up your savings rate.

""Many people focus on how much they're currently saving for the future, but how you handle raises, bonuses, and unexpected income is just as important as current savings,"" says Meade.

If you use the extra income to temporarily increase your standard of living, you're not building long-term wealth and may even fall victim to lifestyle inflation.

Instead of using your bonuses, raises or tax returns to fund an extravagant vacation or buy a new wardrobe, save and invest it to achieve your $15,000 goal. ""This method can be relatively painless because if you immediately put away the unexpected income, you'll never get used to having this income to live off, which means you won't have to make budget cuts later,"" Meade adds.

Credit card interest rates are painfully high, according to Forbes Advisor's weekly credit card rates report. If you can lower your credit card interest payments each month, you'll have more money to contribute toward your $15,000 savings goal. One way to do so is by taking advantage of balance transfer cards. Balance transfer cards typically promise 0% annual percentage rate (APR) for a limited amount of time in exchange for you transferring a balance from an existing credit card.

""If you owe $10,000 on your credit cards, you'll save over $2,000 in interest just by swapping into a 0% credit card deal that lasts for 12 months,"" says Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, money coach, keynote speaker and author of ""Bounce Back: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Resilience."" ""Unless you have no other options, don't pay hefty interest rates and stay in debt longer than necessary,"" she adds.

According to Care's 2024 Cost of Care Survey, the national average cost of a nanny for one child averaged $766 per week, or approximately $3,000 a month. Even day care costs nearly $1,300 a month.

If you have kids and are trying to save money, start by finding ways to slash child care costs. Khalfani-Cox suggests you consider doing a nanny share with another family to lower your monthly expenses. ""A nanny share is when two or more families 'share' a nanny by employing the same caregiver during the same hours for their kids. This lets you split the cost of the nanny and could put $5,000 to $10,000 or more back into your budget per year,"" she explains.

And if you have a qualifying child under 13 years old and pay for child care so you can work, see if you qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Credit. You can typically claim from 20% to 35% of your child care expenses -- up to a maximum of $3,000 for one person or $6,000 for two or more dependents.

Andrea Woroch, a nationally recognized consumer finance and budgeting expert, suggests reevaluating your credit cards to see how well they're rewarding you for the purchases you're making anyway. ""Look at your year-end statement to see where you spent the most in 2023 and look for a rewards card that gives you bonus cash back for those categories. You can then put that extra cash back to work towards your savings goal,"" she says.

She believes that most consumers would earn more money back each month using a flat-rate cash-back card like the Bread Cashback American Express card that offers an unlimited 2% back on every transaction with no spending limit.

You can cut down your spending only so much before it starts to affect your quality of life. If you've already done everything you can to slash monthly expenses, consider getting a second job or starting a side hustle to bring in extra cash each month. Here are some profitable side hustle ideas to boost your income:

How long it takes to reach your $15,000 savings goal depends on various factors, including:

Say you start with $50 and contribute $600 into a savings account with a 5.00% APY compounded monthly. In this case, it'll take you around two years to reach this goal. However, if you up your monthly contribution to $2,500, it'll only take around six months to build your savings to $15,000. Use our savings goal calculator to figure out how much you'll need to put away each month to reach your savings goal within a certain time frame.

With 71.93% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck and having $2,000 or less in savings, reaching your $15,000 savings goal is worth celebrating. But once you've patted yourself on the back for your hard work, it's time to think about what you should do with the funds. Here are a few ideas to consider:

Ultimately, there's no one right way to allocate your $15,000 since it depends on your unique financial circumstances. However, Shinobu Hindert, certified financial planner and author of ""Investing Is Your Superpower,"" believes it's important to strike a balance between investing for the future and treating yourself.

""If you have had your head down and have been working hard without a lot of leisure time, don't be afraid to invest in some fun. A great solution is to split the $15,000 of savings into buckets. You can invest half of it and spend the other half. Or invest a third, spend a third and park the rest in an interest-earning account,"" she says.

If you're still unsure about what to do with the extra $15,000 in your bank account, consider working with a financial advisor to help you map out the best course of action."
Inflation Continues To Ease,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/09/27/inflation-continues-to-ease/,2024-09-27T13:22:49Z,"Stocks closed higher on Thursday as the S&P 500 set yet another new high, making the total count 42. The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6% while the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 and 0.6%, respectively. We'll see if markets can hit their 43rd new high of year following this morning's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report.

Ahead of this morning's PCE report, forecasts called for core PCE to be up 0.2% month-over-month and 2.7% year-over-year. While the annual number came in as expected, the monthly number was just 0.1%. This would seemingly suggest inflation is well under control, giving the Fed room with respect to lowering interest rates. Prior to the PCE report, the CME Fed Watch Tool was evenly split on a rate cut of 25 or 50 basis points in November. Following the economic news, those odds were unchanged.

Some individual stock performances from Thursday worth noting include Coinbase. Shares of Coinbase jumped 7% on Thursday. That company's stock is very closely correlated with bitcoin which has been flirting with $65 thousand after falling to just above $45 thousand back in August. Micron shares soared nearly 15% Thursday after the chip maker reported strong earnings. Shares of Super Micro Computer fell 12% after it was learned the server maker is being investigated for accounting fraud.

Also, Chinese stocks had another strong outing. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF gained 8% as additional stimulus measures were announced by China. This time, it was a lowering of bank reserve requirements to encourage greater lending that boosted stocks. Chinese stocks are up nearly 16% this week following massive stimulus plans. This has the feeling of the government throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at the economy. While the impact has been positive for stocks thus far, I think it's worth questioning what else the government can do if these measures fall short.

Among the stocks I'm watching today is Costco. The company beat on revenues: however, same store sales were soft, and that stock is trading lower by 1.4% in premarket. DirectTV is in talks to buy Dish. Dish is owned by EchoStar, while DirectTV is owned by AT&T. Both companies have seen their subscriber numbers fall, losing customers to competitors such as Google's YouTube TV. A merger could open opportunities for more competitive pricing and would also include Dish's Sling TV service.

Another potentially major story that hasn't been getting much coverage is a looming strike at ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The current contract under which laborers are working is set to expire Monday. If a new contract isn't reached by then, around 45 thousand workers could strike. The financial impact of a strike is estimated to cost the U.S. economy $5 billion per day according to an analyst at JPMorgan. Automakers could be among the industries particularly hard hit.

One other item of interest that I'm watching is market volatility. The VIX is sitting just below 16 at the moment. With the market making new highs, you might expect volatility to be much lower. But I think what you see happening is a lot of demand for protection in the form of option put buying. When that type of demand is prevalent, it often tends to be a contrarian indicator and bullish for stocks. It's when the demand subsides, and investors are less fearful that stocks may fall.

Following this week's PCE data, next week will be a big week of economic data with the latest employment figures scheduled for release next Friday. Then, two weeks from today, earnings season will kick off and we'll hear from, among others, JPMorgan. Therefore, we are heading into a period of heavy economic data and earnings news. I'll have more on both of those next week, but for now, it may be a good time to take inventory of existing positions and how you want to be positioned.

For today, I want to see how the market digests the PCE data. As I've mentioned, we have set 42 record highs in the S&P 500 this year and the recent strength has come despite the fact that market darling Nvidia is relatively unchanged for the quarter. In fact, as of Thursday's close 80% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading above their 50-day moving average and nearly the same number are trading above their 200-day moving average, suggesting the rally is quite broad-based. Let's see if we can continue moving higher with broad market participation. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives."
What's Happening With BUD Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/27/why-is-anheuser-busch-inbev-stock-down-10/,2024-09-27T12:08:40Z,"Anheuser-Busch InBev stock (NYSE: BUD) has barely seen a 10% rise in value since early January 2023 - rising from levels of $58 then to $63 now - vs. an increase of 50% for the S&P 500 over this period. In comparison, its peer - Diageo stock (NYSE: DEO) - has seen a 20% fall over this period. The rise in BUD stock can primarily be attributed to an 8% rise in its revenue per share, while the company's P/S ratio has remained stable at around 2.1x revenues over this period.

Notably, the performance of BUD stock with respect to the index in recent years has been quite volatile. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. But how could BUD stock possibly regain its footing and rise again? Let's delve into the company's revenue prospects to begin with.

Anheuser-Busch InBev's revenue has risen 3.7% from $57.8 billion in 2022 to $59.9 billion in the last twelve months. This can largely be attributed to a 9% fall in sales in North America, while Middle Americas, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific saw sales rise. The decline in North America can primarily be attributed to the backlash to its brief partnership with a transgender influencer to promote Bud Light beer. On the positive side, its adjusted net income margin has remained stable around 10% since 2022, aiding its earnings growth.

The company has seen some rebound in North America lately, with sales declining at a moderate pace, down 1.3% in Q2 this year, compared to around a 9% fall in the prior-year quarter. Its volumes have also trended marginally lower in the previous quarter, down 0.8% y-o-y. Although the company posted revenue growth, it fell short of the street estimates. However, the company managed to beat on earnings with better profit margins.

Looking forward, we expect the sales to rise at a mid-single-digit average annual growth rate over the next three years. With the interest rate cut cycle underway, the consumer sentiment is expected to improve in the U.S. and China. While the impact of lower rates to flow through the economy may take some time, the consumer confidence should improve going forward owing to controlled inflation. This should bode well for Anheuser-Busch InBev. Still, its stock is already trading at around 18x forward earnings, versus its average P/E ratio of 19x over the last two years, we think there is only a little room left for growth. We estimate Anheuser-Busch InBev's valuation to be $70 per share, reflecting just 10% upside from its current levels of $63.

While BUD stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Anheuser-Busch InBev peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
"Why You're Not Seeing The Doctor, But They Want To See You",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeharpaz/2024/09/27/why-youre-not-seeing-the-doctor-but-they-want-to-see-you/,2024-09-27T12:08:12Z,"When a doctor's office says the next available appointment is multiple months away, it does not mean they don't want to see you. Likewise, when the doctor makes a short cameo during an hour-long visit, they wish they could spend more time with you.

The problem is they can't afford it.

The economics of our healthcare system have created a rock and a hard place for physicians, particularly those who run private practices, as reimbursements shrink and patient demands intensify. Rather than create flexible scheduling times, they must fill each appointment in advance, pushing out the next available appointment. One reason they often can't spend more than a few minutes with each patient is because the reimbursement system has put a premium on their time. But there is more to this story.

Two divergent trends have thrown the supply and demand for our healthcare system out of balance. The overall number of physicians is shrinking as the U.S. faces a potential shortage of over 80,000 physicians by 2036, while the high-need patient population continues to grow.

To compound these issues, the largest insurer in the country - by far - has continually reduced its reimbursement rates to physicians. Medicare covers over 65 million patients, and data from the American Hospital Association showed Medicare repaid 82 cents on the dollar against hospital spending in 2022, a record-low rate. To illustrate how much that impacts the entire marketplace, Medicare covers nearly 20% of all patients. Physicians have to make the economics work by both maximizing patient visits per day and driving operational efficiencies.

Further exacerbating the challenges faced by providers is the increasing cost of operating a medical practice. Medical groups are grappling with rising expenses across various areas, including wages, supplies and utilities. A recent MGMA Stat poll found that a significant majority, 92%, of medical group leaders reported higher operating costs in 2024 compared to the previous year.

The financial pressures on medical practices are intense. To get to a more sustainable, economically viable model we need multifaceted solutions that include a reinforced pipeline of upcoming physicians, physician-friendly legislative action and helpful AI and tech solutions.

For some aspiring doctors who complete medical school, their exorbitant education debt may divert them from practicing medicine altogether, instead opting for more lucrative positions such as ones with pharmaceutical companies or consulting firms.

Bloomberg Philanthropies took on the pipeline issue with force when it made donations of $1 billion and $600 million to Johns Hopkins University and four historically Black medical schools, respectively. The gifts specifically aim to tackle medical school debt at Johns Hopkins and increase the number of practicing Black physicians, which has been shown to help balance inequities in Black and underserved communities.

To bolster the physician pipeline, it will take more than well-intentioned philanthropists, and that could come from Congress. For example, it is currently weighing a bipartisan measure to expand the number of government-funded positions for physicians in training. It would add 14,000 new residency positions over the next seven years, a number that still falls short of solving the shortage, but it is a step in the right direction.

Congress could also pass legislation, such as the Provider Reimbursement Stability Act. It would help make the profession more attractive to students while also, importantly, support existing physicians. The Act aims to increase Medicare reimbursement rates for healthcare providers to address declining payments and rising costs. Medicare payments declined 26% in real terms from 2001 to 2023. This growing gap between inflation and reimbursement rates not only jeopardizes patient access but also impacts the financial stability of providers, especially those serving vulnerable populations.

Artificial intelligence will also play a pivotal role in supporting medical practices and is already proving its value to providers by delivering measurable business benefits through increased efficiency and cost reduction. According to a report by Accenture, AI applications could save the U.S. healthcare system up to $150 billion annually by 2026. This is primarily due to AI's ability to automate administrative tasks, which can account for up to 30% of healthcare costs. By automating routine tasks, healthcare providers can streamline operations, cut overhead costs and serve more patients without increasing staff workloads. This automation can also help reduce wait times and increase the number of patients that can be seen, which in turn could boost revenue.

The factors that have led to patients seeing their doctors less are varied and complex. The decline in patient-doctor visits is a multifaceted issue rooted in decades of economic pressures on physicians. Rising education costs and increasing professional demands have strained the system. While there's no single solution for this complex $5 trillion industry challenge, a combination of strategic approaches will change the course of healthcare. A robust pipeline of physicians, supportive legislation and emerging AI solutions that drive efficiency will all contribute to solving the supply and demand dilemma."
Opinion | Black women voters' top issue shouldn't surprise anyone,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/black-women-voters-economy-harris-rcna172851,2024-09-27T10:50:19Z,"Over the past few weeks, MSNBC legal analyst Melissa Murray and I traveled across the country to explore what Black women from the cities to the suburbs are thinking about in the upcoming election. In every conversation, the economy came up as their top concern. They want to know the person they support has a plan to address their needs.

In this election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the only candidate who fits that bill.

On Wednesday, the vice president detailed her economic agenda with a speech and an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle in Pittsburgh. From a campaign perspective, she hit all the marks one would want from a candidate in appearances like these. She was personable. Though she rarely speaks publicly about caring for her mother after her cancer diagnosis, she went into details that anyone who has had to care for a loved one could identify with.

Importantly, Harris also spoke in great detail about her plans, but one didn't need to be an economist to follow the conversation. Her explanation of how her plan to provide $25,000 in down-payment assistance to first-time homeowners would serve as a path forward to build intergenerational wealth was reasonable. When she spoke of her plan to boost a tax deduction for small businesses to $50,000, she made the connection to how that helps startups get off the ground. This level of accessibility is crucial and could make a difference among undecided voters.

In Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, Melissa and I spoke with a young voter named Clarke who just finished her master's degree. She told us that out of 20 classmates, just four were able to land jobs after graduation and that many young people are at a moment when they are being crushed by inflation. Voters like Clarke understand the stakes in this election and are searching for real solutions to ease their economic pain.

Blue Bell is an affluent suburb of Philadelphia that both presidential candidates have targeted. Democrats have made gains there, netting 40,000 more votes in 2020 than they did in 2016 -- a big reason Joe Biden carried the state in the last election. This is a suburb where the margins will matter, and how Black voters and younger voters overall show up to the polls could determine not only the winner of the state, but possibly the entire election.

On the campaign trail, Harris has been building the framework to help voters like Clarke. Harris calls it her ""opportunity economy."" Notably, she doesn't just say the phrase; she explains what it means for people in their lives. Her plan is to increase financial security for all Americans, no matter their backgrounds. In her speech this week to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, Harris focused on growing America's workforce. She connected her vision to her own middle-class upbringing, effortlessly delivering her plans for practical goals that would push America into a brighter tomorrow.

While Harris laid out her economic policies, she also didn't miss an opportunity to needle her opponent. During her MSNBC interview, Harris said former President Donald Trump is ""just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. And one must be serious and have a plan, and a real plan, that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally.""

Harris and Trump have very different visions of how to run the most powerful economy in the world. Frankly, when it comes to Trump's economic vision, it isn't hard to flush out. He is, as The New York Times' Jim Tankersley puts it, using a ""hammer and bullhorn"" approach. He wants to force companies to lower prices, without a clear understanding of how the markets work, and then somehow tariff his way to economic prosperity. The small-government conservatives where I grew up in Nebraska will tell you that isn't likely to work.

Trump's economic pitch is so disconnected from reality that even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blasted Trump's tariff proposals as a price hike for American consumers.

Earlier this month, Trump was asked what he would do to tackle the high cost of child care. His response was an incoherent rant about tariffs on China -- a nonsensical answer that didn't list a single solution. He has shown to voters he doesn't understand the realities of child care in America, one of the biggest costs for families. In contrast, Harris' plan is clear and simple to understand: Expand the child tax credit.

And we all know Trump doesn't have a plan to lower costs of health care. Instead, he claims to have a concept of a plan. Dii, a North Carolina voter Melissa and I spoke with in Washington, D.C., said a plan for affordable health care will be on her mind when she casts her ballot. Voters are paying attention.

I think voters tend to give Republicans the benefit of the doubt on the economy because for years they have just claimed to be better, although they were never good at backing it up with actual policy. This November, unspecified ""concepts"" just won't cut it with Black women.

Harris and Trump aren't the only candidates on the ballot this November. Eleven states will select new governors, control of the U.S. Senate is on the line, and every member of the U.S. House of Representatives is up for re-election. For candidates up and down the ballot, strong turnout from Black women could make the difference in victory or defeat.

Black women are often spoken of as the backbone of the Democratic Party. They are definitely consistent when it comes to showing up to vote, but their vote isn't owned by one political party. It needs to be earned. And for Black women concerned about the economy, Harris has done a lot to earn it."
Harris heads to southern border looking to flip script on immigration criticisms,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-heads-southern-border-looking-flip-script-immigration-criticisms,2024-09-27T10:05:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris stops in battleground Arizona on Friday to hold a campaign event along the U.S. southern border with Mexico as the Democrat presidential nominee works to turn the issue of immigration and border security from a negative into a positive.

Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and his allies who argue she's weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel. Harris has faced intense criticism over the surge of migrants across the nation's southern border during the first three years of President Biden's administration.

The Trump campaign, on the eve of Harris' first border visit as a presidential nominee, called it a ""political ploy.""

But Harris, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, aims to show that she's better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

The vice president is expected to speak about how she is pushing what she describes as the toughest bipartisan border security plan in a generation, a measure that includes new border agents and technologies to stop fentanyl trafficking.

And she's expected to reiterate her argument that Trump ""has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.""

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

She has repeatedly pointed to a border security bill with some bipartisan support that had been making its way through Congress this year before Republicans turned against the measure after prompting from Trump.

Harris has said that the former president ""tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election"" and has pledged that ""as the president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.""

Since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket more than two months ago, Harris has described herself as a former ""border state prosecutor"" who took on international gangs and criminal organizations behind illegal drug, gun and human trafficking across the border.

The description comes as Harris and her campaign have also spotlighted a tougher stance on border security while still pushing for a pathway to citizenship for some migrants.

""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the ""border czar"" both by the media and some Republicans, although the White House has rejected that description. And the vice president has been pilloried over her role as ""Biden's border czar"" by Trump and his allies.

Trump, as he runs to win back his old job in the White House, is calling for a major crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border and has suggested using police and the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

Speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Harris was traveling to the southern border for ""political reasons.""

""When Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero,"" Trump said. ""I hope you're going to remember that on Friday. When she tells you about the border, ask her just one simple question: 'Why didn't you do it four years ago?'""

And Trump has said the policies of the Biden-Harris administration have allowed millions of people to enter the U.S. illegally.

In June, after the collapse of the bipartisan border security bill, Biden announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials say the U.S.-Mexico border is overwhelmed. Following the implementation of the new rules through executive orders, arrests for illegal border crossings have plummeted.

Polls indicate that immigration and abortion are two of the top issues on the minds of American voters, following the economy and inflation.

And public opinion surveys, including those from Fox News, indicate that by double digits Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris handling the issue.

Trump last visited the border during a stop last month in Arizona, which is one of the seven crucial battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the presidential election.

4 Known Unknowns that could scramble the presidential race,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/4-known-unknowns-could-scramble-presidential-race,2024-09-27T09:19:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""Events, dear boy, events."" That's what the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan said remain the greatest challenge facing a political campaign. Back in January 2023, I wrote that the 2024 campaign would likely hinge less on the actual campaigns than on a set of ""Known-Unknowns,"" - the economy, Ukraine, and the Middle East wind up playing out.

At the time, it seemed that President Joe Biden would be running and the GOP nominee wasn't known. Two years later, Biden has been replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump easily sailed to the nomination - but those Known-Unknowns remain, even as polls show minimal shifts in public opinion.

There are four that are likely to change voter's behavior - or not - in the coming weeks.

THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE: TEAMSTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS SUPPORT TRUMP OVER HARRIS

Will further actions by the Federal Reserve change views of the economy? The Fed just announced a 0.5% cut in interest rates, which helped cause Wall Street to achieve an all-time high, and suggested that the economy has done better than many thought just a few months ago. Polls that had recently given Trump the edge in who the voters trust more on the economy now suggest that Harris and Trump are at parity.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

Does Israel's multi-front war further deteriorate and make the Biden-Harris administration look feckless? Following the October 7th massacre of 1,200 Israelis, the Biden administration has sought to facilitate a deal to free the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza - and prevent the war from fully engulfing Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iran, which funds both Hamas and Hezbollah.

Despite multiple trips by U.S. representatives in the region, the U.S. has failed to achieve a ceasefire, nor has it been able to achieve the release of the remaining hostages. A negotiated end to the current war would possibly help Harris, but that seems highly unlikely at this late date. Conversely, if the conflict expands to a full-scale war with Hezbollah, it would give Trump an opportunity to highlight the incumbent administration's inability to control the situation.

Does the Ukraine War look to be better than a stalemate and a war of attrition with Russia? In recent weeks, Ukraine's decision - without the U.S. blessing - to invade and capture territory in Russia seems to have allowed Ukraine to appear more like the plucky successful defenders that initially pushed Russia back in 2022. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been visiting Biden and Harris at the White House.

Given that Trump has claimed that he could end the war quickly, and given that he pointedly chooses not to say that he wants Ukraine to win the war, and given that polls continue to show that most Americans support the Ukrainian war effort, any signs that the Biden-Harris administration is having an impact in helping them achieve that could redound to Harris's benefit.

Appalachian Aggression vs. Minnesota Knice™ on October 1. The conventional wisdom is that vice presidents don't matter. That's the conventional wisdom, but in three of the last six elections - 2000, 2012, and 2016 - the Vice Presidential Debate actually changed the trajectory of the election.

Republican Dick Cheney (2000) decisively won his debate against Democrat Joe Lieberman; then-vice President Joe Biden (2012) was able to arrest Obama's falls after his bad first debate; and similarly, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence was able to change Trump's polling trajectory after his bad performance in the first debate against Hillary Clinton.

This year, while GOP Candidate JD Vance seems to be polling poorly, he's proven himself highly effective in many interviews, his legal background may help him make the case against Democrat Tim Walz, and he knows how to embody the grievances that have fueled the MAGA movement.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

That said, Walz may appear folksy, but he knows how to throw a populist punch as well (How often does he mention Vance and Yale in the same sentence?). Both these Midwesterners are shrewd - and they'll be armed to try to affect the trajectory of the race.

Those are just the Four ""Known-Unknowns."" Then there's always the possibility of ""Unknown-Unknowns"" - for example a terrorist act that might bring into focus the sense of the different approaches to terrorism that Trump and Harris appear to represent. One has no idea how it - or something else - may play out.

Political analysts like to focus on the dynamics of campaigns: fundraising, digital and television ad spending, press conferences, and so-called ""Get-Out-The-Vote"" efforts. But, if one really wants to know what's going to happen in an election, it's usually worth looking outside the campaign and study what the voters are experiencing."
Can Starbucks' Pecan Crunch Oatmeal Latte Help Grow Its Stock By 2x?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/27/can-starbucks-pecan-crunch-oatmeal-latte-help-grow-its-stock-by-2x/,2024-09-27T09:02:53Z,"[Note: Starbucks' fiscal year 2024 will be ending in September]

Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is adding a new beverage The Pecan Crunch Oatmilk latte to its lineup, and it has been garnering good reviews. What makes this drink different from other seasonal favorites? This beverage boasts a pecan pie-inspired flavor, evoking the nostalgia of Thanksgiving. It aims to bridge the gap between the everyday routines of the fall season and the festive indulgences of the upcoming holiday season. This beverage has the potential to become a landmark product for the company, illustrating the impact a single, game-changing offering can have on a brand's trajectory. As exemplified by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, etc, have cultivated a devoted following and solidified the company's market position. Starbucks can also replicate this success, establishing a signature offering that resonates with consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and drives business growth.

Could Starbucks stock grow to $190 in the next few years from the roughly $95 level it is at currently? Does this sound a bit ridiculous? Consider this - Starbucks' stock was trading at around $126 per share, almost 1.3x the current value in July 2021. Below we examine a scenario where SBUX stock doubles from current levels, considering three key metrics: revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.

Overall, the performance of SBUX stock versus the index over the last 3-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and -1% in 2023. Meaning it underperformed the S&P500 index in 2021 and 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SBUX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We have revised our Starbucks' Valuation to $97 per share, based on a $3.58 expected EPS and a 27.1x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price.

Starbucks Revenues and Margins Could Strengthen In Coming Years

Starbucks' Revenues grew from $29 billion in 2021 to $36 billion in 2023 as the company's strength in digital orders helped it rebound quickly from the pandemic setback. The company saw strength in both U.S. business and growth in the International segment during this period. However, the company's sales have been taking a hit in FY 2024 so far. The company's total sales, inclusive of new stores, were down 1% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $9.1 billion in the third quarter (ended June 30), while its global comparable sales declined 3%. It should be noted that the U.S. comparable transactions were down 6%, taking the blame for a large chunk of this decline. Inflationary pressures also played a big role in the company's weak results this year.

Starbucks' net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) fell from levels of over 14% in 2021 to about 10% in 2022 amid increasing operating costs and increased promotional activities. Nevertheless, the company's net margins grew to about 11.5% in 2023 due to sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. Its Q3 net margins came in at 11.6% (down 90 basis points y-o-y), and earnings per share dropped 6% y-o-y to $0.93. The markets are likely betting that Starbucks' margins could eventually recover and then expand to historical levels as the company has its turnaround plans in order.

Why?

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain. It has nearly 39,500 stores worldwide, including over 18,000 stores in North America, and continues to open new ones rapidly. A total of 526 net new stores were opened in the company's fiscal third quarter, and the company sees plenty of opportunities for expansion in the future. The company expects to have 55,000 Starbucks locations across 100 different markets by the year 2030 - with 75% of this expansion outside the U.S. market. Almost 18% of the company's stores are located in China, making it the most important geography internationally.

The coffee business is lucrative as it lends itself to repeat purchases, which puts Starbucks in a strong position. The coffee products offered by Starbucks involve no significant technological disruptions, and the industry's slow pace of progress should help Starbucks make it through the long term. Starbucks is a company with several competitive advantages. These include its brand, a successful rewards program, a wide range of in-store experiences, and ready-to-drink beverages in stores. Starbucks reported 33.8 million 90-day active rewards members in the U.S. as of June 30, an increase of 7% y-o-y (also up 2% quarter-over-quarter from Q2 2024). Consumers are also willing to pay for the products they deem premium, based on Starbucks' high gross margin (~67%) which gives the business room to absorb higher input costs while still being profitable. Starbucks has consistently been able to raise prices throughout the inflationary environment in the U.S. - and most loyal customers still come in despite higher pricing and inflationary pressures - demonstrating the strength of its business.

Former Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol took over as Starbucks' new CEO earlier this month and has highlighted four main areas for improvement in his turnaround plan. His initial plan is to concentrate on its U.S. business. The focus is on providing the baristas with the tools they need to consistently make great drinks in a personal way. Next, he mentioned delivering high-quality food and drinks on time, every time. Third, he wants Starbucks to go back to being a community coffee house by elevating the customer experience. And finally, he wants Starbucks to go back to telling its story. The company owns its coffee farm in Costa Rica, which serves as its base for research and innovation in coffee. However, Niccol noted that the company rarely discusses it.

All said, high expectations are already banked in post-Niccol's appointment, with the SBUX stock now trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of ~26x. However, we believe that with a forward P/E ratio of 24.2x based on 2025 EPS estimates of $3.95, the stock is still trading below where it has often traded over the past few years (P/E in the range of ~high 20s).

How Does This Impact Starbucks' Valuation?

If we assume revenue growth of roughly 1.26x between 2023 and 2027 with margins growing from 11.5% in 2023 to about 21% in 2026, a roughly 2x increase, this would mean that its net income could grow from about $4.1 billion in 2023 ($3.58 per share) to about $9.5 billion (about 8.29 per share). Good times make it easier to imagine even better times - and when that happens, investors could begin to see Starbucks in a more favorable light, re-assessing the company's recovery path. For example, if Starbucks' investors assign a multiple of 23x following its stronger growth trajectory, this could translate into a stock price of about $190 per share by the end of 2027, assuming earnings of $8.29 per share.

What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won't make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, with Starbucks improving its key metrics, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. This is a huge business and Starbucks has valuable know-how in a competitive market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand - it just may not be quick and may require patience.

Of course, there are possibilities that the company could have a hard time training its huge worker base in new types of equipment or the company might misidentify the branding. Overall, it could be a bumpy ride for a while. There is certainly a case to be made for sizable long-term gains from Starbucks stock, but the Trefis High Quality Portfolio could be right up your alley if consistent outperformance is at the top of your list.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. SBUX Peers shows how Starbucks' stock compares against peers on metrics that matter. You will find other useful comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Trump-endorsed House candidate sounds alarm on China's growing influence in battleground state,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-endorsed-house-candidate-sounds-alarm-chinas-growing-influence-battleground-state,2024-09-27T08:15:54Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

China's growing influence in Michigan has brewed into a ""huge issue of concern"" for voters in the key battleground state, according to a Trump-backed House candidate sounding the alarm on ""failed Democratic"" policies in the Great Lakes State.

""This is a huge issue of concern both from national security and economic security standpoint,"" Republican House candidate to represent Michigan's Tom Barrett told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview this week. ""Here in Michigan, the Democrats are giving nearly $200 million of state tax money to a Chinese-backed, Communist Party affiliated company that's going to come to Michigan to build a battery plant. They've already purchased a bunch of rural farmland to go out and build a Chinese Communist Party-backed battery plant in Michigan, not far from a military installation where I trained for countless hours during my career in the Army.""

Barrett is an Army veteran who previously served in Michigan's state House and state Senate before launching his race to represent the 7th District in the U.S. House. Barrett earned Trump's ""complete and total endorsement"" for the House seat earlier this year, and spoke to Fox News Digital about the top issues he's highlighting from the campaign trail, including spiraling inflation, border policies, fentanyl overdose deaths, as well as China's growing influence in the state.

""While families are struggling in Michigan to make ends meet and just buy groceries, pay for their home heating costs, our state government, backed by my opponent, is sending nearly $200 million of their state tax money to a Chinese communist company just so they can come here and spy on us. This is rotten to the core,"" Barrett said.

MICHIGAN REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO SPAR WITH DEMS OVER DEAL WITH CHINESE EV COMPANY IN KEY HOUSE RACE

In 2022, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Gotion, a China-based manufacturer, would construct a $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant in a rural area of the state near Big Rapids. The announcement was met with outrage from residents, including local leaders working to reverse a water supply agreement that would have crippled the plant's construction. Gotion sued the township, Green Charter, and notched a legal victory last month when a federal judge upheld a preliminary injunction allowing construction to continue.

Barrett's competitor this cycle, Curtis Hertel, worked as Whitmer's director of legislative affairs from 2015 to 2023, before serving in the state Senate.

""My opponent signed a nondisclosure agreement to negotiate sending this money to this Chinese company while he was a member of the state Senate and then later went to work as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's chief lobbyist. He's listed in the Foreign Agents Registries Act filings with having secret conversations with this Chinese company about maneuvering through the legislature to get their funding approved,"" Barrett said of his competitor and Democrats in the state.

Hertell's campaign and Whitmer's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for contact.

Barrett pointed to remarks from former Obama administration CIA director Leon Panetta, who warned earlier this year that China would likely use the battery plant for espionage purposes.

""I don't think there's any question that they're going to take advantage of that situation,"" Panetta warned in January when asked about the plant during a House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party hearing. ""And I think we have to be very vigilant about what the hell is going on. That's just the way they operate. They'll establish a manufacturing unit, they'll establish whatever they can, and then they will use that for their own intelligence purposes. They will use that for their own economic purposes.""

Barrett said the deal is not only a national security threat, but also risks American jobs.

MICHIGAN REPUBLICAN TOM BARRETT LEAPS BACK INTO CRUCIAL HOUSE RACE AFTER SLOTKIN EXIT

""It is all in the pursuit of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's electric vehicle mandate that will systematically replace and eliminate existing manufacturing jobs in Michigan that make up the very fabric of our economy here. So we have a Chinese company threatening with national security concerns to replace American jobs in traditional manufacturing with electric vehicle mandates that are borne by the Biden administration. So this has so many problems. It's an absolutely horrible deal,"" he said.

""Michiganders are stepping up. They're aware of this. It is terribly unpopular here. And we need to take this fight to the ballot box to make sure that we don't let this go forward.""

Trump joined farmers during a panel earlier this week in another battleground state, Pennsylvania, where they discussed China's recent purchases of American farmland and again enforcing a trade deal against China that benefits American farmers.

""My first call, I'm going to call up President Xi. I'm going to say, 'You have to honor the deal you made. We made a deal. You'd buy $50 billion worth of American farm product.' And I guarantee you he will buy it. 100% he will buy it,"" Trump said Monday during a campaign event in Smithton, Pennsylvania.

Trump struck a trade deal with China in 2020 that included Beijing's commitment to halt intellectual property theft, refrain from currency manipulation, cooperate in financial services and purchase an additional $200 billion of U.S. products over two years, including up to $50 billion of U.S. agriculture.

""Second thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to say you have to give the death penalty to your fentanyl dealers who are sending fentanyl. You know, in China, they give the death penalty. They don't have a drug problem because they give the death penalty,"" Trump said.

Fentanyl and overdose deaths are again one of the top concerns for Americans this election cycle, with Trump tying the fatal drug to the influx of illegal immigrants who have poured over the southern border under the Biden-Harris administration.

Barrett said his area and district are among the communities across the nation that have been rocked by the influx of the synthetic opioid from across the border.

TRUMP AND VANCE TO HOLD FIRST RALLY IN MICHIGAN

""Every single community in America, in every town, not just in the district where I'm running, but every town in America has been touched and affected and devastated by the outcomes of illegal immigration and lax border policies that have flooded every community with fentanyl. And now the leading cause of death of Americans my age is fentanyl overdose. It's a crippling and devastating tragedy. And we have to fix the problem,"" he said.

""We have to secure our border with more structures. We have to reinstate the remain in Mexico policy. We can't allow the exploitation of asylum claims to overwhelm our social welfare system, to overwhelm our border security. We need to put Border Patrol agents on the border instead of processing asylum claims all day as they're doing right now. And we need to get back to two policies that deter illegal border crossing,"" he continued.

Barrett is an Army veteran who signed his contract over the Christmas break of his senior year in high school. He spent 22 years in the Army, serving in the Iraq War, Guantanamo Bay, Kuwait, and at the DMZ separating North and South Korea.

Barrett pointed to his military career amid his calls to secure the border.

EARLY VOTING BEGINS IN ILLINOIS, NORTH DAKOTA, FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN

""I spent a year of my life deployed during Operation Enduring Freedom to Guantanomo Bay, Cuba, where there were terrorists that we were securing in that facility. And they told us straight to our face, that they wanted to come to America and kill Americans. I believe them. We need to keep them out of our country. We've had hundreds on the terror watch list that we already know have crossed into this country just during this administration. We need to remove them and we need to make sure that we don't allow any further terrorists into our country,"" he said.

Barrett is in the lead in his race against Hertell, but underscored he's not taking anything for granted while

""I think President Trump is very well poised to win Michigan. We know this is going to be a very close race and absolutely nothing we can take for granted. The seventh Congressional District in Michigan, where I'm running, is also highly competitive. And we also have a very competitive United States Senate race in Michigan,"" he said.

And we can go down the same failed path we've been on already with the high cost of living and groceries that are unaffordable for families, and mortgage rates that don't allow a young couple to begin their own family. Or we can turn the corner. Secure our border. Get our costs of living under control, get crime under control, put our foreign adversaries back in check where they belong, and really forge a new path for America."""
Gold Boom At Risk From Reliance On Derivatives And Weak Fundamentals,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/09/26/gold-boom-at-risk-from-reliance-on-derivatives-and-weak-fundamentals/,2024-09-27T02:33:54Z,"Doubts about the strength and longevity of the gold boom, because it appears to a financial markets event based on trading in derivatives, have been raised by one of the gold industries best placed observers, Ross Norman.

Chief executive of Metals Daily, a London-based website and gold trading forum, Norman has a history of asking provocative questions about the metal in which he specialises.

Earlier this year he was first to identify heavy-duty Chinese private sector buying as a gold-price driver, with individual traders picking up where their government left off.

Norman's latest assessment is that ""this is a most peculiar bull run, and even harder to explain,"" he wrote on his website.

The early rush by Chinese investors into gold started with physical buying and then shifted to speculative trading in over-the-counter forwards, future, and options.

""And they bought in massive size, confident that they were swimming with the tide,"" he wrote.

The view of the traders was that they would win when interest rates started falling or they crashed the U.S. economy ""so it was a question of when not if"".

""The idea that the market is derivatives led makes sense in many ways, why else would gold rally to an all-time high just as inflation falls and quickly, the dollar gains, treasury yields gain, all normal surefire leading indicators of the opposite.

""And that's the thing about a derivatives position, it can be largely agnostic (doubting) of market signals.""

Other signs about the gold market being driven by derivative trading is an end to a rally in India which followed a reduction in import duties, the absence of traditional buyers, Middle East gold buyers opting for reduced quality jewelry and reports from Chinese jewellers of a significant decline in trade.

""In the U.S. and Europe it is worse,"" Norman wrote.

""Physical (gold) dealers in Germany, often second only to China in size on gold coins and bars, has been worryingly thin"".

The speculative phase led by China has more recently been joined by U.S. traders with futures long positions at a near four-year high creating a market which is largely unswayed by normal drivers.

Norman is not forecasting a quick end to the boom which has seen gold rise by 45% over the past 12-months to its latest price of $2667 an ounce.

""Derivatives by their nature often have a long leg towards expiry and as such, no immediate price correction is in prospect,"" he wrote.

""That's a long way around saying that even though I don't believe this rally, I would certainly not short it.

""Gold will almost certainly go higher and I would not be surprised to see $3000/oz this side of Christmas.""

Next year, however, could be a different story and if a gold-price correction takes hold Norman will be able to say he was first to ring a warning bell."
Nation-State Game Theory: Bitcoin And Statecraft Meld Together,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/26/nation-state-game-theory-bitcoin-and-statecraft-meld-together/,2024-09-27T00:23:24Z,"As Bitcoin matures into an institutional force, the next plank is nation-state adoption. As nations jostle between one another in an increasingly polarized world, good writing on the topic of Bitcoin and statecraft can help inform the lines here. A new book, National Security In The Digital Age, serves that purpose. With individual chapters written by various experts on the bleeding edge of statecraft and Bitcoin, different elements are examined in a book perfect for legislators and policymakers to consider the unique advantages of Bitcoin.

Most writers refer to the dominant position the United States has had overseeing the US dollar system and its consequences. Since 1973, when President Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard, global demand for fiat-driven US dollars and US debt has been the cornerstone of the world economy. This has led to unanticipated consequences, however, perhaps the most significant being the migration outwards of the manufacturing base of the United States to a more globally distributed economy - with the chief beneficiary being China, which now has the capacity to manufacture military goods like ships at a very rapid pace and become a near-peer that can challenge US military supremacy. China and Russia are now working together in many ways, with China providing CBDC and M-Bridge coverage to create a hedge against US dollar sanctions, while Russia provides kinetic cover with primate military companies in Africa.

However, the world is pulling away from that system because of sanctions on Russia and other factors. The US dollar share of foreign reserves is at a low unseen for a few decades. Can Tether and US-dollar stablecoins provide some amount of cover as bottoms-up demand for the US dollar (eurodollar system) blossoms, as Matthew Pines brings up? Does Bitcoin play a role in wrestling away Middle Eastern countries from China, as Robert Malka wonders? What will happen in Africa, an emerging energy superpower documented by Ben Kincaid?

While the first chapter focuses on the Great Power Conflict, namely how China has bent the US monetary system to its advantage, the second focuses on Africa and the ""African village"" and the roots of bottoms-up adoption of Bitcoin vs. central bank digital currencies like the e-Naira. Fedimint offers a view of leveraging the democratic concepts of the ""African village"" through groups of peers transacting with one another in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin mining can accelerate the escalating growth of energy across the continent (seen, for example, through projects like Gridless). This global conflict comes to the Middle East as the energy superpowers of the 20th century aim to welcome new technologies like Bitcoin while maintaining political control. China's export of technical standards for the mobile Internet, central bank digital currencies, and digital authoritarianism worldwide are cited in detail.

But the United States still has a dollar advantage, and the book argues through the use of many experts - with the shift to electricity being the dominant force, it can employ Bitcoin mining, a renewed look at nuclear power, and the right policy towards grid management to create an alternative. The ability to leverage freedomtech like Bitcoin just as the United States embraced neutral cryptography, email and Internet standards (eventually) could serve national security interests.

The most interesting thread is how Bitcoin and adjacent technology like Nostr have pools of bottoms-up demand resistant to top-down force from those looking to hedge against CBDCs to merchants looking for lower transaction fees. As China's Bitcoin mining ban fails to dent Bitcoin's effect, which is detailed in an entire chapter, it's clear this discussion is ongoing.

The book seems intended for policymakers mostly - it weaves sophisticated arguments about geopolitics into an accessible introduction to the energy dynamics of Bitcoin mining with very specific examples of how it works with ERCOT, the Texas grid, and how it can stabilize the grid with expert advice from Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot. An entire chapter is devoted to ""illicit finance"" and the tradeoffs between Bitcoin existing with the traditional financial world and a place where nation-states move money for nefarious reasons contrary to American interests, as well as the anonymity of cash versus the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin.

The beginning of the book dives deeply into the geopolitics of Bitcoin - the middle is more technical and is meant to explain different facets of Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, and the Lightning Network to people, along with various use cases such as creating and stabilizing energy grids. Towards the latter end, we see the real power of Bitcoin - creating a neutral platform that can redress the lack of trust after generations of racial bias (per Ian Gaines), a lower transaction cost for remittances, and navigating healthcare, inflation, and corrupt officials in Africa.

The book makes it clear throughout that it's about Bitcoin, not ""crypto."" This comes out in the very first page of the foreword by Dr. Julia Nesheiwat. Its detailed explanation of proof-of-work versus the proof-of-stake model favored by Ethereum, how the Lightning Network works, and how it can be interpreted policy-wise. It stands in stark contrast to the instinct of many policymakers to conflate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency together.

This book dives deep into Bitcoin, geopolitics, technology, and the stakes at the heart of the 21st century: who determines innovation and who will benefit as we shift from an oil-driven age to a new electricity and computing age. Those who want to live at the edge of the intersection between Bitcoin and geopolitics are well-suited to join with a reference like National Security in The Digital Age."
Are Those Guaranteed Cash Offers A Scam?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amandalauren/2024/09/26/are-those-guaranteed-cash-offers-a-scam/,2024-09-26T21:21:50Z,"Perhaps you've seen those signs on the side of the road that read ""Cash For Distressed Homes"" and wondered if it was a scam. Or maybe you've seen billboards from legitimate brokers/investors like Kris Lindahl or even his Super Bowl ad and wondered if this was a real thing.

Can you just sell your house for cash quickly? The answer is surprisingly yes. And while this method of selling a home might not be for everyone, it is definitely for a specific segment of the market. It's also making brokers like Lindahl incredibly successful. Here's what you need to know about selling your home for fast cash.

No matter what market you're in, selling your home isn't like selling anything else. It's a major process. You need to find a broker to list it, potentially stage it, and then leave your house during showings -- all while you probably still live there and are searching for a new place to live. If the house is in particularly bad shape, it may even need renovations. Then, there's the contract and negotiation part. So, what if you could just fast-forward to depositing a check and moving on with your life? That's exactly what Minnesota-based mega broker Lindahl does.

""With the uncertainty in the economy around inflation, jobs, housing, student loans, and so much more, we are seeing that homeowners want to trade in their house to guarantee that it's sold so they can secure housing in the next chapter of their life,"" he tells me.

Lindahl offers cash to anyone willing to sell quickly. Sometimes he keeps the properties and other times he renovates them. His approach, however, is a bit different from most brokers. While it's certainly unorthodox, it makes him more approachable and simplifies the process, which can often be complicated and frustrating.

""Trading in your house is an easy concept to understand because everyone knows how to trade in their car and the benefits. It's the homeowner's choice of the direction. Once homeowners understand they have to do nothing to their house to trade it in and they can move stress-free, that's when the lightbulb goes off,"" he explains. ""Most homeowners don't want to gamble and take the risk on the traditional open market, especially in an economy like this. Getting a house ready for the open market is costly, time-consuming, and full of risk if they don't get it right.""

Selling a home for cash can be a better strategy for certain segments of the population such as those downsizing, moving into assisted living, or selling an aging relative's home. Cash buyers may also be necessary for homes that are in an extreme level of distress.

But there are other reasons why some sellers want to get out of their homes as fast as possible such as a pending divorce. This also means their neighbors won't see a ""For Sale"" outside their homes. ""The average home is currently on the market for around 45 to 50 days. That number is going up. In the open market, homeowners have to wait for showings to happen and hope the market doesn't change while they are listed, or that another house comes on the market for less and impacts their price. There are so many risks to the open market with rising days on the market."" According to Lindahl, he can close in as little as three days.

This has also changed how the broker does business. ""The program really started booming four or five years ago as more and more people wanted convenience in every area of their life. Most people sell their house around a life-changing event, and usually, that means they want to sell fast and have confidence it will close. The open market has a bunch of speed bumps (inspections, buyers' financing, macro condition changes) that the Guaranteed Cash Offer doesn't have.""

So, could this be a smart alternative to the traditional listing process? Lindahl has certainly convinced people it is. In the past three years, he's closed over 8000 properties, which is a huge volume for a broker in any market.

Lindahl tells me other companies have tried to copy his strategies, but they've not been as successful, at least in his segment of the market. ""We are able to execute because of the high level of trust homeowners have for our brand and the billions of dollars in real estate transactions we have closed.""

Selling your house for quick cash has also even become popular in warmer and more expensive areas like Southern California, on the outskirts of Los Angles including Riverside and San Bernardino counties, according to Sean Kershaw of SJO Investments. ""The thought behind this from a business standpoint is to acquire a property to renovate and list the property on the market so a family can purchase or rent this property creating a ROI or cash flow. Again these transactions are typically for potential sellers who have a need to sell but lack the resources or the house lacks the qualifications to sell on the market.""

However, most sellers in higher markets like Los Angeles proper, where the median sold home price is $1 million, according to Realtor.com, would rather go through the traditional listing process, even if the house is a bit of a fixer upper. ""We're not seeing a ton of investors buying single-family homes because I think LA is just too expensive of a market,"" broker Lori Levine Harris of Brock & Lori tells me.

However, she says there is no shortage of cash buyers, especially for the prime properties she sells in trendy neighborhoods such as Los Feliz and Silver Lake. ""What we are seeing is parents buying houses for their kids, all cash. A lot of them."""
"Millionaire Investors Prefer Harris To Trump, UBS Poll Says",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/26/millionaire-investors-prefer-harris-to-trump-ubs-poll-says/,2024-09-26T19:45:27Z,"A majority of high net worth Americans favor Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump in November's election, according to a new survey, as the pair spar over the U.S. economy while it navigates a potential inflection point.

A similar poll of business owners from UBS released Thursday revealed a far more pro-Trump tilt, with 53% favoring the Republican candidate to Harris' 47%. About two-thirds of respondents said they were highly concerned about business tax rates increasing, the top worry spot identified in the survey of 500 business owners overseeing annual revenues of more than $1 million. The business owners preferred Trump on the economy at a 55% to 45% margin and on taxes at a 54% to 46% margin.

The millionaire group viewed healthcare, technology and sustainability-focused stocks as the most attractive sectors if Harris wins, and defense, energy and industrials as the most attractive sectors if Trump wins. Strategists have said tech stocks may be better suited under Harris due to Trump's hawkish trade stance with China and some big American tech companies' outsized reliance on Chinese business, while Trump's promise to lower regulatory obstacles are seen as a boon for regulation-heavy industries like energy.

Running a campaign largely targeting the U.S.' middle class, Harris backs several policies designed to rail against the country's wealthiest citizens, including a controversial tax on unrealized capital gains for individuals worth at least $100 million, which would consider stock market gains on already held stocks taxable income. Both Harris and Trump have courted business owners, with Harris floating a tenfold increase to the startup tax break and Trump proposing a major cut to the corporate tax rate for companies that produce products domestically. Polling of the broaderU.S. population mostly suggests a slight preference for Trump to oversee the economy. Though stock indexes continue to set new highs and economic growth remains robust, many Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the economy, with inflation at the core of the malcontent as price jumps raged to a four-decade high during the Biden administration."
Why We Believe Gold Stocks Are The Hidden Opportunity In 2024's Bull Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/26/why-we-believe-gold-stocks-are-the-hidden-opportunity-in-2024s-bull-market/,2024-09-26T19:42:02Z,"On Tuesday, gold hit a new all-time high of $2,670 an ounce, continuing a remarkable rally that's seen the precious metal gain over 27% since the start of the year. If 2024 ended today, it would mark the best year for gold since 2010, when the asset finished up nearly 30%.

Despite the momentum, many investors still aren't paying attention to what I consider to be one of the most obvious opportunities in the market today: gold stocks.

Some investors might be hesitant to buy into gold at these prices, but I believe there are several factors that suggest the rally still has room to run. Central banks around the world are entering a new phase of monetary easing, and investors -- Western retail investors in particular -- are finally starting to recognize gold's value as a hedge against inflation and global uncertainty.

The real opportunity may not be in physical gold itself or the ETFs tracking it, though; instead, I believe it's in the deeply undervalued gold mining stocks that have yet to catch up to the price of bullion.

At the heart of this gold rally is the Federal Reserve's recent policy shift. The Fed made a decisive 50-basis-point (bp) rate cut last week, lowering the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset like gold.

And this could be just the beginning. Analysts and market watchers expect another 50bps of easing this year, followed by an additional 100bps in 2025. This aggressive easing cycle should further increase the appeal of gold as a store of value.

The reason for this is that, when interest rates are low, investors have historically tended to move away from traditional fixed-income assets like bonds, which offer lower returns. As a result, they've looked for alternative investments, and gold has long been one of the most popular hedges against inflation and financial instability.

It's not just investors driving gold's rise. Central banks are playing a massive role. In recent years, these institutions have significantly increased their gold reserves, and their buying spree shows no signs of slowing down. Central bank purchases now account for about a quarter of total global gold demand, which is double what it was before 2022. Gold-buying reached a new record high of 483 tonnes in the first half of the year, a 5% increase over the same period in 2023, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).

Despite this backdrop, many Western retail investors have been slow to embrace gold this cycles. According to a recent Bank of America study, 71% of U.S. financial advisors have little to no gold allocation, often representing less than 1% of their portfolios.

However, that narrative is changing. With the Fed's rate cuts finally materializing, investors are starting to return to gold-backed ETFs once again. The WGC reported positive fund flows into North American gold bullion ETFs during July and August, with European products seeing similar momentum since May. For the first time since 2022, the 50-day moving average for gold holdings has crossed above its 200-day moving average, a bullish signal known as the ""golden cross."" This is a sign that the gold rally could be starting to gain serious traction among investors.

While the spotlight has been on gold prices and ETFs, gold mining stocks remain highly undervalued by comparison. Over the past couple of years, shares of gold mining companies have underperformed relative to gold itself, primarily due to rising costs and a general lack of interest. In 2022 and 2023, a sharp rise in the all-in sustaining cost (AISC), a measure of the cost to produce one ounce of gold, weighed heavily on mining stocks, which in turn led to many investors losing confidence in the sector.

But here's the thing: The underperformance of gold mining stocks relative to the underlying metal has created what I consider to be an incredible opportunity. Right now, these stocks are trading at levels that don't reflect the continued rise in gold prices. And since gold mining stocks have typically moved out of lockstep with the broader market, they offer a level of diversification that I believe can help hedge portfolios against market downturns.

It's not just me saying this. Some of the most well-known contrarian investors are taking note. Stanley Druckenmiller, for example, made headlines when he sold off big tech stocks like Alphabet and Amazon in late 2023 and started buying into gold miners like Newmont and Barrick."
The Fed Cut Rates By 50 Basis Points: How Much Will Home Affordability Improve?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/real-estate/fed-cut-rates-home-affordability/,2024-09-26T17:59:14Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

After two and a half years of interest rate hikes and pauses aimed at curbing inflation, the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark federal funds rate by 50 basis points during its September policy meeting -- the first cut in over four years. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Fixed mortgage rates are indirectly tied to the Fed's rate, so when the Fed began hiking its rate in March 2022, mortgage rates surged, although rates have gradually eased since peaking in October 2023.

One big question is whether this initial jumbo-sized Fed rate cut and future cuts will enable buyers hampered by affordability obstacles to get on a pathway to homeownership.

Although the Fed's decision to chop a half-point off its key policy rate was a welcome move, experts say would-be buyers will unlikely see meaningful signs of affordability soon.

""The challenging thing for mortgage rates is that we've likely already seen a lot of that move be priced in,"" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, tells Forbes Advisor.

Nonetheless, Hale notes that rates have nosedived by more than 1.5% since their peak nearly a year ago, significantly boosting home buyers' purchasing power.

For instance, buyers can now purchase a house similar in price to when mortgage rates were higher, but they'll see around $300 monthly payment savings, according to Realtor.com analysis. Alternatively, Hale says buyers can use the roughly $70,000 in additional purchasing power the lower rates afford to buy a more expensive home.

Although the Fed signaled more rate cuts are in store, experts typically caution against banking on continuous mortgage rate decreases, deeming this a risky home-buying strategy.

""If you find a house at the right price, it's always the right time to buy,"" Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage, tells Forbes Advisor.

Cohn also warns against holding out for lower mortgage rates as a surge of returning buyers could drive home prices higher.

""Is that extra one percent of mortgage rate, let's call it for a year, going to be more or less than the increased price of the house in a year?"" Cohn says.

Hale says another good reason for buyers to make a move now is the ""strong likelihood"" that the market has already priced in the remainder of 2024's projected rate cuts.

Hale also notes that house-hunting competition tends to dip in the fall, giving buyers more bargaining power when negotiating with sellers.

If you can't hop on the home-buying train just yet, Hale and Cohn offer practical tips to help you score the best rate and home price when you're ready to take the leap.

For instance, if you qualify for an FHA 203(k) loan, consider buying a fixer-upper in your price range that needs repairs or updates rather than a more expensive home.

Here are 11 expert home-buying hacks:

Now that rates are well below their peak, should homeowners refinance now or wait for rates to decline further?

""If you bought your home at the peak and your rate was at 8%, 6% looks pretty darn good today,"" Cohn says.

Nonetheless, Hale says it can sometimes be challenging for homeowners to determine the best circumstances to refinance.

""Whether they should refinance now or wait is really going to depend on their risk tolerance for potentially realizing additional savings versus locking in the savings and starting to benefit from that additional cash flow now."" Hale says.

Still, Hale advises those considering refinancing to review their time horizon and weigh the expenses against potential savings. Remember, refinancing isn't free. As with a purchase loan, the process comes with fees and closing costs.

For instance, if you plan to move in a couple of years, Hale says refinancing may not be worthwhile since the savings might not add up. However, you could reap the benefits if you plan to stay longer.

""Fortunately there are tons of refinance calculators that can help you run the math and figure out whether it makes sense for you,"" Hale says."
The Fed's Rate Cut:  A 'Soft Landing' - Or 'Fake News'?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2024/09/26/the-feds-rate-cut--a-soft-landing--or-fake-news/,2024-09-26T17:53:47Z,"On September 18, at precisely 2:00 pm, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve announced a reduction of 50 basis points (½ of 1%) in the Fed Funds target rate.

It was the first rate cut in 4 ½ years, finally reversing the most aggressive interest rate increase program in decades.

50 bps was said to be ""emphatic."" The Financial Times called it a ""jumbo cut."" The Wall Street Journal headlined ""Fed Goes Big.""

Chairman Powell called it ""an appropriate recalibration"" - and repeated that phrase nine times.

The announcement set the stock market ringing like a bell.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 300 points in the first 60 seconds after Powell began to speak. Then it fell back 300 points. Then it was up 200. And then down 280. Up again, and then down 400. In 2 hours, the supposedly staid Dow racked up almost 2500 points in round trip mileage - trillions of dollars of value sloshing around in the gold-plated bathtub known as the U.S. stock market.

The next day, turmoil gave way to relief. The market surged to a new record. ""A furious rally"" swept global markets. European stocks had their best day in a month. Japan's Nikkei average was up 2%. The announcement pushed all the other big stories of the day - the Presidential race, Gaza, Ukraine - to the sidelines.

A Chick-Fil-A sign in northeast Washington DC alerted customers to the big news: ""50 points."" A strange message from a fast food outlet. Was an update on monetary policy somehow more important than the price of a chicken sandwich? Or maybe it was a clever prompt - Come on in, let's celebrate!

Big, bold, jumbo, emphatic, furious, all that - however, this move was no surprise. It would be hard to even call it ""news."" Chairman Powell all but pre-announced the rate cut 27 days prior to the event - ""the time has come for policy to adjust"" - in his Jackson Hole address. The timing was known. The direction was known. The markets had ample opportunity to price it in. A believer in efficient markets would have said that very little new information was introduced on Wednesday.

(True, the exact size of the rate cut was not known. 25 basis points? or 50? It had become the focus of intense speculation. But does this small difference really matter? Not everyone thinks so. I'll come back to it below.)

The ragged price discovery path on Sept 18 exposed the clash of two opposing ""investment theses,"" battling it out in the market.

On the one hand, monetary easing usually bodes well for the stock market. Since 1974, on occasions where the Fed initiated a rate cutting cycle, the market has been up eight out of ten times the following year.

On the other hand, the last three rate cutting episodes have been less fortunate for investors. In those cases, the cut was followed by an economic downturn. If the economy today really needs a stimulus, maybe it means there's trouble ahead. According to Torsten Sløk of Apollo, the rates markets are already pricing in a recession. The Wall Street Journal was spooked in particular by the size of the reduction.

Still, on Thursday morning the Dow opened up 450 points, and maintained this level for several days now. The optimists' view has prevailed, for now.

But is this optimism justified? In all this sound and fury, what is the real news here? There are several layers of misinterpretation that have to be stripped away to get at the true significance of this event.

An adjustment of the Fed Funds Rate can be interpreted in two ways:

Some assume that lowering the Federal Funds Rate will have a direct positive effect on the economy, reducing the cost of credit, stimulating demand and spending, influencing banks' lending, even boosting the labor market and creating new jobs. But is this likely?

It is not clear.

First of all, what is the Fed Funds Rate (FFR), exactly? The way it's talked and written about, one might think the Fed is immediately mandating lower interest rates across the economy. But no - the FFR applies only to the interest rate target for overnight loans of a very specific type, involving transactions between banks.

The FFR comes into play when a bank finds itself with more cash on account with the Fed (its reserves) than it really needs - or not enough. If Bank A is short and wants to top off its reserves, it can borrow from Bank B which has a surplus - and Bank B can earn some interest. The actual FFR (different from the target FFR) is the interest rate that Banks A and B freely negotiate for this transaction. It is determined by the banks, not by the Fed.

That's a key point. The Fed doesn't actually set the rate; it only defines a target. Whether the FFR target has any effect on the credit markets depends on whether the banks go along.

The Fed is merely an ""influencer"" - albeit a powerful one, with various carrots and sticks to deploy for encouraging the private sector to play along.

[Note: The mechanisms for controlling the market's response to the FFR and reserve levels are quite complicated, involving other interest rates which the Fed can set and are not simply targets. Still, the system is not fully deterministic, and depends substantially on market responses from private sector participants (banks).]

So what is the effect of the Fed dropping the target by ½ of 1%? As noted, that ultimately depends on what the banks do, driven by market conditions and the real demand for credit. Actual market rates for interbank credit transactions that impact the economy are often significantly higher than the FFR target. The interbank offered rate - which was for decades the chief measure of the cost of credit in the market - is almost always higher than the FFR (partly due to the longer term, of course, but also partly due to the difference between ""market reality"" and ""policy goals"").

The shifts in the market rate also tend to lag the reversals in the central bank policy by several quarters.

It is hard to make the case that shaving a few basis points off the target for an overnight funding benchmark that only applies to banks lending to each other (not to consumers or businesses) would per se have an immediate impact on the real economy. The causal link is too attenuated, and the size of the adjustment is too small, to move the needle in a $100 Trillion credit market. For comparison, consider that the interest rate on 30-year home mortgages has fallen by over 100 basis points since May, and home sales have continued to decline, dropping by 12% in that period. Cheaper credit does not necessarily spur more borrowing.

But it is assumed - typically without question - that the reduction in the FFR will at least lead to a lowering of other interest rates. In fact, the rates (yields) on Treasurys actually rose after the announcement of the Fed Rate cut, as The Wall Street Journal reported:

Treasury Yields arguably influence credit markets much more than the FFR.

Over time, trends in short term rates like the FFR and in longer-term rates like 10-year Treasury yields do tend to align, but the relationship is quite noisy. It is neither automatic nor necessarily immediate. This suggests that the causal connection is not as solid as is usually supposed.

Fed rate policy is better understood as a messaging program. The FFR is a crucial signal. But what is it signaling?

The view of many economists and financial market analysts is that the current rate cut, relatively insignificant in itself, predicts the future trend in rate cuts which will eventually cumulate to produce a more substantial impact.

Some observers, including some at the Fed itself, now forecast rates reaching 3% by the end of 2026. The Federal Open Market Committee's dot plots project another ~200 bps reduction over the next two years. (Of course it must be acknowledged that the Fed is ""terrible at predicting what it will do."")

It is an article of faith that a changes in the FFR impact credit costs across the economy. This affects the real economy in certain ways. Changes in the growth rate of consumer loans are inversely correlated with the FFR after a lag of about 6 months - meaning lower rates will stimulate borrowing. But more fundamental measures of economic health - GDP growth, consumer spending, job creation - do not show the same pattern.

For those unfamiliar with the meaning of correlation statistics, all of these readings signal a very weak association, if any. Correlation doesn't prove causality, but lack of correlation is strong evidence for the absence of causality.

The lack of correlation with jobs growth is particularly striking, since Fed officials have explicitly tied the rate-change decision to the health of the labor market. Yet the FFR apparently has had no measurable effect on job creation over the last decade.

The FFR appears to be ineffectual with respect to impacting many measures of real economic performance in the following 1-2 years.

So, was the Fed's announcement, or the media's headline interpretation of it, ""fake news""?

Much of the coverage is misleading at least. The reduction in interest rates will not cure whatever ails the labor markets. Based on past experience, it will not directly spur job creation or economic growth, either immediately or over the next couple years.

The real message of this maneuver is quite different. It is has to do with public psychology, and public trust, which Jerome Powell as has said ""is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset.""

The Federal Reserve is a faith-based institution. Its effectiveness rests on the public confidence.

The surge of inflation in 2021-2022 (which trailed through the year-over-year statistics well into 2023) damaged the Fed's credibility enormously. In December 2022, the Washington Post wrote in a lead editorial:

This is strong language. But the danger is real. Confidence in the Fed touched an all-time low in 2023, and is up only slightly in 2024. The Fed's ""most important asset"" has been dangerously impaired.

The rate cut was really about repairing the Fed's credibility. ""Going big"" with 50 basis points is not about the economic impact. It is a psychological gambit, intended to convey decisiveness and self-confidence.

Powell used that interesting new word - ""recalibrating"" - nine times in the press conference. It is the next policy mantra, replacing ""transitory"" and ""higher for longer"" etc. ""Recalibration"" suggests a machine that is capable of precision, accuracy. The Fed needs the public to believe that it can fine-tune policy and control events once again.

This is misleading, however, if not outright deception (""fake news""?). When it comes to the real economy, the Federal Reserve is ineffectual, even helpless, to a degree far greater than it can afford to admit openly. The Central Bank neither caused nor cured the recent surge of price inflation. It can do nothing to affect the price of gasoline or eggs or used cars. It cannot ""create jobs."" It can barely influence the cost of bank credit. It can't even do very much to help the housing market, which is the sector of the economy where interest rates matter most. ""The Fed can cut rates but it can't fix the housing crisis"" headlined Fortune magazine (Sept 19, 2024).

The Fed is the Central Bank not just for the United States, but in effect for the entire world - and the world needs a Central Bank it can believe in. Credibility is crucial and the Fed is right to do what it can to try to recover it. But we should understand what the rate cut was really about. It should not be advertised as something it is not. The Fed shouldn't be selling ""growth."" And the Chick-Fil-A folks should stick to selling sandwiches rather than basis points."

You can tell a lot about the market by analyzing what sectors and stocks are leading...and what sectors and stocks are lagging. So, what message are the markets sending out NOW? What should investors consider buying...or selling...as we head into the fourth quarter of 2024?

To get the answers to those questions, I invited Michael Gayed, editor of the Lead-Lag Report and host of the Lead-Lag Live Podcast, to join me for this week's MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast segment.

We begin by discussing the August selloff, the September rebound, and what the wild action says about markets moving forward. Michael lays out a skeptical case. He notes that smaller capitalization stocks are still lagging their bigger cap brethren, while sectors like utilities and asset classes like gold are leading the advance.

That's typically ""defensive"" action, indicating it's premature to sound an all clear for stocks. He goes on to explain why investing is ""always about probabilities"" - and why it's so important to pay attention to ""disconnects and divergences"" when deciding where and whether to commit your capital.

Next, Michael explains which credit market indicator he's closely watching for signs of renewed trouble. He also names the one currency market trend that could lead to future selling in markets - one that we just got a ""preview"" of in early August. As the conversation nears an end, we cover topics like China stimulus and what contrarian trades it could fuel...why he has liked gold for almost a year, and still does...and what more speculative subsector of healthcare he favors.

Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the Federal Reserve just cut interest rates by 50 basis points. But you may NOT know how that translates into rates on various financial products and investments. Or that many ALREADY priced in last week's cut (and then some)!

Take a look at the MoneyShow Chart of the Week below. It shows four rates - the prime rate in orange, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in light blue, the average 30-year mortgage rate in purple, and the effective yield on 7-10 year corporate debt in green.

What should jump out at you right away? That borrowing costs for high-grade corporations who tap the bond market for money - and US home buyers who take out long-term mortgages - peaked LAST OCTOBER! We've already seen corporate debt yields drop about 150 basis points from the peak, while long-term mortgage rates have sunk about 170 bps.

At the same time, we're only NOW seeing SOFR reflect the Fed's cut. That means business loans, derivatives, and other financial products tied to that short-term rate are only now being repriced. The prime rate will also drop 50 bps as soon as this chart updates with one more day of data. That means rates charged on variable-rate credit cards and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are only now falling.

What happens next? A lot depends on what bond INVESTORS think the Fed's recent move - and the ones it will make in the rest of 2024 and into 2025 - will mean for growth and inflation.

Right now, the market consensus is that the Fed will engineer a soft landing via its cuts...rather than fuel another bout of punishing inflation. As long as that remains the case, long-term yields can level out here while short-term rates keep coming down. That's the ideal scenario.

But if investors start worrying the Fed is going too far, they'll dump bonds. That will drive long-term yields higher even as short-term rates dip. That's the NOT-ideal scenario.

Me? I remain in the Be Bold / Don't worry so much camp. And I still like things I've recommended in the past, including the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), up more than 6% in the last 90 days, and the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), up more than 18% during that same time frame!"
"MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle fawns over Harris, says non-answers are 'okay': These aren't 'clear and direct issues'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-stephanie-ruhle-fawns-over-harris-says-non-answers-okay-arent-clear-direct-issues,2024-09-26T16:28:34Z,"Vice President Harris addresses tariffs, inflation, immigration policies and more on MSNBC.

MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle showered Vice President Kamala Harris with praise and repeatedly shrugged off her non-answers following their sit-down.

Appearing on ""Deadline: White House,"" Ruhle said that while Harris ""didn't want to go deep"" on her plans with tariffs, she claimed the VP had a ""serious plan as it relates to manufacturing.""

""If you think about the big economic legislation that has been passed in the last four years, we have actually seen billions of dollars being put to work, thousands of jobs being created, much of which are in red states and red counties, bringing manufacturing jobs back,"" Ruhle told her MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace.

""Now, they're not the old manufacturing jobs. They are new manufacturing and this friction, this period of change, doesn't just happen overnight, right? So Donald Trump, who really appealed to that blue collar, that union worker in 2016 kind of on a guttural, emotional level, we've seen the Biden administration appeal to that base on a policy level, but she knows she's not getting those votes overnight,"" Ruhle continued.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

Ruhle, who also serves as a business analyst for NBC News, said Harris' ""challenge"" is to message to voters that her economic policies ""serve everyone,"" insisting that the VP wants to build ""an inclusive economy.""

""What I didn't hear from her was divisive language,"" Ruhle told Wallace. ""Imagine if I was sitting against Donald Trump, imagine the language he would be using, please! And just the fact that we were talking about collaborative inclusivity - I don't know. Vote for her or don't vote for her, but isn't it great to just have a positive conversation right now?""

The MSNBC host did go on to admit that Harris didn't answer a question about how she would get the funding for her ambitious economic agenda without Congress but quickly defended her by saying Trump would ""balloon"" the deficit ""significantly bigger than Vice President Harris will.""

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE CALLS OUT HARRIS FOR DODGING HOW SHE'D RAISE TAXES: 'SHE DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION'

Ruhle later appeared on ""All In with Chris Hayes,"" which aired the interview in full.

She further shrugged off Harris' non-answers, referring to an exchange she had about the Democrat's criticisms of Trump's tariff proposals while also implementing their own tariffs under the Biden administration.

""It's complicated, right?"" Ruhle exclaimed. ""We're a country of 330 million people, our economy is complicated. In the same way - is the economy good or bad? It totally depends! So tariffs, if used in the right places, can work. And one could watch that and say, 'Well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer.' That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues.""

Ruhle rejected critics who panned Harris' price control plan as being ""socialist,"" turning to Trump's proposal of capping interest rates for credit card companies.

""When I call, like, ride or die capitalists about this. They're like 'Oh, it's nonsense. It was just talk and talk.' But when she says anything that even sniffs like it, they're like 'See, she's a socialist nutball.' So it's completely crazy,"" Ruhle complained.

MSNBC HOST DEFENDS HARRIS AVOIDING POLICY QUESTIONS: SHE'S 'NOT RUNNING FOR PERFECT'

Hayes complimented Harris as being ""quite adept"" on the issues and said it would benefit her campaign by doing more such media interviews, something Ruhle agreed with ""100%.""

""Because what's crazy is that Donald Trump gets so much credit and has for the last nine years of the fact that, you know, people have access to him when he says what he thinks, and he just lets it rip, but much of what he says either doesn't make sense or it's not true. She actually was perfectly reasonable,"" Ruhle said.

""And listen, there's some things she's not giving a direct answer on because she's a politician,"" she continued. ""But I agree with you that getting a chance to speak to her, getting the American people to hear from her more. What do you do with the fact, if you're her campaign, when people hear over and over, 'I don't really know what her policies are,' and they can say, 'Well, look, we have this book, and it has 82 pages.' I guarantee there are people who watched tonight who went, 'Oh, taxes only increased if you can make over $400,000?' because there's all sorts of people like 'Well, my tax cuts are gonna run out. Maybe my taxes are gonna go up next year.' They're not really reading the 82-page plan.""

Ruhle added, ""I mean, she's a great interview! I sat down with her for 25 minutes. You might not have liked all of her answers, but she had one for every single question.""

While Ruhle seemed to suggest that voters learned something new from her interview about Harris' economic policies by citing her intention to raise taxes for anyone making more than $400,000, President Biden touted that same policy proposal as a candidate in 2020, something Harris embraced as the 2024 nominee back in July."
Dividend Stocks To Double Your Money,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/09/26/dividend-stocks-to-double-your-money/,2024-09-26T15:38:26Z,"I'd load up on dividend magnet stocks, sit back and watch Fed Chair Jay Powell pump them to the moon!

Want to know what happened the last time the Federal Reserve cut interest rates? The broader market soared 124%! Powell printed so much money that the stocks popped:

Today, select dividend stocks are set up for 124%-like returns too. Buying them now is the best way to build wealth. And protect ourselves from inflation.

Yeah, the last time Powell printed money, inflation followed for the first time in 40 years! It was quite the feat.

Now, we have Jay taking a victory lap for solving the problem that he created. This is our cue to find stocks that sold off on recession fears and buy them before they bounce out of the bargain bin.

Kinda sorta like how we buy dividend grower UnitedHealth Group (UNH) whenever it dips. We discussed UNH at the start of the year -- I called it a ""perfect for 2024"" stock. My point was that UNH's stock price was lagging behind its payout, a rare occurrence that should always be bought.

UNH benefits from health insurance premiums that are always rising. (The kind that contributed to Powell's inflation mess -- ha!) Price hikes plus profits from UNH's technology-driven Optum unit -- which provides pharmacy benefits, runs clinics and supplies data analytics -- trickle down to a yearly double-digit dividend increase.

We've bought UNH twice in my Hidden Yields advisory. And twice we've profited. Our gains are so reliable that UNH is basically an ""in-house"" ATM for us!

That said, there are times we need to be patient. When I hosted our Q2 ""Subscribers-Only"" Webcast in June, UNH had traded sideways for over a year. Yours truly fielded several impatient questions. On cue, UNH took the hint and took off in pursuit of its payout:

As you can see above, UNH's price has rallied above its dividend. The stock is back to a Hold. But fear not if you ignored my recent advice to buy UNH. (I'm not mad -- I'm just disappointed. Same thing I tell my kids!)

Amgen (AMGN) is another dividend magnet play we discussed back in May. Remember? We called it out as a likely beneficiary of the ""lovey dovey Fed."" (Hawkish Jay didn't fool us back then, either!) Amgen had the setup that we love -- a price trailing its payout:

Mr. and Ms. Market were blue on the blue-chip biotech at the time, but they were missing the key catalyst for Amgen: rare diseases. Of more than 10,000 identified today, only 5% have approved medicines. As an established biotech with seemingly endless resources, Amgen has the R&D and manufacturing know-how to research, create and bring these drugs to market profitably.

Since 2020, the drug maker has boosted rare disease product sales from $2.2 billion to $3.9 billion. BINCYTO, a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is up 48% year-over-year. And the company's $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics expanded Amgen's rare disease portfolio even further. For example, Tepezza, a Horizon product, treats thyroid eye disease.

The result for Amgen? A top line that is accelerating. Wall Street finally figured this out -- shares are up 26% (good for 61% annualized) since we added them to our Hidden Yields portfolio in April.

If you missed UNH and AMGN, please, keep your head up. There are other divvie magnets to buy now thanks to our prolific and dovish money printer, Mr. Powell.

Just one example. NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) delivered yet another dividend raise last month.

NEP is the ""yieldco"" spun off from NextEra Energy (NEE) back in 2014. Renewable energy is the mission of the spinoff. The yieldco buys a wind farm, for example, and the parent company runs the operation.

Parent NEE is the gold standard for renewable energy in the utility sector, so an NEE-to-NEP connection is about as ""blue blood"" as it gets.

That was true until 2022 happened.

When Jay Powell hiked rates to clean up his inflation mess, yieldcos were pummeled. Because they constantly need financing, their investors worried whether the companies would survive the hiking cycle. Case in point: NEP yields 13.4% today, a reflection of these concerns. Investors sold off, the price fell, and the yield (of course) rose.

Call me crazy, but if the 13.4% yield was in jeopardy, management wouldn't be raising the payout!

The company has raised its dividend every quarter for the past nine years. Thirty-nine consecutive quarterly payout hikes -- 39!

I realize the market views NEP as risky, but CFO Brian Bolster clarified recently that the company does not have any growth equity needs -- doesn't need to raise any cash to grow its business -- until 2027. Between now and then, lower interest rates should give Brian a chance to refinance existing debt cheaply and boost cash flow even more.

After all, the Fed is now Brian and NEP's friend."
Solana And Ethereum: How These Cryptocurrencies Stack Up In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amorsexton/2024/09/26/solana-and-ethereum-how-these-cryptocurrencies-stack-up-in-2024/,2024-09-26T15:35:23Z,"In 2008, Bitcoin was introduced as the world's first provably secure peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Ethereum, announced in 2014, built on Bitcoin's vision by allowing developers to create their own decentralized applications on a blockchain. Solana, conceived in 2017, was built to address Web3's scalability challenges, enabling high throughput and low-latency transaction processing at scale.

Both Etheruem and Solana have been built to solve problems faced by the previous generation of blockchain technology. Both have also gone from zero to one in bringing new infrastructure to market, unlocking novel use cases, and driving adoption across Main Street and Wall Street alike. But how does one protocol compare to the other in 2024?

Today, let's look at how Ethereum and Solana stack up across three categories: institutional adoption, scalability, and liquidity.

Institutional Adoption

In 2024, institutional adoption has been driven in part by newly introduced crypto exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S, providing a regulated and accessible way for investors to add digital assets to their portfolios.

Most recently, Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, with funds from major institutions such as Blackrock and Grayscale. This followed the successful launch of eleven Bitcoin ETFs in January, after approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By August, BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust was the first to surpass $1 billion in net inflows.

The debut of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has paved the way for a potential Solana ETF. Solana ETFs are not currently listed in the U.S., although they are available in some international markets. There are, however, applications under review by the SEC, with VanEck being the first American company to file for a U.S. Solana ETF, and 21Shares also submitting an application. It has been reported that the SEC rejected the 19b-4 filings submitted by Cboe BZX on behalf of the two institutions, raising a question around the deadline for an ultimate decision on a Solana ETF.

Staking is notably excluded from Ethereum ETFs, leading some to believe a Solana ETF would follow suit, Solana also being a Proof of Stake blockchain. If so, this would indirectly transfer value to those who stake both SOL and ETH through each respective protocol's inflation rate, meaning those who self-stake or choose to stake with a third party would receive more value from their staking.

Scalability

Both Ethereum and Solana pursue a vastly different, yet equally ambitious, scalability roadmap.

Today, the Ethereum network faces throughput limits, with transactions ranging from 15-30 per second (TPS). These transactions are bundled into blocks, which are then processed by validators. Ethereum scalability relies on a strong Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, a roadmap it has pursued since 2020. In March 2024, Ethereum's Dencun upgrade was launched, introducing proto danksharding and dramatically reducing fees for L2s. These L2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, are separate blockchains, fully compatible with Ethereum, that take transaction load off the main network. L2 solutions have grown in popularity due to their high speeds and low fees, with institutions, such as Kraken, Sony, and Coinbase, as notable examples looking towards L2s for a number of use cases.

Solana is faster than Ethereum, with a theoretical max of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), and it aims to be even quicker. Yet historically, Solana's mainnet has had to overcome some uptime challenges. Firedancer, a Solana validator client built by Jump Trading, aims to deliver up to a theoretical TPS that is orders of magnitude higher, while improving reliability. Built from the ground up, Firedancer uses a concurrency model, borrowed from the low latency trading space, with high performance implementations of Solana's core primitives. Firedancer's testnet, Frankendancer, is a combination of Agave, developed by Solana Labs, and Firedancer. At this year's Solana Breakpoint, Frankendancer was announced as live on mainnet, with Firedancer live on testnet.

Liquidity

Liquidity is important for an efficient Web3 economy, as it determines how quickly assets can be traded without impacting price. Trading volumes on Solana have historically been much lower than Ethereum, by a factor of 2 or more. However the speed and low-fee properties of Solana has led to a recent catch up, when Solana trading volumes briefly surpassed Ethereum (July and August 2024). Both ecosystems see real-world use cases and tokenization, particularly with stablecoins which are prime trading assets, has strong drivers for increased liquidity.

Staking also impacts the levels of liquidity in both Ethereum and Solana, as both ETH and SOL require tokens to be locked in order to stake. Today, only 28% of the overall supply of ETH is staked, yet liquid staking has claimed the top spot in Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem. Liquid staking provides stakers with a Liquid Staking Token (LST) of their assets, one which is available to hold, trade, or participate in DeFi. The availability of liquid staking solutions is key to Ethereum's economy: without a centralized marketplace, buyers and sellers must provide liquidity in pools to allow for assets to be bought, sold, and swapped across DEXes and DeFi platforms. Liquid staking providers, such as Liquid Collective, allow greater capital efficiency for stakers wishing to receive rewards, while also giving them the liquidity to participate in Ethereum DeFi.

While Ethereum holds a lead in terms of deeper liquidity, institutional trust, and a thriving L2 ecosystem, Solana's momentum as a high-performance L1 is clear. Ethereum is building an increasingly modular stack, while Solana believes in the highly optimized, monolithic structure.

The institutional confidence in ETH as an asset is highlighted by the recent introduction of ETFs, and initiatives such as the recently introduced Node Operator Risk Standard (NORS) certification establishes an objective benchmark of excellence for professional Ethereum node operators.

But Solana's achievements, and future potential, cannot be understated. Solana is actively scaling its mainnet infrastructure, creating a superhighway for future growth without fragmenting liquidity across L2s. Furthermore, Solana's institutional interest has been signaled by a number of major players, including Franklin Templeton.

While Ethereum's advantage as a first mover is evident, both networks will play important roles in shaping the future of finance in both 2024 and beyond."
Boomer Gold Is Now Bitcoin,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/26/boomer-gold-is-now-bitcoin/,2024-09-26T14:59:15Z,"You can't be right all the time. I decided to play this crypto cycle with ether not bitcoin on the premise that Eth is spicier than BTC and would run further faster. The idea was bitcoin $100,000-plus and ether $10,000-plus.

I suppose, like a true Brit, I mustn't grumble because I did get my ether much cheaper than even these depressed levels.

The last leg of the hoped-for bitcoin boom to $100,000 has not happened, though the dream lives on - or perhaps now instead, the prospect of a geopolitical nightmare of a scenario is in view. A terrible geopolitical event that makes bitcoin dash to above $100,000 because a lot of rich/desperate people need to run for the hills with flight capital, seems possible because:

1. It is already building every day in the news.

2. Gold is on the run foreshadowing that possibility.

This in my mind is now the only credible prospect for the final leg up and is not exactly a long shot. I hope it will not come to pass, but gold and bitcoin will provide a very strong advance warning. Prices often run well ahead of the news, something we seem to see in the decision of the Federal Reserve, for example. Its every word and punctuation is examined by armies of analysts so it's not surprising price moves preempt the news. For example, you can be assured that plenty of individuals would load up on bitcoin and gold if their warring side looked like it was in big trouble, and no one in a position to do so is going to leave it until the last minute.

Thankfully, this is still a ""what if"" rather than a certainty and meanwhile further down the food chain from bitcoin and ether is struggling. Here is the bitcoin vs. ether chart:

To me the calculus has simplified. Bitcoin remains the only true crypto. It is not ""run"" by anyone and almost everything else is, and ether has gone away from those Satoshi principles into the realm of technical and governance oligarchy. Human intervention, especially in matters financial, is not known to end well for the masses and we have certainly seen enough unhappy outcomes with centralized crypto thus far. I like a crypto that can't be fiddled with or downright fiddled and you now have to look really hard to find a crypto where their isn't a Wizard of Oz pulling levers behind the curtain.

The rolling development of ether puts it at risk with every modification. Tweaks can wreck the business model. The laws of unintended consequences, that of Murphy, Finagle, O'Toole's and Waldo's cannot be ignored or underestimated. Breaking the business model is easily done, especially when you carry dogma along with you. Let me give you an example of a dangerous ether dogma. Monetary deflation is good and adds value. Sounds obvious doesn't it...

But how about Gresham's Law? ""Bad money drives out good."" That means inflated money kills the usage of deflationary or stable money. That's not good news for a deflationary Ethereum.

No, no, no, crypto denizens cry, Gresham is wrong, good money, i.e. bitcoin drives out bad, i.e. dollars. That is a brave claim and when you see the success of stablecoins in term of crypto market cap, you can see bad money definitely has its charms even in the realm of crypto's hard money posturing.

So Ethereum's developers' potentially flawed attempt at making ether deflationary may just have been a blunder and the reason for its less than excellent performance recently. Meanwhile, inflationary solana has galloped up the market cap charts.

In any event, right or wrong, the great boot of government is bearing down on crypto and it is clear the fun is gone, and with it a lot of the benefits and advantages that crypto had over fiat.

Want to make a new crypto, or a new crypto thingamabob? Better find a lot of money to get lawyers to tell you you can't do it without inviting the wrath of all sorts of global regulators and regulations. In the previous booms, you just needed to get coding and buy a plane ticket to the Caribbean.

So while the probability of the next leg up seems distant the bottom line is, if something wicked this way comes, up will go crypto, if not, down it will go into the new cycle's crypto winter.

If gold wasn't crying havoc, I'd say that the crypto winter was here, but as gold is frighteningly strong, I'm not ready to sell up my Eth just yet because while gold used to be Baby Boomer bitcoin, now Boomer gold is bitcoin."
IRS Announces 2024-2025 Per Diem Rates For Taxpayers Who Travel For Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/09/26/irs-announces-2024-2025-per-diem-rates-for-taxpayers-who-travel-for-business/,2024-09-26T14:53:55Z,"The IRS has released its annual update of special per diem rates for taxpayers to use in substantiating business expenses while traveling away from home. The new numbers are effective as of October 1, 2024, and are to be used for per diem allowances paid to any employee on or after October 1, 2024, for travel away from home. As always, the rates include those for the transportation industry, the rate for the incidental expenses, and the rates and list of high-cost localities for purposes of the high-low substantiation method.

The IRS allows the use of per diem (that's Latin meaning ""for each day"" -- remember, lawyers love Latin) rates to make reimbursements easier for employers and employees. Per diem rates are a fixed amount paid to employees to compensate for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses incurred when traveling on business rather than calculating the actual expenses.

A per diem rate can be used by an employer to reimburse employees for combined lodging and meal costs, or meal costs alone. Per diem payments are not considered part of the employee's wages for tax purposes so long as the payments are equal to, or less than the federal per diem rate, and the employee provides an expense report with a reasonable amount of time. The report must include the business purpose of the trip, the date and place of the trip, and receipts for lodging (if using the meals-only per diem rate). If the employee doesn't provide an expense report meeting all of that criteria, the payments will be taxable to the employee.

It's important to note that employees don't have to stick to the per diem rate. They can pay more or less than the federal per diem rate. However, if an employer pays more than the federal per diem rate, the excess will be taxable to the employee.

What about self-employed taxpayers? The good news is that while employees may not deduct business-related expenses on a Schedule A as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), self-employed taxpayers can still deduct business-related expenses on a Schedule C. That doesn't mean that self-employed taxpayers can't receive a per diem rate reimbursement -- they can. But the per diem rates aren't typically as useful for self-employed taxpayers because they can only use the per diem rates for meal costs.

As of October 1, 2024, the special meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) per diem rates for taxpayers in the transportation industry are $80 for any locality of travel in the continental United States (CONUS) and $86 for any locality of travel outside the continental United States (OCONUS). The per diem rate for meals & incidental expenses (M&IE) includes all meals, room service, laundry, dry cleaning, and pressing of clothing, and fees and tips for persons who provide services, such as food servers and luggage handlers.

The rate for incidental expenses only remains $5 per day, no matter the location (and no, it's not your imagination -- that flat rate is not adjusted for inflation and has not changed in years). Incidental expenses include fees and tips paid at lodging, including porters and hotel staff.

Since the cost of travel can vary depending on where -- and when -- you're going, there are special rates for certain destinations. For purposes of the high-low substantiation method, the per diem rates are $319 for travel to any high-cost locality and $225 for travel to any other locality within the continental United States. The meals & incidental expenses only per diem for travel to those destinations is $86 for travel to a high-cost locality and $74 for travel to any other locality within the continental United States.

As you can imagine, high cost of living areas like San Francisco, Boston, and New York City continue to make the list. There are, however, a few noteworthy changes, including:

Per diem rates are used as a convenience for employers and workers -- it's a relatively simple way to substantiate business travel amounts.

Here's why that matters. As noted earlier, per diem payments are not considered wages for federal income tax purposes so long as the payments are equal to or less than the federal per diem rate and the employee provides an expense report to the employer within a reasonable amount of time. That's a good thing.

Not following the rules can result a tax on employees for those payments -- that's not such a good thing. Keeping it simple makes it more likely that all parties will follow the rules.

Of course, employers don't have to stick to the per diem rate. Employers can choose to pay less -- that still falls within the guidelines. But if an employer pays more than the federal rate and there's no substantiation (meaning records that meet IRS guidelines), the excess will be taxable to the employee.

That's why having a baseline for reimbursement -- with adjustments for those garden spots that are a bit more expensive -- smooths out record-keeping a bit. It also gives the IRS (and its algorithms) insight whether employee payments for travel expenses are really just that -- or disguised compensation.

You can find the entire high-cost localities list, together with other per diem information, in Notice 2024-68. To find the federal government per diem rates by locality name or zip code, head over to the General Services Administration (GSA) website."
Warren Buffett Has It Right - Time In The Market Trumps Market Timing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbuckingham/2024/09/26/warren-buffett-has-it-righttime-in-the-market-trumps-market-timing/,2024-09-26T14:46:45Z,"Warren Buffett famously once said, ""The stock market is a mechanism for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient."" Countless examples throughout equity market history support this sentiment, most recently demonstrated by the rally following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%.

The equity markets cheered the news, with major indices hitting all-time highs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's upbeat tone at the press conference, combined with better-than-expected economic data, painted a promising picture for the future. Retail sales in August rose by 0.1% -- a small but significant improvement over expectations -- and industrial production surged by 0.8%, far exceeding the 0.2% forecast. Housing starts also topped projections, adding to the sense of economic resilience. These numbers highlight an economy that continues to grow, even amid concerns over inflation and rising interest rates.

Just two weeks ago, the financial media was rife with fear over what the Fed would do next, and investors were bracing for the worst. Yet here we are, only a short time later, with markets rising and fears ostensibly subsiding.

As I am fond of saying, the secret to successful investing in stocks is to not be scared out of them. It is tempting to react impulsively to short-term market swings, but history shows that those who remain steadfast in their investment strategy are often rewarded. Rather than being swayed by daily volatility or media-driven fear, successful investors stay the course. By focusing on long-term growth and the power of compounding, they position themselves to weather downturns and capitalize on the inevitable recoveries that follow.

Indeed, through the Miracle of Compounding, great fortunes can accrue even with relatively modest returns. For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average would eclipse 100,000 in less than 16 years simply by showing 5.8% per annum price appreciation, which has been the historical rate of return for the popular benchmark. As the table below shows, the Dow would make it to six figures in just eight years if it was a total return and not a price index, and if it enjoyed the 13.2% total return that has been the average for Value stocks since 1927.

The historical evidence is clear: stocks, particularly value stocks, have delivered strong returns over time, regardless of interest rate movements. Even as the 10-year Treasury yield rose from 3.65% to 3.74% last week, equities pushed higher. Investors who stick to their strategies, avoid panic selling and let their investments grow through the power of compounding will likely be the ones to benefit most from the market's long-term upward trajectory.

Whether it's an upcoming Federal Reserve decision or pending Presidential/Congressional election, it is crucial to keep the Oracle of Omaha's words in mind. Wealth is built not by reacting to every twist and turn, but by staying invested through thick and thin. Patience remains one of, if not the greatest, allies of the equity investor, ensuring that time in the market transfers wealth from those who chase short-term gains to those who play the long game."
How Universal's 'Wicked' Can Improve Retail Sales This Holiday Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/09/26/how-universals-wicked-can-improve-retail-sales-this-holiday-season/,2024-09-26T12:35:00Z,"Universal Pictures' Wicked musical release, starring Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, is set to hit theaters on Wednesday, November 27, the day before Thanksgiving.

In advance, Universal has amassed an all-star lineup of retailers and brands, counting on the two witches from Oz to wave their magic wands and generate excitement in a consumer market that has been spooked by ""bad juju.""

Collaborations will cover apparel, accessories, footwear, home decor, beauty toys, role play, publishing, collectibles and more. Aldo, Ariana Grande's r.e.m. Beauty, Beekman 1802, Build-A-Bear, Bombas, Bloomingdale's, Crocs, Fisher-Price, Forever 21, H&M, Hallmark, Hasbro, Hot Topic, Kohl's, Rebecca Minkoff, Target, Vera Bradley, Walmart and many more are on the Wicked train.

Ulta Beauty just announced its Wicked multibrand lineup will hit stores October 6, explaining in a statement, ""The Wicked-themed collection defines beauty norms, empowering beauty enthusiasts to embrace their truest selves."" Ulta needs some good magic this holiday season as comparable sales declined 1.2% in its most recent quarter.

And it's not just Ulta that needs a lift. Consumers are spooked by the economy, and retailers hope good witch Glinda will cast a spell to get them to come out and spend in the critical holiday season ahead.

The Conference Board just announced that in September the Consumer Confidence Index fell by seven points, the largest drop in the last three years. And its Present Situation Index was off over ten points based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions.

""The deterioration across the Index's main components likely reflected consumer's concerns about the labor market and reactions to fewer hours, slower payroll increases, fewer job openings -- even if the labor market remains quite healthy, with low unemployment, few layoffs and elevated wages,"" The Conference Board's chief economist Dana M. Peterson said in a statement.

The fact that the Bureau of Labor Statistics just revised its previous 12-month job number down by 818,000 didn't help people's confidence in the job market.

The National Retail Federation (NRF) just released its Halloween spending forecast and predicts it will come in about 5% less than last year's, down from $12.2 billion to $11.6 billion this year.

""Halloween marks the official transition to the fall season for many Americans,"" NRF Vice President of Industry and Consumer Insights Katherine Cullen said in a statement.

As such, Halloween, along with back-to-school (BTS) shopping, are guides to how the coming holiday retail season will turn out. And BTS doesn't look promising either.

Back-to-school forecasts were off 5%, dropping from $41 billion in 2023 to $39 billion this year. Back-to-college spending was off even more, down 7% from $94 billion last year to $87 billion this year, according to the NRF.

In the NRF's September economic outlook, released before The Conference Board's report, it tried to put a positive spin on where the economy stands. ""The U.S. economy is clearly not in a recession nor is it likely to head into a recession in the home stretch of 2024. Instead, it appears that the economy is on the cusp of nailing a long-awaited soft landing with a simultaneous cooling of growth and inflation.""

Yet, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stands at 81.7 points, within striking distance of hitting 80 points, which typically signals a recession ahead.

""The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession over the next 12 months remained low but there was a slight uptick in the percentage of consumers believing the economy was already in recession,"" Peterson said.

While the Census Department's Monthly Retail Trade Survey shows retail, excluding motor vehicles and gasoline stations, has increased 3.7% through August, if you take food services out, retail sales have only advanced 1.5%, from $3.28 trillion to $3.33 trillion. These three categories are excluded from NRF's core retail tracking.

Nonstore retailers, the core retail sector's largest category, has grown 8.3% this year, and it certainly will continue to advance this holiday season.

However, other categories in retail are languishing. Furniture and home stores are off 5%, building materials and supplies down 2%, sporting goods and hobby declined 3.5% and department stores continue to struggle with revenues down 1% this year.

While inflation is well off highs reached in mid-2022, retail prices are still about 20% higher in most spending categories since runaway inflation took hold. For example, Bankrate found that only about 6 percent of the nearly 400 items tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are cheaper now than they were back in 2020.

In response, shoppers are widely trading down to less premium goods, according to McKinsey and Company's third quarter ConsumerWise survey among 4,000 U.S. consumers. Some 76% of consumers surveyed, including 86% of GenZ and Millennials, are trading down to save money.

And particularly among the younger cohort, a social media-driven trend called ""underconsumption core"" is taking hold. CNN reported that these young people are pushing back against influencers who urge followers to buy the next new fashion trend, beauty product or hot gadget.

They are opting instead to show off how well they are making do without, and helping to save the planet in the process.

""It's really pushing back against this idea that you need to constantly be buying things to have a happy and fulfilling life,"" Megan Doherty Bea, assistant professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shared with CNN.

The NRF has yet to announce its Winter Holiday forecast, but at the start of the year, it predicted core retail growth would be in the 2.5% to-3.5% range and reach between $5.23 trillion and $5.28 trillion by year end. However, as of August, retail growth is only about half that.

While NRF nailed its Winter Holiday 2023 forecast last year, with retail sales up 3.8% over November-December to reach $964.4 billion, retail will need to make up for the shortfall its experienced through the first eight months of this year to hit NRF's full-year forecast.

That looks increasingly unlikely, given current consumer sentiment and all the other unknowns we face, as McKinsey warns, ""The next few months may be turbulent. Market uncertainty, the upcoming U.S. general election and ongoing geopolitical conflicts may test U.S. consumers' faith in the economy.""

One hit movie can't be expected to singlehandedly lift holiday retail sales. Yet excitement generated by Wicked could bring consumers out of their funk and get them engaged for the holiday season.

Regardless, it's going to take a lot of powerful witchcraft to overcome retail's headwinds going into the last months of the year."
Trump hits back at Harris with 'Kamala's Project 2025',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hits-back-harris-kamalas-project-2025,2024-09-26T12:23:46Z,"Trump senior adviser Jason Miller discusses the former president's response to an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate him on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Former President Donald Trump struck back at Vice President Kamala Harris by releasing what he says is Harris' version of a ""Project 2025"" on Thursday.

The list of policies Trump accuses Harris of supporting comes in reference to the Heritage Foundation's own Project 2025. Democrats have sought to tie Trump to the Heritage project, but he says he has not read it and does not support it.

Trump argued on social media that Harris' ""Project 2025"" includes such policies as ""Citizenship for 20 million illegals"" and ""taxpayer funded reparations,"" among other things.

Trump later followed up with a post highlighting inflation in key swing states that took place during the Biden-Harris administration.

While Trump has denied any connection to Project 2025 throughout the campaign cycle, he most clearly divorced himself from it during his debate against Harris earlier this month.

Harris attempted to smear Trump as radical by citing some of the policies in the Heritage document.

The Biden-Harris record ""speaks for itself,"" and not in a good way, according to former first lady Melania Trump.

When asked about Vice President Harris replacing President Biden as the Democratic Party nominee, Melania said the country is experiencing numerous challenges under their leadership, a stark contrast to her husband's term in office.

""The country is suffering. People are not able to buy usual necessities for their families. We have wars going on around the world. Soldiers are dying. They were dying under this administration because of weak leadership. The border is open and dangerous. A lot of fentanyl is coming over, killing our youth. It's very hard to see,"" she told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt in an exclusive sit-down interview that aired Thursday.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HER HUSBAND: SURVIVING BOTH WERE 'REALLY MIRACLES'

""[The economy] it's really not great. Inflation is high and, if we compare these four years under this administration compared to four years under my husband as commander in chief, he was leading the country through peace through strength. And the border was safer than ever before. We didn't have any wars. People were prospering. They had jobs. They could support their families, so I think the American people need to decide what they really want. Maybe some strong tweets, but everything else great for this country, so it's all in the American people's hands on November 5th.""

The conversation marked the former first lady's first television interview in more than two years. It also came in anticipation of her new memoir release titled ""Melania.""

During the interview, she also recalled finding out about the two attempts on her husband's life, which have come within a brief two-month span of each other.

The first came when gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, striking his ear and leaving blood streaming down his face.

Crooks also claimed the life of former Pennsylvania fire chief Corey Comperatore and injured rallygoers David Dutch and James Copenhaven.

""I ran to the TV and I [rewound] it and I watched it,"" Melania recalled.

""I didn't really see [it] live, but maybe, you know, three minutes, a few minutes later. But when I saw it, I, you know, it was only... Nobody really knew yet. Because when you see him on the floor, and you don't know, you don't know what really happened.""

MULTIPLE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS PUT ON LEAVE FOLLOWING TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Just two months later, the former president had another brush with death at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida, when the barrel of suspected gunman Ryan Routh's firearm was spotted among the bushes.

Melania was in New York at the time, but called to make sure everything was fine. While speaking to Earhardt, she credited the Secret Service for a ""fantastic"" job.

""The guys that they were, the team, they were fantastic. And I think both of the events, they were really miracles. If you really think about it, July 13th was a miracle. How... like that much, and he could, you know, he could not be with us.""

"Trump, Harris neck and neck in key states Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina: poll",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-neck-neck-key-states-arizona-georgia-north-carolina-poll,2024-09-26T12:07:37Z,"Who is in the lead of the 2024 election roughly 40 days out? Will Cain breaks it all down. Plus, the Ruthless Podcast guys join Will to discuss if Trump can defeat Harris, the future of the GOP, and if sports are 'bread and circuses.'

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are virtually tied in three crucial battleground states, according to new statewide surveys from Marist College.

The Marist Poll released Thursday finds that Harris and Trump are tied at 49% among likely voters in North Carolina who were asked which candidate they were leaning toward. Of those polled who have made up their minds, 91% said they strongly support their choice.

The race is tight in Arizona as well, where Trump polls just one point ahead of Harris, 50% to 49%, according to the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The same goes for Georgia, where 50% of likely voters are leaning towards Trump and 49% say they are more inclined to vote for Harris.

The Marist Polls were conducted from Sept. 19-24, surveying 4,643 registered voters across all three states who report they are definitely voting in this year's election.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

There are 43 Electoral College votes up for grabs between Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Trump, a Republican, won all three in his 2016 victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but lost Arizona and Georgia to President Biden in his 2020 defeat. North Carolina, a swing state that Trump won twice, has an incumbent Democratic governor and appears more competitive this year as the Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, is mired in scandal over posts he allegedly made on a porn website and polls poorly against state Attorney General Josh Stein, the Democratic candidate.

""North Carolina, with its 16 electoral votes, is both the Harris and Trump campaigns' backup plan after the hard-fought battle over Pennsylvania,"" said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""North Carolina is so close that the five regions in the state line up now almost exactly as they did four years ago. It's as if the Biden years and the 2024 campaign haven't happened.""

Harris and Trump are tied at 48% among North Carolina independents who are likely to vote. Biden carried Tar Heel independents by four points in 2020, according to the 2020 Presidential Exit Poll. Harris leads Trump among Black voters 86% to 13%, but underperforms compared to Biden, who earned 92% of the Black vote in North Carolina in 2020. Trump has an advantage over Harris with white voters, 59% to 40%, though Harris has improved with this demographic over Biden, who won 33% of the white vote in 2020.

The top issues for North Carolina voters are inflation (32%), preserving democracy (28%), immigration (14%) and abortion (11%), according to the poll.

HARRIS AND TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN PENNSYLVANIA AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRAILS IN OTHER 'BLUE WALL' STATES: POLL

Over in Arizona, Harris edges Trump among independents 51% to 47%. Biden won Arizona independents by 9 points four years ago, 53% to Trump's 44%. Again, Trump leads Harris among white voters 51% to 48%, while the Latino vote is competitive, with 51% leaning towards Trump and 49% towards Harris.

The top issues for Arizona voters are preserving democracy (27%), inflation (26%), immigration (21%) and abortion (14%), the survey said.

""Arizona's 11 electoral votes are up for grabs, but the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate (Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.) has a double-digit lead,"" said Miringoff. ""Voters in the state, like elsewhere, are willing to split their ticket this time unlike the straight party voting that occurred in 2016 and 2020.""

Harris also leads Trump among Georgia independents by five percentage points, 51% to 46%. Similar to Arizona, Biden won Georgia independents by 9 points in what was the first presidential election win for Peach State Democrats since 1992. Trump heavily contested the 2020 results in Georgia and continues to make unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud that have been rejected by Georgia officials, including Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

EARLY VOTING BEGINS IN ILLINOIS, NORTH DAKOTA, FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN

""Georgia was ground zero for election controversies in 2020. Yet, the overwhelming majority of Georgians express confidence that elections will be fair and accurate,"" said Miringoff. ""Interestingly, most Democrats and Republicans share this view despite the results last time.""

Georgia voters rank inflation as the top issue (34%), followed by preserving democracy (24%), immigration (13%) and abortion (11%).

A Fox News national poll taken after the first debate between Harris and Trump spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

""An increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family,"" the Fox News poll notes.

Trump led Harris on the economy by 5 points in the Fox News poll.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.

But Shaw added that Trump's ""edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

Why It's Time To Get Over The Broadband Affordability Fixation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2024/09/26/why-its-time-to-get-over-the-broadband-affordability-fixation/,2024-09-26T12:03:41Z,"This question has dominated public discourse in recent years as policymakers have focused on, and allocated significant resources towards, closing the country's digital divide once and for all. But determining the ""affordability"" of something is highly subjective and thus not amenable to a neat one-size-fits-all definition arrived at by central planners. Nevertheless, there are some who remain transfixed with affordability and wield the issue to justify any number of unnecessary government interventions. This obsession distracts from the critical tasks of removing barriers to broadband adoption and demonstrating to those who remain offline that an internet connection is worth having.

It is time to get over this affordability fixation.

Can I Afford It?

Deciding whether something is ""affordable"" is almost entirely subjective and hinges on a variety of personal factors, like the extent to which someone views a good or service as necessary. For these reasons, affordability is typically viewed as a consumer sentiment rather than an objective economic indicator. Unfortunately, these nuances rarely come up in conversations about broadband. Instead, policymakers, commentators, and others continue to assert, despite ample data to the contrary, that the ""affordability"" of broadband is the primary, if not sole, impediment to more robust adoption and use. Sadly, this misinformed view has begun to influence policy.

A leading example comes from the $42.5 billion BEAD program. A creature of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, BEAD represents the largest ever expenditure of federal resources for broadband. A goal of BEAD is to bolster ""affordable"" broadband by requiring grant recipients to offer low-cost broadband service at a set price - typically in the range of $30-$60/month - to qualifying low-income households.

The explicit linkage of price and affordability - that low prices automatically make something affordable - reflects the reductive thinking about broadband adoption that has prevailed for years. It also underscores the need for having a more exacting focus on the many other factors that influence whether people subscribe to high-speed internet service.

What The Data Say

How reductive is this thinking? Let's consider the data.

Broadband adoption rates have been all-but-flat over the last few years. According to survey data from Pew, overall home broadband adoption rates have increased from 73% in 2016 to 80% in 2023.

At the same time, broadband prices have barely grown. Indeed, per a recent analysis of broadband pricing changes between 2018 and 2023 by the ACLP at New York Law School, broadband is cheaper now in real terms (i.e., after accounting for inflation) than it was 5 years ago, with prices growing at a vastly slower rate than those for other essential services. For example, electric prices, which are highly regulated, rose by about 30% over the same period, while gas prices, also set by regulators, rose by 32%.

In addition, major ISPs have been offering low-cost broadband options for years to qualifying households. These offerings, which have proven to be popular and impactful, provide deep discounts on connections and access devices to low-income households and others.

Taken together, these trends would seem to provide fertile ground for significant gains in broadband adoption. And yet, as noted, adoption rates have only inched up.

Even so, the signature broadband adoption initiative of the last decade - the $14+ billion Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) - doubled down on the ""low cost = affordable"" obsession, yielding a program that generously doled out subsidies to a broad swath of consumers. Unsurprisingly, the ACP, which eventually reached 23 million households, did relatively little to bring new subscribers online.

Surveys by the FCC and the Benton Institute found that most ACP enrollees already had a broadband connection pre-subsidy. This strongly suggests that these consumers already perceived internet access to be ""affordable."" Only about 20% of ACP enrollees used their subsidy to purchase their first internet connection; all other enrollees used their subsidies to purchase additional broadband services (e.g., to upgrade a service offering, add another mobile broadband plan to their bill, etc.).

Waking Up To Reality

The data demonstrates that, even when broadband is free or very low cost, many non-adopters still choose to remain offline. Why does this happen? And why aren't policymakers focused on this issue?

The simple answer to the first question is that these digital holdouts do not see broadband as something they want to use. For them, broadband is not relevant to their lives.

This is not a new phenomenon. To the contrary, the interplay of broadband adoption and relevance has been observed for years. NTIA surveys stretching back to 2001 have found that the top reason for not using the internet at home has been ""no need or interest."" NTIA, which designed the BEAD low-cost requirement, has noted that addressing relevance rather than price is a ""more difficult challenge"" that few have risen to meet. This answers the second question: policymakers usually choose to focus on broadband ""affordability"" because it is easier to dole out subsidies than it is to grapple with more complex issues like demonstrating the relevance of broadband to non-adopters.

This was not always the case.

Fifteen years ago, during development of the FCC's National Broadband Plan, there was a concerted effort to study the impediments to greater broadband adoption. That work generated studies and findings detailing the many real barriers holding back greater use of broadband. Even though progress has been made on some fronts, many of these barriers still exist in some form or another.

For example, many older adults remain reluctant to use new technologies because of security and privacy concerns. For people with disabilities, many parts of the online experience remain inaccessible and unusable. These very real concerns will likely intensify as more invasive digital tools come online; as high-profile hacks proliferate; and as society confronts continued real-world impacts of online mis/disinformation, the toxicity of social media, and growing stigma around smartphones.

Looking Beyond Affordability

Overcoming these barriers requires tailored, often community-specific approaches and lots of resources. Some $2.75 billion in federal digital equity funding is slowly being made available to help remove remaining impediments to broadband adoption. Although this represents a historic funding commitment by the federal government, it will probably not be enough to scale and sustain the most impactful approaches like Digital Navigators and OATS from AARP.

What needs to be done?

At the federal level, if Congress establishes a permanent ACP, it should narrow eligibility to ensure that available subsidies are laser-focused on those who remain offline or those who subscribed for the first time during previous iterations of the program. Over time, new adopters could be transitioned to existing low-cost offerings from ISPs, a process that is already underway post-ACP and generating mostly positive outcomes.

Congress and the states should also consider creating long-term funding streams to support, sustain, and expand proven adoption-oriented programs. As the adoption rate increases, these programs could shift their focus to a broader array of issues, like parsing online mis/disinformation, strengthening cybersecurity, and enhancing digital privacy across all demographic groups.

Progress on these critical fronts will not happen, however, until the country moves on from its fixation on broadband affordability. Broadband is cheaper today than it was 5 years ago. Most consumers have multiple affordable options to go online. And yet millions of Americans still choose to remain offline. Solutions to these issues will only come by delving into the details of broadband connectivity and understanding that ""cheap"" or ""affordable"" does not always translate to ""adopted."""

Sixty-two years after Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, its spectacular success has minted his eldest son as a centibillionaire.

Rob Walton became the first member of America's richest family to hold a 12-figure fortune, worth an estimated $100 billion. Shoppers have flocked to the budget retailer amid high inflation, sending Walmart's shares up 53% year-to-date.

Just 15 other people are worth $100 billion or more, including Elon Musk and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang. With Walmart's stock market tear, Rob's siblings Jim and Alice may soon join him in this elite club.

A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. But the groups are something of a double-edged sword, says Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights. While they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal criminal charges by a grand jury Wednesday night, capping a series of federal corruption investigations against him and several high-ranking members of his administration. In a defiant video statement shortly before the indictment was reported, Adams said the charges were ""entirely false, based on lies"" and dismissed calls for him to resign, saying the people of New York ""elected me to lead this city, and lead it I will.""

Since the Federal Reserve's major interest rate cut last week, yields for 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for loans like mortgages and auto rates, have actually increased. Now expectations have shifted for the Fed to enact another big cut amid mounting evidence that the economy needs even more of a jolt.

A Delaware court extended an order stalling Bolt founder Ryan Breslow's bid to raise $450 million, characterizing the deal as a ""prisoner's dilemma"" for investors. It's the latest snag in Breslow's ongoing bid to raise fresh capital for the struggling payments company, as three irate Bolt investors requested the halt on the Series F financing round -- including the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock.

The Senate voted 78-18 to approve legislation Wednesday to continue funding the government through December 20, narrowly averting a shutdown just five days before the deadline. The short-term spending deal still requires lawmakers to either hash out a funding deal or pass another extension in December, about six weeks after Election Day.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-Md.) was the target of a sophisticated spoofing operation where a video caller used deepfake imagery to pose as a high-level Ukrainian official, according to multiple reports late Wednesday.

The Israeli military is reportedly considering a ground invasion into Lebanon, amid an escalating conflict with Hezbollah that has killed hundreds and threatens to turn into a full-blown war. Late Wednesday, the U.S., France and several key allies issued a statement calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire, noting that the conflict ""presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.""

In a letter to shareholders, Elliott accuses Southwest's leadership of obstructing a leadership change with ""a chaotic series of defensive actions.""

TOPLINE Philip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine's image with its wildly in-demand flavored Zyn pouches, embraced by celebrities, entrepreneurs and star athletes.

By the end of 2024, PMI, which owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, expects to sell as much as 580 million cans of Zyn, a 50% increase over the 385 million sold last year. Forbes estimates that Zyn sales, which PMI does not break out in public filings, generated $1.3 billion last year (about 3.7% of PMI's $35 billion in total revenue) and could hit $1.9 billion this year.

Zyn is six times more profitable than PMI's cigarette division, says Bonnie Herzog, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the tobacco industry. And unlike cigarettes, which have been steadily declining in volume for the last decade, Zyn is in hypergrowth mode. Shipment volume in the U.S. has jumped a staggering 238% since 2020.

But while pouches have successfully divorced nicotine from the cigarette, they still have health risks. Plus, the FDA has not authorized them for sale, although Swedish Match filed an application in March 2020. This means the products are technically illegal, but the FDA is allowing them to stay on the market while the agency reviews applications.

And at least five lawsuits allege that PMI is marketing Zyn to minors. ""Zyn is Juul 2.0,"" says Scott Schlesinger, a Florida-based attorney who recently filed a class action against PMI and Swe­dish Match.

But Stacey Kennedy, head of PMI's U.S. operations, insists that PMI is marketing Zyn only to adults who already smoke or use nicotine. ""I think Zyn is proof that nicotine can be used [to replace] more harmful products,"" she says.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Zyn has become a runaway success for PMI. Its newest nicotine product will generate nearly $2 billion in sales this year, Forbes estimates,"" says staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""But the nicotine pouch is more than just a financial juggernaut -- Zyn has spawned its own culture online (also known as the Zynternet), with viral memes and celebrities touting the brand. And it has even entered the presidential election: Ohio Senator JD Vance has been photographed holding a container of Zyn, while on the other side of the aisle, Tim Walz levied a 95% tax on Zyn and other nicotine products as governor of Minnesota.""

"Mortgage Rates Today: September 26, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-09-26-24/,2024-09-26T10:55:45Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.68% with an APR of 6.70%, according to Curinos. The 15-year fixed mortgage has an average rate of 5.71% with an APR of 5.75%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.74% with an APR of 6.77%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) remained at 6.68% from 6.68% yesterday. This time last week, the 30-year fixed was 6.62%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.70%. This time last week, it was 6.63%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At today's interest rate of 6.68%, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000 will pay $644 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. You'd pay approximately $131,870 in total interest over the life of the loan.

With an interest rate of 5.71%, you would pay $828 per month in principal and interest for every $100,000 borrowed. Over the life of the loan, you would pay $49,127 in total interest.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.74% -- 0.01 percentage point up from last week. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate had a 52-week APR low of 5.00% and a 52-week high of 10.50%.

A 30-year jumbo mortgage at today's fixed interest rate of 6.74% will cost you $648 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,862.

The Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy -- including its interest rate hikes, which it's using to restrain inflation -- is the primary factor that's pushing long-term mortgage rates higher. The state of the economy and housing market also affects mortgage rates. As for what interest rate the lender might offer you, this depends on your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and credit score, both of which indicate your risk as a borrower.

Related: Mortgage Rate Forecast & Trends For 2024

Shop around and talk to various lenders to get a sense of each company's mortgage loan offerings and services. Don't go with the first lender quote you receive; instead, compare the best mortgage rate quotes to get a deal. In particular, consider what fees they charge, what fees they're willing to waive and what closing assistance they might provide. Make sure any special offers or discounts don't come at the cost of a higher mortgage rate.

Be sure to apply with each lender within a 45-day window. During this window, you can have multiple lenders pull your credit history without additional impact on your credit score.

Mortgage rates remain elevated, and the nation's housing supply remains limited. The low inventory is preventing house prices from dropping. Meanwhile, the combination of high mortgage rates and appreciated home values will continue to present an obstacle for many prospective homebuyers seeking affordable housing.

Home loan borrowers can qualify for better mortgage rates by having good or excellent credit, maintaining a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and pursuing loan programs that don't charge mortgage insurance premiums or similar ongoing charges that increase the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).

Comparing rates from different mortgage lenders is an excellent starting point. You may also compare conventional, first-time homebuyer and government-backed programs like FHA and VA loans, which have different rates and fees.

For the most part, several economic factors influence the trajectory of rates for new home loans. The recent Federal Reserve rate hikes don't directly cause mortgage rates to rise but have indirectly caused the interest rates for many long-term loans to increase. Rates are more likely to decrease when the Fed pauses or decreases its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.

Further, the inflation rate and the general state of the economy directly impact interest rates. High inflation and a strong economy typically signal higher rates. Cooling consumer demand or inflation may help rates decrease.

As you compare lenders, consider getting rate quotes for several loan programs. In addition to comparing rates and fees, these programs can have flexible down payment and credit requirements that make qualifying easier.

Conventional mortgages are likely to offer competitive rates when you have a credit score between 670 and 850, although it's possible to qualify with a minimum score of 620. This home loan type also doesn't require annual fees when you have at least 20% equity and waive PMI.

Several government-backed programs are better when you want to make little or no down payment:"
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 26, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-26-24/,2024-09-26T10:55:40Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying puny interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, depicts the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the trade-off is you may have to meet strict conditions laid down by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can nail down an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's below last week's 0.26%.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Opinion | Trump's campaign shows the problems with the Aquaman presidency,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-second-term-aquaman-theory-rcna172665,2024-09-26T10:28:52Z,"A second term would show the excesses of presidential power more clearly.

During Barack Obama's presidency, frustration among his supporters at unfulfilled campaign promises became so common that a political scientist coined a name for the phenomenon. These supporters, Dartmouth University's Brendan Nyhan explained, were suffering from the Green Lantern Theory of the Presidency.

The Obama supporters' belief was that, just as the superhero Green Lantern could will anything into existence using his power ring, presidents could achieve any policy goal if they simply tried hard enough.

Most of the left has moved on from this cartoonish view of the presidency, but not Donald Trump. In recent weeks, the Republican presidential nominee has promised to do everything from cutting car insurance rates to making in vitro fertilization free. These pledges come after he previously claimed that he would impose across-the-board tariffs on all imports, deport millions of undocumented immigrants, end inflation, end the Ukraine war, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and abolish the Department of Education, among a number of other big ideas.

It's tempting to view these as all empty promises, especially given how many pledges he didn't fulfill in his first term. But there's a risk to being too dismissive of presidential power, too, especially when faced with the prospect of a second Trump term. Some of his worst ideas would be entirely within his powers as president, especially the way the office is currently constructed, while his proposals to help the average American are most likely out of reach.

The key to understanding this is what I call the Aquaman Theory of the Presidency: The commander in chief is all powerful in certain circumstances, like how Aquaman can summon aid from sea creatures underwater, and totally useless in other situations, just as Aquaman isn't much help in the desert.

Consider tariffs. Trump, who has called himself ""a Tariff Man,"" has said he would levy a 20% tariff on all imports to encourage domestic manufacturing. Additionally, he recently threatened to impose a 100% tariff on cars made in Mexico and a 200% tariff on John Deere tractors if production is moved to Mexico. These tariffs would drive up costs for consumers, spark retaliatory moves that hurt American businesses and destabilize the global economy.

But could Trump do them? Sure. In this case, Tariff Man is Aquaman on his home turf.

Over the last century, Congress has repeatedly expanded the president's power to impose tariffs during wartime or for national security or even, some argue, any kind of national emergency. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has proposed a long-shot bill to limit that power, and some free-market supporters hope the Supreme Court might step in, but Trump would have the advantage in this fight for now.

By contrast, Trump would have to go through Congress to fulfill his off-the-cuff promises to end taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security income. Republicans are already planning to extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which disproportionately helped the wealthy at a cost of several trillion dollars. They might be persuaded to tack on one or two of those new proposals, but Trump wouldn't have much power to force the issue if they didn't want to do it.

Overall, Trump has broad powers for some of his worst ideas:

The success of some of his other ideas would depend in large part on how Congress and the Supreme Court reacted.

For example, Trump has proposed signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, the post-Civil War guarantee from the 14th Amendment that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen. Would Republicans in Congress stand up to the president and seek to undo that? Would the current Supreme Court reject it as clearly beyond the pale? Or would they both acquiesce, effectively granting the president a power that he does not actually have?

Trump would have fewer powers, however, when he needed Congress to act.

If he earnestly tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for example, he would be unlikely to get any more cooperation from all the lawmakers he'd need to do it than in his last attempt in 2017. And Republicans are certainly not going to rush to make IVF free. In fact, anything more complicated than cutting taxes is likely to run into a legislative brick wall, especially since Trump hasn't outlined any plans for exactly what he'd do and has little support among the rank and file for these ideas.

Not all of this is absolute. Presidents can sometimes get Congress to do their bidding, muscling through key pieces of legislation with combinations of threats and favors. And the current Supreme Court would certainly find some limits on presidential power if they are used by a President Kamala Harris.

But if Trump gets a second term, he would have some Aquaman-like powers to do a lot of harm and not a lot of power to do good."
Crime data guru 'frustrated' by media insisting crime is down under Biden-Harris: 'Huge spike in our cities',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/crime-data-guru-frustrated-media-insisting-crime-down-under-biden-harris-huge-spike-our-cities,2024-09-26T09:15:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A guru on crime statistics believes progressive journalists and pundits have misled Americans by insisting crime is down under the Biden-Harris administration.

Jeffrey Anderson is the president of the American Mainstreet Initiative, a small think tank that focuses on issues ""everyday Americans"" care about, such as crime and immigration, inflation and the national debt. Prior to that, he was the director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which is the arm of the Department of Justice that puts out federal crime stats.

He recently penned a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, ""Contrary to Media Myth, U.S. Urban Crime Rates Are Up,"" which suggested flawed FBI data hides a rise in urban-area crime since the Defund the Police movement of 2020.

ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: MODERATORS DAVID MUIR AND LINSEY DAVIS FACT-CHECK TRUMP 5 TIMES, 0 FOR HARRIS

Anderson was ""frustrated and yelling at the TV"" when ABC Presidential Debate co-moderator David Muir cited FBI data to insist violent crime has come down ""overall"" in recent years when fact-checking former President Trump.

""Contrary to the fact-checkers and the debate moderator... there's no statistically significant evidence in the best, most authoritative source that crime is dropping in America,"" Anderson told Fox News Digital.

""There's been a huge increase in urban crime from 2019, right before the summer of George Floyd and the Defund the Police movement to 2023, which are the most recent numbers, which were just released a couple weeks ago,"" Anderson added. ""In fact, the increase in urban crime, violent crime is [up] 40% over that period of time.""

Anderson said that if you remove simple assaults, which are considered the ""least serious"" of violent crimes, then data shows a 54% increase in urban areas since 2020.

""It's a huge crime spike in our cities,"" Anderson said.

Anderson believes the major uptick in urban-area violent crime is the result of major cities being controlled by left-leaning officials.

""They've had a very lax law enforcement philosophy... they put handcuffs on police. They've made it very difficult for them to do their jobs. And then the prosecution of criminals once they're arrested has been minimal,"" Anderson said.

ABC'S 'THE VIEW' WAS 100% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP FOLLOWING SECOND ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: STUDY

""And so, as a result of that, really, these are the same lax law enforcement policies we tried back in the 1960s and 70s. We're getting the same results in our cities,"" he continued. ""And we know the way out, thanks to the broken windows policing we tried in the 1990s and 2000s, but we'll see if the cities actually adopt those policies.""

Trump pushed back on Muir during the infamous debate, suggesting the FBI data was fraudulent because major cities weren't included.

""I think the media, which is highly progressive, does not want to admit these progressive policies in our cities caused a huge crime spike. So, they're trying to grab on to whatever numbers they can, stats they would never normally cite, like partial year, unpolished FBI figures, and try to claim that we're seeing a decline in crime,"" Anderson said.

Anderson said the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which is put out by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the DOJ statistical agency where he used to work, proves his point.

""The FBI is not a statistical agency. The NCVS says that violent crime in our cities is up 40% from 2019, pre-George Floyd, Defund the Police to 2023,"" he said.

""It does not show any statistically significant decline in violent crime either nationwide, or in our cities, over the most recent year,"" he added, noting that NCVS is particularly important to understand because it includes crimes that are not reported to the police, in addition to the ones that were reported.

""That's hugely important, especially given that most respondents to the NCVS, 55% who reported they were a victim of a crime, said the crime was not reported to police. So, when you only look at crimes reported to police, you're missing most crimes,"" Anderson said.

Other recent headlines include NBC News' ""Murder and other violent crime dropped across the U.S. last year, FBI data shows"" and CNN's ""Did you know violent crime is down? Not if you're watching right-wing media."" Both of these articles cited FBI data that compares 2022 to 2023, which does not include all law enforcement agencies in the United States.

In his Wall Street Journal piece, Anderson noted five reasons why he feels left-leaning news organizations and pundits emphasize FBI data.

""First, the NCVS figures are finalized statistics, not unpolished, partial-year preliminary figures. Second, the FBI switched to a new reporting system in 2021 that makes year-to-year comparisons (from before to after its change) difficult if not impossible,"" he wrote.

""Third, the NCVS is a nationally representative survey, while the FBI lacks data from a relatively large number of law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, and it hasn't had the same mix of agencies reporting data each year. Fourth, the FBI isn't considered a principal statistical agency by the federal government, so its ability to compensate for such missing data is limited,"" Anderson added. ""Fifth, the NCVS captures crimes whether they are reported to the police or not.""

The Bureau of Justice Statistics has been publishing the National Crime Victimization Survey on an annual basis since 1973. It includes statistics on nonfatal violent crimes including rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault. It also includes property crimes such as burglary or trespassing and motor vehicle theft."
North Carolina GOP focusing on 'hand-to-hand political combat' to ramp up ground game in battleground state,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-gop-engaging-hand-hand-political-combat-get-out-vote-battleground-state,2024-09-26T08:15:40Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republicans are taking both a data-driven and hand-to-hand approach to target key voters in the battleground state whose electoral votes are historically decided by just a small fraction of people.

Republicans won North Carolina in the past three presidential elections, but the results have consistently come down to just a couple of thousand votes, with former President Trump winning by about 4% in 2016 and 1% in 2020. The last Democrat to win the state, former President Obama in 2008, won by less than 14,000 votes.

As Republicans ramp up their get out the vote efforts this cycle, leaders at the forefront of the movement told Fox News Digital that they are focusing their resources on encouraging early voting and delivering their message to the key 1% to 2% that could swing the election for either party.

Jason Simmons, chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, told Fox News Digital that there has been an ""overwhelming"" response to their knocking on doors and grassroots activism.

""We've been very engaged with all of our grassroots activists and have a very enthusiastic response. People are fired up. As I travel from one end of the state to the next, you see our Trump captains really engaging with the voters of North Carolina, taking the message of why it's important in this year to go out more so than ever,"" Simmons told Fox. ""They're out there every day knocking [on] doors, making phone calls, talking to the voters of North Carolina about the issues that matter most.""

Republicans in the state are also using data to help turn out the vote for residents who haven't been engaged in voting in past elections.

""It's really drilling down into the data and identifying those voters that we know will vote our way, especially the low- to mid-propensity voters, by getting in front of them and talking to them about those issues that matter most to them and then encouraging them to make that plan and to go vote,"" Simmons said.

After speaking with voters across the state, Simmons said the economy, inflation and the southern border are the issues of top concern among North Carolina voters.

Republicans are also investing in encouraging early voting this cycle, and according to Dallas Woodhouse, state director for a conservative training outfit, American Majority, the data reveals that more early voting would benefit the GOP in 2024.

""We have field teams out right now educating conservative voters about the importance of actually voting early, voting by mail in North Carolina, how it is safe to vote by mail. We're trying to turn around some of the trends that were difficult for conservatives in 2020 and 2022,"" Woodhouse said. ""What we know is that the earlier you get the vote in, the more efficient it is for candidates, for parties. And if you wait till the last minute, you are at risk of illness and bad weather and your cost per vote goes way out.""

Woodhouse said that by Election Day, America Majority expects to have knocked on half a million doors in the state, reached a million voters by phone and a million and a half voters through text messages.

""All you can do is go out and fight every day, go out, push the message of free markets, limited government, strong national defense, and get people out to vote what they do from theirs up to them.""

Woodhouse added that the presidential race in North Carolina is going to be ""razor-close to the end.""

""The fact is, North Carolina is razor-close. ... So, voter by voter or house by house, that's what you're into: hand-to-hand political combat to get every single voter to the polls.""

Mark Robinson, North Carolina's lieutenant governor and the Republican gubernatorial candidate, recently came under fire after CNN published a report alleging that Robinson had previously made salacious comments, such as referring to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on pornographic websites in the late 2000s. Just days later, his campaign released a statement that staff in various senior roles had stepped down.

""It's very unfortunate, and it's disturbing, troubling, the remarks that we've seen and the allegations attributed to Mark Robinson,"" Simmons told Fox of the recent controversy. ""But ultimately, it's up to him to go and talk to the voters of North Carolina and show them that these are not his words, his values. And we'll continue to talk to the voters of North Carolina about those issues that matter most to them.""

JD Vance takes apparent jab at Kamala Harris saying she's from a working class family,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jd-vance-takes-apparent-jab-kamala-harris-saying-shes-from-working-class-family,2024-09-26T07:16:39Z,"Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins discusses the impact of former President Trump and vice presidential candidate JD Vance's efforts to 'create' focus on migrant crisis in Springfield, Ohio.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance took an apparent jab at Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris during an event in Michigan, when he echoed a talking point about her upbringing that she often repeats at her own events.

When speaking to a group of supporters in Traverse City, Vance mentioned he also ""grew up in a working class family"" and knows what it takes to stand up for the middle class in an election year unsettled by high inflation and crippling costs.

""Now, look, a lot of you know my story and a lot of you know where I came from. Look, I grew up in a working-class family. And so, when the Democrats -- when Kamala Harris -- talks about her middle class background, when the Democrats talk about how they stand for working people, they're not telling the truth,"" Vance said.

He added: ""They're lying to you.""

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: NEW POLL INDICATES WHO HAS EDGE IN MOST IMPORTANT BATTLEGROUND

In his remarks, Vance said voters can look back to how many Democrats in positions of power during the COVID-19 pandemic sought to enforce lockdowns and to keep them in place while Americans were desperate to return to work.

""Here's how we know they're lying to you,"" he continued. ""Remember back a few years ago when there were a lot of nurses, a lot of people in a lot of industries that were losing their jobs because they refused to take the COVID shot? Now, I believe if you want to take the Covid shot, take the shot. If you don't want to take the COVID shot, don't take the COVID shot. But listen, it is disgraceful for Kamala Harris to say that she stands for the American working man when she fired millions of American working men and women from their jobs for not doing what Kamala Harris would tell them to do.""

Vance was visiting Michigan as the state represents an important background for former President Trump's re-election chances and for down-ballot races like former Rep. Mike Rogers, who is running to represent Michigan in the U.S. Senate.

After commending Rogers, Vance turned his attention to the current vice president.

""I don't know if you saw the news but Kamala Harris has decided to give her first solo national interview,"" Vance said. ""I've watched a couple of these interviews, local journalists with Kamala Harris, and I've realized why it is that Kamala Harris doesn't give interviews. And the answer is that every time she answers a question, I think we gain about 100,000 votes, me and Donald Trump.""

""They ask Kamala, of course, because she's the vice president and she is the reason why we have sky-high inflation and a wide open border, what are you going to do? What is your specific plan to solve the inflation crisis that's making it unaffordable to buy groceries and housing? And Kamala will say, well, did you know that I grew up in a middle-class family, I had a very nice lawn back there in Berkeley, California,"" he continued. ""It's like, well, that might be true. What the hell does that have to do with lower inflation?""

Vance added: ""Or they'll say, Kamala Harris, we've got a war in every new continent across the country. Kamala Harris, your administration has in some ways led to the policies that caused this conflict. How are you going to solve it as President of the United States? And Kamala Harris will say, well, did you know that I worked at McDonald's for about three months when I was a teenager?""

THIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS THE UPPER HAND IN THE 2024 CASH DASH

The Republican senator's tirade against the Democratic nominee by arguing she fails to offer specifics in her answers.

""I think my friends, all of us watching this interview are saying to ourselves, what is Kamala Harris? What is she actually planning to do for the American people? And the answer is we don't know. [But] we don't have to guess that much because she's been the vice president for three and a half years and she hasn't done a thing. So let's dispense with this idea that Kamala Harris is going to fix the very problem she caused.""

And, ""Kamala Harris is why we have sky-high inflation. Kamala Harris is why you can't afford groceries or housing. Kamala Harris is why the world is at war right now in nearly every single continent. Kamala Harris is why the border is wide open. And Kamala Harris, you want a promotion? The message from Michigan is you're fired. Go back to San Francisco where you belong.""

Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are the Democrats' so-called ""blue wall,"" which the party reliably won for a quarter-century in presidential elections.

A zoo in Finland is returning pandas to China because they're too expensive to keep,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/g-s1-24620/a-zoo-in-finland-is-returning-pandas-to-china-because-theyre-too-expensive-to-keep,2024-09-26T05:18:27Z,"HELSINKI -- A zoo in Finland has agreed with Chinese authorities to return two loaned giant pandas to China more than eight years ahead of schedule because they have become too expensive for the facility to maintain amid declining visitors.

The private Ähtäri Zoo in central Finland some 330 kilometers (205 miles) north of Helsinki said Wednesday on its Facebook page that the female panda Lumi, Finnish for ""snow,"" and the male panda Pyry, meaning ""snowfall,"" will return ""prematurely"" to China later this year.

The panda pair was China's gift to mark the Nordic nation's 100 years of independence in 2017, and they were supposed to be on loan until 2033.

But since then the zoo has experienced a number of challenges, including a decline in visitors due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as an increase in inflation and interest rates, the facility said in a statement.

The panda deal between Helsinki and Beijing, a 15-year loan agreement, had been finalized in April 2017 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Finland for talks with Finland's then-President Sauli Niinistö. The pandas arrived in Finland in January 2018.

The Ähtäri Zoo, which specializes in typical northern European animals such as bears, lynxes and wolverines, built a special panda annex at a cost of some 8 million euros ($9 million) in hopes of luring more tourists to the remote nature reserve.

The upkeep of Lumi and Pyry, including a preservation fee to China, cost the zoo some 1.5 million euros annually. The bamboo that giant pandas eat was flown in from the Netherlands.

The Chinese Embassy in Helsinki noted to Finnish media that Beijing had tried to help Ähtäri to solve its financial difficulties by, among things, urging Chinese companies operating in Finland to make donations to the zoo and supporting its debt arrangements.

However, declining visitor numbers combined with drastic changes in the economic environment proved too high a burden for the smallish Finnish zoo. The panda pair will enter into a monthlong quarantine in late October before being shipped to China.

Finland, a country of 5.6 million, was among the first Western nations to establish political ties with China, doing so in 1950. China has presented giant pandas to countries as a sign of goodwill and closer political ties, and Finland was the first Nordic nation to receive them."

JESSE WATTERS: ...Kamala heard that and said, what are you doing Wednesday? Stephanie Ruhle is a business analyst on NBC. She's a Trump hater. And the interview focused on the economy, something Kamala can't talk about. Because if she said what her plan was, she'd lose in a landslide.

Kamala was just asked about her policies. She rambled and then said, the American dream is gone. She's been in power for four years and said the American dream is gone. She just sank her campaign. But that was just the beginning.

They just asked her what her trade plan was, she never answered and then said Trump doesn't have one.

Trump's not serious about trade? He's deadly serious. He won a trade war with China. Passed the new NAFTA deal, signed new trade deals with South Korea and Japan. He used tariffs to bring countries to the negotiating table. And we had a great economy with no inflation. I don't know if Kamala Harris knows this, but the Biden-Harris administration kept Trump's tariffs on China."

Actor and comedian John Leguizamo said that religious Latinos who support former President Trump were ""homophobic.""

During an interview with TMZ, Leguizamo was asked about Vice President Kamala Harris polling lower with Latino voters than President Biden had when he was the 2024 presidential nominee. The ""John Wick"" and ""Encanto"" actor said Harris needed to be more ""aggressive"" and ""court"" Latinos, suggesting the VP needed a big-name celebrity to endorse her and encourage younger people in this demographic to vote.

When asked about Latinos in the Sun Belt trending toward Trump, Leguizamo suggested Harris would have a difficult time winning over religious Latinos due to their views on abortion and LGBTQ issues.

""Latino people are not a monolith,"" said Leguizamo. ""No group is, right? So, religious Latinos, they are anti-abortion and homophobic,"" he said, adding that these voters might be swayed on jobs and housing instead.

""You might get them, because the thing Latinos care most about is jobs and housing,"" he continued.

""So if you're talking about start[ing] businesses, Latino women are No. 1 start-up businesses in America. And we Latinos poll very large [sic] on keeping the housing market going...and Kamala Harris brought up those points and she's gotta keep hitting those points,"" he said.

Leguizamo also suggested Latinos who support Trump on immigration don't have ""sympathy or empathy"" for those coming into America seeking asylum or those who cross the border illegally.

""I think a lot of immigrants who came here are competitive with other immigrants coming in for some weird reason and have no sympathy or empathy for people looking for a better life,"" he said.

""Nobody wants to come to the border that way...you only do that if you have no other option. If you're running away from violence, starving to death,"" he continued. ""They're only coming here to work. To get a job -- no American would risk their life for a job.""

""Because Latinos, they're blaming him [Biden] for the economy, which they shouldn't be because COVID was the culprit and Trump not handling COVID was the culprit in damaging our economy,"" he told the outlet.

Leguizamo also compared Latinos who support Trump to roaches supporting insecticide.

""Latin people for Republicans are like roaches for Raid. Let's just get real,"" Leguizamo said on an episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" in October of 2020. ""I think there's a level of self-hate or just lack of care for the rest of your Latin brothers and sisters who are in cages, who are being demonized by this president.""

Hispanic voters give Trump a 42% to 37% advantage over Harris regarding immigration policy, Reuters/Ipsos polling from late August shows.

This is a full transcript of the exclusive interview of Vice President Kamala Harris by MSNBC's ""11th Hour"" host Stephanie Ruhle. It has been lightly edited for clarity.

RUHLE: Madam Vice President, you just laid out your economic vision for the future.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But, still, there are lots of Americans who don't see themselves in your plans. For those who say, these policies aren't for me, what do you say to them?

HARRIS: Well, if you are hardworking, if you have the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, you're in my plan.

I have to tell you, I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and character of the American people. We have ambition. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We can see what's possible. We have an incredible work ethic.

But not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things. But we don't lack for those things. But not everyone gets handed stuff on a silver platter. And so my vision for the economy -- I call it an opportunity economy -- is about making sure that all Americans, wherever they start, wherever they are, have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those ambitions, which include, for middle-class families, just being able to know that their hard work allows them to get ahead, right?

I think we can't and we shouldn't aspire to have an economy that just allows people to get by. People want to do more than just get by. They want to get ahead. And I come from the middle class.

Look, my mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard. She saved up. By the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. And homeownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. You know, gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream.

So part of my vision for the economy is, let's deal with some of the everyday challenges that people face and address them with commonsense solutions, such as affordable housing.

RUHLE: Over the last four years, there have been tremendous economic wins. And you have just laid out a big plan.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But, still, polling shows that more -- most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy. Why do you think that is?

HARRIS: Well, here's what I know in terms of the facts.

Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression, when you look at, for example, the employment numbers.

RUHLE: It was during COVID, and employment was so high because we shut down the government, we shut down the country.

HARRIS: Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs, by most people's estimates, at least 200,000. He lost manufacturing plants. Ask the autoworkers how he lost auto plants.

We have grown over 20 new auto plants. He has an agenda. Let's just deal with it right now going forward, not to mention what happened in the past.

He has an agenda that would include making it more difficult for workers to earn overtime, an agenda that would include cutting off access to small business loans for small businesses, an agenda that includes tariffs to the point that the average working person will spend 20 percent more on everyday necessities and an estimated $4,000 more a year on those everyday necessities, to the point that top economists in our country, from Nobel laureates, to people at Moody's and Goldman Sachs, have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy.

His would shrink the economy. Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So, the facts remain that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people.

And I'm not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share -- but tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country, and then not really paying much attention to middle-class families. My perspective on the economy is, when you grow the middle class, America's economy is stronger.

And there's empirical evidence to prove my point correct.

RUHLE: Then let me ask you about taxes, because lots of people will say, I don't like Donald Trump, but he cut my taxes. He didn't just cut corporate taxes. He cut individual taxes.

Now, that expires next year. And there's some people confused, saying, I don't know what's going to happen next year.

Under a Harris administration, at what income level should someone expect their taxes to go up? And that state and local tax deduction that's currently capped and matters to a lot of people in blue states, are you going to lift that cap?

HARRIS: So, first of all, when it relates to anybody making less than $400,000 a year, your taxes will not go up. Your taxes will not go up. And, in fact, under my plan, taxes for 100 million Americans will actually be cut, including $6,000 a year for young couples for the first year of their child's life in a tax cut, a tax credit, essentially, by expansion of the child tax credit.

And why is that? Because during the first year of a young couple -- of a person's -- child's life, they're going to need help buying a crib, buying a car seat. And we all benefit when they're actually able to do what they naturally want, to do to take care of their child.

RUHLE: And expanding that child tax credit, or you mentioned housing before, giving that extra money for a first home, if you can't raise corporate taxes, or if GOP takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that?

Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow?

HARRIS: Well, but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes. And we're going to have to raise -- we're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share.

That's just it. It's about paying their fair share. I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. And it is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that I meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax than the richest people in our country.

RUHLE: Bill Gates just said it this week. If he was in charge of taxes, he would have paid more.

But how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share, but they're not leaving our country?

HARRIS: Well, listen, I work with a lot of CEOs. I have spent a lot of time with CEOs.

And I'm going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of America's economy agree that people should pay their fair share. They also agree that, when we look at a plan such as mine, that is about investing in the middle class, investing in new industries, investing in bringing down costs, investing in entrepreneurs like small businesses, that the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits.

Part of my plan for the economy is investing in new industries in a way that we have active partnership with the private sector. I have worked with the private sector my entire career. I -- even as vice president, working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies to increase by billions of dollars the money going into community banks to increase access to capital for small businesses.

Why do those biggest corporations and CEOs do that? Because they know those kinds of investments, like in our small businesses, in start-ups and entrepreneurs, actually strengthens America's economy overall, and everyone benefits.

So this is not about bilking anybody, but it is certainly about saying, let's make sure that we create opportunities for everyone to grow wealth. I believe that it is not sufficient and it should not be our goal to just make sure everyone is working. That should be the baseline. That should be a given.

And let's create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home, to start a business, to take a nice vacation from time to time, right?

RUHLE: For people who want to buy a home, yes, getting a $25,000 kicker would be great, but it's not just affording a home. We don't have enough in this country.

HARRIS: You're absolutely right.

RUHLE: And one of the main problems are regulations and rules, strict, strict rules at a local level.

How does the federal government cut through all that red tape and get down to, I don't know, the suburbs of Pittsburgh and say, we're going to have to build some affordable housing here? How do you connect the two?

HARRIS: So, you're absolutely right.

So, across our country, people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing. So it's homeownership, to your point. We need more supply. That is, without any question, part of the solution.

Creating more supply under my plan includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector and homebuilders. Part of my goal and the plan would be to create three million new housing units for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term. It includes also what we must do to cut red tape. You're absolutely right.

It takes far too long and there's too much bureaucracy associated with homebuilding. And I say that as a devout public servant. I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need to do around building. And that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local governments.

And it's going to be different in different places, depending on the needs of that community, the needs of that local government, that municipality, but working in consultation and coordination and also around incentives that we can create.

For example, some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars, and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing, and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing for working people.

RUHLE: Then let me ask you a business that matters a lot to this town...

RUHLE: Right? When you think Pennsylvania, when you think Pittsburgh, you have got the Liberty Bell in Philly and you have got U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh.

RUHLE: You are opposed to this idea. Many people are. But if the deal doesn't go through, they have said people could lose jobs. They could close mills. They could leave the state of Pennsylvania.

I mean, that is like moving the Liberty Bell to Newark. So which is more important?

HARRIS: It's most important that we maintain America's ability to have American manufacturing of steel by American workers, for a number of reasons, which includes, again, back to the point of growing our economy and how I think about the economy overall, investing in new industries.

There is not a new industry that I can imagine that is not going to require steel as a -- manufacturing of steel as a fundamental part of what it accomplishes. And having American workers in an American company manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically important, not only in terms of our economy, but also in the context of national security.

Most people now realize, if we didn't before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an over-reliance on foreign manufacturing, that we have to be intentional about U.S.-based manufacturing. And of the products that we have to prioritize, steel is one of them. And that's always going to be my priority.

RUHLE: Steelworkers matter in this country. Unions matter.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: In 2016, Donald Trump connected with unions. He saw them. He -- there was an emotional connection. But what he didn't do was deliver policy.

In the last four years, we have seen huge wins in this country for unions, but not all unions have gotten behind you. I want to understand. When the Teamsters decided not to endorse you, what was their reasoning? What are they looking for?

HARRIS: Well, let me go back to our just previous conversation. I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the steelworkers and almost every other major union in America, because I stand by workers and I stand by the importance of being able to join a union and to understand the benefit and the value of unions.

And I understand the importance of investing in new industries and working actively with the private sector to grow our economy.

RUHLE: But I'm asking, because there's this idea, we want something more from her. What is it?

HARRIS: Well, here's the thing that -- back to your point about previous election cycles.

Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet and, one would argue, broke. Look at Lordstown. He said he was going to...

And what happened? It shut down. Outsourcing under Donald Trump. His policies that are about putting tens to hundreds of percent tariffs.

So, part of the challenge -- and I don't disagree that it's a challenge, got to earn the vote of everybody -- is reminding people of fact, regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere. And I think that's really important. And that's part of what I'm doing in this campaign, is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs.

RUHLE: Can I ask you about tariffs?

Because you just mentioned it. It's not just with one company. Donald Trump's sort of big idea is this broad-based tariffs across the board. You and many others have said that would be, not only disastrous, but it would be a direct tax on the American consumer.

HARRIS: It would be a sales tax on the American people that -- the independent economists have already measured this by his -- the sales tax of doing a 20 percent tariffs on all imports that he has described, would be a 20 percent sales tax, in essence, on basic necessities for the average American worker, average American family, totaling almost $4,000 a year.

That is no small matter. Here in Pittsburgh, when I'm talking to a group of folks who work here, who live here, and when they hear it might be $4,000 more a year for them, look, people can't afford that.

RUHLE: But tariffs aren't unique to President Trump. President Biden has tariffs in place. He's actually looking to potentially implement more. Where do you come out on, is there a good tariff, a bad tariff?

HARRIS: Well, part of it is, you don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board. And that's part of the problem with Donald Trump.

I -- frankly, I'm going to -- and I say this in all sincerity. He's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. And one must be serious and have a plan, and a real plan, that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally, but actually putting the thought into, what will be the return on the investment, what will be the economic impact on everyday people?

And when you look at my plans, you will see what those benefits will be, $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. You know what that means? Then you're creating the ability of that working person to build intergenerational wealth.

Doing the work of a $6,000 child tax credit, doing the work of a $50,000 tax deduction for first-time small businesses, start-ups, because, right now...

RUHLE: That's a real plan.

HARRIS: It's a real plan, because, right now -- and, again, it's about paying attention to the detail and being serious about it.

I'm serious about my enthusiasm and my -- for small businesses and my belief in what they will do as part of America's economic engine. On Friday...

HARRIS: And also looking at the fact that, right now, the tax deduction is $5,000. Nobody in this Year of our Lord 2024 can start a small business with $5,000. Very few can.

So, extending it to $50,000, tax deduction for start-ups, to generate the innovation and the ambition of the ideas that are present and among us, but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal.

RUHLE: His plan is not serious when you lay it out like that, but a serious problem over the last few years has been inflation. Luckily, it's cooling, but prices are still high.

RUHLE: You have said you want to take this on by going after those who engage in price gouging.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But as somebody who supports free markets, who's a capitalist, how do you go after price gouging without implementing price controls?

Because, once we get in this zone, people start to get worried and they say, I don't know what she stands for.

HARRIS: So, just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people.

And, as attorney general, I saw this happen. In the midst of an emergency, whether it be an extreme weather event or even the pandemic, we saw it, where those few companies, not the majority, not most, but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices.

Yes, I'm going to go after them. Yes, I'm going to go after them. And that is part of a much more comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down the cost of living, including housing, including the everyday needs of the American people.

RUHLE: On Friday, you are going to the border.

Immigration is complicated. One of the issues is an economic one. And no one is eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio. And I'm glad not to be talking about that. But there are people there that are stressed, that feel that they're at capacity. Communities around the country that have legal immigration, many have said, we're at capacity.

And many feel like the government has said to them, well, adapt, sit down, be quiet, this is how it is.

What would a Harris administration do for those communities who've taken in many, many legal immigrants, but are at capacity?

HARRIS: Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration system. And it needs to be fixed.

And if we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with others, proposed a border security bill that would have put 1,500 new border agents on the border to help those hardworking border agents who are there right now working around the clock, would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl, which is killing Americans around our country and devastating communities, would have put more resources into our ability to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, which, in my career, I have prosecuted.

Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on, and told them to kill the bill, don't put it up for a vote. He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution, because he wants to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem.

And that's part of what needs to be addressed. And my pledge is that, when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law. And we need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.

RUHLE: And I want to just ask you about a little job and a big job.

RUHLE: Because your opponent almost every day seems to be talking about this. So I just want to ask you, yes or no...

(CROSSTALK)

RUHLE: ... at any point in your life, have you served two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun...

HARRIS: And -- but it was not a small job. Like, I did fries.

HARRIS: But, to your point, if you don't mind, before you get to the big job...

RUHLE: Please.

HARRIS: ... it's a -- there's a -- part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family -- I worked there as a student, I was a kid -- who work there trying to raise families and pay rent on that.

And I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs.

RUHLE: But the economy is an unpredictable beast. And you are running for a job that takes extraordinary instinct and guts.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: When's the last time you had to make a gut decision? This here is very prescribed. It's very controlled.

HARRIS: Yes.

Probably the biggest gut decision I have made most recently is to choose my running mate, yes. There were lots of good, incredible candidates. And, ultimately, that came down to a gut decision.

RUHLE: I know I'm out of time, but then I just want to ask you a question from my gut.

HARRIS: OK.

RUHLE: Because, today, we're talking about reproductive -- excuse me -- we're talking about the economy.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: And people don't think often about reproductive rights being an economic issue. But it is, a woman's ability to plan her future, her education, her life.

Today, and in the last few days, Donald Trump keeps talking about it and how, in overturning Roe v. Wade, he helped women, he protected women. He says, they're miserable today. They're poorer today. They're more vulnerable today. He said he will be the protector of women if elected.

Can you respond to that?

HARRIS: So, Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future.

So, I think we would all agree that, as a result of that perspective that he has about women, he also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended, undid the protections of Roe v. Wade.

And now in, state after state, you see laws being passed that do punish women, laws that -- I mean, most recently, a heartbreaking story resulted in a young woman dying, a mother of a 6-year-old, heart-wrenching stories. And that's for the listener, much less their family.

So, look, I think the thing about Donald Trump is that I don't think the women of America need him to say he's going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them.

I am not perfect, but I will tell you, I'm always going to put the needs of the people first.

RUHLE: Madam Vice President, thank you for your time today."
"Harris calls for Americans to 'move past the failed policies' in November, draws mockery",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-calls-americans-move-past-failed-policies-november-draws-mockery,2024-09-26T00:10:35Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris takes aim at former President Trump as she tries to narrow the gap on the economy, Americans' top issue.

Vice President Kamala Harris faced ridicule on social media after she called for Americans to move on from the ""failed policies"" that ""we have proven don't work,"" in an address on the economy on Wednesday.

During a policy speech at The Economic Club of Pittsburgh, Harris emphasized her ""middle-class upbringing"" and pledged to ""build a strong middle-class,"" with proposals she's rolled out in recent weeks like increasing the tax break for new small businesses and giving a $25,000 credit to first-time homebuyers.

""When the middle class is strong. America is strong. And we can build a stronger middle class,"" Harris said. ""The American economy-- is the most powerful force for innovation and wealth creation in human history. We just need to move past the failed policies that we have proven don't work. And like generations before us, let us be inspired by what is possible,"" Harris said.

Harris' comments about ""moving past"" failed policies drew jokes from conservative political commentators on social media, who found her statement ironic since she's the incumbent vice-president.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTIONS ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""Acceptance is the first step,"" Former 2020 Trump campaign advisor and Fox News contributor Steve Cortes joked.

""Who wants to tell her?"" Redstate columnist Buzz Patterson quipped.

""Kamala Harris says we need to move past the failed policies that don't work. She's telling to to vote for Trump. Listen to her,"" Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon wrote.

""New Trump ad just dropped!"" conservative commentator LibsofTikTok posted.

""You're right,"" Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also wrote in response. ""The American people are sick and tired of the Harris-Biden Administration's failed policies. November can't come soon enough!""

""Quite the optics today as Harris is out saying we need to move past failed policies while the old man is on The View saying he delegated everything to her in his administration,"" posted Versus media podcast host Stephen L. Miller.

During her speech, Harris also called her 2024 opponent, ""one of the biggest losers ever,"" a phrase President Biden said about Trump while on ""The View"" earlier in the day.

Harris trails Trump with voters on key issues like the economy and inflation, according to polls. In recent weeks, she has made the economy a focus in her public remarks as she tries to narrow the gap between herself and Trump on Americans' top concern."
Harris calls Trump 'one of the biggest losers ever' during economy speech in key battleground,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-claims-trump-one-biggest-losers-ever-economy-speech,2024-09-25T23:01:27Z,"PITTSBURGH -- Vice President Harris pledged to lower child care and elder care costs as part of her push to help middle-class Americans cope with rising prices during her highly touted economic address in which she also repeatedly took aim at her rival for the White House, former President Trump.

Speaking at the Pittsburgh Economic Club in the must-win battleground state of Pennsylvania, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee outlined the three pillars of her economic agenda: lower costs, investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship, and leading global competitors in the industries of the future.

Pointing to persistent inflation, which has dogged President Biden's administration and provided Trump with plenty of political ammunition to fire at Harris, the vice president said that despite recent economic ""positive steps ... the cost of living in America is just too high.""

But Harris also said Trump ""has no intention of lowering costs"" and that he's made it harder for small businesses to function as the backbone of the nation's economy.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

And one day after Trump in a speech in battleground Georgia vowed to create manufacturing jobs by raising tariffs on overseas rivals and lowering taxes on U.S.-based manufacturers, Harris took aim.

Harris said Trump ""makes big promises on manufacturing. Just yesterday, he went out and promised to bring back manufacturing jobs.""

She then said that during Trump's four years in the White House, ""[M]anufacturing jobs went down across our country and across our economy. All told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency, starting before the pandemic hit, making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on manufacturing.""

THIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS UPPER HAND IN 2024 CASH DASH

And the vice president also blasted Trump over the nation's trade deficit with China.

""Donald Trump also talked a big game on our trade deficit with China, but it is far lower under our watch than any year of his administration while he constantly got played by China,"" she said.

And she described Trump as someone who wants to help the wealthy and big businesses, but not average Americans.

""For Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers, not those who actually build them, not those who wire them, not those who mop the floors,"" she said.

The Trump campaign, returning fire, put out a statement moments after the vice president's address ended headlined ""Kamala's Speech Full of Lies.""

Spotlighting a line from her address, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ""Kamala Harris is right about one thing -- it's time to turn the page. She's had three and a half years to prove herself, and she has failed.""

Pointing to economic conditions the past three and a half years under President Biden's administration, Leavitt said ""personal savings are down, credit card debt is up, small business optimism is at a record-low, and people are struggling to afford homes, groceries, and gas. Every time Kamala speaks, it becomes increasingly clear that ONLY President Trump will Make America WEALTHY Again.""

WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THE ECONOMY?

Trump mockingly calls Harris ""Comrade Kamala"" and says she's a far-left socialist.

Apparently pushing back, the vice president, near the top of her speech, spotlighted that ""I'm a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment. And I know the power of American innovation.""

Harris, in her address, detailed plans for new tax incentives that would aim to spark next-generation industries critical to the economy and national security.

And the vice president shined a spotlight on her proposals to provide first-time home buyers $25,000 to help with down payments and a $6,000 tax credit for families with newborns.

""When we lower the cost and ease the burdens people face, we will not only make it ... easier for them to meet their obligations as caregivers, we will also make it more possible for them to go to work and pursue their economic aspirations,"" she said. ""And when that happens, our economy as a whole grows stronger.""

With less than six weeks until Election Day on Nov. 5 and with early in-person voting or absentee balloting underway in nearly two dozen states, just about every poll indicates the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans.

And while the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic-inflicted recession continues, high prices remain a leading concern among voters.

When it comes to which presidential candidate can better handle the economy, Trump continues to have the edge, but his margin over Harris differs dramatically depending on the poll.

The former president is up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, 11 points in a CNN poll and favored by seven points in an ABC News/Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at five points in the latest Fox News poll and two points in an AP/NORC survey.

In Pennsylvania, a new Monmouth University survey indicated Trump holding a three-point edge over Harris when respondents were asked which candidate is more trusted to handle the economy.

Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes up for grabs, is the biggest prize among the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeeds Biden in the White House.

Hours before Harris arrived in Pittsburgh, a new public opinion poll from Muhlenberg College indicated the vice president and Trump deadlocked at 48% in the Keystone State. It was the latest survey to point to an incredibly close contest in the must-win state.

If you're looking for a middle ground between the relatively low growth potential of savings and the higher risks associated with stocks and shares, you could consider lower-risk investments.

Be aware, however, that even with supposedly low-risk investments, there remains a risk that you could lose some or all of your money.

No investment is risk-free, but there's a wide spread of how much risk is involved.

Stocks and shares are regarded as higher risk investments because the price of shares can fluctuate quickly and frequently.

Fortunately, if you're happy to take a little more risk than simply leaving your money in a savings account, but don't want full-blown exposure to a handful of stocks and shares, several low-risk investment options exist.

The following investments can help boost your returns more quickly than a plain savings account. But keep in mind they are deemed 'low risk', not 'no risk'. There is still the potential to lose your money.

Note: before considering low-risk investments, ensure you have a 'rainy day' fund in place. This might be a cash pile worth between three to six months of your financial needs safely stored on deposit.

1. Money market funds

A money market fund offers a slightly higher return than you'd receive from a cash deposit.

Instead of investing in bonds (see below) or stocks and shares, money market funds invest in short-term debt. This is bought from governments, banks and companies with strong balance sheets and high credit ratings. A small amount of interest is paid in return.

This makes a money market fund a stable, low-risk investment because the short timeframes mean there's less uncertainty. It also offers more diversification than holding cash under the roof of one bank.

Money market funds can be a good option if you're looking for somewhere to 'park' your money en route to fulfilling a longer-term financial plan. For example, where you intend to invest in equities in the near term but haven't decided where.

2. Government bonds

Bonds tend to be more secure and less volatile than stocks and shares. In terms of risk, regard them as a half-way house between having your cash on deposit and equity investing. They can be traded on markets in the same way as stocks and shares.

In the UK, government bonds are known as 'gilts', while in the US they are referred to as 'Treasuries'.

When you buy a bond, you lend money to the issuer in return for interest payments during the life of the bond (known as the 'coupon'), plus the return of your initial loan when the bond matures.

Bonds are also referred to as 'fixed interest securities' because, as an investor, you know in advance the return you'll receive on your investment.

The interest rate you receive varies according to the bond. The riskier the bond, the higher the interest rate - and this is coupled with the increased chance of not getting back your original investment.

High-quality government debt from countries such as the UK and US (neither of which has ever defaulted on its repayment obligations) sits lower down the risk ladder than the debt issued by companies.

Ratings agencies, such as S&P, Moody's and Fitch, analyse countries and companies and rank their credentials in terms of the quality of debt that's being issued.

You can buy UK gilts from the Debt Management Office. Gilts can also be bought via a stockbroker or a bank using the Retail Purchase and Sale Service. This would incur fees, cutting down on any profits.

It's also possible to invest in a large number of fixed interest securities via a range of investment funds and exchange-traded funds - typically via investment platforms and trading apps - that specialise in holding bonds. Investing in bond funds via a stocks and shares individual saving account (ISA) provides a tax-exempt wrapper for your investments.

Tax treatment depends on one's individual circumstances and may be subject to future change. The content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be, nor does it constitute, any form of tax advice.

3. Corporate bonds

If you're willing to accept more risk in exchange for a larger interest payment, high-grade corporate bonds issued by established, high-performing companies typically offer returns higher than gilts.

While high-grade corporate bonds are relatively safe, you can still lose money investing in them if:

interest rates rise - the rates bonds pay are generally locked-in for a defined term, so your money won't have the capacity to earn a higher rate. If you wanted to sell your bonds, you might also have to sell them for less than you paid if overall interest rates have risen the issuer goes bust - investment-grade bonds are relatively safe, but they don't have the same security as money in bank accounts. That's why it's important to focus on debt issued by companies rated most likely to pay you back. Less highly-rated companies may offer higher rates, but there's a greater risk.

Many investment firms run funds specialising in this sector which can help to spread the risk further by providing exposure to an array of corporate bonds. Investing in corporate bond funds via a stocks and shares ISA once again provides tax-exempt status.

Bear in mind the content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be, nor does it constitute, any form of tax advice.

4. Annuities

Annuities, provided by insurance companies, can be bought with some or all of the proceeds of a pension. They offer a guaranteed income for life, or over a fixed time period.

You don't have to use the money built up in a pension to buy an annuity.

In recent years, insurers and financial advisors have reported renewed interest in annuities - and the security they provide - against a backdrop of volatile markets and challenging economic conditions.

In 2024, with inflation reducing but interest rates remaining relatively high, the returns on annuities have improved further.

5. Preference shares

There are two types of shares you can own in a company: ordinary shares and preference shares, with the latter conferring extra rights.

As a preference shareholder, you are at the front of the queue for dividend payments. A dividend is a distribution, usually in cash, paid by a company to its shareholders as a gesture, but are never guaranteed from year to year. The payments are met out of a company's earnings.

Companies can't pay ordinary dividends until the payouts to preferred shareholders have been made.

In addition to dividends, you may see your investment grow through a buyback. Recently, some companies have been buying back preference shares, usually at a slightly higher price than they were sold for, because preference stocks pay higher dividends - and therefore cost companies more - than corporate debt.

Preferred shareholders are also first in line for a claim on assets in the event a company goes bust.

6. Dividend-paying stocks

Certain ordinary stocks are also relatively safe options for investors seeking a higher yield in a low interest rate environment.

Income funds invest in these shares with the aim of generating a steady, though not guaranteed, but hopefully growing level of income through the dividends payments made by these companies.

Target shares tend to be those of stable, established companies that are known to pay competitive dividends, such as some of those listed on the FT-SE 100 index of the UK's leading companies.

7. Index funds

Index tracker funds offer investors exposure to a variety of shares, often at relatively low cost. They aim to copy the performance of certain stock market indices, such as the UK's FT-SE 100 or the S&P 500 in the US.

Index funds can hold hundreds, if not thousands, of companies. Diversification of this nature greatly decreases investment risk, while still offering the potential for elevated returns.

As an investor in a tracker fund, you can only (at best) expect to mimic the performance of a particular index. It's important to remember that the money you invest in a tracker will, over time, follow the movements of an index - both down as well as up."
Joe Scarborough: Business owners and conservatives call Trump out over tariff obsession,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/trump-tariffs-economic-plan-wall-street-journal-john-deere-rcna172685,2024-09-25T18:07:06Z,"On Tuesday in Georgia, Donald Trump delivered what was billed by his campaign as a speech on the economy. During those remarks, Trump continued to pitch tariffs as a way to lower costs for Americans. He called tariffs ""one of the most beautiful words I've ever heard"" and ""music to my ears.""

That speech came just one day after the former president threatened tariffs on John Deere, following the company's announcement that it would shift some of its U.S.-based production out of the country.

""As you know, they've announced a few days ago that they are going to move a lot of their manufacturing business to Mexico,"" Trump said on Monday in Pennsylvania. ""I am just notifying John Deere right now that if you do that, we are putting a 200% tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States.""

Business owners, conservatives and even The Wall Street Journal editorial board have not been shy to say what they think of Trump's tariff proposal. On Tuesday, the WSJ editorial board laid out their thoughts clearly, publishing a piece titled, ""A Deere in Trump's Political Headlights."" The first sentence reads, ""Hard to believe, but Donald Trump is giving U.S. companies a reason to think Kamala Harris might be better for their business.""

Yes, you read that right. The conservative-friendly Wall Street Journal editorial board says Trump's incessant talk of tariffs is making business owners think a Harris administration would put forward economic proposals that would be friendlier toward their companies.

Trump has dumbed down his already inane economic policies, so that now it all comes down to tariffs. If you ask him about child care, he talks to you about tariffs. If you ask him about jobs, he talks about tariffs. If you ask him about the deficit, he talks about tariffs.

He says tariffs will not hurt middle-class people, that they won't be inflationary. Yes, they will. Trump can't reverse the laws of economics any more than he can reverse the laws of physics."
Jobs That Will Benefit From Interest Rate Cuts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/25/jobs-that-will-benefit-from-interest-rate-cuts/,2024-09-25T17:52:04Z,"The Federal Reserve initiated its first interest rate reduction last week, lowering rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. As the central bank appears more assured in its ability to control inflation, the Fed is now turning its attention to bolstering employment in the United States.

During periods of low interest rates, industries that rely heavily on borrowing for growth could experience a notable surge in profitability. The reduced cost of borrowing would not only fuel growth and innovation, but could also create a ripple effect that enhances job opportunities and career advancement for American workers.

As companies capitalize on favorable financing conditions, they are more likely to invest in talent development and workforce expansion, making this an opportune time for individuals seeking to advance their careers.

Additionally, by reducing the cost of borrowing for major purchases, like homes and cars, as well as easing the burden of credit card debt, these rate cuts are poised to increase the disposable income of Americans. This extra cash in consumers' pockets is expected to stimulate spending, which in turn could boost economic growth.

As consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, the potential impact of lower interest rates on the overall economy could be significant.

As economic activity surges, job creation often follows, touching multiple sectors of the economy.

Consumer spending power is likely to drive demand across various discretionary industries, including retail, hospitality and leisure. As companies in these sectors expand to meet growing consumer appetites, they are expected to create new employment opportunities.

For instance, retailers may need to hire more staff to handle increased sales volumes, while hotels and restaurants might expand their workforce to accommodate a surge in travel and dining out.

Lower interest rates typically vitalize the housing market by making mortgages more affordable, leading to increased demand for homes. Real estate agencies may need to expand their workforce to handle higher transaction volumes.

Moreoverover, lower borrowing costs make financing more accessible for developers, which can spur investments in residential and commercial construction projects.

There will be a likely surge in demand for skilled labor across various construction specialties, as well as boosting employment in related fields such as architecture, engineering and building materials manufacturing. As more construction projects become financially viable, there may be an uptick in infrastructure development and renovation work, further expanding job opportunities.

Lower interest rates can stimulate investment in high-growth sectors, making it easier for tech startups and established companies to secure funding. This influx of capital is likely to fuel a surge in hiring across various tech roles, from software development to data science and artificial intelligence.

Tech companies may also be more inclined to invest in research and development, potentially creating new product lines and services that require additional headcount.

This environment is likely to spur job creation in areas such as mortgage lending, as more consumers seek to purchase homes or refinance existing loans. Investment banking could see increased activity, with companies looking to capitalize on cheaper borrowing costs for mergers, acquisitions and expansions. Furthermore, the wealth management sector may experience growth as investors seek professional guidance to navigate the changing economic landscape.

It will be more affordable for businesses to invest in new equipment, facilities and production lines. This economic shift is likely to encourage manufacturers to expand operations and their workforce, as well as spark hiring in supply chain management, logistics and research and development.

As manufacturing becomes more cost-effective, there could be an uptick in reshoring efforts, bringing production back to domestic facilities and further expanding job opportunities."
The Hidden Costs Of Healthcare Price Controls,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ritanumerof/2024/09/25/the-hidden-costs-of-healthcare-price-controls/,2024-09-25T17:45:48Z,"Government-imposed price controls, which establish limits on what can be charged for a good or service, are often promoted as a way to stabilize costs for consumers. In healthcare, price controls cap the costs of treatment and pharmaceutical products. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, for instance, capped out-of-pocket prescription drug costs in Medicare and requires drug companies that raise their drug prices faster than inflation to pay Medicare a rebate. In the recent presidential debate, Vice President Kamala Harris advocated for expanding these IRA measures -- a move that aligns with her official policy platform, which plans to decrease patient costs by extending the $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket spending to all Americans.

Government intervention, regardless of the industry, distorts the market. Healthcare is no exception to this rule, and the effect of such intervention over decades has brought us to the crisis we face today in access to healthcare and its affordability. Consider the example of Diagnosis-Related Groups, which were introduced in 1983 and significantly altered market dynamics.

CMS intervened to lower rising healthcare costs and bend the cost curve by introducing DRGs as a way to create more discipline among hospitals, moving from usual and customary rates to a more predictable payment system. Unfortunately, CMS never dealt with quality or accountability and failed to connect payment to outcomes. More complex coding schemes have been introduced to enable physicians and healthcare systems to capture more revenue, adding to the administrative overhead but not improving outcomes. The approach didn't bring costs under control and reimbursement for specific DRGs has continued to be under pressure. Over the years delivery organizations have cost shifted to commercial payers where the reimbursement has been significantly higher than what Medicare pays.

A RAND study found that in 2022, private health plans paid hospitals 254% of what Medicare would have paid, meaning those with private health insurance are in effect subsidizing Medicare recipients, all because the federal government warps the market by underpaying for care and failing to demand accountability across the continuum of care. To the extent healthcare systems make more money by treating patients in more intensive settings, they are incented to do so. This practice may offset some revenue loss from reimbursement pressure, but it raises overall healthcare costs and doesn't get to the root of the problem. Commercial payers have pushed back, leaving healthcare delivery organizations scrambling for innovative ways to capture sufficient revenue to stay afloat. Many have gone under, others have merged with larger systems, services have been cut, and quality has deteriorated.

While trying to solve complex problems with simple solutions is tempting, it typically doesn't work. Adding more price controls into the mix will push organizations to find creative workarounds that are unlikely to solve the underlying issues in healthcare delivery -- how to get to better health outcomes at lower total cost of care.

Government intervention to lower cost by imposing controls will have similar impact for other sectors of healthcare. Price controls applied to the pharmaceutical industry will have a chilling effect on innovation as research and development budgets will be cut, especially in areas focused on rare disease. A recent study found that pharmaceutical sales revenues correlate strongly with investment in R&D. Pharmaceutical companies eliminate research and product development jobs when price controls artificially depress the fair market value of their products.

Drug manufacturers can't pursue all 'good' ideas; they need to evaluate market potential, unmet medical need and the likelihood of positive clinical trial results. They must go through the hard work of getting regulatory approval, adequate reimbursement and market adoption. This is already a risky business. If one in ten drugs makes it to market, that one success needs to fund the other nine failures. Putting price caps in place will have a dampening effect on which assets pharma companies choose to advance, thus diminishing the availability of breakthrough new drugs.

If the goal is better health outcomes at lower total cost of care -- something CMS has been attempting to achieve for over 40 years -- Vice President Harris' price control policy proposals are not the answer. Instead, they are just more of the same. And while there is a role for government oversight -- to ensure that organizations are held accountable and operate transparently -- price controls are a step beyond what is necessary for effective regulation. They distort the market without bringing down the total cost of care. When regulators artificially control prices in one place, creative firms will find ways to make money in other areas.

Piecemeal solutions, that force change in one area without coordination across the healthcare ecosystem, will continue to fail to solve underlying problems. As I note in my book Bringing Value to Healthcare, any realistic attempt at reform ""must comprehensively address the extraordinarily complex array of multiple stakeholders involved. In particular, this includes drug, device and diagnostics manufacturers; hospital and physician providers; ourselves as consumers and payers (including the government)."" Only then, once we meaningfully reform the payment system that drives the industry as a whole, will we see prices begin to fall and patient outcomes meaningfully improve."
Whither Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevendesmyter/2024/09/25/whither-inflation/,2024-09-25T17:36:59Z,"We were lucky enough to have the great David Zervos speaking to us at our MAIS conference in Oxford on Wednesday afternoon, just hours before the release of the Fed's rate decision. There are few who understand the Fed reaction function so intimately or discuss it so eloquently. David suggested that he thought 50bps was a definite possibility, expounding on the reasons that might prompt this deeper cut. Later, over dinner, as we were listening to Tom Holland discussing great historical decisions, news of the 50bps cut dropped. And my phone and those of many others at the conference, looked something like this (posted on our #marketmemes Slack channel by my colleague William J. Ross).

The markets took a little while to digest the implications of the cut - the mood was, eventually, one of optimism. It feels, though, in discussion within the firm and with analysts and investors outside it, that many things remain up in the air. Former Kansas Banking Commissioner Michelle Bowman became the first dissenting voice on a Fed decision since 2005. It was striking, not just because there has been so much focus on the dynamics and politics of the September decision, but because Jerome Powell has been so keen to promote his tenure as one of consensus and compromise.

Bowman said that she was voting for a 25bps cut because she was worried that inflation, far from tamed, was merely temporarily abated. ""I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continued to be near estimates of full employment,"" she said in a speech to the Kentucky Bankers' Association.

One of the many fascinating things that Zervos said to our gathering of investors in Oxford was that Ben Bernanke's anatomization of Fed activity in response to the GFC laid the foundation for subsequent interventions. And the key message Bernanke drew? The Fed should have gone earlier, and bigger. So it was that when Covid hit, the central bank response was both more significant and more multi-faceted than anything we have seen before. As such, given the scale of the stimulus one understands Bowman's impulse that suggests we wait and see if inflation really has been beaten into abeyance.

Henry Neville, who chairs our Tuesday market meetings, drew our attention to several interesting charts this week. Firstly, this one, showing that while the volatility of growth readings has normalized post-Covid, inflation volatility remains elevated.

It's striking that, while growth volatility (the turquoise line) has fallen back to long run averages of around 2%, inflation volatility (dark blue line), after moderating somewhat, remains persistently elevated, indicating the potential for a stickier and more prolonged inflation than many seem to expect.

Some upstream inflationary inputs are starting to look a little ominous. Take semiconductors: one of the key elements driving optimistic prognoses of economic performance. After a Covid-related spike, semiconductors continued a long-term downward pricing trend through 2021 and 2022 before, coinciding almost exactly with the launch of Chat GPT4 in March 2023, chip pricing began to appreciate dramatically. It's clear that this major driver of economic growth is a potential inflationary stumbling block in the months and years ahead, particularly given the possible pass-through effects to be taken into account here (whereby semiconductors pricing tends to be reflected in a lagged fashion in end products). For instance, in the 21/22 inflation spike, semiconductors were one of the key bottlenecks that (indirectly) caused the run-up of used car pricing.

Bowman also mentioned the neutral policy rate or r* - the rate at which the economy operates at equilibrium between saving and investment (and thus between employment and inflation) - that was being used by the Fed as the basis for decisions was, in her view, much higher than her colleagues thought. As such, she is implicitly arguing that the economy requires higher rates in order to avoid stoking inflation. The interplay of policy rates and r* is beyond the scope of this article, but I'd strongly recommend this Bank for International Settlements - BIS paper by Gianluca Benigno et al, which looks at how r* has changed in a post-pandemic world Quo vadis, r*? The natural rate of interest after the pandemic (bis.org). The question of where r* was and what it implied was something that I chewed over regularly with my friend and former colleague Ben Funnell. Ben sent me this chart, which shows that over recent history, policy rates have consistently undershot the neutral rate.

He also sent me the chart below showing the break in the relationship between economic growth and r*, a relationship that has tracked closely since the 1960s.

Again, I'm not sure this is the place to delve too deeply into economic wonkery, but I do think we might think about the fact that so much in the new regime seems to be operating somewhat differently to how it operated before, and so cautious incrementalism might be preferable as an approach rather than yet again reaching for the policy bazookas that - at least in the near and medium term - bailed us out of the GFC and Covid."
Harris-Trump showdown: New poll indicates who has edge in most important battleground,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-new-poll-indicates-who-has-edge-most-important-battleground,2024-09-25T16:32:35Z,"PITTSBURGH, PA - A new public opinion poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris holding the edge over former President Trump in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.

Forty-eight percent of those questioned in Monmouth University survey of registered Pennsylvania voters released on Wednesday said they are definitely or probably supporting Harris in the presidential election, with 45% saying the same thing about Trump.

And the poll, conducted Sept. 19-23, indicates Harris holding a four-point advantage over Trump among those who said they are extremely motivated to cast a ballot in the White House race.

The survey is the latest to indicate a close contest in Pennsylvania, which, with 19 electoral votes up for grabs, is the biggest prize among the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeeds Biden in the White House.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, makes up the Democrats' so-called 'blue wall,' which the party reliably won for a quarter-century in presidential elections until Trump narrowly carried all three states in his 2016 White House victory. But Biden - with razor-thin margins - won back all three states four years ago.

Both Harris and Trump have repeatedly made stops this summer in Pennsylvania. And while the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven swing states, more money has been spent to run spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds. And both sides have dished out more dollars to reserve airtime going forward in the Keystone State than any of the other swing states, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.

The release of the poll comes a couple of hours before Harris returns to Pennsylvania - which is considered a must win state for the Democratic presidential nominee - to deliver what her campaign is billing as a major speech on the economy.

THIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS THE UPPER HAND IN THE 2024 CASH DASH

The vice president, at her address at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, is expected to offer up the most substantial comments on the economy since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticker just over two months ago.

A senior Harris campaign official said the vice president will spotlight her ""pragmatic"" approach to the economy and will offer up ""practical, realistic solutions.""

The official added that Harris - who has been derided by Trump as ""Comrade Kamala"" - will describe herself as ""a capitalist"" who ""understands the limitations of government and has always sought to take good ideas from wherever they come and harness the power of innovation.""

Her address comes a day after the former president, in a speech in battleground Georgia, gave what was also billed a major economic speech, and vowed to lower taxes on U.S.-based manufacturers.

With less than six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5 and with early in-person voting or absentee balloting underway in nearly two-dozen states, just about every poll indicates that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans.

This, as nation's economic recovery from the pandemic-inflicted recession continues, but inflation remains a leading concern among voters.

WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THE ECONOMY?

When it comes to which presidential candidate can better handle the economy, Trump continues to have the edge - but his margins over Harris differ dramatically depending on the poll.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the LATEST Fox News poll, and just 2 points in an AP/NORC survey.

In Pennsylvania, the new Monmouth University survey indicates Trump holding a three-point edge over Harris when respondents were asked which candidate is more trusted to handle the economy.

Harris, according to the senior campaign aide, is expected in her speech to premiere some new manufacturing proposals and highlight her ideas to lower costs, invest in American innovation and entrepreneurship, and her goal of ""leading the world in the industries of the future.""

The senior official added that Harris is expected to argue that ""for Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors.""

And that she will reiterate her charge that Trump has ""no intention to grow the middle class, because all he cares about is helping himself and billionaires like him.""

Trump has repeatedly charged that Harris' plans for the economy are inept and potentially dangerous.

""If you think four years of Harris-Biden is bad, that's nothing compared to four years of Harris-Walz,"" the Trump campaign has argued.

The One Chart You Need To Track To Predict The Stock Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/09/25/the-one-chart-you-need-to-track-to-predict-the-stock-market/,2024-09-25T15:26:42Z,"People are still fixated about the interest rate moves. Interest rates up markets down, interest rates down markets up. Interest rates are generally considered the be all and end all of monetary policy.

This is old hat.

As any payday loan shark will tell you, it is the availability of money not the interest rate that is important. Conversely, what is the use of 1% interest rates if no one will lend you money? We think of the availability of money for borrowing as simply a function of a borrower's salesmanship or collateral or even the toughness of the lender, and in the old model that works just fine. However, in the modern world it's more a case of the availability of money rather than anything else.

When money is easy lenders run out of good people to lend to and conversely, when money is tight lenders run out of money to lend to good borrowers. As such, today it is the availability of cash to lend that is key rather than a percentage point of interest here or there. On the margin the rate counts but QE and QT are king because they control availability of cash or in modern parlance liquidity. Interest rates are a big deal in the very long term but in the short term, when for example many corporations send IOUs to their banks just to get the cash to make payroll, the liquidity necessary to make this apparently precarious sort of situation possible is much more important. Without the access to liquidity cash there is no long term. This is what the ballooned Fed balance sheet is all about. It ballooned because the Federal Reserve used it as a way of taking long term uncash-like debit and turning it into instruments with more cash-like properties.

Ultimately, the extremities of the macroeconomic response to the pandemic caused inflation, and to drag inflation-causing cash out of the system the means by which it was created, expansion of the federal Reserve's balance sheet, had to be reversed.

That is what has been happening. Here is the full process so far, care of the Fed's site:

As an aside, the Federal Reserve is bringing down its balance sheet at roughly $1 trillion a year. So normality resumes nominally in three years. But if you roll in inflation that will be perhaps just two years. Yet along the lines of fun facts, blowing up the balance sheet has proved to be a life saver in two major economic emergencies so you could forgive folks for imagining a large balance sheet might not be the work of the devil that needs to be cast out. We will see, however, while this chart shows the Fed's plan at work, there is another that shows the criticality of this process and that is where we need to look for the canary in the U.S. economies economic coal mine.

What is it? It's a graph of excess money in the system. How, why? When the system makes too much money, banks end up with cash they can't lend. They don't want to have it sloshing around and the central bank offers them a home for it with a nice interest rate. This is what the ""reverse repo"" is, a deposit account for the excess money in the system; it's a way of keeping the case out of trouble, so to speak. So here is a long-term chart of it to give context, care of the New York Fed:

If you relate to this representing excess money and you consider the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, you can see the Federal Reserve reeling in inflation in these two charts.

You can also see that while the Fed is unwinding its balance sheet it is slowing its pulling of cash from the market. Be assured, it has plenty of clever ways to manipulate money supply, it's what it does.

Optically, you can guess it's queasy about throwing the economy into recession, so it is leaving a margin of too much money in the systemin much the way it did 2014-2018.

The recent drop of 0.5% in interest rates and the recent deceleration of tightening shown by the reverse repo suggests the regulators feel they have reached a pivot point.

For the investor and trader, however, the procession of the repo and balance sheet are indicators of the long-term direction of travel for Fed policy.

I would suggest these charts together sketch a policy of looser money than many expect and therefore a little more lively inflation than is publicly targeted. It also shows a proactive policy of not crashing markets, which of course is a lovely safety net to have under any investor.

The next way point in post-election. If the Fed is actually diverging from long-term policy it will be because of the election and attempting to lower the rise of any emergency in the run up to it. Therefore, it would go back on track after the next president is selected and that will appear in new trajectories in these charts.

While there are plenty of matters to keep investors up at night right now, the Fed is not one of them. What is more, they telegraph their intentions and their actions are updated in these charts every week and it is from these charts that all others flow."
Rob Walton Just Joined The $100 Billion Club For The First Time,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/09/25/rob-walton-just-joined-the-100-billion-club-for-the-first-time/,2024-09-25T14:10:06Z,"The eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton is the first member of America's richest family to boast a 12-figure fortune.

With Walmart stock at an all-time high, Rob Walton -- the eldest son of the retail giant's founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) -- is worth an estimated $100 billion, making him the first member of America's richest family to boast a 12-figure fortune.

Walmart shares are up 54% year to date, with shoppers flocking to the retailer's ""Every Day Low Prices"" to escape high inflation. As a result, Rob Walton, 79, now ranks as the 16th richest person in the world, just ahead of his brother Jim Walton, 76, and sister Alice Walton, 74, who are worth $98.8 billion and $91.3 billion, respectively as of 9:30 am Eastern time Wednesday. On September 5, Alice Walton reclaimed the title of world's wealthiest woman for the first time since May 2022, overtaking L'Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who briefly became the first female centibillionaire in June and is now worth $87.4 billion.

Rob Walton joins 15 others in the $100 billion club, including the world's richest person Elon Musk (estimated net worth: $265.5 billion), French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault ($175.5 billion) and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang ($106.7 billion). In 2021, only four people held fortunes that spanned a dozen digits and a year before that there was just one, Jeff Bezos.

Walton was two months shy of turning 18 years old in 1962, when his father opened the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas. After graduating from the University of Arkansas in 1966, Walton went to law school at Columbia University, before joining the Tulsa-based law firm that helped take Walmart public in 1970. He joined the family retailer in 1978 and was appointed vice chairman four years later. When his father died in 1992, he took over as chairman.

Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director, including more than 20 years as chairman-a role that has been held by his son-in-law Greg Penner since 2015. Penner also replaced Walton as controlling owner of the NFL's Denver Broncos last October, after a group led by Walton bought the team for a record $4.7 billion in 2022.

Despite selling more than $28 billion of Walmart stock -- and giving away more than $11 billion of the retailer's shares -- over the past decade, Sam Walton's heirs still own 45% of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth, due to significant stock buybacks that have kept the family's stake from being diluted. Forbes estimates that three-quarters of the clan's shares are split almost evenly between the families of Rob, Jim and Alice Walton, and that most of the rest belongs to the heirs of their brother John Walton (d. 2005): his widow Christy Walton, 75, and son Lukas Walton, 37, who are worth $17 billion and $35.1 billion, respectively.

While Alice Walton has dedicated her life to curating art and other forms of philanthropy, Jim Walton was replaced by his son Steuart Walton on Walmart's board in 2016 but still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. With Walmart stock on the rise, both Jim and Alice may soon join their brother-who Forbes estimates has given away slightly less of his Walmart shares, cash and other stock-to nonprofits, in the $100 billion club too."
Before & After: How The ACA Is A Step Forward For Small Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/2024/09/25/before--after-how-the-aca-is-a-step-forward-for-small-businesses/,2024-09-25T13:37:39Z,"Rhett Buttle covers the intersection of the private and public sector.

Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released an analysis showing that 3.3 million small business owners and self-employed workers had healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace in 2022. This means that nearly one in five (18%) of small business owners and self-employed workers between the ages of 21 and 64 received coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces, compared to 6% of the rest of the population in that age range.

""The Affordable Care Act has been transformative for millions of small business owners and entrepreneurs who rely on the law for affordable and reliable health care coverage, including 3.3 million in 2022. The Affordable Care Act allows Americans with dreams of starting their own businesses to pursue new opportunities without fear of being unable to access or afford health insurance, creating a more dynamic and productive economy over the long run,"" said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen.

This is roughly the 10th year that the Affordable Care Act has been in place since it opened to individuals in 2014. When one looks at the success of a monumental piece of legislation like this one, it is important to remember the landscape before it was implemented and how things have changed since then. Here is that picture for Main Streets across America.

Before: The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, with the Marketplace opening on January 1, 2014. Before it opened, many small business owners and self-employed workers were not able to obtain health insurance through their jobs and had limited options for purchasing affordable, high-quality health coverage. In most cases, the coverage was expensive and sometimes denied due to pre-existing conditions, and the quality of the plans was very inconsistent and hard to understand or compare.

After: Today, any aspiring entrepreneur can pursue launching a business without the fear of not being able to obtain healthcare coverage. In 2022, nearly one in five (18%) of small business owners and self-employed workers ages 21-64 relied on the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces for coverage. This in turn has encouraged entrepreneurship, freeing workers to leave large employers and not be forced to stay there because of insurance. A record 19 million business applications have been filed since the Biden-Harris Administration took office.

""It is no coincidence that the Biden-Harris Administration has seen a historic Small Business Boom alongside a surge in Marketplace enrollment among small business owners. With 19.4 million new business applications since the President took office, millions of entrepreneurs continue to rely on the Affordable Care Act for health insurance in order to pursue their American dream of business ownership,"" said U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman.

""Small business owners and entrepreneurs are the engine of America's economy. We are ensuring small businesses have access to affordable health care so they can focus on starting and growing businesses, not on whether they can afford health coverage,"" said Vice President Kamala Harris. ""I'm proud that over 4 million small business owners and self-employed workers have coverage through the ACA, up from 3.3 million in 2022. I will always support small businesses and invest in entrepreneurs by strengthening and expanding the ACA, and by rejecting Republican efforts to repeal it.""

This data also shows that the small business owners and workers are also utilizing the enhancements to the Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits, which can lower monthly payments. The American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act made the credit available to people purchasing coverage through the Marketplaces by increasing the amount of it for individuals with low and moderate incomes and expanding the eligibility for people with middle incomes facing high premiums. In 2022, more than 2.7 million (82%) of small business owners and self-employed workers claimed the Premium Tax Credit, including about 285,000 taxpayers with incomes over 400% of the poverty level. Unfortunately, these expanded tax credits are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 if Congress does not take action to extend them or make them permanent.

""Marketplace enrollment has surged under the Biden-Harris Administration's economic policies, which have made premiums far more affordable for American small businesses and entrepreneurs,"" said Secretary Yellen.

In addition, the data showed that small business owners and self-employed workers accounted for 28% of all individuals covered by Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage. In looking at this, one can see the importance of stable healthcare options to Main Streets across the country. It also shows how critical the Affordable Care Act Marketplace may be to this small business boom."
Bidenomics architect is Kamala's economic whisperer,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidenomics-architect-kamalas-economic-whisperer,2024-09-25T13:12:45Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris would prefer voters not remember her role in the economic disaster of the past three and a half years. She has distanced herself from President Biden and the agenda bearing his name, ""Bidenomics.""

But in this life, we are judged by our actions and the company we keep. The truth is that Harris was the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the budget-busting packages that supercharged inflation. One of her closest advisers today, Brian Deese, is the architect of ""Bidenomics.""

Voters who think Harris would bring a new outlook to the White House should think again. If she is elected, the same old crew would be in charge. That means the next four years would look exactly like the last three and a half.

Prices have risen more than 20% across the board since Biden and Harris took office. The prices of many family staples have risen by more. Inflation has fallen from its peak of 9.6% in the summer of 2021, but it is still well above the Fed's 2% target.

TRUMP HAS A PLAN FOR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, HARRIS DOES NOT

Democrats and the financial press are declaring ""Mission Accomplished,"" but this is a calamitous economic record that has left Americans worse off and resentful. The blame falls squarely on Bidenomics and its promoters, such as Harris and Deese.

Bidenomics was the belief that a government spending bonanza could juice the economy after the turmoil caused by a pandemic, lockdowns and supply-chain disruptions.

Deese, who served as Biden's chair of the National Economic Council from 2021 to 2023, said this agenda was based on the ""unapologetic acknowledgement"" that government action was necessary to ""correct for market failures"" and create ""strong and inclusive growth."" He contrasted Bidenomics with Reaganomics, saying the Biden-Harris approach had ""a more rational understanding of the productive and constructive role that the public sector and public investment can play.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

The original sin of Bidenomics was the American Rescue Plan, which became law in March 2021. Harris was hardly a spectator to this event. She cast the tie-breaking vote for it in the Senate. The bill injected an eye-popping $1.9 trillion into an economy already awash in easy money.

The result of this spending binge was predictable: immediate and persistent inflation.

However, the Biden administration downplayed the damage as temporary and attempted to shift the blame. In 2021, Deese claimed that ""short-term inflationary pressures"" were ""not the issue."" He later predicted that inflation would ""moderate"" in 2022.

In fact, inflation hit a 41-year high in 2022 and still has not returned to the 2% annual rate considered normal. To this day, Harris crows that inflation is ""under 3%."" They can move the goalposts, but they can't change the facts.

CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS POUR COLD WATER ON HARRIS' NEW SMALL-BUSINESS TAX PROPOSAL

Worse still, the Biden-Harris administration used inflation as an excuse to double down on the very agenda that caused it. Concerns about inflation ""underscore why it's so important that we move forward"" with the next installment of Bidenomics, Deese said in 2021.

That would turn into the perversely titled ""Inflation Reduction Act,"" another debt bomb designed to promote green energy. Goldman Sachs estimates that the IRA's climate subsidies cost an additional $1.2 trillion, more than three times what its supporters claimed.

To no one's surprise but the administration's, the result of this spending was sustained inflation. Casey Mulligan at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity found that the administration's spending policies accounted for about half of the inflation our economy has suffered. A better name for the bill would've been the Inflation Acceleration Act.

It's little wonder Harris is running from the record of the past three and a half years. Democrats have dropped the term ""Bidenomics"" as swiftly as they dropped the man. Instead, Harris speaks of an ""opportunity economy."" Her boosters promote her approach as ""fair capitalism"" or ""middle-class capitalism.""

But if you peek behind the curtain, it's clear Harris hasn't learned from her mistakes in office. To the contrary, she is carrying forward the administration's belief that spending and government are the solution, not the problem.

Deese, who should've been sidelined after his plans caused the worst inflation in 40 years, is back as a trusted adviser. Harris' plans bear his fingerprints, from $25,000 government checks for homebuyers to a $6,000 payoff for new parents.

What To Know About Kamala Harris' Economic Agenda Ahead Of Speech Today,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/25/what-to-know-about-kamala-harris-economic-agenda-ahead-of-speech-today/,2024-09-25T13:08:00Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to build on her economic platform Wednesday when she delivers an economy-focused speech in Pennsylvania, after the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis.

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris will speak Wednesday at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, where Politico reports she's set to deliver substantive comments on the economy. An anonymous Harris aide told the publication the vice president's speech will paint her as being ""pragmatic"" on the economy and as ""a capitalist"" who ""understands the limitations of government and has always sought to take good ideas from wherever they come and harness the power of innovation."" The speech is expected to include new proposals on manufacturing and ""lowering costs, investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship, and leading the world in the industries of the future,"" the aide told Politico. Harris could then elaborate more on her economic agenda Wednesday evening, as she'll sit down with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle for her first one-on-one interview on a major network since becoming the Democratic nominee.

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals earlier in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."
Financial Heavyweights Offer Mixed Forecasts On Fed's Next Move,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danirvine/2024/09/25/financial-heavyweights-offer-mixed-forecasts-on-feds-next-move/,2024-09-25T13:00:10Z,"The decision by the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points has ignited lively discourse among financial titans, each offering their unique perspectives on the potential ramifications. As the economy teeters on the precipice of uncertainty, the question that looms large is whether this monetary maneuver will catalyze a soft landing or precipitate a tumultuous descent.

Leading the optimistic camp is Goldman Sachs, with its chief financial officer, Denis Coleman, expressing confidence that the Fed's decisive action has paved the way for averting a recession. Coleman's remarks during an interview with CNBC this week resonate with the sentiment that the 50 basis-point cut signals a new trajectory for monetary policy.

In Coleman's estimation, the rate reduction should ""unlock incremental amounts of confidence"" and ""reduce the cost of capital,"" thereby fostering an environment conducive to strategic business initiatives as the year draws to a close. His projections envision a ripple effect, wherein the lower interest rates will invigorate investment backlogs and catalyze increased market activity in the forthcoming year.

Echoing the consensus among Goldman Sachs economists, Coleman insists that a recession remains an unlikely scenario. Instead, he anticipates a gradual economic recovery, particularly in Europe, fueled by an uptick in investment once the presidential election concludes and manufacturing gains momentum, buoyed by the favorable interest rate environment.

The Fed's decision to embark on this rate-cutting cycle was framed by Chair Jerome Powell as a ""recalibration"" of policy, a response to the evolving dynamics of falling inflation and rising employment risks. This recalibration, according to Coleman, aims to strike a delicate balance, enabling the central bank to lower inflation without tipping the economy into a recessionary vortex - a feat he acknowledges as a ""tricky job to manage economies through transition.""

Austan Goolsbee, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has emerged as a vocal proponent of a dovish monetary policy stance. In remarks delivered at the National Association of State Treasurers Annual Conference this week, he advocated for ""many more rate cuts over the next year"" to facilitate a soft landing for the economy.

Goolsbee's rationale is anchored in the observation that inflation has ""way down"" from its peak and has recently converged around the Fed's 2% target. Concurrently, the 4.2% unemployment rate is widely regarded as indicative of full employment, aligning with the central bank's dual mandate.

Despite the favorable economic conditions, Goolsbee emphasizes the incongruity of maintaining elevated interest rates, which he deems unsuitable for an environment where the primary objective is to sustain, rather than cool, the economy. This dissonance, he argues, necessitates a significant downward adjustment of rates to preserve the prevailing economic equilibrium.

Goolsbee's advocacy for preemptive rate cuts stems from a desire to remain proactive in steering the economy toward a soft landing. His stance is encapsulated in the notion that ""if we want a soft landing, we can't be behind the curve,"" a sentiment that resonates with the Fed's mandate to maintain a delicate balance between inflation and employment.

While Goldman Sachs exudes optimism, JPMorgan Chase's Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Dimon, strikes a more skeptical tone. Dimon's reservations stem from a belief that inflation may not dissipate as readily as anticipated, casting doubt on the notion of a seamless soft landing for the economy.

Dimon's skepticism is rooted in his conviction that ""inflation is going to go away so easily,"" as he stated on stage at The Atlantic Festival last week. This sentiment stands in stark contrast to the prevailing narrative of cooling inflationary pressures, as evidenced by the recent 2.5% year-over-year increase in overall inflation - a figure that suggests a moderating trend.

Dimon's assessment of the likelihood of a soft landing for the U.S. economy remains cautiously optimistic, hovering around a 35% to 40% chance, highlighting his reluctance to ""count [his] eggs"" prematurely.

Ultimately, the resolution of this debate will unfold over time as the economy responds to the Fed's monetary maneuvers and the interplay of various macroeconomic forces. Divergent discourse is a testament to the enduring complexity of economic forecasting, where nuanced insights and prudent risk management strategies will remain invaluable assets for navigating the next chapter of this saga."
Why Interest Rates May Rise Again Sooner Than You Think,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/09/25/why-interest-rates-may-rise-again-sooner-than-you-think/,2024-09-25T12:29:46Z,"Rate cuts are finally here. So will we actually hit that vaunted ""soft landing"" everyone's been talking about?

Well, I've got a (contrarian, naturally!) take that I know most people haven't thought about -- especially since last week's jumbo 50-point rate cut dropped:

What if we hit a ""no landing"" scenario, where the economy ticks along and inflation comes back?

I'm bringing up that unpleasant idea because, usually in a rate-hiking cycle like the one that just ended, the central bank pushes the Fed funds rate higher until it breaks something.

But this time, it's not clear it has.

In fact, when it looked like it finally had -- when Silicon Valley Bank and friends crumbled to dust in March 2023 -- Jay blinked, and pumped liquidity into the market through the back door, a move we've referred to as ""Quiet QE"" here many times before:

With that in mind, last week's oversized cut was understandable: The Fed has been keen to take its foot off the brake for a while now. Now that inflation is close(-ish!) to its 2% target, it's making its move.

But here's the thing: The government's deficit spending is completely out of control. It is possible, perhaps probable, that Uncle Sam will overwhelm Powell.

For fiscal 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $1.9 trillion deficit on $4.9 trillion in tax receipts. (And yes, this is the CBO that paints its projections with rose-colored ink.) So we have nearly $5 trillion in revenues, and almost $7 trillion in expenditures.

A 40% overshoot.

Give me an extra $2 trillion, and I'll show you a good economy! But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation. So how do we profit if rates bottom before the media expects them to?

Here's an answer that might surprise you: We're buying a company that lends money to small businesses.

We're going with a small-business lender because an economy that's nicely humming along will encourage companies -- especially smaller, domestic firms seeing strong demand -- to expand in the near term.

In the long run, if rates show a hint of moving up, these same firms are also likely to try to front-run them by moving up their expansion plans.

It reminds me of the ""refi wave"" of 2020.

Remember that? I sure do. Your income strategist nearly missed the window to get in on it, despite many reminders from my wife. Fortunately, I managed to wake up and lock in a 2%+ mortgage before rates skyrocketed (and I wound up sleeping on the couch!).

I bring this up because we could see something similar on the business side: At any hint of rates bottoming, I expect the nation's companies to borrow more upfront to ""lock in"" an attractive rate, just like homeowners did.

And Ares Capital (ARCC) will be here for it.

Ares is a business development company (BDC), a class of firms that lend to small businesses. These days it's nearly impossible to get a business loan from a bank, so BDCs have stepped in to fill the gap, providing debt, equity and other finance solutions.

A key thing to keep in mind about BDCs is that they get special tax privileges, and in exchange, they must return at least 90% of their taxable profits to shareholders as dividends. They trade just like regular common stocks, with tickers we buy and sell.

(If this sounds like a real estate investment trust, or REIT, to you, it's because REITs get the same deal from Uncle Sam.)

As with REITs, the tax savings mean more money available to send out to us as dividends, juicing the yields on these stocks. (ARCC, as we'll discuss momentarily, pays an outsized 9.5% dividend today.)

Ares, unlike many BDCs, builds real long-term value (I've been hard on BDCs in the past for chasing too many bad loans instead of creating shareholder value). Ares was, for example, one of the only BDCs that kept on lending in 2020.

On the dividend front, the company's 61 cents a share earnings last quarter easily covered the 48-cent per share payout. A 79% payout ratio is great in the land of BDCs.

And about that dividend: Ares not only yields 9.5% but has a history of hiking its payout. I know I don't have to tell you that this is a rare setup in dividend-land: We usually have to pick between a payout that grows (but with a low current yield) or a high yield now.

ARCC gives us both!

Look at this chart, generated through our recently upgraded ""toy"" here at Contrarian Outlook -- our Income Calendar dividend tracker:

The ""bump"" at the end of 2022 was a special dividend. Ares keeps a ""spillover"" of extra earnings that it pays out to shareholders periodically, or it may choose to keep these funds on hand for a rainy lending day.

Plus, Ares increased its net asset value (NAV) over the past year. And those gains may begin to accelerate with a reheating economy."
Fed Interest Rate Cuts Ease Clean Energy Headwinds,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/09/25/fed-interest-rate-cuts-ease-clean-energy-headwinds/,2024-09-25T11:58:13Z,"What side of the bed did you wake up on today? The answer might shape your view of clean energy's prospects in the United States.

If you woke up on the right side, it's easy to be flush with optimism. This year 96% of the new power added to America's electric grid will come from wind, solar, and storage, and almost all the projects in our development pipeline are clean energy.

The Inflation Reduction Act created unprecedented 10-year policy certainty for U.S. renewables, which spent decades living or dying with one- or two-year extensions of their primary tax credits, often arriving during the week between Christmas and New Years.

Those 11 hour verdicts made investment decisions for the following year fraught with uncertainty, and there's nothing the business community hates more than a murky landscape.

On those days, it's easy to feel dour about the clean energy transition because we're still not moving fast enough to hit our climate targets. Renewables face strong headwinds from multiple fronts such as high interest rates, glacial progress connecting projects to the grid, supply chain constraints, and siting challenges.

Fortunately, the Fed just nudged us closer to the right side of the bed -- its recent rate cut will improve clean energy economics.

Renewables And High Interest Rates: As Unappetizing As Peanut Butter And Mustard Sandwiches

High interest rates and renewables don't pair well. The elevated rates of the past several years have artificially driven up the cost of wind and solar while shrinking the pool of available financing. As a result, developers have delayed or canceled potential projects, slowing new clean additions to the grid at a time when we need new power due to growing electricity demand, among other reasons.

Why do high rates have such an outsized impact? Because renewables run on free fuel from the wind and sun, most of their capital costs are upfront. However, high interest rates make this upfront capital more expensive to access, thus making projects cost more or even become financially unviable.

For example, an offshore wind project derives 70% of its expenditures from the cost of capital, compared to just 20% for a gas plant, according to Wood MacKenzie.

""Renewable energy in general is very, very susceptible to rising interest rates and offshore wind, even the most of all of the renewable energy sectors because it's so capital intensive,"" said Orsted Americas chief executive officer David Hardy. ""Our fuel is free, we say, but our fuel is really the cost of capital because we put so much capital out upfront.""

Additional analysis from Wood Mackenzie ""shows that a 2% increase in the risk-free interest rate pushes up the levelized cost of electricity for a renewables project by 20% compared with only 11% for a combined cycle gas plant.""

The Fed brings relief

The Fed's recent half point rate cut finally takes a step in the right direction for renewables, which had been languishing under the high rates designed to cut inflation.

""As interest rates rose 300 bps, it just fundamentally changed the economics of the projects, said Orsted CEO Hardy.

This month's rate cut will make it cheaper to access the upfront capital needed to build renewable energy projects. Although rate cuts and the cost of capital don't exactly mirror each other, they follow the same trendline. For example, the investment firm Lazard finds cutting the cost of capital from 7.7% to 5.4% lowers the cost of an offshore wind project by about 17%.

""As rates fall, projects become increasingly financially viable,"" Advait Arun, senior associate of energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise and Heatmap contributor, told Heatmap News.

More Relief On The Way (Hopefully)

The Fed's half point cut is a positive omen that should boost investor confidence. The real jolt could be on the way, however, as forecasters predict the Fed could cut rates another half point before the end of the year and another full point in 2025. That could result in tens of billions of dollars in new investment and a big shot of adrenaline for the clean energy industry.

""We can go quicker if that is appropriate. We can go slower if that's appropriate. We can pause if that's appropriate,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. ""This process evolves over time.""

Those cuts should help unclog America's clean energy development pipeline.

""If you see a bigger cut, you'll just see a huge sigh of relief, and people will start getting back to dusting off the business plans that were un-fundable as of yesterday,"" said Sean O'Sullivan, founder of the venture capital firm SOSV.

Not Just Utility-Scale: Help For Homeowners Too

The past half decade's high interest rates also impacted consumer choices, making mortgages and car loans more expensive. Rooftop solar was no exception -- high rates made rooftop solar loans more costly, slowing the development of another clean technology.

""The residential solar market has really been battered lately, and I do think [the cuts are] going to help tremendously,"" said Mona Dajani, partner and global co-chair of energy, infrastructure and hydrogen at law firm Baker Botts.

This cut means a $30,000 residential solar system could now be $3,000 cheaper.

""It may not sound like much, but this rate cut will save solar shoppers thousands of dollars in interest over the lifetime of their solar panels,"" said Spencer Fields, director of insights at EnergySage. ""Most solar adopters finance their system with a loan, so dropping interest rates will help make solar more affordable and likely drive-up demand for new commercial and residential solar installations.""

Let's Brighten Our Outlook

We all know what to do for a better shot at waking up on the right side of the bed -- limit screen time before going to sleep, get to bed at a reasonable hour, avoid a late day cup of coffee.

We also know what to do to feel more optimistic about the clean energy transition: Update and expand our electric grid, reform the interconnection process, improve transmission planning, and set state and national clean energy standards.

The high-interest rate headwinds are easing -- let's get to work on the other factors that might make us feel less pessimistic about the clean energy transition."
Will PPG Stock Rebound To $170?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/25/will-ppg-stock-rebound-to-170/,2024-09-25T11:02:12Z,"PPG Industries stock (NYSE: PPG), a paint, coatings, and specialty materials company, currently trades around $125 per share, about 25% lower than the peak level of over $170 seen in June 2021. PPG has fared much worse than its peer - The Sherwin-Williams Company stock (NYSE: SHW) - up 40% over this period. PPG stock has been weighed down due to the soft demand in Europe and a slow recovery in China. PPG saw its stock trading at around $110 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it's trading 15% above those levels. This compares with 51% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period.

PPG stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last three years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and uncertain geopolitical environment, could PPG face a similar situation as it did in recent years and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a strong jump? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $172 implies that PPG stock will have to gain around 35% from here, and we don't think that will materialize anytime soon. That said, we do think PPG stock has some room for growth. It currently trades at 1.6x trailing revenues, compared to its average P/S ratio of 2.0x over the last five years. Notably, the $150 average of analysts price estimate reflects around 18% upside from here.

Our detailed analysis of PPG Industries' upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how PPG stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

PPG stock saw a decline of 57% from $27 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to $11 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It surged post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $22 in early 2010, rising about 2x between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

PPG Fundamentals Over Recent Years

PPG Industries revenue rose from $16.8 billion in 2021 to $18.2 billion in 2023, led by better price realization. The company has seen increased sales for aerospace coatings and automotive OEM coatings. The company's operating margin decreased from 12.9% to 11.3% over the same period. This can primarily be attributed to higher wages and logistics costs. Its earnings per share stood at $5.35 in 2023, compared to the $6.01 figure in 2021. The company has been focusing on strategic actions to boost shareholder value. In that direction, the company has entered into an agreement to divest its silica product business for $310 million to QEMETICA.

Does PPG Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

PPG Industries' total debt has been around $7 billion in recent years, while its cash is around $1.2 billion. The company also garnered $2.1 billion in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. With its cash cushion, PPG appears to be in a position to service its near-term obligations.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe PPG Industries stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, soft demand in Europe and a slow recovery in China remain key risk factors to realizing these gains.

"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 25, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-25-24/,2024-09-25T10:56:45Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can park some cash? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are notorious for paying paltry interest rates. But it's easy to find rates 10x higher if you know where to look. For instance, online banks and credit unions often pay much higher rates than brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you land a basic savings account with a rate in that range, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, depicts the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the trade-off is you may have to meet strict conditions laid down by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.26% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's below last week's 0.26%.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."

Today, the mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.68%, according to Curinos. On a 15-year fixed mortgage, the average rate is 5.71%, and the average rate on a 30-year jumbo mortgage is 6.74%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) increased to 6.68% from 6.65% yesterday. This time last week, the 30-year fixed was 6.60%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.70%. This time last week, it was 6.62%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

According to the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of 100,000 will pay $644 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included) at today's interest rate of 6.68%. You'd pay approximately $131,918 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate is 5.71%, higher than it was one day ago. Last week, it was 5.67%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.74%. It was 5.69% this time last week.

At today's interest rate of 5.71%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $828 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $49,069 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today's average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage climbed 0.06 point from last week to 6.74%.

Borrowers with a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.74% will pay approximately $648 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,861.

To get an estimate of your mortgage costs, using a mortgage calculator can help.

Simply input the following information:

Buying a house is a huge purchase and can put a big dent in your savings. Before you start looking, it's important to calculate how much house you can afford and you're willing to spend.

Not only do you want to consider your income and debt, but you also want to factor in emergency savings and any long-term financial goals such as retirement or college.

These are some basic financial factors that go into home affordability:

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term."
Trump's Economic Plans Don't Add Up,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/25/trumps-economic-plans-dont-add-up/,2024-09-25T10:36:50Z,"As the presidential race enters its final month, both candidates are emphasizing the economy. What do the candidates offer? This blog looks at Donald Trump's economic ideas, and the next one will analyze Kamala Harris' proposals.

Analyzing Trump's economics -- or any of his policy ideas -- is challenging, because they often are sound bites with little underlying analysis or detail. And Trump pushes out new ideas virtually every day, with no underlying analysis of their impacts, making it even harder to keep track of his proposals.

We do know Trump supports extending and deepening regressive tax cuts favoring the wealthy and corporations, levying tariffs that will raise prices for all Americans and possibly start a trade war, and disrupting the labor market by deporting millions of immigrants.

Just this week, Trump talked about capping credit card interest rates at 10 percent, a proposal the Wall Street Journal editorial board compared to previous proposals by Bernie Sanders. No analysis was offered. We should expect more unvetted and unanalyzed ideas in the coming weeks, because that's how Trump campaigns.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who has covered Trump for years, recently said journalism is ""not built to deal with somebody who says things that are not true as often as he (Trump) does or speaks as incoherently as he often does.""

But analysts still try to understand Trump's proposals. Economists at Goldman Sachs in September reportedly concluded Trump's tariff and immigration policies would reduce US GDP in 2025 by half a percent, or about $140 billion, with associated job losses. (Trump's immigration proposals include using the National Guard and US military to deport between 15 and 20 million people.)

Again, it's hard to model Trump's economic ideas. I started working on this blog by going to his campaign's website with the official Republican platform. The platform leads off with twenty ""promises,"" followed by ten ""chapters"" that do not map directly to the twenty ""promises.""

The platform is virtually all broad statements with no policy specifics. Idea number one is to ""defeat inflation and quickly bring down all prices."" How? Cut wasteful government spending, produce more energy, and stop illegal immigration (whatever that has to do with inflation.)

How about the promise to ""build the greatest economy in American history?"" Deep tax cuts, cut regulations, and produce more energy. How to do those things? The platform, and the Trump campaign, remain silent on details.

Maybe we can use Trump's campaign speeches as a guide? That's what economists at the University of Pennsylvania did, trying to operationalize Trump's ideas and run them through their Penn-Wharton budget model, in order to ""project the policy proposals' fiscal, distributional, and economic effects.""

All Wharton really does is estimate federal budget deficit impacts over ten years. They don't -- and can't -- provide a full analysis of the likely economic impacts, in significant part because Trump hasn't provided enough detail to estimate them.

They model three of Trump's main tax cut proposals -- reauthorizing and extending regressive personal and business tax cuts ($4 trillion -- yes, trillion), eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, even for wealthy retirees ($1.2 trillion), and lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent ($600 billion).

For Wharton, that means the deficit under Trump increases by $5.8 trillion over ten years, or a net deficit increase of $4.1 trillion after factoring in some positive economic stimulus effects.

Several of Trump's key economic proposals -- most notably raising tariffs by 10 percent on all imports and by 60 percent on imports from China -- weren't modeled by Wharton. Trump says those tariffs would offset the lost tax revenue, but Wharton laconically notes that ""key implementation details...are missing,"" including the impact on prices and retaliation from trading partners. So they don't model the tariffs.

Others have tried to. The conservative Tax Foundation modeled the 10 percent tariff over ten years, calling it a ""tax hike"" on Americans of over $300 billion that would raise prices of imported goods and services. Adding in the China tariff increases the ten-year tax hike to $2.6 billion. They estimate the two tariffs, in a dynamic economic model with other investment proposals and foreign retaliation in trade, would reduce overall GDP.

According to the Tax Policy Foundation, Trump's two tariff proposals ""would lower average after-tax incomes of US households by about $1800, or 1.8 percent."" And although the tariffs would raise some gross revenues, net revenues would be lower by close to $1 billion ""because those tariffs would reduce other tax receipts"" through their negative effects on the economy.

But, just as we saw this week on the credit card interest proposal, Trump has no interest in specifying details of what his proposals would look like. He campaigns more like an entertainer or stand-up comic, testing out lines to see what the audience likes.

And offering new unspecified ideas allows him to influence the news cycle, as journalists, academics, and analysts chase the latest unvetted notion and try to think what it might mean.

Attempts to engage on policy specifics are washed away when Trump changes the subject, or distorts and falsifies issues repeatedly. (NPR analyzed an hour-long Trump news conference in August, and found ""at least 162 misstatements, exaggerations and outright lies in 64 minutes."")

So assessing Trump's economic plans is hard. But we do know he advocates deeply regressive tax cuts tilted towards the wealthiest households; tariffs that would raise prices for Americans and possibly start a trade war; likely skyrocketing federal deficits; and deportations and immigration policies that would cut our labor force and shake our legal system. That's not an economy -- or a society -- that we should want."
How To Buy Treasury Bills: A Guide On T-Bills For Beginners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/how-to-buy-treasury-bills-guide-on-t-bills/,2024-09-24T21:57:40Z,"Treasury bills, known also as T-Bills, are short-term U.S. government securities that mature in one year or less, and are typically sold at a discount. T-bills may be good investments for investors who are extremely risk-averse or need a place to park funds when they are planning to make a large purchase.

The Treasury Department sells Treasury Bills, which are short-term Treasury marketing securities backed by the U.S. government, at a discount from the par amount (also called face value), whose price is determined when they are auctioned publicly. They are considered safe investments because there is virtually no chance of default.

While T-Bills are ""safe,"" they earn relatively little compared with other investment vehicles and, in some cases, may also cause the investor to lose money. T-Bills are best for fiscally conservative investors who are very risk-averse or for those who need a temporary holding place for funds they've earmarked for an upcoming large purchase of, for instance, a car or house. T-Bills may mature in four, eight, 13, 17, 26 and 52 weeks. Except for a Cash Management Bill, attractive to institutional investors, you can buy all the others electronically or a bank, broker or dealer.

A benefit of owning T-Bills is that earnings are exempt from state and local taxes. However, you must pay federal taxes on any earnings.

To buy new issue T-Bills, you can do so through TreasuryDirect.gov, the primary market, which charges no fees, or through a bank, broker or dealer, which likely bills you a fee or commission or both.

The Treasury Department publicly auctions off new issue T-Bills through TreasuryDirect weekly in short maturity lengths of four-week, eight-week, 13-week, 17-week and 26-week; 52-week bills go to auction every four weeks.

You can also buy pre-owned T-Bills using a bank, broker or dealer.

Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts.

The pluses of investing in T-Bills are that they are safe, easy to buy and readily available.

The best thing to say about investing in T-Bills is that they are safe-that is, your investment is secure, as it's backed by the U.S. government. It may be one of the best investments for those who are risk-averse or for an investor who wants to park their money temporarily in anticipation of a major purchase.

Through TreasuryDirect.gov, you can easily set up a way to purchase T-Bills electronically, by opening an account, choosing an auction to participate in and placing a bid. Even better, TreasuryDirect charges you no fees.

There are many opportunities to buy T-Bills through TreasuryDirect. Auctions occur every week, except for those with a 52-week maturity, which happens once a month.

Early withdrawal, taxes owed and interest rate fluctuations can cause risks in T-Bill ownership.

""The biggest mistake an investor makes when purchasing Treasury Bills is not fully understanding their time frame. For example, if an investor purchases a 26-week Treasury Bill and needs their money prior to the bill maturing, they must sell it in the secondary market, which could result in getting less back than what was invested (a loss of principal),"" Jason Fannon, CFP and senior partner of Cornerstone Financial Services in Southfield, Michigan, told me.

Another risk is ""buying [T-Bills] on the secondary market because there could be a discount or premium,"" Larry Pon, CPA, founder of Pon & Associates, in Redwood City, California, told me. ""The tax accounting for the discount and premium is very complicated.""

If the interest rate is low, T-bills may not be the wisest investment because earnings are low, too. ""There was a period of time a few years ago when the interest rate was close to zero, so T-Bills were not great investments, Robin Gills, CFP, of Apex Wealth Management, in Katy, Texas, told me.

Both T-Bills and T-Bonds are better wealth-protection, not wealth-accumulation vehicles. However, there are differences that may convince you to choose one over the other. ""Time horizon dictates whether one is better invested in T-Bills or T-Bonds,"" Robert R. Johnson, finance professor at Creighton University and co-author of The Tools and Techniques Of Investment Planning, Strategic Value Investing and Investment Banking for Dummies, told me.

Johnson said, ""Both asset classes are incredibly liquid and both are riskless (in terms of default risk). But, with T-Bonds, there is more interest rate risk due to the longer duration than with T-Bills. T-Bonds will likely provide you a higher return over a longer time horizon.""

If you're looking for stable investments, both T-Bills and Certificates of Deposit share that trait. T-Bills are backed by the U.S. government and CDs, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

However, tax realities could sway an investor to choose a T-Bill over a CD, if they live in a state with high taxes, such as New York or California. T-Bills are exempt from state and local taxes, but not federal taxes, whereas a CD is subject to all three. A CD advantage over a T-Bill is the length of the investment, which may appeal to some investors. T-Bills come in with a maximum maturity runway of 52 weeks, whereas money in CDs can be locked away for as many as five years.

Liquidity is also an issue to consider. If you need to sell either a CD or a T-Bill, you can do both. However, according to the investment firm Charles Schwab, ""A Treasury investor could still lose money if they had to sell a Treasury prior to maturity, but the Treasury market is a much more liquid market than the CD market and, therefore, much easier to sell if needed.""

Stocks are high-risk, while T-Bills are low-risk. Stocks can also help you build wealth, while T-Bills do not. ""According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stocks offer investors the greatest potential for growth (capital appreciation) over the long haul. Investors willing to stick with stocks over long periods of time, say 15 years, generally have been rewarded with strong, positive returns. But stock prices move down as well as up. There's no guarantee that the company whose stock you hold will grow and do well, so you can lose the money you invest in stocks,"" according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Consider how many working years you have and your risk tolerance before you invest in stocks.

The Treasury Department has streamlined the way to buy new issue T-Bills, so you need only to go TreasuryDirect.gov and follow the easy-to-understand prompts. This is the primary market to buy T-Bills; the secondary market is when you buy pre-owned T-Bills and go through a financial professional to do it.

When on the TreasuryDirect.gov home page, click on LogIn, and it will take you to a page with a display that reads, ""Don't Have an Account? TreasuryDirect, Create a New Account."" You click on that, which takes you to another page with the display ""Create a New Account,"" which you also click on. It takes you to a new page with Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3. Follow the instructions of each. To register, you will need your driver's license number and expiration date and your bank routing and account numbers as well as all other standard information. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.

Once your account is active, you log in. Click on ""Buy Direct,"" and then choose ""Bills - Short-term securities of 1 year or less."" Then you will see a list of options giving maturity dates, so that you can decide how many weeks you want to hold the T-Bill.

Fill in the amount of the investment. When you created your account, you linked it to a bank account that will pay for your T-Bill securities.

TreasuryDirect sells each new issue T-Bill at a scheduled public auction and awards all successful bidders securities at the same price, which is the price that corresponds to the highest rate, yield or discount margin of the competitive bids that Treasury accepts. When deciding to buy a T-Bill, you have already selected the auction date, the maturity and amount you want to spend for it and designated the account from which the funds are drawn.

On the auction date, you can see the results, by either signing up for an email notification through TreasuryDirect, looking up the results on the same site or checking various media outlets that cover the auctions.

Once the Treasury Department issues you the securities, it withdraws money to pay for them from the account you have designated for it. If you used TreasuryDirect, the securities go into your account or if you used a bank, broker or dealer, that entity holds on to your securities. You may keep them until the end of their term, maturity date or you may sell or transfer them before maturity.

You may be more comfortable having a broker handle all your financial transactions, but ask them to spell out their fees and commissions before you task them with buying your T-Bills.

When you do it yourself using TreasuryDirect, you pay zero fees and no commissions. For that same transaction, a broker may charge a commission and a fee, which can eat into your modest earnings.

The secondary market has an array of offerings that have been pre-owned, with owners willing to sell their T-Bills. One clear advantage over investing in the primary market is that you may find better yields there through a brokerage firm.

Some drawbacks are when you use a bank, broker or dealer to buy T-bills in the secondary market, they may recommend that you invest more than the $100 minimum required by TreasuryDirect, and you are likely to also pay fees to the financial professional.

Yes and no. They are always subject to federal taxes and could be to capital gains taxes as well. Even though you will pay federal taxes on earnings, you are free of state and local taxes, which could add up in a place like New York City, where you pay hefty city and state taxes, or another high-tax state like California. ""That can make them a bit more appealing compared to other investments,"" Fannon told me.

""If you sell your T-Bill before maturity, you could also find yourself with a tax bill on capital gains.The gain or loss will be the difference between what the T-Bill is sold for and your cost basis in the T-Bill,"" Pon said.

Inflation is declining now in the U.S., having come in at 2.5% in August 2024 compared with 2.9% the month before, according to the U.S. Inflation Calculator. So how does inflation affect T-Bills?

""The return to T-Bills approximates that of inflation,"" Robert Johnson told me. ""Since 1926, according to Ibbotson Associates, the return to T-Bills has averaged 3.3% annually. Inflation over that same time period has averaged 2.9% annually. Thus, the real return to T-Bills (that is, the premium over inflation) is only 0.4%. The holders of T-Bills only marginally increase their purchasing power.""

While T-Bills are not designed to deliver you high yield, you can up it a bit by laddering.

""To counter the impact of inflation, strategies like laddering, where you invest in T-Bills with varying maturities, can help manage interest rate risk and provide regular cash flow,"" Cliff Ambrose, founder and wealth manager at Apex Wealth, in Danvers, Massachusetts, told me.

""T-bills are terrific wealth-protection vehicles. They are not good wealth-accumulation vehicles,"" Bill Harris, CEO of the online bank Evergreen Money, told me. Those statements sum up the good and the bad of T-Bills. Use T-Bills when you want to hold on to funds, but don't count on them to make you rich."
Trump reveals tax deal he will be 'offering to every major company and manufacturer on Earth',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-reveals-tax-deal-he-offering-every-major-company-manufacturer-earth,2024-09-24T20:20:41Z,"Former President Trump speaks about his tax and economic plan during campaign event in Savannah, Georgia.

Former President Trump on Tuesday is vowing to ""launch a historic buildup of American manufacturing muscle and might"" through an economic and tax deal he says he will be offering to ""every major company and manufacturer on Earth.""

Trump, speaking during a campaign event in Savannah, Georgia, said his plan for the U.S. economy - which is centered around a ""15% Made in America"" corporate tax rate - will ""create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers, and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago.""

""Here is the deal that I will be offering to every major company and manufacturer on Earth -- I will give you the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs, the lowest regulatory burden. And free access to the best and biggest market on the planet,"" Trump said. ""But only if you make your product here in America. It all goes away if you don't make your product here. And hire American workers for the job. If you don't make your product here, then you will have to pay a tariff, a very substantial tariff.""

TRUMP GIFTS PENNSYLVANIA MOM OF THREE WITH $100 AT GROCERY STORE CHECKOUT: 'COMPLETE SURPRISE'

Trump argued that ""with the vision I'm outlining today, not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands, but under my leadership, we are going to take other countries' jobs.

""We're going to take their factories,"" Trump continued. ""We're going to bring thousands and thousands of businesses and trillions of dollars in wealth back to the good old USA.""

""Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America and to bring them back,"" he declared.

""And we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars into our treasury and use that money to benefit the American citizens, and it will not cause inflation, by the way,"" Trump said.

The current U.S. corporate tax rate is at 21%. Lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% for all businesses would lower tax revenue by $460 billion per a dynamic analysis by the Tax Foundation, to $673 billion, according to the Tax Foundation's static analysis. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that tax revenue would be $595 billion lower over a decade under the policy.

EARLY MAIL-IN VOTING DATA SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR REPUBLICANS, TRUMP: EXPERT

Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from the current 21%, after she had previously supported a 35% corporate tax rate during her short-lived presidential campaign in the 2020 cycle. The Harris campaign has described this as a ""fiscally responsible way to put money back in the pockets of working people and ensure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share.""

The CRFB's analysis found that increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% would raise tax revenue by $1 trillion from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2035. The Tax Foundation's analysis also projected that it would raise taxes by $1 trillion, while the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated it would raise $1.2 trillion in revenue in that period.

Trump ripped Harris during his speech in Savannah on Tuesday, calling her the ""tax queen.""

""They love her in other countries because she forces everybody out of our country into their hands. The tax queen is demanding a 33% tax hike on all domestic production,"" he said. ""Now, you know you can hate companies and all that, but they still fuel growth and they fuel jobs, they fuel everything.""

Trump also announced Tuesday that ""we will set up special zones of federal land with ultra-low taxes and regulations for American producers"" which will be ""ideal spots for relocating entire industries that we've taken in from other countries.

Are Healthcare Labor Woes Ending? Some Might Be In A Post-Covid First,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2024/09/24/are-healthcare-labor-woes-ending-some-might-be-in-a-post-covid-first/,2024-09-24T19:28:37Z,"Labor woes plaguing hospitals and health systems across the country could be subsiding for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic triggered an exodus of healthcare workers.

A new report by Fitch Ratings says the ""worst of the labor downturn"" could be nearing an end for not-for-profit hospitals in the U.S. Not-for-profit, or tax-exempt hospitals, account for most hospitals and health systems in the U.S. and they have been hit hard by staffing issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the so-called ""Great Resignation"" took their toll on healthcare providers across the country.

As one example, the Fitch report said the year-over-year ""average hourly earnings growth of hospital employees has (favorably) declined, averaging 3% in 2024 compared to 4.2% in 2023.""

""Hospital wage inflation is cooling to more sustainable levels, with (year-over-year) wage growth below that of the private and ambulatory healthcare services sectors for several months,"" Fitch said in its report. ""This development follows an extended period of above-average salary and wage increases for hospital employees, which were implemented to reverse persistently high turnover and external contract labor use.""

To be sure, Fitch said hospital payrolls have increased for the last 32 consecutive months as of August of this year, up 6.7% since February 2020, which was around the time COVID began its spread in the U.S. and triggered shutdowns the following month.

But Fitch says ""job openings in the healthcare and social assistance sector"" are continuing their steady decline"" and are down to 6% as of July compared to 7.9% in January.

And though the openings rate in the healthcare and social assistance sector is down from pandemic highs, it's still much higher than the 4.2% from 2010 to 2019, the year before COVID hit in early 2020. ""Job openings, while heading down, are still high due largely to the ongoing shortage of clinical labor that will take time to address,"" said Fitch Director Richard Park.

The nation's largest healthcare staffing firm known for placing physicians at hospitals across the country said its clients are still dealing with labor shortages though the situation has improved.

""The COVID pandemic created a once-in-a-generation healthcare workforce crisis,"" Meredith LaPointe, Chief Business Officer with AMN Healthcare said.

""While the crisis has passed and conditions are normalizing, many of the underlining factors driving workforce shortages and turnover in healthcare remain,"" LaPointe said. ""Geographic and specialty misalignment between demand and supply of physicians, nurses and allied health professionals continues to be the status quote. This is a long-term challenge that requires long-term solutions and creative thinking.""

In one area where medical care providers remain in particular demand is in the care of people age 65 and over who are eligible for Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors and the disabled.

Since late last year, health insurance companies that administer privatized Medicare Advantage plans, which contract with the federal government to provide benefits for seniors, have reported higher than expected medical costs, particularly from hospital admissions and inpatient surgeries put off during the pandemic.

Humana, for example, earlier this year said the industry was ""navigating significant regulatory changes while also absorbing unprecedented increases in medical cost trends."" CVS Health's Aetna health insurance has also had troubles including higher costs that contributed to the departure of a high-ranking executive.

""Hospitals are still dealing with post-pandemic pent-up service demand, especially from seniors, that has kept labor needs high,"" Fitch's Park said. ""Sustained high volume levels are a modest positive for health systems, but often come with administrative challenges, slow payments and denial of prior authorizations for care, in particular when dealing with Medicare Advantage insurers."""
Violent crimes have increased under Biden-Harris admin despite Dems' denials: expert,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/violent-crimes-have-increased-under-biden-harris-admin-despite-dems-denials-expert,2024-09-24T19:08:06Z,"Former President Trump, during a campaign event in Asheville, North Carolina, on Wednesday, spoke about the Biden-Harris admin's handling of the border, saying there is a ""new category"" of crime ""beyond control.""

Violent crimes have dramatically increased during the Biden-Harris administration, according to a recent Department of Justice study that appears to refute consistent claims by the Harris campaign - and some in the media - that serious offenses are on a downward trajectory.

Crimes such as rape or sexual assault, aggravated assault, and robbery increased from 2020 to 2023, the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed earlier this month as part of its National Crime Victimization Survey. Across the board, the survey found total instances of reported violent crimes increased from 5.6 per 1,000 individuals aged 12 and over in 2020, when Trump was still in office, to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023.

The study found 9.8 instances of violent crime per 1,000 people aged 12 and over in 2022, which marks the highest rate during the 2020-2023 era.

Crime is once again a top concern this election cycle, with voters often listing crime behind the economy, ongoing inflation woes, immigration and foreign policy on their list of concerns ahead of voting on Nov. 5.

'WEAK-ON-CRIME LIBERAL': TRUMP CAMPAIGN HITS BACK AFTER HARRIS BLAMES HIM FOR 'VIOLENT CRIME WAVE'

During Trump's debate against Vice President Harris on Sept. 10, the 45th president stated that crime is on the rise in the U.S., while linking the trend to the influx of illegal migrants who crossed the border since 2021.

""All over the world crime is down. All over the world except here,"" Trump said. ""Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made. Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.""

ABC News' David Muir, who co-moderated the debate, interjected that FBI data shows crime is on a downward trajectory.

""President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country,"" Muir said, before Trump added that the FBI didn't include data from the ""worst cities.""

The FBI released its quarterly crime report for 2024 in June, which found violent crime decreased by 15.2% between January-March 2024 compared to the same time period in 2023. The FBI data, however, does not include crimes that were not reported to the police.

On the other hand, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is one of the most comprehensive federal surveys, according to some experts, which includes interviewing 230,000 U.S. residents on whether they've been the victims of crimes, what the crime entailed and if the crime was reported to police.

BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN SAYS CRIME IS DOWN, BUT INDEPENDENT DATA SHOWS VIOLENT CRIME UP ACROSS 66 CITIES

""When David Muir goes and says the FBI shows that crime is down, that's not what the FBI is measuring,"" Crime Prevention Research Center President John Lott told Fox News Digital in an interview this week. ""What the FBI measures is that reported crime went down, and that's a big difference between total and reported crime. We know most crimes aren't reported to the police. And the rate that people report crimes to the police depends in part on things like whether they think the guys are going to be arrested or not.""

Lott noted that arrest rates have dipped, with 2022 data showing only 20% of reported violent crimes resulted in an arrest in major cities.

""So, if people don't think that the criminals are going to be caught and punished, it reduces the returns for some people reporting the crimes to the police to begin with,"" he argued.

An opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal this week argued that the National Crime Victimization Survey is far more reliable than FBI crime data for five reasons: NCVS data is finalized before it's published, unlike the FBI data that shows partial-year data; the FBI overhauled its reporting system in 2021 that makes year-to-year comparisons more difficult; the NCVS study represents data nationally via its surveys, while the FBI data does not include stats from some massive police departments such as the Los Angeles PD; the FBI ""isn't considered a principal statistical agency"" and so it is unable to compensate for missing data from agencies such as the LAPD; and the FBI data only includes crimes that were reported to police, while NCVS data includes surveys from individuals who did not report a crime.

GUN CRIME EXPERT BLASTS RED STATE 'CHERRY-PICKING' BY YALE PROFESSOR IN SENATE HEARING: 'POLITICAL BIAS'

On Monday, the FBI did publish its crime report for 2023 and found violent crime declined an estimated 3% when compared to 2022. That FBI report is based only on reported crimes, and includes data from more than 85% of law enforcement agencies enrolled in the FBI's program.

When asked for comment about NCVS data, the White House pointed to a Politifact article published this month that argued that while both the methodology for the FBI data and the NCVS ""have value,"" FBI data is typically more reliable. The article argued that while NCVS data may include unreported crimes, it might ""also capture events that don't rise to the level of a crime.""

""As PolitiFact explained when they debunked this lie, 'the FBI data tends to be more rigorous' and 'nongovernmental groups have released data' that 'aligns' with those numbers - whereas 'the victimization survey excludes murders.' It would track that apologists for the Trump Administration, which oversaw the biggest murder rate increase in American history, would cherry pick a survey that excludes murders altogether,"" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.

""Here are the facts: every year in office, the Trump Administration and congressional Republicans attempted to defund the police by cutting the COPS program; then, in 2020, murders spiked more than ever. Now, after making an unprecedented federal investment in public safety, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have delivered a record *drop* in the murder rate and the lowest violence crime in 50 years.""

Lott, who also served as a senior adviser for research and statistics at the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs, authored an op-ed for Real Clear Politics this month and detailed that the DOJ survey found that total violent crimes are 55.4% higher in 2023 than in 2020, the end of Trump's tenure, while rape crimes increased by 42%, robbery by 63%,and aggravated assault by 55%. The DOJ survey does not include surveys on murder, but that category is almost always reported to police departments, and subsequently to the FBI, he noted, and makes up about 1% of the U.S.' total violent crimes.

The FBI's quarterly data found murders dropped by 13% in 2023 compared to 2022, but the rate remains 5% higher than pre-pandemic data from 2019, Lott explained.

The Associated Press published a fact-check following the presidential debate and determined Trump's claim that violent crime has been on the rise under the Biden-Harris administration was false, citing the NCVS study outlining that the rate of violent victimizations in 2023 was not statistically different from the rate in 2019.

""The 2023 rate was higher than the 2020 (6.6 per 1,000) and 2021 (7.5 per 1,000) rates but was comparable to 5 years ago in 2019 and consistent with the overall downward trend since 1993 (33.8 per 1,000),"" the NCVS study states.

STUDY DEBUNKS 'RED STATE MURDER' CLAIM FROM HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATS

Lott countered that the AP report failed to ""mention whether the rate is statistically different than in 2020 or 2021.""

""Nor do they mention how large the increases are. Trump's point was that violent crime had increased during the Biden-Harris administration. The rate in 2022 was statistically significantly higher than in either of those previous years. The violent crime rate in 2022 and 2023 was also significantly higher,"" he wrote in his Real Clear Politics op-ed.

""Total felonious violent crime increased by 19% from 2019 to 2023, and there is only one other time when the increase over four years was larger.""

FLORIDA CRIME TRENDING DOWN WHILE CALIFORNIA SKYROCKETS EXPLAINED BY ONE KEY DIFFERENCE: EXPERT

Lott found that the 55% increase in total violent crime between 2021-2023 was the ""largest percentage increase over three years"" in the roughly 50 years the NCVS has collected crime data.

""The next largest percentage increase over three years was in 2006 and that was 27%. The percentage increase under Biden is slightly more than twice the largest previous increase. Now, if you want to take it from 2019 for serious violent crime, then what you see is it's increased by 19% from 2019 to 2023. That's the second-largest percentage increase in serious violent crime that we've ever seen. That's a huge increase. And those percentage increases are both very statistically significant,"" he said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the data, but did not immediately receive replies.

After the NCVS data was published this month, Trump touted it as evidence supporting his debate remark that violent crimes have increased under the Biden-Harris administration.

""You remember where David Muir tried to correct me that crime is rampant like never before?"" Trump said from the campaign trail in California this month.

Billionaire Mark Cuban Blasts Trump's John Deere Tariff Proposal In Harris Campaign Call: 'Insanity',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/24/billionaire-mark-cuban-blasts-trumps-john-deere-tariff-proposal-in-harris-campaign-call-insanity/,2024-09-24T18:22:44Z,"Billionaire Mark Cuban warned former President Donald Trump's threats to impose a 200% tariff on John Deere if it moves production to Mexico could destroy the company, calling it ""insanity"" in a broad rebuke of Trump's economic policies during a Kamala Harris campaign call Tuesday -- the billionaire's latest show of support for the vice president.

Explaining his support for Vice President Kamala Harris, Cuban said ""she's better for business"" and ""thinks through her policies"" rather than saying ""off the top of her head . . . what she thinks the crowd wants to hear like the Republican nominee.""

Some experts have warned that Trump's proposals to raise taxes on imported goods by 10% to up to 60% on goods from China would raise prices for consumers and hurt the U.S. economy by leading to a range of factors including decreased consumer spending.

Cuban also attacked Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates in the Tuesday call, comparing it to Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., proposal for a 15% cap. ""So now you've got Donald Trump getting involved in price caps and price controls to a greater extent than self-described socialist Bernie Sanders,"" Cuban said.

Cuban has become a frequent Trump critic since Trump's entrance into politics. He initially supported Trump's first campaign for president, but ultimately ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race. Cuban has derided Trump's bombastic, off-the-cuff style and regularly accuses Trump of failing to adequately explain his proposals. Cuban was among more than 90 business leaders who endorsed Harris in September in an open letter, citing her ""strong record of advancing actions to spur business investment in the United States and ensure American businesses can compete and win in the global market.""

We estimate Cuban's net worth at $5.7 billion, while Trump is worth about $3.6 billion.

Harris Vs. Trump On The Economy: Trump Now Holds Just Slim Lead On Issue In Latest Poll (Forbes)

How The Economy Really Fared Under Biden/Harris And Trump -- From Jobs To Inflation (Forbes)"
The Impact Of Inflation & New Regulations On Cost Of Estate Planning,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrencase/2024/09/24/the-impact-of-inflation--new-regulations-on-cost-of-estate-planning/,2024-09-24T16:34:03Z,"Darren Case is an Arizona attorney covering tax and estate planning.

In recent years, the landscape of estate planning has undergone significant changes due to a combination of rising inflation and the implementation of new regulations, notably the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). These multiple factors have considerably increased the cost and complexity of estate planning, affecting individuals and families across various economic strata. While it may certainly be a tough pill to swallow knowing that the cost of an estate plan, even if basic, has increased in price significantly, understanding these influences is crucial for anyone navigating the increasingly intricate world of estate planning.

Inflation and Its Effect on Estate Planning Costs

Inflation, which is generally defined as the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, ultimately erodes purchasing power and affects nearly every facet of the private wealth planning area. For estate planning specifically, inflation has impacted both the immediate costs associated with setting up and maintaining an estate plan, as well as the long-term value of the assets within an estate.

Simply put, the cost of legal services, financial advisory, and other professional fees associated with estate planning has increased due to inflation. As the prices of goods and services rise, so too do the fees charged by estate planning attorneys, tax advisors, and financial planners. This uptick in various costs means that individuals and families must allocate more resources to establish and update their estate plans. For example, legal fees for drafting wills, trusts, and other estate documents have seen a significant increase, making comprehensive estate planning more expensive.

Moreover, inflation affects the value of assets, which can also complicate estate planning. As asset values rise, the need for more sophisticated planning to mitigate estate taxes and ensure proper asset distribution becomes more pressing. High net worth and ultra-high net worth estates may require advanced strategies such as intentionally defective grantor trusts, spousal lifetime access trusts, charitable trusts, family limited partnerships, etc., which come with their own set of costs. This will become even more important with the potential sunset of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA). As inflation drives up asset values, the complexity and cost of these strategies can also rise.

The Corporate Transparency Act and Its Financial Implications

In general, the Corporate Transparency Act, enacted as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, is a regulatory measure aimed at increasing transparency in corporate ownership. (Since the CTA went into effect on January 1, 2024, the guidance provided continues to be updated.) The CTA mandates that certain business entities disclose their beneficial owners -- individuals who ultimately own or control the entity -- by filing certain reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This regulation seeks to curb money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit activities.

In the context of estate planning, the CTA introduces new layers of complexity and yet more additional costs. Business owners and those involved in managing family businesses or holding companies must now comply with these disclosure requirements. This necessitates additional legal and administrative work to ensure accurate reporting and adherence to the new regulations.

For individuals with substantial business interests or those managing family-owned enterprises, the CTA can increase the cost of estate planning in several ways. First, the requirement to maintain up-to-date records of beneficial ownership can necessitate the hiring of additional compliance personnel or the use of specialized software. This administrative burden translates into higher costs.

Second, the need for legal expertise to navigate the complexities of the CTA can further inflate estate planning expenses. Estate planning attorneys must stay abreast of the latest regulatory developments and advise clients accordingly, which can lead to increased fees. Additionally, the incorporation of new compliance measures into estate plans requires thorough revisions and updates to existing structures, adding to the overall cost. For example, often times individuals and families will gift fractional share interests in businesses to irrevocable trusts for the benefit of children or other family members, which is an incredibly complex transaction in its own right. Add in the additional analysis and requirements of the CTA to such transactions will only make matters that much more difficult and expensive.

Navigating the Increased Costs

Given the rising costs associated with inflation and new regulations like the CTA, individuals and families must be proactive in managing their estate planning strategies. One approach is to work closely with experienced estate planning professionals who can provide specifically tailored advice and help mitigate costs. For example, a well-structured estate plan might include strategies to optimize tax efficiency and minimize administrative burdens.

Of course, regular reviews and updates to estate plans are essential, especially in the face of changing economic conditions and regulatory environments. Staying informed and working with knowledgeable professionals, enables individuals and families the ability to better navigate the complexities and expenses associated with modern estate planning.

In conclusion, the combined effects of inflation and new regulations such as the Corporate Transparency Act have significantly increased the cost of estate planning. As prices rise and compliance requirements become more stringent, individuals and families must be prepared to invest more in their estate planning efforts, especially in light of the potential sunset of the TCJA. By understanding these impacts and seeking expert guidance, they can effectively manage the financial and administrative challenges of preserving and transferring their wealth."
Consumer Confidence Suffers Biggest Monthly Drop Since 2021 -- Job Market Hopes Waver Before Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/24/consumer-confidence-suffers-biggest-monthly-drop-since-2021-job-market-hopes-waver-before-election/,2024-09-24T16:27:48Z,"Consumer confidence fell this month by the largest amount since August 2021, according to a monthly survey released Tuesday morning by the economic research firm Conference Board, as discontent among Americans about the state of the economy looms large weeks before the election.

The survey concluded Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve rolled out the first interest rate cut since March 2020, a move which can boost consumer attitudes as borrowing costs grow less costly, leading to more hiring.

The worse-than-expected consumer confidence reading comes as voters identify the economy as their top issue heading into the presidential election. Though the economy remains strong overall, recent data has pointed to weakness in the labor market -- the unemployment rate of 4.2% last month was 0.5 percentage points above where it was at the start of the year and inflation is still above the 2% historical target. ""Consumers are clearly concerned about the implications of the upcoming election, the increasing conflict around the world, and the stubbornly high cost of food and credit,"" wrote Harris Financial Group managing partner Jamie Cox in emailed comments Tuesday. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, a rival reading on the state of the U.S. consumer, actually rose in September to a four-month high, though both indexes remain far lower than they were from 2017 to 2019, before the pandemic upended the economy."
How Low Might Mortgage Rates Go As The Fed Cuts Rate?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/09/24/how-low-might-mortgage-rates-go-as-the-fed-cuts-rate/,2024-09-24T16:12:31Z,"The 30-year mortgage rate to declining towards 6%. That's after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates on September 18. That's down from similar mortgage rates approaching 8% in November 2023, which may have been the peak level for this cycle.

The Fed doesn't control mortgage costs directly, but the market's expectation that rates are moving lower, together with cooling inflation, have been significant factors in helping bring down mortgage rates over the past 12 months. For here, it's possible rates move lower. However, that will depend on what the Fed does compared to market expectations, as well as other economic factors such as inflation. trends

Current 30-year mortgage rates reflect fixed income markets' expectations about future Fed decisions. So the recent decline in mortgage interest rates reflects the market's prediction that short-term interest rates are likely to decline. If that prediction proved inaccurate, then rates could move back up.

However, if the Fed does cut rates more aggressively than expected, maybe mortgage rates could move lower. Broadly speaking the market is projecting that short-term interest rates will end 2024 at close to 4% and then be in the region of 3% in December 2025. Should the Fed be more or less aggressive in cutting rates than those implicit estimates, then the mortgage rate may move down, or up, respectively.

For example, if the Fed decided that it wasn't worried about a softer job market and inflation surged, then mortgage rates could move higher again. Economists don't view this as a particularly probable scenario, but it is possible. Equally, if there were a deep U.S. recession, the Fed might cut rates dramatically, potentially helping pull mortgage rates down from current levels.

Mortgage rates are now much higher than 2020 to 2021 when the 30-year mortgage rate temporarily fell below 3%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was asked if he thought we'd return to that level at the recent Fed meeting on September 18 and said the following: ""Intuitively most, many, many people anyway, would say we're probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates, long-term bonds trading at negative rates. And it looked like the neutral rate was, might even be negative, so and it was, people were issuing debt at negative rates. It seems that's so far away now, my own sense is that we're not going back to that. But honestly, we're going to find out. But it feels, it feels to me, and that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then. How high is it? I don't, I just don't think we know. It's, again, we only know it by its works.""

From here, the key questions for the mortgage market will be what is the long-term rate for neutral short-term rates. The current expectation is that short-term rate is around 3% according to both markets and Fed policy makers. Of course, mortgage rates build in a premium to that 'risk free' rate as lending to an individual homeowner is riskier and more complex than lending to the U.S. government. Then the second question is how fast we get there. Current expectations are that we may see short-term interest rates of about 3% by late 2025.

However, many economic events could change that trajectory quite dramatically. We may now be past peak interest rates for this cycle as inflation has cooled, but where mortgage rates settle in the future remains an open question. Mortgage rates currently reflect some optimism that interest rates are coming down quite sharply over the next 12 months."

The stock market isn't the only indicator hitting record-high valuations this year. Gold values have also been skyrocketing -- even outpacing the markets. Spot gold prices are hovering near their record of $2,664 per troy ounce. As of Friday, Gold's year-to-date value gain was 27.1%, higher than the S&P 500's record 20.8% return.

Forbes' Derek Saul writes gold is becoming more valuable for two reasons. One is the interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve last week. While lower interest rates tend to be better for consumer spending and borrowing, investors can't earn as much from assets that are tied to federal interest rates, like government bonds and certificates of deposit. Gold, on the other hand, has its own inherent value and isn't impacted by the Fed's decision. In general, gold prices tend to increase whenever interest rates go down.

But the year's constant geopolitical turmoil is also driving gold prices up. Gold is an international currency standard and is seen as a safe hedge against geopolitical risks. Central banks have been purchasing gold quickly as international conflicts unfold. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, central banks have bought gold three times faster than in years prior, Goldman Sachs found. The ongoing conflict involving Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah has added to the frenzy. J.P. Morgan reported that the first quarter of 2024 saw a gold-buying pace 36% higher than anticipated.

While the price of gold doesn't directly impact most businesses (jewelry being a notable exception), the commodity can be seen as an economic indicator, often pointing to economic uncertainties. Everyone in the finance business is well aware of today's unknowns. In addition to the geopolitical situations and interest rate changes, there's also the upcoming presidential election -- in which some major changes to tax policy are being proposed -- and lingering inflation difficulties.

And CFOs are expecting turbulence in the near term. According to StrategicCFO360's quarterly poll of CFOs conducted with BlackLine last month, CFOs rate the economy as a 6.5 out of 10. Overall, 55% said they expect a recession in the near term. Just 35% are anticipating a soft landing.

Last month, the Justice Department launched a pilot program to reward corporate whistleblowers who help uncover corruption at companies. While many companies carry directors and officers liability insurance, often referred to as D&O insurance, will this change impact what companies can afford in premiums -- or in potential damages? I talked to Carolyn Rosenberg, a partner in the insurance recovery group at law firm Reed Smith, about the issue. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

It finally happened: Last week, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The Fed's policy-setting committee opted for a significant rate cut of half a percentage point, meaning the target federal funds rate is now 4.75% to 5%, down from the 5.25% to 5.5% where it's sat since July 2023.

""This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at the press conference following last Wednesday's announcement.

But what does the rate cut mean in the long run? And is this the beginning of more leveling off? The answer to both is we'll see. What happens next depends on how businesses, financial institutions, investors and consumers behave. If inflation continues to decrease or stays steady, if employment figures move upward and if the economy sees increased vigor, it may be the beginning of more economic good news. Forbes writers collected predictions of how the rate cuts will impact different interest groups, ranging from small businesses to student loan borrowers.

Just over a week after roughly 33,000 unionized Boeing machinists in the Pacific Northwest went on strike, the company made its ""best and final offer"" to the union. The aerospace manufacturer's proposed deal includes raises of 30% over the four-year term of the contract -- an increase from 25%, a $6,000 bonus for each worker who approves the deal -- double the previous offer, reinstates performance bonuses -- which were slated to be cut, and increases the company 401(k) match. The union responded on Facebook that the company treated them disrespectfully by sharing the offer directly to members and media while union members were still reviewing it, and Boeing has made the deal contingent on ratification by 11:59 p.m. Friday.

It's not clear what the union's ultimate response will be; the union said it was sending an email survey to members for input. The strike has been costly for Boeing. An analysis by Anderson Economic Group estimated the first week cost the company's workers and shareholders at least $571 million. Since the strike essentially shut down production, Boeing started finding ways to cut its costs last week as the strike continued. Non-unionized employees -- executives, managers and other white-collar workers -- will be furloughed one week out of every four. The company has also instituted a hiring freeze and reduced purchases from vendors and suppliers.

Forbes senior contributor Ted Reed writes labor strikes in the last few years have been bolstered by support from the White House. Focusing on recent airline-related contract negotiations for which strikes were authorized if there was no agreed upon contract by a deadline, Reed writes the administration signaled proof that the threat of strikes were real. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and National Mediation Board Member Linda Puchala worked directly with the union representing American Airlines flight attendants in their successful quest for a contract.

Some labor leaders feel the same support from the White House will continue if Vice President Kamala Harris is elected in November. Former President Donald Trump said in an interview on X last month he supported firing employees who go on strike, leading the United Auto Workers to file federal labor charges against him for trying to threaten and intimidate workers.

One way to deal with the accountant shortage: cash. Private equity has been investing in accounting firms for the last few years, with five of the 25 largest firms in the U.S. receiving those investment dollars, Forbes' Kelly Phillips Erb writes. These investments represent a source of funds for many of the pressures today's accounting firms are grappling with. They can help bolster salaries and benefits to attract a dwindling number of accounting college graduates. The funds can be used to upgrade technology, making AI platforms available that cut down on more mundane work, like data entry and routine review. And they can help meet retirement and pension obligations. Accounting firms are seen as solid investments for private equity firms, places where they can put their money and watch it grow. However, some accounting firms and industry watchers fear that private equity money can cause conflicts of interest or result in some ""sexier"" areas of accounting firms -- like tax and advisory services -- taking most of the funds, with little money left for areas like auditing.

As legal claims against businesses and their boards climb, directors and officers liability insurance, commonly abbreviated as D&O, has become a vital financial hedge for companies. Since the Justice Department launched a corporate whistleblower awards program last month, are there likely to be more claims? I talked to Carolyn Rosenberg, a partner in the insurance recovery group at law firm Reed Smith, about what changes this may bring to D&O coverage. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

In general, how have companies thought about D&O insurance and how do they consider what they need?

Rosenberg: Insurance is typically part of an overall risk management effort on the part of a company. So insurance is designed to shift the risk to an insurer, as opposed to having a company or an individual be personally responsible. Part of what kind of D&O insurance a company may decide upon is really a question of several factors. What is the company's risk appetite? What's the company's financial position? Is it primarily to protect directors and officers? Is it to protect the company's balance sheet? What is the availability of coverage and what's the cost of the coverage? And also what are the terms and conditions of the coverage?

There are a great deal of differences between different insurance policies. Different insurance companies may provide D&O insurance coverage, but beyond that, there can be both nuances and differences in terminology, differences in what enhancements might be negotiated.

When looking at D&O insurance, also look comprehensively at your insurance programs across the board, because you may get hit with a ransomware claim, a data breach claim or a myriad of different claims, and you want to make sure that there are no gaps in your programs. In other words, if a claim is going to be excluded under one type of policy, you might want to look and see: Do you have coverage for that under a different type of policy?

How do you see the new Justice Department whistleblower program impacting the D&O insurance market?

It may be a little too soon to tell. The program is touted as finding more financial incentive and focusing on different areas, but there have always been the opportunity to have whistleblowers attempt to bring claims. The question is, will this lead to a surge of claims? That's not necessarily been proven out.

It's still prudent to look at your current coverage, or if you're in the process of potentially renewing coverage, to see what kind of coverage is in the marketplace. Most D&O policies for public companies include coverage for the company for securities claims. The issue that the whistleblower-type claims and other regulatory initiatives may bring -- and it's not necessarily a new question -- is what coverage do you have for regulatory-type investigations, as opposed to simply a lawsuit? How early in the process will coverage apply, because costs of defending claims, costs of looking into investigations can be quite high. The issue is what coverage do you have currently? And then what other potential alternatives exist in the market?

I've seen certain articles that [ask] does this mean you should be looking into what's called entity investigations coverage to have certainty about coverage for investigations? Historically, those options have been fairly limited and very expensive. It will be interesting to see if those options become more practical, broader or affordable, if in fact there becomes a market for them.

What kind of advice would you give to a CFO working through this process and trying to find the most value and benefit to the company in terms of both their premium and the coverage they may need if something happens?

I would start early, before the insurance renewal, so there's time to compare policy terms and conditions and prices. Most big public companies work with quality insurance brokers who can get those options. A number of companies work with someone like me or others who are insurance coverage counsel for policy holders to really get into the weeds on the policy terms and conditions. Working with the insurance brokers and the risk managers and legal or other teams involved in assisting the CFO, to really do a fulsome look at how the policies compare, and even create potential enhancements to seek from the insurers. And then being able to leave time to do a comparison to say: If this policy is going to be X thousands more in premium, is it worth it if we compare the terms and conditions, apples to apples? Or it may be that we are not comfortable going with this insurer for whatever reason.

The other aspect is that the newest hot issue is artificial intelligence, and to the extent that companies are using it and what they're expecting on the horizon, we would also say you want to look to see if there's anything about the policies or what you're doing that would suggest any specifics with regard to AI.

Inflation Continues To Rank As The Top Problem For Small Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamdunkelberg/2024/09/24/inflation-continues-to-rank-as-the-top-problem-for-small-business/,2024-09-24T15:49:19Z,"In August, NFIB's Small Business Economic Trends survey found that 24% of small business owners surveyed identified inflation as the most important business problem they faced, followed by labor quality at 21%. Also in August, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in at 2.5%. This is far below the 9% recorded in June 2022 and the lowest inflation rate since February 2021. So, what's the concern? A simple answer is that prices are up 20% (cumulative) since 2021. Although the rate of price increases (inflation) is down, prices are still rising and working their way through the economy. As consumers have discovered, readjusting to 20% higher prices is a continuing problem that is not easily resolved in a short time.

Inflation was a problem through most of the 1970s and early 1980s. It spiked again during the 2008 period which experienced high oil prices, and most recently in 2021 when it was triggered by Covid shortages and massive federal spending (Chart 1). Amplifying the distress, interest rates rose to higher levels reflecting expected inflation in future periods and the Federal Reserve's ""anti-inflation"" policies.

Main Street has a major impact on inflation, with over 30 million small firms making price decisions that impact consumers. The percent of firms raising selling prices each quarter (NFIB Small Business Economic Trends) clearly impacts the inflation rate (Chart 2). A regression model confirms and quantifies this relationship:

CPI Inflation = -0.93+ 16.9 * % raising prices last quarter, R2=72%

The percent of small business owners raising selling prices is clearly a good predictor of future inflation. There are two interesting exceptions, one in the early 1980s and the other during the 2022-24 period. In the 1980s, the official inflation readings were well above those anticipated by the percent of owners raising their selling prices. In the most recent period, the reverse is true, BLS reports are consistently below those anticipated by small business price increases. According to reports from the BLS, around 50% of the CPI data is based on imputations, meaning that roughly half of the information used to calculate the Consumer Price Index is estimated, not direct measures of prices; interest rates (important credit prices) are not directly included.

These results suggest that inflation may be higher than the BLS thinks. This would be consistent with the 2022 paper by ex-U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Marijn Bolhuis, and Judd Cramer.[1] The authors found that methodological changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over time affects the levels of inflation reported and experienced today. They along with other researchers have confirmed that the inflation we are experiencing today, measured by the BLS rules that were in place in the early 1980s, would be as high as the almost 15% reported in March of 1980. Clearly, jumps in price levels this large will cause great stresses for small business and will not resolve easily or rapidly.

"Watchdog sheds light on FAFSA fiasco, from a birthday bug to call center failures",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121218/fafsa-college-financial-aid-gao,2024-09-24T14:43:10Z,"New investigations by the U.S. Government Accountability Office offer the fullest picture yet of why the revamped FAFSA had such a troubled launch. LA Johnson/NPR hide caption

There's no question, the rollout of the revamped FAFSA - the Free Application for Federal Student Aid that millions of students must fill out to qualify for college loans and grants - was a slow-motion explosion of mistakes and miscommunication by the U.S. Department of Education.

On Tuesday, though, the public got a detailed map of that disaster, thanks to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and testimony before a House subcommittee.

These GAO reviews and testimony come as the department prepares to launch the next FAFSA cycle, which will again be delayed, with a small rollout in October and a full launch by December.

Some of the problems outlined by the GAO will sound familiar; NPR has covered them extensively here and here. But, by reviewing federal data and conducting interviews with department employees, GAO investigators offer the fullest picture yet of the department's failures and their impact on applicants.

In December 2020, Congress voted to overhaul the FAFSA. The changes were intended to make the form easier to fill out and expand access to federal student aid for students who need it most. Implementation of this new law would fall to the incoming Biden administration.

The problem was, the FAFSA ended up getting a down-to-the-studs, high-tech overhaul that appears to have fallen behind almost from the start, according to the GAO review.

Even after getting an extension from Congress, the Education Department still rushed to release an incomplete FAFSA on Dec. 30, 2023. The form would not be consistently available for another week, on Jan. 7, though, even then, it was riddled with problems.

According to the GAO review, the department identified 55 technical ""defects"" after the FAFSA finally launched, some of which have yet to be resolved as of early September. That's ""about twice as many"" defects as FSA had flagged during testing.

Part of the problem, according to the GAO, is that early testing was rushed, and department officials signed off on testing reviews ""though significant work had not yet been completed.""

Ultimately, this led to an array of mistakes, from minor to critical, that weren't addressed - or even caught - until students ran headlong into them. Among those mistakes:

One of the most glaring problems the GAO highlights (and NPR has covered) hit students whose parent or spouse does not have a Social Security number. The form's electronic identity verification process for these mixed-status families didn't work well. The GAO estimates that between 15 and 40% of mixed-status families were able to have their identities verified automatically, but tens of thousands were instead forced to email documents to the department for a more burdensome, manual verification.

According to the GAO, ""[the Department of] Education planned for only 3,500 individuals to be manually verified, less than 2 percent of the approximately 219,000 parents and spouses who actually ended up going through the manual verification process.""

The department issued a report Monday, reviewing its efforts to learn from and move beyond the FAFSA debacle. In that report, the department assured mixed-status families that identity verification would not be a barrier in the next FAFSA cycle, though the problem has not been fully resolved.

One of Congress' goals for the FAFSA overhaul was to make it easier and faster to complete. For independent students, it was a breeze. But the GAO's review makes clear, the form was still a slog for dependent students who needed parental input to complete it.

The Education Department has a call center system meant to answer students' and families' questions, including about the FAFSA.

But according to the GAO review, ""nearly three quarters of all calls to the call center (4.0 million out of 5.4 million calls) went unanswered during the first 5 months of the rollout.""

The GAO review suggests the department bears considerable blame for its short-staffed call center: It vastly underestimated how many people would ask for help during the rollout period.

Keeping in mind that people also call for help with lots of other issues, including help navigating student loan confusion, the department projected it would receive a total of 2.2 million phone calls within the first 5 months of the FAFSA rollout. They got more than twice that many.

The department staffed its call center based on what seems like a naive projection of demand.

For the first month of the new FAFSA rollout, the department employed 902 call center workers according to the GAO - far fewer than the 1,649 it made available to answer questions during the first month of the previous year's FAFSA cycle.

As a result, investigators found, ""The call center's failure to meet demand became a significant bottleneck for students and families who struggled to get help with pressing issues that delayed or entirely prevented them from successfully accessing and completing the FAFSA.""

Looking ahead to the next FAFSA cycle in its Monday report, the department says it has added more than 700 new call center agents.

Not only did calls for help go unanswered, investigators say the department took nearly two months after the FAFSA's launch to communicate directly with students.

The 3.5 million applicants who navigated the form's initial rollout heard nothing from the department until Feb. 20, 2024 - more than seven weeks after the form launched - and that was simply to tell them that their forms had not yet been processed.

What's more, the Education Department didn't tell applicants about changes to their aid eligibility after it belatedly adjusted its math to account for inflation - a problem it had known about and delayed fixing for months.

According to the GAO, another 500,000 applicants whose aid eligibility changed as the result of other department mistakes likewise received no notice or update.

In this communication void, GAO investigators write, some students ""may have relied on the inaccurate estimate of the financial aid eligibility they received when they submitted their FAFSA to make decisions about which college they could afford.""

In its own recent FAFSA report, the department committed to being more transparent with applicants in the future: ""A student is now notified as soon as their application is processed, including whether it was successfully processed or if it requires additional action. By the end of the month, the Department will provide more specific information about the action required (e.g., missing a signature).""

Students weren't the only ones in the dark.

College financial aid offices depend on the department to send students' FAFSA records before they can make financial aid offers. But the department missed its January deadline to begin delivering those records, with little warning, then promised to deliver them by mid-March.

Another challenge for schools: They could not submit to the department what are called ""batch corrections"" to students' FAFSA records.

It's not uncommon for schools to flag minor changes that must be made to students' records and, in the past, they could save time by submitting those corrections back to the department automatically, in batches. But, this time around, this batch corrections function wasn't working.

Without being able to submit corrections in batches, college aid offices were forced to manually submit each record, a much more labor-intensive process. Some schools simply waited, hoping the option to submit in batches would return. When it didn't, these schools had to scramble to find additional people to manually - and belatedly - send their record corrections.

Even now, the GAO says, these delays could mean some enrolled students haven't yet received the aid they're entitled to this semester because records corrections took so long to submit.

According to the review, these problems ""contributed to about 9 percent fewer high school seniors and other first-time applicants submitting a FAFSA, with the largest declines among lower-income students, according to [Department of] Education data as of August 25, 2024.""

In short, the students this fix was most intended to help were hardest hit by its failures.

If there's any good news in this report, it's that the damage would have been far worse had the Education Department not mounted an outreach campaign following its troubled rollout.

According to the GAO, that campaign helped close ""the FAFSA submission gap from about 1.4 million fewer applicants in mid-May 2024 to around 430,000 fewer applicants in late August 2024 compared to last year.""

The Education Department went to great lengths on Monday, ahead of Tuesday's GAO release and congressional hearing, to assure students and families that it has been hard at work making sure this upcoming FAFSA won't mirror last year's calamity.

""We have put all hands on deck at the Department to make sure we release the 2025-26 FAFSA in a way that reflects industry-standard best practices around technological transformation and responds to the frank feedback and recommendations of our partners,"" U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona wrote in a recent letter to those partners. ""I am proud of the progress we have made over the last few months.""

The department's Monday report outlines that progress, including changes not just to the FAFSA but to the agency that manages it, FSA. The department has also committed to a much more robust testing plan that should flag many errors before the form goes live.

To leave ample time for pre-testing, the department says it won't yet be returning to the form's previous, October release date and will instead wait to open the form widely ""on or before December 1.""

Until then, millions of students, families, school counselors and college aid administrators are left to wait and hope that the easier, faster FAFSA's anything-but-easy year was just a blip, an anomaly, and that someday, in hindsight, the troubles will feel as strange and quaint as a paper form."
Trump gifts Pennsylvania mom of three with $100 at grocery store checkout: 'Complete surprise',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-gifts-pennsylvania-mom-three-100-grocery-store-checkout-complete-surprise,2024-09-24T13:48:00Z,"Jenny and Bryant Kantz join 'Fox & Friends' to share their story after meeting former President Trump at the grocery store, explaining how their family has been impacted by inflation.

Pennsylvania mom of three Jenny Kantz found it a ""complete surprise"" when former President Trump handed her $100 at a grocery store checkout line to take the pinch out of her bill.

""It was a great experience,"" she told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday.

Sitting alongside her husband Bryant, Jenny enthused about meeting the former president at the Sprankles Grocery Store her cousin owns in Kittanning, northeast of Pittsburgh on Monday.

Trump's team reportedly requested that someone be present at the checkout counter upon his arrival, but Kantz says she had no idea he had planned to give her money from his own wallet.

HARRIS AND TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN PENNSYLVANIA AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRAILS IN 'BLUE WALL' STATES: POLL

Video of the moment shows Trump handing over the cash and telling Kantz, ""It [the cost] just went down 100 bucks. We'll do that for you from the White House.""

""The total bill was $194 and some change, and the inflation on groceries has definitely affected us,"" Kantz explained on Tuesday.

""I think it was late 2022 or early 2023, I remember coming home from the grocery store and telling him [Bryant], 'I don't even know how to budget for groceries anymore because it's like every time I go to the store, they just go up and up and up.' That, paired with the rising cost of energy, fuel for our vehicles... it just means that we watch a little bit more closely what we spend.""

According to ConsumerAffairs, the Keystone State saw the highest grocery inflation rate in the U.S. with an 8.2% increase in prices.

PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRAT BACKS TRUMP, ISSUES WARNING ON HARRIS: 'THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE HERE'

In Kantz's personal circle, stay-at-home moms have stepped up to get side jobs to cover extra expenses. They have also shifted to homemade foods and opted for recipe-sharing to make their money go further.

Despite cost burdens, Kantz said she plans to keep the $100 bill Trump gave her.

""I'm going to frame it,"" she laughed.

Best No Late Fee Credit Cards Of 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/no-late-fee-credit-card/,2024-09-24T13:10:12Z,"Not all credit cards charge a late fee, but most of them do. Depending on the card, it may be a flat fee for all late payments or a graduated fee structure, increasing the amount after your first one.

In March 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a final rule lowering the typical credit card late fee from $32 to $8 for major credit card issuers. The new regulation was designed to close a loophole in the Credit CARD Act that allowed financial institutions to adjust their late fees for inflation, even as their costs related to the late payment decreased.

However, the regulation has faced opposition from various industry groups, including the American Bankers Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The rule was initially blocked by a Texas judge due to concerns about the constitutionality of the CFPB's funding structure. But even after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld its funding mechanism, the case has remained in legal limbo, bouncing back and forth between courts in Texas and Washington, D.C. As of August 2024, the fate of the regulation remains unclear."

Consumer products companies are challenged on all fronts. Inflation continues to drive up costs, supply chains remain unpredictable, and consumer behavior changes constantly.

In this volatile economy and rapidly changing industry, how can CPG companies thrive, let alone survive? How can they optimize their operations to drive sustainable, profitable revenue growth?

Simply put, old ways of doing business won't cut it. Today, effective CPG trade and revenue growth management requires a new approach to keep up with the pace of change.

Consumer products companies are challenged on all fronts. Inflation continues to drive up costs, supply chains remain unpredictable, and consumer behavior changes constantly.

In this volatile economy and rapidly changing industry, how can CPG companies thrive, let alone survive? How can they optimize their operations to drive sustainable, profitable revenue growth?

Simply put, old ways of doing business won't cut it. Today, effective CPG trade and revenue growth management requires a new approach to keep up with the pace of change.

With so much rapid, continual change, CPG companies need systems that give them agility and flexibility to reevaluate promotions, plan capacity, and adjust forecasts. Old, manual systems just can't keep up.

Paul Smith, a global solutions manager for trade and revenue growth at SAP, noted that a lot of companies still use Excel to manage trade promotions.

""Doing this as a paperwork exercise or an exercise with partial systems or things slightly bolted together or where you've got batch jobs running - that's when it becomes really painful,"" Smith said.

A more effective approach for managing revenue growth involves integrating trade promotion and revenue growth management capabilities into a holistic enterprise planning ecosystem.

Comprehensive ERP solutions like SAP handle pricing conditions, master data, and trade management, providing a complete system of record.

This streamlines and automates processes by providing teams a single source of truth - including promotion plans, costs, list prices, and discounts rates. Teams get the agility they need to respond quickly to market dynamics.

A data-driven, integrated approach gives companies the real-time visibility and flexibility that's so critical in today's business environment.

For example, they can conduct frequent scenario planning in order to gauge promotion effectiveness. With a central source of truth, they can align with retailers' perspectives and foster better outcomes for all parties, Smith said.

Charette stressed the importance of collaboration between departments, including sales and demand planning. A holistic system connects teams across the enterprise, giving them the same data to improve forecasting accuracy and optimize revenue growth.

The pace of change will only continue to increase for CPG companies. But brands that take steps to modernize their processes and systems will be able to navigate today's market complexities and whatever new challenges come.

By implementing the necessary technology and business changes, they can ensure sustainable and profitable revenue growth for years to come."

TOPLINE Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn sees the language learning app at the forefront of the transition to AI-powered education.

On Tuesday, Duolingo unveiled its first step in that direction: An interactive feature in which users partake in ""video calls"" with Lily, one of Duolingo's beloved mascots. It's a part of the company's paid subscription tier, called Duolingo Max, and allows people to practice conversing in other languages as if FaceTiming with an AI friend, with dialogue generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o model. Another new feature is an AI mini-game called Adventures, which puts users in interactive situations to practice their language skills, like ordering a coffee from a cafe or getting their passport checked.

The new features are the latest wave of tools from a generative AI push the company began last year, when it launched the subscription tier for premium AI features.

Duolingo's focus on AI has translated into a surge in users and revenue: Almost 104 million people take language lessons on the app each month, up 40% year over year. This past quarter, revenue hit $178.3 million, up 41% from last year.

The company's stock, climbing since 2023, hit an all-time high on Monday of $270, vaulting the company to a $11.75 billion market cap and minting von Ahn as a new billionaire. A Forbes analysis of his Duolingo shares, stock options, and assets -- he owns roughly 10% of the company -- confirms his net worth.

But while business is booming right now, competitors are also investing in AI. Babbel, for example, last year debuted a speech recognition feature that learns a user's voice to evaluate their pronunciation. Rosetta Stone also added AI-powered language assessment exams, used in enterprise settings.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Von Ahn sees building an AI tutor as the company's ultimate moonshot,"" says Forbes senior writer Richard Nieva. ""The effort comes as companies everywhere try to inject AI into their products, and Duolingo is no different.

What's Happening With Edwards Lifesciences Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/24/whats-happening-with-edwards-lifesciences-stock/,2024-09-24T12:03:59Z,"Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE: EW), a medical technology company specializing in artificial heart valves, currently trades at $67 per share, about 50% lower than the peak level of $131 seen in December 2021. EW has fared much worse than its peer - Medtronic stock (NYSE: MDT) - down 7% over this period. EW stock has been weighed down after its downbeat outlook for Q3. EW saw its stock trading at around $95 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it's still trading 30% below those levels. This compares with 51% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period.

The decrease in EW stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being appreciably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and uncertain geopolitical environment, could EW stock underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $131 implies that EW stock will have to gain around 2x from here, and we don't think that will materialize anytime soon. We do think EW stock has some room for growth. It currently trades at 6.7x trailing revenues, compared to its average P/S ratio of 10.3x over the last three years. Notably, the $77 average of analysts price estimate reflects around 15% upside from here.

Our detailed analysis of Edwards Lifesciences upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how EW stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

EW stock saw a marginal decline of 5% between August 2008 (pre-crisis peak for EW) and March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It surged post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $7 in early 2010, rising about 55% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

Edwards Lifesciences is going through a major restructuring. It has entered into an agreement to acquire JenaValve Technology, a pioneer in the transcatheter treatment of aortic regurgitation. Also, it has exercised its option to acquire Endotronix, a company focused on heart failure management solutions. These acquisitions will cost the company around $1.2 billion, plus up to $445 million in additional milestone payments. Furthermore, the company has recently divested its Critical Care business for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction. The company will use the net proceeds from the sale to fund the above acquisitions and share repurchases. With this restructuring, Edwards Lifesciences will now be focused on its cardiovascular business.

Does EW Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

Edwards Lifesciences' total debt has been around $700 million in recent years, while its cash is around $2.0 billion. The company also garnered $866 million in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. It will also get a $4.2 billion infusion from the sale of its Critical Care business. Given that Edwards Lifesciences is net debt negative, it is in an excellent position to service its near-term debt obligations.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe Edwards Lifesciences stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, a slowdown in TAVR sales growth remains a risk factor to realizing these gains.

What's Behind The 20% Fall In Diageo Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/24/whats-behind-the-20-fall-in-diageo-stock/,2024-09-24T11:04:58Z,"Diageo (NYSE: DEO) has seen around a 20% fall in value since early January 2023 - declining from levels of $166 then to $133 now - vs. an increase of 51% for the S&P 500 over this period. In comparison, its peer - Anheuser-Busch InBev stock (NYSE: BUD) - has seen an 8% rise over this period. The fall in DEO stock can primarily be attributed to a 20% decline in the company's P/S ratio to 3.7x revenues now, versus 4.7x in 2022, and a 1% fall in total revenues over this period.

The performance of DEO stock with respect to the broader S&P500 index over the recent years has been quite volatile. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and uncertain geopolitical environment, could DEO stock underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Diageo's Valuation to be around $155 per share, around 15% above the current market price. Our forecast is based on a 21x forward expected adjusted earnings of $7.40 per share in 2025. The 21x figure aligns with the stock's average P/E ratio over the last two years.

Diageo revenue declined 1% from $20.5 billion in 2022 to $20.3 billion in 2024. This can be attributed to high inflation and weakening consumer spending. The company has seen its volumes decline lately, especially in the North America region. Consumers are shifting to cheaper alternatives rather than spending on top brands, such as Johnnie Walker. The company reports its revenues under five geographies - North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and Africa. These accounted for 40%, 24%, 19%, 9% and 9% of the company's total sales in 2024, respectively. Higher inventory levels in Latin America have weighed on the company's performance in 2024, with the segment sales down 15% y-o-y. Although the company has seen its revenue decline slightly since 2022, its operating margin has expanded from 28.7% in 2022 to 29.6% in 2024.

Looking forward, we expect the sales to rise at a mid-single-digits average annual growth rate over the next three years. With the interest rate cut cycle underway, the consumer sentiment is expected to improve in the U.S. While the impact of lower rates to flow through the economy may take some time, the consumer confidence should improve owing to controlled inflation. This should bode well for Diageo. With its stock trading at under 18x forward earnings, versus its average P/E ratio of 21x over the last two years, we think much of the ongoing headwinds are priced in. And, investors will likely be better off picking DEO in this decline for robust long-term gains."
Forget The Fed -- China Could Be About To Quietly Blow Up The Bitcoin Price And Crypto Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/24/forget-the-fed-china-could-be-about-to-quietly-blow-up-the-bitcoin-price-and-crypto-market/,2024-09-24T10:55:31Z,"Bitcoin has surged since crashing to September lows of around $52,000 as JPMorgan's chief executive leads a flurry of serious inflation warnings.

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, rocketing by over 200%, largely due to the BlackRock-led Wall Street bitcoin revolution (which is suddenly hurtling toward a fresh earthquake).

Now, as details emerge of a secret meeting between Elon Musk and El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, China has unleashed a flood of stimulus measures designed to prop up its stalling economy, hot on the heels of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and kicking off a global monetary policy easing cycle.

People's Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng has announced a series of ""bold"" stimulus measures, cutting bank reserves by 50 basis points and reducing mortgage rates to spur economic growth.

""I think these are pretty bold moves from authorities,"" Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.Com, told Reuters. ""It doesn't qualify as 'big bang' stimulus. It's mostly targeted at financial markets and supporting the banking system... Overall, for investors, it's a very bullish thing.""

""More and bolder easing measures could also be in store in the coming quarters,"" Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC, added.

The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has so far failed to move on the news out of China even as stocks across Asia soared to their highest in more than two and half years.

""Bitcoin's lack of response to this news, juxtaposed against rallying Chinese indices, highlights that its current beta appears more tightly linked to Fed policy and U.S. markets, as evidenced by near two-year high correlations with U.S. stocks, particularly following last week's FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting,"" Rick Maeda, a Singapore-based research analyst at Presto Research, told Coindesk.

Last week, the Fed's historical 0.5% interest rate cut pushed the bitcoin price sharply higher as traders braced for the beginning of a new liquidity cycle.

The Federal Reserve interest rate cut and stimulus from China are predicted to trigger a bitcoin price surge over the next few years by some bullish investors.

""I still have a $1 million [bitcoin] price target,"" Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of bitcoin and crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went on to set up the Maelstrom investment fund, told Coindesk last week.

""I'm more of a 2026, 2027 sort of person. Next year, we really get a ramp up in fiscal spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election. And if the U.S. dollar declines a lot, then China has room to enact stimulus as well and keep the yuan stable. And then you have the rest of the major central banks following in the footsteps of the Fed. They look at the Fed; they're easing so we can ease too.""

Hayes has previously said he expects a China ""bazooka"" combined with the Fed easing to create a ""glorious"" crypto bull market."
Have economists gone out of fashion in Washington?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2024/09/23/g-s1-23958/economists-influence-washington,2024-09-24T10:31:06Z,"Shortly after World War II, President Harry S. Truman signed into law the Employment Act of 1946. The main purpose of the law was to ensure that Americans had jobs as they came home from war and the economy wound down from wartime production. But the law had a much more lasting legacy: It created the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), which has given official economic analysis and advice to presidents for over 75 years.

For the economics profession, the creation of the CEA was a big deal. All of a sudden they had a formal advisory body to the president of the United States. How many other professions get that? Not many.

Despite signing this legislation into law, however, President Truman was slow to appoint members to the council. People started prodding him. And, finally, he was like, ""Fine, OK. Let's let some egghead economists into the doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.""

The president appointed two Ph.D.-trained economists and a lawyer -- who had started an econ Ph.D. but never finished -- to the three-member council. Of the three, Edwin Griswold Nourse, who got his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago, served as the chair.

Looking back at his time as the first CEA chair in American history, Nourse complained that Truman wasn't actually very interested in the thoughts of economists.

""U.S. News and World Report once had a lengthy survey of opinion about Mr. Truman and one of the things they said is: 'Mr. Truman is uncomfortable with scientists and economists. They are too precise and logical. He works on a different beam,'"" Nourse recalled in a 1972 interview. ""And that, in my judgment, was a very true appraisal of him.... In his decisions he turned automatically to business people, political people, including lawyers.""

While economists were clearly making inroads into policy circles in the 1940s and 1950s, they were mostly just flies on the wall. They had little authority or influence.

As documented by Binyamin Appelbaum in his illuminating book The Economists' Hour, the Federal Reserve back then, for example, was led by lawyers and businesspeople, not economists. Economists who were employed by the Fed, like Paul Volcker, worked largely in anonymity in the basement of its Washington headquarters. Truman's predecessor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was apparently confused by and slightly disparaging of the work of John Maynard Keynes, a giant in the field. President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned the nation against relying too much on technocrats (which includes economists).

In short, real policymaking authority was in the hands of noneconomists.

But in the years that followed, a ""revolution"" swept Washington and economists became something akin to high priests of policy.

""The number of economists employed by the government rose from about 2,000 in the mid-1950s to more than 6,000 by the late 1970s,"" writes Applebaum. Economists began to shape policy and take leadership roles. ""Arthur F. Burns became the first economist to lead the Fed in 1970. Two years later, George Shultz became the first economist to serve as Treasury secretary. In 1978, Volcker completed his rise from the Fed's bowels, becoming the central bank's chairman."" (Listen to our episode about Paul Volcker's storied tenure as Fed chairman here).

From the 1980s until somewhat recently, economists like Milton Friedman and Larry Summers were some of the most influential policy thinkers around.

But now the pendulum seems to be swinging back, with economists and their ideas increasingly being pushed back into the basement. The leading economic thinkers and policymakers are increasingly noneconomists (or, at least, people who do not have advanced degrees in the field).

The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, is a former investment banker and lawyer by training.

As president, Donald Trump demoted the Council of Economic Advisers when he didn't include its chairman in his Cabinet.

The head of President Biden's CEA, Jared Bernstein, studied music and social work. He has no degree in economics.

Some of Kamala Harris' top economic advisers -- from Brian Deese to Mike Pyle to Deanne Millison -- are all lawyers.

And on issues from free trade to immigration to tax policy to rent and price controls, both the Trump and Harris campaigns are throwing bedrock economic ideas in the trash can and embracing heterodox, populist ideas that might get you laughed at in economics courses. (The Indicator recently did an episode touching on this).

In a recent column, economist and Bloomberg opinion writer Allison Schrager identifies one particular school that seems ascendant in economic policymaking circles -- and it's not an economics one. Yale Law School seems to be churning out some of the most important economic thinkers and policymakers around these days.

From Senator and vice presidential candidate JD Vance to FTC Chair Lina Khan to Kamala Harris advisers Brian Deese and Mark Pyle, there are a bunch of Yale Law grads having a big influence on economic thinking and policy.

Even though the acolytes of the Yale Law School of Economics can be found on both sides of the political aisle, Schrager points out, they share a worldview. They are skeptical of free trade. They bash big business. They see the decline of manufacturing not as a natural evolution of the economy but as a policy catastrophe that needs fixing. They support industrial policy, or a more muscular role for the government in shaping industry with policies like tariffs and subsidies. They think a lot about dividing up the economic pie, Schrager says, and less about growing it.

In all this, Schrager says, the Yale Law School of Economics rejects important ideas that have long dominated mainstream economics.

Despite a seeming ideological coherence, however, it's not like Yale Law School is indoctrinating students with this worldview. The school, Schrager says, is not explicitly or systematically teaching this stuff.

Rather, Yale Law School seems to accept and matriculate a pretty diverse array of thinkers. It's just that it's the most prestigious law school in the nation and serves as an important gateway to the Washington elite. Whichever way the political winds blow in Washington, politicians will likely turn to Yale Law School grads because they're smart, connected, ambitious and politically savvy.

The rise of the Yale Law School of Economics seems to say more about the political winds of our times and the declining popularity of economists and their ideas than anything. Free-market policies -- sometimes called ""neoliberalism"" -- are unpopular on both sides of the political aisle right now. Many blame it for widening inequality, the loss of manufacturing jobs and a host of related social ills. ""I don't think a lot of economists would call themselves neoliberal, but a lot of ideas in economics do seem consistent with it,"" Schrager says.

To put it in economics terms, the demand for economists seems to have declined as voters and politicians seek populist policy solutions. When they had the keys to policy, economists may have pushed policies with outcomes that many voters -- especially in crucial Rustbelt swing states -- don't like. Plus, Americans seem to be putting less trust and faith in expertise in general.

Generally speaking, economists may have some serious competitive disadvantages vis-a-vis lawyers in the political world. Schrager says that economists are often ""politically out to lunch"" and more wedded to economic theory and empirical evidence than most lawyers. Lawyers are trained in making arguments and understanding laws, and politicians do stuff by making arguments and laws. Economists are mostly trained to crunch data and develop theories.

In addition, Schrager says, there may be changes in the economics profession that make economists even less well-suited to the world of politics these days. The profession seems to put more emphasis on empirical rigor. They focus more on finding solid evidence using experiments and fancy statistical work -- and that often means trying to answer smaller questions. Schrager says they're focusing less on big economic questions that may have more relevance for policymakers.

Like many others these days, Appelbaum makes clear in his book The Economists' Hour that he thinks the high tide of economist influence over the last 40 or so years was a bad thing. He blames free-market-oriented economists for pushing a set of ideas and policies that widened inequality and made many Americans worse off.

Schrager disagrees. ""I doubt that we had as much power as that book suggests, but I think in the ways we did have power, we were actually pretty successful,"" Schrager says. ""I would call 40 years of low inflation, decent growth, and rising prosperity pretty good things.""

All this said, there are some silver linings for the profession when it comes to politics these days. First off, they're not completely on the outs. Economist extraordinaire Janet Yellen, for example, heads the U.S. Treasury Department. And there are a range of Ph.D.-trained economists advising Donald Trump and other politicians, and so on.

Looking forward, economists might do as they tend to do and comfort themselves with some data. Mark Hallerberg, a political scientist who has studied when economists become top policymakers across OECD countries, says that politicians often appoint economists to top positions in times of change or crisis. There's something about appointing economists to top positions that seems to signal to markets, ""We got this. Don't worry.""

In short, economists might make a comeback if the economy gets rough -- or if the populist ideas being pushed by both political parties prove to be dead ends for greater prosperity.

Moreover, let's not forget: both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris majored in economics as undergrads. That's another win. Plus, Schrager points to the recent presidential debate.

""In the first couple minutes, Trump and Harris debated whose policies economists hate more,"" Schrager says. In other words, they seemed to care what economists think. ""It suggests we still have some influence."""
CNN data guru says Harris is 'struggling among voters of color' in the Sun Belt: 'Really interesting',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-data-guru-says-harris-struggling-among-voters-color-sun-belt-really-interesting,2024-09-24T10:12:27Z,"CNN's data reporter Harry Enten told host Jake Tapper Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling with Black and Hispanic voters compared to former President Biden in 2020.

Vice President Kamala Harris is ""struggling"" with Black and Latino voters in the Sun Belt compared to former President Biden in 2020, CNN data guru Harry Enten said Monday.

On ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" CNN's senior political data reporter noted that, according to NYT/Sienna polling, former President Trump has a slight advantage over Harris in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, the former two of which Biden won.

What's more, Harris is trailing Biden's numbers with Hispanic and Black voters in the region.

""I think this is really interesting,"" Enten said, showing a breakdown of support for Harris today compared to support for Biden in 2020 in the three Sun Belt states.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES

""Hispanic voters, four years ago, Joe Biden won that vote 66% in the Sun Belt,"" he said. ""Look at where we are now, Kamala Harris at just 52%, so Kamala Harris struggling among Hispanic voters. Donald Trump doing considerably better than he did 4 years ago.""

""How about Black voters?"" Enten continued. ""Kamala Harris, again, leading here by a significant margin, right? She's getting 83% of that vote, but that is significantly short of Joe Biden's 92%.""

""So the bottom line is, in the Sun Belt, which is much more diverse than the northern battleground states up in the Great Lakes, Kamala Harris is struggling among voters of color,"" he added.

Enten also highlighted how, among Sun Belt voters, 31% are most concerned about the economy/inflation, 16% about immigration, and another 16% about abortion. He observed that the first two of these issues are ""great for Donald Trump.""

FOX NEWS POLL: 87% CONSIDER SITUATION AT SOUTHERN BORDER A PROBLEM

Tapper asked what would happen if Harris maintained her hold on the less diverse blue wall states up north while Trump maintains his advantage in the Sun Belt.

""Oh my goodness, look how close this race is. 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 262 because she carries these Great Lake battleground states, even if she loses in North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona,"" Enten replied. ""But the bottom line is this, Mr. Tapper, this race is way too close to call based upon the polling that I currently see."""
It's Time For The Truth On The High Cost Of Drugs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2024/09/24/its-time-for-the-truth-on-the-high-cost-of-drugs/,2024-09-24T10:03:41Z,"Make no mistake, our medicines, like everything else these days, cost far more than they should. Rather than acknowledging the actual causes of today's income-sapping inflation and high drug prices, far-leftists, such as millionaire socialist Senator Bernie Sanders, indulge in diversionary political theater to mask Democratic policy failings.

Sanders' favored form of demagogic diversionary theater is the CEO perp walk, whereby he marches business leaders to stand before his ironically named Senate HELP Committee and throws angry tirades devoid of facts at them in front of an accommodating media.

The upcoming hearing with the CEO of drugmaker Novo Nordisk, Lars Jørgensen, will likely be no different -- unless other members of the committee and the media cast aside Sanders' circus and instead focus on what actually drives up drug prices that U.S. seniors and the rest of the population pay.

First, some context. Generally speaking, prices for prescription drugs -- unlike the costs of groceries, energy, rent and other daily necessities -- have risen at a slower pace than the terrible inflation caused by President Biden's and Vice President Kamala Harris' economic policies. In fact, wholesale prices paid to drugmakers have largely gone down in recent years, which begs the question: Why have prices that patients pay through their insurance or other healthcare plans gone up so significantly?

At the center of the problem are pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), three of which are owned by the biggest insurance companies and control 75% of the prescription drug market. These corporate middlemen stand between drugmakers and patients. They secretly command a drug-formulary-and-rebate system that exists only in the U.S. Thanks to an unjustifiable special exemption from federal antikickback-corruption laws granted by Congress, PBMs are allowed to pocket massive drug-pricing rebates -- often 40% and higher -- instead of passing on those savings directly to patients. This is why the difference between what a drugmaker is paid and what a patient pays at the pharmacy counter is so great.

In any other industry, the practices of some of these companies would be subject to federal prosecution and carry criminal penalties. Instead, the Biden-Harris White House and congressional Democrats chose to manipulate public anger over patients' out-of-pocket costs to advance their unrelated political and policy priorities. They're doing it by masking their massive green-energy spending plan as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which passed two years ago, and marketing it as a drug-pricing and Medicare-reform bill.

The Democrats' IRA not only left the PBMs' unique exemption from federal anticorruption laws in place but also gave them a further financial windfall by extending it. Meanwhile, the vast majority of older Americans haven't seen their out-of-pocket drug costs go down. Worse, instead of paying lower drug prices, they've seen Medicare drug plan premiums spike 20%- 120%.

After all, someone had to pay for the IRA's diverting an estimated $260 billion in projected Medicare savings to unrelated projects. These include billions of dollars meant for Medicare instead going to tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles and solar panels, green-energy grants to favored corporations and massive new nonMedicare subsidies to big insurers.

Moreover, prior authorizations and access restrictions are on the rise. Up to 2 million seniors could be kicked off their current Part D plans because fewer choices are available as a direct result of the IRA.

What about the IRA's promised savings resulting from giving the federal government the power to negotiate Medicare drug prices? The Biden-Harris Administration recently boasted that it had secured $1.5 billion in direct drug-cost savings for seniors. But that's spread across 55 million-plus people in the Medicare program and doesn't apply until 2026. As for the IRA's capping seniors' drug costs, it turns out the cap will benefit less than 6% of Medicare drug plan enrollees next year.

All this should be the focus of Senator Saunders' hearing, but it won't be. Instead, he'll be attempting to villainize a unique European company (its largest shareholder is a charitable organization) that must grapple with America's failed drug-pricing system. Novo Nordisk also spent billions of dollars in R&D to develop treatments for diabetes and obesity. Along with leading U.S. drugmakers, Novo Nordisk has helped spur competition in ways that can help drive down the costs of becoming healthier.

The Biden-Harris Administration's key tool in controlling drug prices is threatening to penalize or strip the patents from innovators. This takes away any incentive for companies to invest in breakthrough treatments that will save future lives. In contrast, if the administration were to eliminate the PBMs' special exemption from federal antikickback laws and ensure savings went directly to patients, as former President Trump tried to do, that would significantly lower Americans' drug costs almost overnight. Instead of going along with Bernie Sanders' bullying, Democrats and the media should insist on the enactment of this basic reform."

The price of gold today, as of 9:07am, was £1,968.19 per ounce. That's up 0.03% on yesterday's closing price of £1,967.53.

Compared to last week, the price of gold is up 0.16%, and it's up 3.64% from one month ago.

The 52-week gold price high is £1,968.64, while the 52-week gold price low is £1,851.91.

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation."

Today's average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.65%, up 0.04 percentage point from the previous week, according to Curinos.

Borrowers may be able to save on interest costs by going with a 15-year fixed mortgage, which will typically have a lower rate than a 30-year, fixed-rate home loan. The average APR on a 15-year fixed mortgage is 5.74%. However, a 15-year mortgage means you are paying off the house in half the amount of time compared to a 30-year term, so your monthly payments will be higher.

30-Year Mortgage Rates

Today, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage is 6.65%, compared to last week when it was 6.61%.

The annual percentage rate (APR) on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.67%. The APR was 6.62% last week. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

With today's interest rate of 6.65%, a 30-year fixed mortgage of $100,000 costs approximately $642 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. Borrowers will pay about $131,179 in total interest over the life of the loan.

15-Year Mortgage Rates

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 5.71%, higher than it was one day ago. Last week, it was 5.69%.

On a 15-year fixed, the APR is 5.74%. Last week it was 5.69%.

At today's interest rate of 5.71%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $828 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $49,117 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Jumbo Mortgage Rates

Today's average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage climbed 0.08 point from last week to 6.76%.

Borrowers with a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.76% will pay approximately $649 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,867.

What's an APR, and Why Is It Important?

APR, or annual percentage rate, is a calculation that includes both a loan's interest rate and a loan's finance charges, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. In other words, it's the total cost of credit. APR accounts for interest, fees and time.

Since APRs include both the interest rate and certain fees associated with a home loan, the APR can help you understand the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it for the entire term. The APR will usually be higher than the interest rate, but there are exceptions.

How Are Mortgage Rates Determined?

Mortgage interest rates are determined by several factors, including some that borrowers can't control:

Federal Reserve. The Fed rate hikes and decreases adjust the federal funds rate, which helps determine the benchmark interest rate that banks lend money at. As a result, mortgage rates tend to move in the same direction with the Fed's rate decision. Bond market. Mortgages are also loosely connected to long-term bond yields as investors look for income-producing assets -- specifically, the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond. Home loan rates tend to increase as bond prices decrease, and vice versa. Economic health. Rates can increase during a strong economy when consumer demand is higher and unemployment levels are lower. Anticipate lower rates as the economy weakens and there is less demand for mortgages. Inflation. Banks and lenders may increase rates during inflationary periods to slow the rate of inflation. Additionally, inflation makes goods and services more expensive, reducing the dollar's purchasing power.

While the above factors set the base interest rate for new mortgages, there are several areas that borrowers can focus on to get a lower rate:

Credit score. Applicants with a credit score of 670 or above tend to have an easier time qualifying for a better interest rate. Typically, most lenders require a minimum score of 620 to qualify for a conventional mortgage. Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Lenders may issue mortgages to borrowers with a DTI of 50% or less. However, applying with a DTI below 43% is recommended. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Conventional home loans charge private mortgage insurance when your LTV exceeds 80% of the appraisal value, meaning you need to put at least 20% down to avoid higher rates. Additionally, FHA mortgage insurance premiums expire after the first 11 years when you put at least 10% down. Loan term. Longer-term loans such as a 30-year or 20-year mortgage tend to charge higher rates than a 15-year loan term. However, your monthly payment can be more affordable over a longer term. Residence type. Interest rates for a primary residence can be lower than a second home or an investment property. This is because the lender of your primary mortgage receives compensation first in the event of foreclosure.

What Is the Best Type of Mortgage Loan?

Conventional home loans are issued by private lenders and typically require good or excellent credit and a minimum 20% down payment to get the best rates. Some lenders offer first-time home buyer loans and grants with relaxed down payment requirements as low as 3%.

For buyers with limited credit or finances, a government-backed loan is usually the better option as the minimum loan requirements are easier to satisfy.

For example, FHA loans can require 3.5% down with a minimum credit score of 580 or at least 10% down with a credit score between 500 and 579. However, upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums can apply for the life of the loan.

Buyers in eligible rural areas with a moderate income or lower may also consider USDA loans. This program doesn't require a down payment, but you pay an upfront and annual guarantee fee for the life of the loan.

If you come from a qualifying military background, VA loans can be your best option. First, you don't need to make a down payment in most situations. Second, borrowers pay a one-time funding fee but don't pay an annual fee as the FHA and USDA loan programs require.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

What is a good mortgage rate?

A competitive mortgage rate currently ranges from 6% to 8% for a 30-year fixed loan. Several factors impact mortgage rates, including the repayment term, loan type and borrower's credit score.

How to get a lower mortgage interest rate?

Comparing lenders and loan programs is an excellent start. Borrowers should also strive for a good or excellent credit score between 670 and 850 and a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less.

Further, making a minimum down payment of 20% on conventional mortgages can help you automatically waive private mortgage insurance premiums, which increases your borrowing costs. Buying discount points or lender credits can also reduce your interest rate.

How long can you lock in a mortgage rate?

Most rate locks last 30 to 60 days and your lender may not charge a fee for this initial period. However, extending the rate lock period up to 90 or 120 days is possible, depending on your lender, but additional costs may apply.

Opinion | Harris is finally catching up to Trump on the all-important economy question,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-finally-catching-trump-important-economy-question-rcna171994,2024-09-23T18:03:24Z,"If this result holds up, it could be fatal to the former president's chances of winning back the White House.

It's one of the enduring mysteries of American politics: Despite the irrefutable evidence that the economy performs better under Democratic presidents by almost any measure, much of the voting public remains convinced that Republicans are better economic stewards. But if recent polling is accurate, glimmers of sense are breaking through. In several recent polls, Vice President Kamala Harris has nearly erased former President Donald Trump's advantage on the question of which candidate would be better for the economy. If this result holds up, it could be fatal to his chances of winning back the White House. It would be nice if this change were a testament to the voters' rationality and keen economic understanding. But it isn't.

In the latest NBC News poll -- with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points -- voters give Trump a 50-41 advantage on ""dealing with the economy."" That 9-point deficit may not sound like good news for Harris, until you learn that at the beginning of the year, Trump's advantage over President Joe Biden on that question was more than 20 points.

Other polls have shown even better results for Harris. A CBS News/YouGov poll found that Trump leads by only 53-47 among those who say the economy is a major factor in their vote. A Fox News poll showed Trump ahead of Harris by 5 points on this measure. An AP-NORC poll showed Trump leading Harris by only 2 points on who voters trust on the economy. A Quinnipiac poll of swing states found a similar gap. A Morning Consult poll show the two tied on the same question. And a Financial Times/University of Michigan poll found Harris leading by 2 points. (The CBS result lies outside the margin of error, while all the other poll findings are within those surveys' margin of error.)

While the numbers vary somewhat, the overall trend is clear: Voters are much more favorably inclined toward the Democratic nominee on the economy than they used to be -- which is a huge win for Harris. Before Biden exited the race, Trump was obliterating him on these economic questions, even though Biden's economic stewardship was worlds ahead of Trump's.

The lead Trump enjoyed earlier in the year can be attributed to a combination of amnesia, delusion, and the widely shared sense that the 81-year-old Biden just wouldn't be up to the job in a second term. Voters somehow forgot how Trump's mismanagement of the pandemic made the inevitable downturn deeper and more difficult to recover from.

The former president may be fond of asking, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" But the appropriate answer is, ""Are you kidding?"" Four years ago the economy was 10 million jobs in the hole from pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate was still 7.8% (today it's 4.2%). Even before the pandemic, Trump also ballooned the deficit, which Republicans pretend to care about, with tax cuts aimed at the wealthy.

Even if you want to excuse Trump from blame for the pandemic recession (which you shouldn't), Biden's economic performance was almost miraculous: millions of jobs created, growth steady, a dramatic surge in manufacturing investment directly spurred by his industrial policy, and an economy that has significantly outperformed our global peers in recovering from the pandemic. That outperformance includes inflation, which spiked globally due to snarled supply chains and corporate price gouging, and which the U.S. recovered from more quickly than peer nations.

Yet millions still believe that not just prices but everything was better under Trump. NPR recently interviewed one Georgia voter who said she's supporting Trump ""because her investments were doing better when he was in office."" Unless she invested in Trump NFTs, it's hard to imagine what she could be talking about. The day before the 2020 election, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 26,925; last Friday it closed at 42,063, for an increase of 56%. The S&P 500 told the same story: It closed at 3,310 the day before the 2020 election, and finished at 5,702 on Friday, for an increase of 72%.

Nevertheless, for a couple of years now, many have been convinced that the economy is a disaster. One poll taken in May showed that 56% of Americans thought we were in a recession, 49% believed the stock market was down for the year, and perhaps most incredibly of all, 49% said unemployment was near a 50-year high, when in fact it's near a 50-year low.

Millions also continue to believe that because he's a rich businessman, Donald Trump must really understand the economy. After all, how could the man behind Trump University, Trump Steaks, and Trump Vodka not be an economic genius?

But that idea seems, finally, to be breaking down. Perhaps some voters have taken a close look at the two candidates' proposals and are starting to conclude that Harris' ideas have more merit. Perhaps they've seen that both conservative and liberal economists agree that Trump's plan for across-the-board tariffs would be an economic disaster. Or maybe they have been impressed with Harris' plan to reduce the price of housing.

More likely, though, is that voters' feelings are translating into economic conclusions. Just as people felt that Biden looked old and feeble and therefore he couldn't have been doing a good job on the economy, now many feel that Harris seems serious and competent, and therefore they can trust her to do a better job. Her ratings overall have improved since her successful convention and strong debate performance, so that halo has extended to economics. And as Trump spends every day spreading insane lies about immigrants, perhaps some voters are questioning his ability to handle a whole range of issues.

There is reason to believe things could get even better for Harris on this score. The Fed's decision to lower interest rates will likely give people confidence that mortgage and car loans will get cheaper. She'll also probably continue to get a boost from something no lawmaker has much control over: the retail price of gas. The national average is now $3.21 and falling, a full 66 cents lower than it was a year ago, and in many states the price is below $3.00.

By the time we get to the election, Harris may have even opened a real lead on the economy. The basis of voters' judgment may not be much more rational than when they thought Trump was an economic wizard. But at least the conclusion won't be so crazy."
"Harris needs to do more interviews to win over undecided swing state voters, urges CNN commentator",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-needs-do-more-interviews-win-over-undecided-swing-state-voters-urges-cnn-commentators,2024-09-23T16:54:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp urged on Monday that Vice President Kamala Harris needed to do more interviews if she wanted to win over undecided voters because they ""still have questions"" about the vice president.

""Kamala Harris still has to introduce herself to people. We're hearing that over and over again from swing state voters, they don't know her enough, so they should both want another debate,"" Cupp said, noting Trump needed to change the momentum in the race. ""They still have questions about Kamala Harris.""

Harris has sat for a few interviews since emerging as the Democratic nominee but has yet to hold a formal press conference.

""So they might stay home. They might vote third party but, they are wanting to hear more from Kamala Harris,"" Cupp said, referring to undecided voters. ""She has identified the correct problems, they say they don't have enough specifics on the solutions. Both politically and practically. What would she do to solve X problem, inflation, for example? And how would she get Congress to go along with it? These are two things that American voters - they're not stupid - they see as real political realities and problems and they want to know more.""

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

CNN's John Berman noted that Harris would be speaking to voters in Georgia about the economy and wondered if it would be heard nationally.

""Nationally, no they won't, which is why she needs more interviews. This is not just S.E. Cupp or journalism asking for more interviews, right? This is because voters are telling us they still have questions. And that media interaction could come in the form of a town hall. It could be podcasts and other kinds of unconventional media, but she's got to do more,"" Cupp warned.

Harris sat for an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, alongside her running mate Gov. Tim Walz, following over a month of pressure and questions surrounding her first sit-down. She has since done a couple of local radio interviews, as well as a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station.

Harris also recently did interviews with the National Association of Black Journalists and with Oprah Winfrey, who endorsed Harris, at a campaign event.

The vice president has been criticized for lacking specific answers and dodging questions during the interviews she has done.

""This week she couldn't or wouldn't answer a single question straight, and people could see it. She is an artless dodger,"" The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan wrote, suggesting voters have a choice between ""awful and empty.""

What Business Leaders Should Know About The Community Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/09/23/what-business-leaders-should-know-about-the-community-economy/,2024-09-23T16:21:47Z,"It finally happened: Last week, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The Fed's policy-setting committee opted for a significant rate cut of half a percentage point, meaning the target federal funds rate is now 4.75% to 5%, down from the 5.25% to 5.5% where it's sat since July 2023.

""This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at the press conference following last Wednesday's announcement.

The decision had a near-immediate impact on markets, which surged immediately after the news, then shrank back a bit as it was digested. On Thursday and Friday, markets continued to climb as investors basked in the optimism a rate cut brings: Cheaper borrowing, more funds circulating for business ventures and expansions, and stronger consumer buying power. The companies leading the post-cut party were some of the same ones that have buoyed markets all year, including Apple, Nvidia and Meta. Other companies that are expected to see more activity in the near future also saw their stocks surge, including construction equipment maker Caterpillar, banking giant Citigroup and private equity firm Blackstone.

But what does the rate cut mean in the long run? And is this the beginning of more leveling off? The answer to both is we'll see. Before the decision came down, Forbes contributor Dan Irvine wrote a 50-basis-point rate cut could show the Fed's commitment to promoting a stable economy -- as well as encouraging job growth, stimulating investment, spurring consumer spending and reinvigorating economic activity. Further, Powell said in the press conference that the Fed's rate cut is the start of ""the cutting cycle,"" meaning more is at least under consideration.

What happens next depends on how businesses, financial institutions, investors and consumers behave. If inflation continues to decrease or stays steady, if employment figures move upward and if the economy sees increased vigor, it may be the beginning of more economic good news. Forbes writers have collected predictions of how the rate cuts will impact different interest groups, ranging from small businesses to student loan borrowers, which you can read here.

Regardless of what the larger economy is doing on a day-to-day basis, business thrives on serving people. Amrapali Gan, the former CEO of OnlyFans, sees the future in businesses based on community. Gan, who started strategy firm Hoxton Projects after stepping down from OnlyFans, recently became a strategic partner and growth advisor to secure women's social platform Communia. I spoke to her about the growth of the community economy and work in safe social platforms dedicated to women's empowerment. An excerpt from our conversation appears later in this newsletter.

In need of a bold shakeup to reinvigorate the company after years of sales declines, Nike made like its legendary slogan: Just do it. Last Thursday, Nike announced that CEO John Donahoe would retire in October -- a decision attributed both to the board and Donahoe in the company release -- and longtime Nike employee Elliott Hill would return from retirement to take the CEO's slot. Hill's hiring supercharged Nike's stock -- which increased as much as 9% right after his appointment was announced last week -- and excited investors.

Donahoe, who took the helm of the athletic shoe and apparel titan in 2020, brought a vastly different approach to the company, which analysts have said contributed to its recent decline. In a LinkedIn post this summer, former Nike executive Massimo Giunco detailed some of the problematic decisions Donahoe had made. He moved away from the warehouse model, making Nike a DTC-first business. He eliminated many of the categories in the organization, making merchandise categories gender-led. And the messaging model switched from marketing and enhancing the brand to digital marketing and sales activation.

Hill is a 32-year Nike veteran who started at the company as an intern in 1988. He climbed the company's ranks to become president of consumer and marketplace, and Fast Company reported many at Nike thought Hill was the obvious choice to become CEO in 2020. After Donahoe was named to the position, Hill retired. Analysts are enthusiastic about Hill's prospects for the company. ""This highly anticipated leadership change will inject a much-needed sense of urgency,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai wrote in a note to clients.

As the federal government has cracked down on monopolies, it's stopped several proposed mergers, but not all of them. Last Tuesday, the Department of Transportation gave its approval to Alaska Airlines' $1.9 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. One day later, the deal was completed. The Transportation Department issued several conditions to Alaska Airlines in order to close the deal: Ensuring frequent flyer miles earned on both airlines would be maintained, continuing essential air support for rural areas, and requiring the same amount of service between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland.

The merger is especially notable because it was approved. The federal government has stopped several other major mergers, including a proposed JetBlue acquisition of Spirit Airlines, and book publisher Penguin Random House's bid to buy Simon & Schuster. Arguments in a three-week trial at which the Federal Trade Commission challenged a proposed merger of grocery chains Kroger and Albertsons wrapped up last week. While a decision could be weeks away, analysts are projecting that deal will also ultimately be blocked, Grocery Dive reported.

While the number of women in the C-suite has increased 12% from 2015 to today, in which nearly three out of 10 top execs are women, there's still a long way to go, the most recent Women in the Workplace report from Lean In and McKinsey showed. Forbes senior contributor Kim Elsesser writes that at the current rate of progress, it will take 22 more years for white women to achieve gender parity at work. For women of color, that milestone will be met in 50 years. Lean In founder Sheryl Sandberg told Elsesser that this problem begins early, with the failure to promote entry-level women to managerial roles. ""Everyone wants women in senior leadership roles, but five years out of college, which is roughly when this happens, if for every 100 men, you only promote 81 women and 54 women of color, you're never going to get there,"" Sandberg explained.

Another problem the report calls out: Men see women's progress and opportunities differently. Among senior leaders, 79% of men think women are well-represented in top leadership, a viewpoint only shared by 55% of women. Close to nine in 10 senior-level men think that women's opportunities to advance have improved, while just over six in 10 women believe similarly.

After spending three years at the online creator platform OnlyFans, and just over a year and a half of that as its CEO, Amrapali ""Ami"" Gan stepped down to pursue her own venture: strategy and branding firm Hoxton Projects. She also came across Communia, a secure social platform for women to have honest and emotional conversations. This summer, Gan joined Communia as a strategic partner and growth advisor.

I talked to Gan about Communia, the up-and-coming community economy it represents, and her work in online platforms dedicated to women's empowerment and security. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A more complete version is available here.

Tell me about what the community economy is and how it works.

Gan: Everyone is familiar with the term 'creator economy' and how the creator economy has truly taken off. The pandemic hit fast forward on that, where everyone with a phone is essentially a content creator: able to share content, create a following and monetize it. Now you have this breadth of creators in various categories.

I see the future being the community economy, which is more about deep, meaningful interactions versus a larger individual talent, influencer or celebrity speaking to a broad audience. Whereas with the community economy, it's more about coming together over a shared experience through shared interest interaction. And that's digital, [but] could be translated to IRL. You're seeing everything from book clubs, run clubs, all of these different experiences on the rise, which are mixing digital and IRL components. That's something Communia also has in the works: smaller IRL events for their community, which they've tested out in the U.K. and starting to do in the Los Angeles area, too.

Thinking about value creation for the community economy, that's really through these shared experience interactions versus creator economy, where it's much more about views, likes and follower accounts. It's a different kind of value. With community, it's much more of that emotional, positive ethos. Anyone can be part of it. It's not necessarily like, 'Oh, I'm just following this person,' and they need to have certain likes on stuff, or engagement, or they're doing brand deals. What is actually meaningful is very different.

The community economy, thinking about relationships, is more about long-term authentic relationships. Whereas the creator economy can be a bit transactional in terms of those brand deals, affiliate codes, links -- which in all honesty, many consumers and fans are a bit fatigued by and are very much aware that that happens. There's been this search for anyone who's engaging digitally. Like, 'Oh, where are there other people that like the same music, sports, going through the same shared life experiences.' That's why I always was gravitating towards Communia because it's a place for these shared experiences, for people to come together who are like-minded and have a safe space. That can be the same thing for people who like going to concerts, sports fans, usually across the board.

Communia is a place that brings women support and empowerment. When you ran OnlyFans, it was as a company that brought a different sort of empowerment to women, but it was made to tailor to their safety and support for them. Why is it important for social platforms to foster a place for women's empowerment?

What's important is that women feel there's some level of control over their identity, their data, their IP, whenever they are using a platform or are in the digital ecosystem. I know when I go online shopping and I give my email, I'm going to end up getting a bunch of stuff. But if I don't want that, I can easily opt-out. Having clear terms of service, knowing what you're getting into when you sign up for a platform. Women are very savvy tech consumers, and that's something that businesses are definitely realizing, and that's what creates an opportunity for a platform like Communia.

Where do you see the community economy going in the next five years?

It's going to continue to grow. You're going to see other platforms come out that appeal to different communities. The future is: people want that connection. If you look at the world right now, there's all these articles about the loneliness epidemic. There's different AI tools coming out that combat that. There's this natural need for, 'Where can I find like-minded people who have the same interests?' And then from there, it just organically grows.

"With Just A Week Left, 'Devastating' Strike At Ports Looks Unavoidable",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2024/09/23/with-just-a-week-left-devastating-strike-at-ports-looks-unavoidable/,2024-09-23T16:14:03Z,"There is only one week left to resolve a major ports strike that could have a huge impact on U.S. retailers just as they come into the most important time of year.

And the odds are not looking good on preventing tens of thousands of International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) maritime workers at ports from the top to the bottom of the country going on strike on September 30.

That's the crucial date when a six-year master contract between the ILA -- the largest union of maritime workers in North America -- and the United States Maritime Alliance covering East and Gulf Coast ports is due to expire. The contract includes six of the 10 busiest U.S. ports, handling more than 13 million containers annually, among three dozen ports covered.

The ILA has consistently threatened to take strike action if a new contract is not agreed and now retailers are bracing for the shutdown just as they are in the midst of preparing for the holiday season, the most critical three-month period of the year. For some businesses, it accounts for more than half their annual sales.

Little wonder than that the CEO of the retail industry's largest trade body, the National Retail Federation (NRF), earlier this month called for both parties to negotiate a settlement.

""The threat of a strike during the peak shipping season has many retailers already implementing costly mitigation strategies,"" NRF CEO Matt Shay said. ""At a time when inflation is on the downward trend, a strike or other disruption would significantly impact retailers, consumers and the economy. The administration needs to offer any and all support to get the parties back to the table to negotiate a new contract.""

The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) echoed that sentiment in a statement earlier this month: ""The importance of keeping these ports operational cannot be overstated, especially as the peak holiday season approaches. A disruption in cargo movements would have profound consequences for retailers, manufacturers, and consumers across the country.""

For its part, the ILA is negotiating on behalf of 45,000 dockworkers and has warned its members are prepared to down tools if they can't agree a new contract by the October 1 deadline.

In June, the NRF and a coalition of 158 state and federal trade associations called for the Biden administration to help the two parties return to the negotiating table after discussions had stalled. The NRF and a number of other trade associations have also written multiple letters asking the president to ensure there is no disruption to the port operations.

Presidents have the authority to intervene in labor disputes that pose a threat to national security or safety under the Taft-Hartley Act, which lets the president impose an 80-day cooling-off period under which workers go back to work while negotiations continue. However, the Biden administration has indicated that it doesn't plan to use that authority if the longshoremen strike.

Retailers have been preparing for months, with an unusually busy summer suggesting that many retailers were trying to get ahead of the curve, while also mitigating against disruption in the supply chain around the Middle East.

They could choose to redirect imports to Canadian ports, although several of those are also facing the possibility of industrial action, or switch to air transport, which is far more expensive.

""A sleeping giant is ready to roar on Tuesday, October 1, 2024, if a new Master Contract Agreement is not in place,"" warned ILA President Harold Daggett in a statement. ""My members have been preparing for over a year for that possibility of a strike.""

The union is arguing for improved wages and continued protections against automation and new technology in its terminals and noted that in the last three years wages have failed to keep pace with inflation.

If the workers do walk off the job, it would be the first national longshoremen's strike since 1977."
Marxist leader sworn in as president of country with 22M people,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/marxist-leader-sworn-president-country-22m-people,2024-09-23T15:31:49Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Marxist politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake officially entered office as the president of Sri Lanka on Monday.

Dissanayake, 55, defeated President Ranil Wickremesinghe, whose party was accused of leading the country into an economic crisis. The new leader's party is the People's Liberation Front, a Marxist group that launched two armed insurrections during the 1970s and 1980s.

""We have deeply understood that we are going to get a challenging country,"" Dissanayake said during his swearing-in ceremony. ""We don't believe that a government, a single party or an individual would be able to resolve this deep crisis.

Chinese president Xi Jinping congratulated Dissanayake on his victory, saying on Monday that China looks forward to working together ""to jointly carry forward our traditional friendship."" The U.S. and India previously congratulated Dissanayake.

Reuters reports that inflation rose as high as 70% after the 2022 collapse due to a severe shortage of dollars. Inflation has since cooled, however, and the nation's GDP is expected to grow ""for the first time in three years.""

Dissanayake's inauguration is the first standard transfer of power in Sri Lanka since 2022, when rioters forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign and flee the country. Wickremesinghe then replaced him in the fallout.

Energy Revenue Fuels A War-Time Moscow Boom,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2024/09/23/energy-revenue-fuels-a-war-time-moscow-boom/,2024-09-23T15:23:08Z,"Hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into Russia from oil and gas sales are fueling Moscow's war effort in Ukraine and more. Unbeknownst to diplomats and other decision-makers, energy export revenues drive the massive geo-economic polarization between East and West, as petro and gas dollars pour into the Russian tech sector.

Russia's capital -- and especially the hi-tech/IT sectors -- are the prime beneficiaries of the East-West confrontation. This has significant long-term secondary and tertiary consequences. According to the Russian news agency TASS, in 2023, public and private annual investment inflows into the capital city reached $73.5 billion and growing. $1.7 billion in high-tech exports are projected for 2023. These geo-economic effects are working to change the geopolitical landscape and the global balance of power of the 21 century, something many Western policymakers may not be aware of.

The limitations of the Western sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine directly affected the landscape. The Biden Administration never enacted a full embargo on Russian oil due to worries that high oil prices that would fuel inflation. Instead, it created an oil price cap of $60 per barrel for countries not participating in the embargo, allowing Moscow to rake in exorbitant revenues for its energy exports.

Since 2022, Russia has earned some €742 billion from fossil fuel exports. After losing the European markets, millions of barrels of discounted Urals brand oil went to China and India. At the same time, natural gas continued to flow to landlocked European countries, including Austria, Czechia, Hungary, and Slovakia. The West never sanctioned the exports of Russian liquified natural gas.

As a result of the West's war sanctions, Russian capital flight has been cut dramatically. In 2015-2020, an estimated $150 billion left Russia for the West (0.8 percent of GDP). In 2022, the invasion of Ukraine, combined with rule of law deficiencies, the prosecution of oligarchs, and sometimes violent property disputes, caused a record $239 billion (13 percent of GDP) to flee the country. Now banking and financial sanctions are precluding financial outflows, and capital flight diminished to $29 billion for the first half of 2023.

While the middle class spends money on restaurants and mostly Chinese cars, oligarchs invest at home. The pent-up billions in Russia have fueled a boom reminiscent of the war-time prosperity in St. Petersburg and Moscow during World War I. During that conflict, war contracts, bribes, and compensation for the dead and the wounded drove up inflation and contributed to the popular resentment that led to two revolutions and finished off the Russian Empire. For now, the war boom is fueling industrial developments, with unexpected long-term consequences that are unlikely to be welcome in the West.

As always, in Russia, Moscow benefits from the revenue more than any other region. The billions pouring into hi-tech and IT have created world-class digital services allowing 24-hour deliveries of food, advanced one-stop apps that allow utility payments, bookings of doctors' appointments, and childcare. The government platforms even provide online birth certificates and passport applications. While Russians who emigrated after the big invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 often struggle to open bank accounts or get credit cards, Muscovites use their own MIR card system, QR code payments, and even a face recognition system called Face Pay, which is used in public transit or regular shopping, is similar to the Global Entry tech in US airports and allows contactless payments. One can only imagine such a system's data harvesting and privacy implications.

As tax revenues pour in, Moscow's ambitious mayor Sergey Sobyanin directed cash flows into infrastructure development and tech. There is the highest share of electric buses in Europe (1/3 of the total), and new metro and high-speed rail lines are spreading to new life-and-work centers that used to be bedroom communities.

Moscow also has become the leading Russian hub for IT development for exports, which declined from its high of $10 billion in 2021. It's dwarfed by the Indian software and Chinese electronics exports. But while Indians and Africans may be wary of Chinese software products, they are more open to Russian apps that may harvest terabytes of data and, combined with facial recognition, jeopardize the customers' national security. After all, we remember the Kaspersky virus checker program once purchased by the U.S. Government and eventually banned because of the alleged collaboration between Kaspersky and the Russian intelligence services.

Russia is also developing AI-powered systems for city transport monitoring and road development for domestic use and exports. With abundant stranded gas and limited export options, Russia will direct at least 1 Gigawatt of new energy capacity to support new data centers in the Moscow region. While still much smaller than U.S projections of a $200 billion industry by 2030, Russia's quickly growing $1 billion data center sector is vying to compete with China and the West.

Moscow is trying to attract celebrities and investors. The World Development Organization, a mostly-BRICS body, conducted a competition event in Moscow in September, at which Sobyanin received an innovation award. For the BRICS Urban Forum Cloud City, the city announced the participation of Thomas Sudhof, a Stanford biochemist, and Columbia University economics professor Jeffrey Sachs.

The tragic background of this techno-feast and geopolitical shift is hard to ignore, but there are winners and losers when the tectonic plates of geopolitics shift. While hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians are being killed and wounded, the world is witnessing the greatest geopolitical realignment since the end of the Cold War. Russia and China, leaders of the BRICs and Shanghai Cooperation Organization, are slowly but surely attempting to create a counterbalance to NATO and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the polarization includes hi-tech growth fueled by growing hydrocarbon revenues.

It is too early to tell whether the Russian wartime boom is sustainable and if global energy and tech polarization is reversible. Still, the unintended consequences of the conflict and the sanctions are there for all to see -- and to be contemplated by the next U.S. Administration after the November elections."
What's Happening With FMC Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/23/whats-happening-with-fmc-stock/,2024-09-23T13:03:33Z,"FMC Corporation stock (NYSE: FMC), an agricultural science company focused on products to improve crop yield and quality, currently trades around $64 per share, roughly 51% below its pre-inflation shock highs of around $131 seen in April 2022. FMC has fared much worse than its peer - CF Industries stock (NYSE: CF) - down 10% over this period. FMC stock has been weighed down after falling sales volume and destocking dampened its financial performance over the last year or so. Its business in Latin America also took a massive hit, with sales down 33% y-o-y in 2023. FMC saw its stock trading at around $101 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it's still trading 36% below those levels. This compares with 51% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period.

The decrease in FMC stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FMC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $130 implies that FMC stock will have to gain around 2x from here, and we don't think that will materialize anytime soon. We do think FMC stock has a some room for growth. It currently trades at 2x trailing revenues, compared to its average P/S ratio of 2.3x seen over the last three years. Notably, the $72 average of analysts price estimate reflects around 12% upside from here.

Our detailed analysis of FMC Corporation's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how FMC stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

FMC stock declined 20% from nearly $18 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak for the markets) to $14 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It bounced after the 2008 crisis to levels of around $20 in early 2010, rising nearly 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

FMC's Fundamentals Over Recent Years

FMC Corporation's revenue declined from $5.0 billion in 2021 to $4.1 billion in the last twelve months. This can be attributed to lower sales volumes amid destocking of its products. A drought in Brazil last year also weighed on its sales. Not only did the company see its sales decline, its operating margin contracted from 22.5% in 2021 to 13.9% now. However, there has been some recovery this year. The company's Q2 sales were up 4% -y-o-y on an organic basis. The North America region led this growth with sales rising 24% y-o-y. Its adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share were up 26% y-o-y.

Looking forward, FMC expects its revenue to be in the range of $4.30 billion to $4.50 billion in 2024, reflecting a 2% decline at the midpoint versus 2023. It expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.64 per share, reflecting a decline of 12% at the midpoint versus 2023.

Does FMC Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

FMC's total debt increased from $3.3 billion in 2021 to $4.2 billion now, while its cash decreased from $517 million to $472 million over this period. The company also garnered $481 million in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Given that FMC's market capitalization is $8 billion, a debt level of $4 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of around 50%. Its cash as a percentage of assets of under 4% is low. This implies that the company's financial position isn't great.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe FMC Corporation stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, the pressure on the company's sales volume and a large debt obligation, remains a significant risk factor to realizing these gains.

"As Robinson staffers quit, Vance questions 'reality' of scandal",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/robinson-staffers-quit-vance-questions-reality-scandal-rcna172193,2024-09-23T12:35:16Z,"JD Vance isn't sure if Mark Robinson's scandal in North Carolina is real. The gubernatorial candidate's top aides, however, were apparently convinced.

Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson was already on track to lose North Carolina's gubernatorial race, but the right-wing candidate's troubles went from bad to worse last week. CNN appeared to uncover evidence of the GOP candidate publishing to a porn website's message board, describing himself as a ""black NAZI."" The same report pointed to evidence of Robinson having written that slavery wasn't necessarily a ""bad"" thing and about his enjoyment of transgender pornography.

While Robinson has denied the accuracy of the reporting, the Republican -- who was widely recognized as a radically extreme candidate before these allegations -- continued to face related accusations in the days that followed. The Washington Post reported late Friday, ""A porn site user linked to North Carolina gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson praised Adolf Hitler's book 'Mein Kampf.'""

NBC News hasn't confirmed the allegations, but it did shine a light on the exodus from the right-wing candidate's campaign headquarters.

These were not obscure figures on Team Robinson. On the contrary, with roughly six weeks remaining before Election Day, the scandal-plagued candidate just lost his campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, finance director, and senior adviser.

The local NPR affiliate reported soon after that, in the wake of the resignations, Robinson's campaign operation was left with just three paid aides -- one of whom is the candidate's bodyguard.

Given these circumstances, it's tempting to think the party's presidential ticket might take overt steps to distance itself from the North Carolinian. After all, as recently as Thursday, there were reports that some working on behalf of Donald Trump's campaign were among those urging Robinson to withdraw from the race.

But as things stand, Team Trump isn't prepared to abandon the gubernatorial hopeful just yet.

The former president campaigned in North Carolina on Saturday, and while Trump didn't share the stage with Robinson, and he was careful not to mention Robinson, Trump campaign insiders told NBC News the White House hopeful has no plans to pull his endorsement.

As for Trump's running mate, JD Vance's initial response to the scandal was to argue online that Robinson is less important than grocery prices. (A report in The Atlantic noted last week, ""U.S. grocery inflation has been dead in its tracks since last year -- prices are up just about 1 percent compared with summer 2023."")

That was not, however, the Ohio senator's final word on the subject. NBC News reported:

In comments to the network affiliate in Philadelphia, the Republican vice presidential hopeful said on camera, ""The allegations are pretty far out there, of course, but I know that allegations aren't necessarily reality."" Asked whether he believed Robinson's seemingly outlandish denials, Vance went on to say, ""I don't not believe him, I don't believe him.""

Evidently, those responsible for running Robinson's statewide campaign came to a very different conclusion.

As the election season progresses, let's also not forget that Robinson faced perfectly credible primary rivals earlier this year, both of whom warned North Carolina Republicans that Robinson's unambiguous record of radicalism made him a poor choice for a critically important race.

Trump backed him anyway, and local GOP voters backed Robinson over his intraparty rivals by a lopsided margin.

Primary election results have consequences, too."
Republican Party is the only home for Hispanics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/republican-party-only-home-hispanics,2024-09-23T12:10:11Z,"Hispanics are the largest and most important minority group in the United States, making up 1 in 5 Americans.

As a group, we are far from a cultural monolith; but despite the array of reflected countries and traditions, our community is united through shared values grounded in family and faith. The Republican Party is the only party that reflects these values in 2024.

President Trump's increasing support among Hispanic voters indicates a Latin shift toward the Republican Party. A recent NPR/Marist poll shows Trump leading by four points with Hispanic voters over Harris.

In fact, President Trump could become the first Republican in history to win a majority of the Hispanic vote, and stands unparalleled in the support he has inspired among Hispanic voters.

TRUMP OUTPERFORMING 2020 SUPPORT AMONG HISPANICS, WHO PREFER HIM ON IMMIGRATION, POLL SHOWS

The Hispanic community has finally realized that Democratic ideologies fail to represent them.

Hispanic values are Republican values: we are a community grounded in hard work, faith, family and country. This reality is one I see every day in Miami, my home district.

Miami is one of the most diverse cities in America, and I've experienced firsthand how the Republican message on key issues - the economy, immigration and community safety - resonates strongly with my community.

This demographic shift reflects a larger rejection of Biden-Harris policies that have devastated the country. Under Democratic executive leadership, our economy has been crippled with sky-high inflation, hitting a 40-year high while gas is up 50% and groceries are up 22%.

HISPANIC VOTERS IN NEVADA SAY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKING SOME CONSIDER VOTING TRUMP

Our communities are also less safe. Directly thanks to Kamala Harris' failure to secure our borders, many American cities like Miami are now home to the most dangerous gangs in South America like Tren de Aragua.

Harris has allowed for mass migration and created the greatest injustice for the Hispanic community in the history of America. Harris has failed the Hispanic community through her inaction, and now, through her plans if elected president.

The Harris economic plan demonstrates her open embrace of socialist policies. Her plan includes Soviet-style price controls like those used in Cuba and North Korea that cause famine and food shortages. Harris even proposed a tax on small-businesses higher than that in Communist China.

Like my own parents, many in my community have fled oppression in their homelands, and fear policies that embrace the same dangerous socialist and communist ideologies they escaped. They are now voting Republican to avoid reliving this trauma in the U.S., even in Democratic districts.

Hispanic support for the Republican Party has become evident even in traditionally Democratic strongholds like my own district in Miami-Dade County. I represent one of the most Democratic congressional seats held by a Republican in the nation. My district is the only one where Biden won, yet the Democratic incumbent in Congress lost, outside of California.

This was only possible because I understand my community's needs and aspirations, and realize how well aligned the Republican Party is for Hispanic support. Given that 1 in 8 eligible voters are Hispanic, that support could be monumental.

It is my hope that the rest of the party realizes and welcomes my community as well.

As we approach the 2024 election, it is clear that Hispanic voters, like those I represent, will play a pivotal role. Our values, aspirations and shared experiences have led many to find a new home in the Republican Party, heralding a new era of political engagement.

To that, my Republican colleagues and I must say, ""Welcome home; we're happy you're here!"""
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 23, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-23-24/,2024-09-23T11:30:05Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are going up. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Shopping for an account where you can save for a rainy day or retirement? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are infamous for paying teensy interest rates. That has changed, thanks to the Fed's campaign of interest rate hikes to combat inflation last year. But even though the Fed hasn't raised its rate since July 2023, consumer deposit yields remain high.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you score a basic savings account with a rate in that range, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. That's the same as a week ago. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay considerably higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.26% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Mortgage Rates Today: September 23, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-09-23-24/,2024-09-23T11:30:00Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.61% with an APR of 6.63%, according to Curinos. The 15-year fixed mortgage has an average rate of 5.66% with an APR of 5.69%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.69% with an APR of 6.72%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.61%, which is 0.01 percentage point higher than last week.

The interest plus lender fees, called the annual percentage rate (APR), on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.63%. The APR was 6.61% last week.

To get an idea about how much you might pay in interest, consider that the current 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage of 6.61% on a $100,000 loan will cost $640 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. The total amount you'll pay in interest during the loan's lifespan is $130,250.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate is 5.66%, lower than it was yesterday. Last week, it was 5.71%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.69%. It was 5.69% this time last week.

With an interest rate of 5.66%, you would pay $826 per month in principal and interest for every $100,000 borrowed. Over the life of the loan, you would pay $48,617 in total interest.

On a 30-year jumbo, the average interest rate is 6.69%, lower than it was at this time last week. The average rate was 6.71% at this time last week.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.69% will pay $644 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,833 and you'd pay roughly $989,923 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Mortgages and mortgage lenders are often a part of purchasing a home, but it can be difficult to understand what you're paying for -- and what you can actually afford.

Using a mortgage calculator can help you estimate your monthly mortgage payment based on your interest rate, purchase price, down payment and other expenses.

Here's what you'll need in order to calculate your monthly mortgage payment:

The first step on your homebuying journey should be to calculate affordability. You'll want to find out how much you can afford based on things like income, debt and savings.

Here are a few important factors that go into home affordability:

Home loan borrowers can qualify for better mortgage rates by having good or excellent credit, maintaining a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and pursuing loan programs that don't charge mortgage insurance premiums or similar ongoing charges that increase the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).

Comparing rates from different mortgage lenders is an excellent starting point. You may also compare conventional, first-time homebuyer and government-backed programs like FHA and VA loans, which have different rates and fees.

For the most part, several economic factors influence the trajectory of rates for new home loans. The recent Federal Reserve rate hikes don't directly cause mortgage rates to rise but have indirectly caused the interest rates for many long-term loans to increase. Rates are more likely to decrease when the Fed pauses or decreases its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.

Further, the inflation rate and the general state of the economy directly impact interest rates. High inflation and a strong economy typically signal higher rates. Cooling consumer demand or inflation may help rates decrease.

Conventional home loans are issued by private lenders and typically require good or excellent credit and a minimum 20% down payment to get the best rates. Some lenders offer first-time home buyer loans and grants with relaxed down payment requirements as low as 3%.

For buyers with limited credit or finances, a government-backed loan is usually the better option as the minimum loan requirements are easier to satisfy.

For example, FHA loans can require 3.5% down with a minimum credit score of 580 or at least 10% down with a credit score between 500 and 579. However, upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums can apply for the life of the loan.

Buyers in eligible rural areas with a moderate income or lower may also consider USDA loans. This program doesn't require a down payment, but you pay an upfront and annual guarantee fee for the life of the loan.

If you come from a qualifying military background, VA loans can be your best option. First, you don't need to make a down payment in most situations. Second, borrowers pay a one-time funding fee but don't pay an annual fee as the FHA and USDA loan programs require."
"'Wonder Woman' star Lynda Carter snubs Republican sister, endorses opponents in Arizona race",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/wonder-woman-star-lynda-carter-snubs-republican-sister-endorses-opponents-arizona-race,2024-09-23T10:03:56Z,"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier lays out the latest polling numbers and how key Senate races may determine control on 'Special Report.'

Lynda Carter, the actress famous for playing Wonder Woman in the 1970s, slighted her conservative sister last weekend by endorsing her opponents in an Arizona state representative race.

Pamela Carter, who served as a state director for the Trump campaign in 2020, is currently running for Arizona's Legislative District 4. Carter is running as a Republican, along with her fellow conservative candidate, Matt Gress.

Instead of endorsing her sister or staying quiet, Carter opted to publicly announce her support for the two Democratic opponents, Karen Gresham and Kelli Butler.

""As a native Arizonan, I am proud to endorse @KelliButlerAZ and @KarenGreshamAZ for the two LD4 seats in Arizona's State House,"" Carter wrote on X on Sept. 14. ""Kelli and Karen are both strong, experienced candidates, born and raised in Arizona.""

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: WHICH CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THIS CRUCIAL ISSUE

""They are working mothers fighting for the rights that matter most to Arizonans, especially every child's right to a quality education,"" she added.

The 73-year-old actress has a history of endorsing Democratic candidates, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Biden in 2020.

Pamela Carter's platform states that she is committed to tackling inflation, supporting law enforcement and securing the Southern border. The Republican's campaign website accused her Democratic opponents of ""champion[ing] Joe Biden's open border policies, but this is a critical issue that should not be corrupted by their partisan politics.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN

""Our open borders are allowing human trafficking, drugs (including fentanyl), gangs, drugs, and violence to pour across our border, in record-setting quantities,"" her website reads. ""This puts us all at risk, just because politicians are too busy fighting each other to fight for us.""

""I believe we should secure the border, enforce Arizona's laws, and stop the flow of drugs, crime, and violence,"" the Republican added. ""Legal immigration has long been a source of strength for America and deserves its own updating, but nothing meaningful will succeed until illegal immigration is largely ended.""

Two days after she endorsed the Democratic candidates, Carter endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

""I'm voting for @KamalaHarris because she has a proven track record of improving the lives of everyday Americans,"" the actress wrote on Sept. 16. ""A 'concept of an idea' won't protect your grandparents' retirement savings. Her policies already do.""

"Trump has a plan for economic prosperity, Harris does not",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-has-plan-economic-prosperity-harris-does-not,2024-09-23T09:12:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As the November election approaches, the economy remains the most important issue for voters. On the question of which candidate voters believe would make the best economic policy decisions, President Trump holds a 10 percentage point advantage over Vice President Kamala Harris, according to the latest Pew Research survey. No one should be surprised.

Trump offers straightforward pro-growth economic policies consistent with the plan he successfully implemented during his first term in office, as most voters fondly recall.

He would keep tax rates low, encouraging investment and consumer spending, reduce growth-hobbling business regulation, and expand America's domestic energy production, reducing the cost of literally everything.

During his first term in office, this plan reduced unemployment to historic lows for every race and both sexes, increased wages and family incomes to historic highs, drove poverty to historic lows, reduced income inequality, and all without inflation. It's a plan that works, and Americans know it.

NEW TRUMP WEBSITE REVEALS HOW MUCH MONEY A HARRIS PRESIDENCY COULD COST TAXPAYERS

In fact, CNBC surveys going back to 2008 tellingly show that, over the past 16 years, Americans have been more pessimistic than optimistic about the economy in all but two years - 2018 and 2019 - when Trump was president.

In other words, Americans were more pessimistic than optimistic about the economy in all 12 years that Presidents Obama and Biden occupied the White House, but were more optimistic in two of the four years Trump was president. No one seriously doubts that Trump's economic winning streak would have continued but for the pandemic.

Today, economic pessimism is essentially back to where it was in 2016, Obama's last year in office, and where it was near the end of 2021, the year Biden and Harris took office.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT HER PLAN TO HANDLE A RECESSION, ATTACKS TRUMP'S ECONOMIC RECORD INSTEAD

The roots of the current pessimism lie in two massive Biden/Harris spending bills - each of passed only because Harris casting the tie-breaking votes (the misnamed American Rescue Plan and the comically named Inflation Reduction Act).

These bills led to an economy plagued by surging inflation that raised the price of everything over 20% - and Harris owns them. Real wages failed to keep up, lowering the standard of living for millions of Americans. Add in housing that is far less affordable due in great part to interest rate hikes the Fed implemented to reduce inflation, and you have serious economic pessimism.

It's not a record Harris wants to run on so she is attempting to distance herself from it, promising an ""opportunity economy."" But how would Americans find economic opportunity without economic growth, something her plans would only stifle?

WERE YOU BETTER OFF UNDER TRUMP'S ECONOMY OR BIDEN'S?

Of course, Harris would increase taxes on the most successful individuals and businesses. It's a policy that's very popular, if not a mainstay, on the Left. But raising taxes unequivocally discourages private sector investment and growth, demeaning economic opportunity.

A San Francisco liberal at heart, Harris has indicated no inclination to meaningfully reduce the massive, growth-killing federal regulatory state and is unlikely to abandon her career-long opposition to domestic fossil fuel production (despite supposedly reversing her position on fracking, at least in politically significant Pennsylvania).

So, from where will the growth from her ""opportunity economy"" come?

In a desperate effort to come up with something, Harris offers a confused mixture of unserious proposals even the left-leaning never-Trump Washington Post has criticized as ""populist gimmicks.""

AMERICANS FRUSTRATED WITH 'OUTRAGEOUS' HIGH PRICES AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

For example, to combat inflation, Harris has proposed that government fix the price of goods purportedly to stop businesses from ""price gouging."" But there has been no price gouging as the Biden-Harris administration's own Department of Labor data makes clear. In reality, American businesses have merely passed on to consumers the increased costs that surging inflation has forced on them.

In any event, price fixing is just bad economic policy. As stated in a Washington Post opinion piece, ""[i]t's hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is,"" as government price fixing ""would lead to shortages, black markets and hoarding, among other distortions seen previous times countries tried to limit price growth by fiat."" That sounds pretty bad!

But of course it's a bad economic policy. It was never intended to be good economic policy. It is a purely political proposal designed to cast blame on American businesses for the surging inflation the Biden-Harris economic policies caused.

So, given her pivotal role in passing those two inflation-driving behemoth spending bills, you would think Harris might have learned her lesson on government spending and inflation. But apparently she has not.

The Washington Post's editorial board also panned another Harris ""populist gimmick"" - to give first-time home buyers $25,000 in down payment assistance. Why? Well, because it would stimulate housing demand ""which risks putting upward pressure on prices."" Of course it does.

But again, Harris' goal was not to actually make home purchases less expensive. It was to assuage voters frustrated that housing inflation and increased interest rates have made owning a home to expensive thanks to Biden-Harris economic policies.

Bottom line, Trump offers a proven pro-growth plan that will reinvigorate our economy benefiting all Americans. Harris offers growth-diminishing policies and political gimmicks. Rather than economic opportunity for American families, her policies are about political opportunity for herself.

If Americans have had enough economic misery over the last three-and-a-half years and are ready for a return to prosperity, Trump has a plan for that. Harris does not."

How to invest in gold

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Gold bars. Known as bullion, gold bars tend to be a popular choice for buying gold. Bullion is typically sold by gram or ounce. Purity, manufacturer and weight should be stamped on the face of the bar. Gold coins. The Sovereign and Britannia are popular collectables that command a premium over what you would get for the same amount of gold in the form of bullion. Gold jewellery. Like gold coins, you'll probably be paying extra for gold when you buy it in the form of jewellery - a premium that could be anywhere from 20% to 300%, depending on the manufacturer.

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

Gold shares. Buying the stocks of gold mining or processing companies is another way to invest in the yellow metal. You don't get to own physical gold, but you do get exposure to the rise and fall of the price of gold in the market. Gold funds. There are a range of funds that provide exposure to gold. They may invest in gold stocks, or they may trade gold derivatives in the options and futures markets.

Should you invest in gold?

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Is gold an inflation hedge?

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Is buying gold better than holding cash?

Inflation reduces the 'real' value of a currency over time. Or, put another way, £50 today buys you less than it did 10 years ago. However, gold can provide a way of protecting the 'real' value of your wealth against inflation.

During a period of high inflation, some investors may revert to buying gold as a real physical asset that holds its value.

Periods of high inflation often correspond with a rise in interest rates and general economic uncertainty. As a result, gold is seen to some as a safe haven and, in theory, increased demand results in a rise in price.

Over the last 20 years, annual inflation has averaged 3% in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. Over the same period, the price of gold has increased by an average of 9% per year (according to the World Gold Council). Whereas the average base rate (a proxy for the interest rate on savings) was 3% over this period, according to the Bank of England.

Adjusting for the inflation rate of 3%, the 'real' value of gold has therefore increased by an average of 6% per year. In comparison, savers would have experienced no 'real' increase in the value of cash held in savings accounts due to the impact of inflation.

That said, there is no guarantee that gold will perform the same way in the future as it has in the past.

Is it a good time to buy gold?

Gold potentially offer investors a safe haven in times of economic and geopolitical volatility. It may also provide a way of preserving wealth in a high inflation environment. As with shares, the price of gold is volatile. However it has delivered an increase in value over the last 30 years. Again, performance going forward is not guaranteed.

Investors should also consider the effect of foreign currency movements when deciding whether to buy gold. Gold is typically denominated in US dollars and, as a result, tends to have an inverse relationship with the US dollar. This means that, if the US dollar strengthens against other currencies, the price of gold can fall.

Looking over the last year, the price of gold in US dollars has decreased by 3% as the US dollar has strengthened against other currencies. However, the price of gold in sterling has increased by 10% due to the weakening of the pound against the dollar.

Overall, it is difficult to assess whether it's a good time to buy gold as its price is dependent on a number of factors. Although a continuation in the current level of economic and political uncertainty may provide a tailwind for gold prices, investors should also be aware of the volatility of this asset.

Does gold drop in value?

Gold is a limited commodity with a relatively static supply, meaning that the price of gold is highly sensitive to changes in demand. A fall in demand will therefore result in a drop in the value of gold.

By way of example, the price of gold fell by over 25% from 2011 to 2013. It also fell from over $2,000 per Troy ounce in mid-2020 to less than $1,700 in early 2021, a fall of 17%.

How is gold price determined?

The price of gold is determined by the level of supply and demand. The daily price is set by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and there are two different types of gold prices:

Fixed: LBMA members meet via conference call twice-daily to agree a price to clear their outstanding client orders. This is typically used for larger gold orders. Spot: this is a 'live' price largely used for buying and selling gold bullion.

Is it profitable to invest in digital gold?

Digital gold (or digigold) is a form of digital currency that allows you to buy fractions of physical gold stored by the seller. Buyers of digital gold will own, and have legal title to, the gold, with the seller acting as custodian.

Digital gold enables buyers to invest by value - say, £25 - rather than by weight (as with a 1 kilogram bar of bullion). Buyers can also invest a lower minimum amount than with the physical asset.

Digital gold also offers a saving in terms of storage and insurance. For example, the Royal Mint charges an annual management fee of 0.5% for its DigiGold products, compared to 1-2% for physical gold.

As buyers own the underlying physical gold, their profit (or loss) will be dependent on the price of gold, as covered in the questions above.

Which types of gold is it possible to invest in?

You can buy physical gold in the form of bullion, coins or jewellery, or invest in digital gold:

Bullion bars: these usually range in weight from one gram to over 10 kilograms. A premium is typically charged above the 'spot price' of the gold to cover manufacturing costs.The cheapest option currently sold by the Royal Mint is the one gram 999.99 fine gold Britannia bullion bar, retailing at £70 Coins: these are available in lower weights than bullion bars. The flagship gold coins in the UK are the Sovereign and Britannia. The Royal Mint is currently charging £122 for a 916.67 Fine Gold Quarter Sovereign 2022. Both coins are legal tender in the UK, and, as such, are free from capital gains tax and VAT for UK resident Jewellery: jewellery, especially antique pieces, is another option. However, you may pay a mark-up of at least 20%, and often far higher, relative to the content of the gold. This covers the labour cost of the design and manufacture and the retail margin Digital gold: this allows you to buy and hold fractions of the physical assets, with lower minimum investment amounts and savings on the storage and insurance costs.

Investors may also want to consider investing in an indirect form of gold, including:

Buying shares in companies that mine, refine and trade gold: However, while the prices of mining company shares correlate to gold prices, their share prices are also impacted by other factors Buying gold and commodity funds: specialist commodities, mining and exchange-traded funds can provide investors with exposure to gold, without the difficulties of trading and storing it in physical form.

Mortgage Rates 23 September 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-23-09-24/,2024-09-23T08:55:47Z,"Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steading interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but, for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Cooling and steady inflation has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy but we will know more in its Autumn Budget which will be held on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.56%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.39% and 4.43% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 4.09%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 4.14% and 3.77% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.68%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stand at 7.17% today, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Halifax's house price report (published 6 September) reported that average property values in August were 4.3% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.3% when compared to July. Halifax, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in August at £292,505 - up from £291,268 in July.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
64 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/64-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-09-23T04:09:54Z,"Fox News host Jesse Watters asks how Vice President Kamala Harris is different from President Biden as he accuses her of bombing her first solo interview since becoming Democrats' 2024 candidate on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' (Courtesy: ABC News)

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 64 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Under pressure to sit down for a substantive interview after weeks of stonewalling, Harris finally ended her interview drought last month in Georgia when she was joined by running mate Tim Walz for a pre-taped piece with CNN's Dana Bash that was a far cry from a traditional press conference. She's done more interviews since, including this week with the National Association of Black Journalists, and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey on Thursday at a star-studded campaign event.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August earlier this month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

Trump has sought to highlight the contrast in media availability between the two, sitting for several lengthy interviews in recent weeks, in addition to his three news conferences.

In her interview on Friday in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

""So I got my four seconds of fame on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and of all people to be her guest, let me show you who it was,"" a TikTok creator behind the account Blaire_Allison said in a video posted Saturday.

The TikTok then showed a clip of Winfrey's town hall-style interview with Harris that aired Thursday evening, featuring various people describing how the cost of living is strangling average Americans' pocketbooks, including a video from Blaire Allison posted in November 2023.

""I don't understand how people are affording life right now,"" Allison said in the featured clip.

The TikTok creator launched a rebuttal to the clip being aired by imitating Harris to underscore she does not support the Democratic vice president's run for the Oval Office.

""To my Americans: Let me make something perfectly clear, OK? I do not support Harris for president,"" she said, mocking and imitating Harris' often roundabout way of speaking. ""OK? I want to be unburdened by who has been in the White House the last three and a half years. OK?

In a follow-up TikTok, the content creator stated that Winfrey's team did not secure permission to feature her original video, noting she had ""no clue that clip would be shared while she interviewed Kamala Harris.""

""I have made it very clear that I don't support Kamala Harris, at all,"" she added.

The creator told Fox News Digital via email on Sunday that she is a ""very patriotic American and I don't believe Harris puts Americans first, nor has established a plan on how she will improve Americans livelihoods,"" and will consequently not vote for Harris come November.

""I was disappointed that such a well known talk show such as Oprah Winfrey didn't even notify me they were using my clip, which didn't allow me time to watch the footage until people in my community notified me,"" she added.

Blaire Allison's original video from November that was featured in the town hall focused on how the cost of living was affecting people on average salaries, including teachers and minimum wage workers, with the TikTok creator saying inflation and cost woes ""really p---es me off.""

""How are people affording life right now? How are people tackling this cost of living on the average American salary? I just watched a TikTok of a teacher who makes a teacher's salary. I don't know what state she's in, so I don't know how much she makes. But her one-bedroom apartment is $2,000 and when she spends $2,000 on that one-bedroom apartment, it doesn't even come with the washer and dryer, so she has to go pay an additional $2 every time she wants to use the washer and dryer,"" she said in the video that was posted to her TikTok account on Nov. 6, 2023.

Gold Keeps Hitting New Record Highs: Why It's Outperforming Stocks As Rate Cut Provides Latest Boost,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/22/gold-keeps-hitting-new-record-highs-why-its-outperforming-stocks-as-rate-cut-provides-latest-boost/,2024-09-22T16:12:05Z,"Gold prices continue to skyrocket, closing last week at another record high, as several factors help boost the precious metal which has actually outperformed the blistering stock market in 2024.

The volume of global central bank purchases of gold have tripled since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, according to Goldman Sachs, which also named concerns over climbing U.S. federal debt and the potential for increased institutional capital into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a driver of higher gold prices.

811%. That's how much gold prices have soared since the turn of the millennium, dwarfing the S&P's 517% return since Dec. 31, 1999.

The two largest years for central bank gold purchases on record were 2022 and 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal. China was the biggest buyer of the commodity during that stretch, though the People's Bank of China declined to bolster its gold reserves from May to August, ending an 18-month streak of gold purchases. Gold prices typically increase during times of uncertainty as investors look to clutch onto the metal which has been viewed as a source of value for centuries, outlasting countless currency changes and conflicts. Gold, which traded as low as $255 per troy ounce in 2001, has enjoyed three distinct rallies since 2000, including around the 2008 financial crisis, around the COVID-19 pandemic and the last two years' global inflation bout. The latest rally comes as most experts believe the odds of a U.S. recession is unlikely to occur imminently, eating into gold's historic boost from heightened downturn fears."
The U.S. Retirement System Will Fail Most Future Retirees,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2024/09/22/the-us-retirement-system-will-fail-most-future-retirees/,2024-09-22T12:27:10Z,"Careful research done by PhD economists conclude we face a huge retirement shortfall. We are about eight to nine years away from Social Security's inability to pay full benefits; all boomers are past age 60, and the typical Gen Y and Millennial is predicted to do a little worse or much worse than the cohorts of their big brothers, sisters, and parents. The erosion in retirement security is worse for the bottom 60% or so of the earnings distribution. Yes it's a crisis.

Early boomers at the top of the income distribution have benefited from run-ups in the stock market, owning houses, and having employers who helped them save in retirement accounts and funded defined benefit plans. The top 20% of earners get 44% of all the employer contributions according to Vanguard who examined 401(k) - type employer plans. The nation's private, commercial, voluntary employer - retirement plans exacerbate pay inequity and retirement income inequality.

Even Andrew Biggs, economist at the conservative think tank, American Enterprise Institute (which has been associated with partially privatizing and reducing Social Security benefits) agrees federal and state tax law steer tax breaks to the top earners.

And can we really say we don't have a retirement crisis for regular working households when new 2022 data from the Federal Reserve bank the Survey of Consumer Finance, shows the middle 70% of households by income aged 50-65 have a median retirement account savings of $86,000 and a median debt of $89,700? If you withdraw from your $86,000, say between age 65 and 70, traveling, buying a car -- you'll look comfortable. But all that money could be gone by your mid-seventies and then it's Social Security all the way to the end.

About 40% of middle-class older workers are projected to be downwardly mobile into poverty or near poverty when they reach age 62 and beyond. Disagreements rest on the definition of ""poverty."" How can a serious researcher say $13,000 a year is a standard to shoot for; I reject the U.S. definition of poverty and so do most experts and practitioners.

The U.S. poverty measures depart from internationally acceptable standards and consistently lowballs how much hardship we have. No serious researcher uses the U.S. standard as a measure of financial deprivation. Most antipoverty programs define poverty as 150% or 200% of the official rate. According to the U.S. official number, you are a poor elder if your annual income is below about $13,000. Internationally, an American elder is counted as poor when their incomes fall below 50% of median, which is about $21,000. Measured this way, my coauthors including economist Siavash Radpour, found downward mobility worsening after the pandemic.

The U.S. has the highest rate of elder poverty of any of our peer advanced-Western countries. By international standards, one out of four elder Americans over 65 live in a chronic state of want, in comparison the elder poverty rate is a low 5% in the Netherlands and about 10% in Germany, which is not atypical. This is a crisis and a shame.

Tony Webb, Michael Papadopoulos, and I found in the Illusory Benefits of Working Longer that without working, 79% of people in 2028 age 62-70 would not be able to afford their pre-retirement living standards or stay about de-facto poverty levels. And we included everything we could estimate -- defined benefit plan benefits, Social Security, home equity!

I can see how this grim assessment puzzles people if you just encountered a careful paper by Peter J. Brady of the Investment Company Institute and Stephan Bass at Internal Revenue Service. But they didn't look forward boomers aging or Gen Y and younger. They only studied the relatively-advantaged 1945 birth cohort at age 72 and included earnings from paid work. They conclude retirement looks better than many think. But they make no claims about the future. They can't. And people working aren't retired. This cohort also got the best part of traditional defined benefit pension plans, they were able to collect peak Social Security benefits before the raising the retirement age cut benefits for middle boomers and younger, and who got the most out of a steady increase in housing asset values.

And, Harvard economist Karen Dyson et. al. agree the younger cohorts will likely do worse than current retirees.

Deniers also cherry - pick surveys show most retirees feel comfortable. But comfort levels depends on the survey. We surveyed the surveys. The results depend on who you ask. Eight robust and frequently-cited surveys on retirement confidence conducted by government bodies, research groups, and industry advocates show a wide range of retirement anxiety, from a high of 71% to a low of 32%. Levels of retirement anxieties differ by age, working status, and retirement status. The majority of near retirees in the middle and lower incomes are the most nervous about their retirement futures. And they should be.

Bottom line. The startling finding that 79% of age 62 - 70 don't have enough retirement income, without working surprised me. But projections based on real wealth data from the University of Michigan convinces me it's true. New data could change my mind.

Biggs is right. This assertion needs modifying: ""Nearly half of older Americans have no retirement savings and must rely solely on Social Security in old age."" I should have written:

I agree 100 percent dependence on Social Security is rare. And the Census Bureau analyzed only 12.2 percent of seniors get at least 90 percent of their income from Social Security. I agree many people have Social Security and other forms of income at young old ages. But as you age those other sources of income fade away. Work disappears, cash piles are spent, expenses rise, you live longer and sicker than you think, and levels eroded away by inflation.

As MIT economist James Poterba and colleagues note -- in research that needs updating -- a substantial fraction of persons die with virtually no financial assets and rely almost entirely on Social Security benefits for support. True, many of these households may be deemed to have been prepared for retirement because their income in old age was not substantially lower than their low income in their late 50s or early 60s. But saying a high replacement rate of a very low income (which is what incomes are right before retirement typically) is surely a poor way to judge sufficiency.

Retirement crisis deniers promote their rosy picture about retirement by taking snapshots when people are relatively young retirees and working at older ages in professional jobs. The average income of 70-year-olds looks a lot different than the median income of 75- or 80-year-olds.

And we are going backwards. People in retirement used to be closer together in terms of income and wealth. People in retirement now and in the future are farther apart, retirement income inequality is growing along with longevity inequality. See the new book Longer Lives Are for the Rich .

Additionally, economists John Sabelhaus and Alice Henriques Volz find that the people in the top wealth levels are doing a bit better (based on the wealth they have they expect to use in old age) than people born 10 and 20 year years earlier. A rosy picture there. But a full 50% of people at the bottom of the wealth distribution are doing worse than their older sisters and brothers' cohort and parents' cohort who were at the same place in terms of their wealth at their age. This isn't about how much they will get; it is a finding that shows our retirement system has aged so that some people are going backwards, and inequality is increasing.

Retirement financial security for Baby Boomers and Generation Xers is worse than for earlier retirees. I agree with Alicia Munnell, I don't care what you call the problem - a crisis or very bad problem -- ""roughly half of households are not in good financial shape in retirement.""

The retirement crisis deniers don't show up advocating more revenue into Social Security. The retirement crisis deniers say that 12.9% or 10% poverty measured the American way shows we don't have to make large reforms. But the facts are restoring and expanding Social Security would prevent major setbacks. In ""How-Gloomy is the Retirement Outlook- respected Urban Institute researchers Karen Smith and Richard Johnson show that median age-70 income will be higher for Millennials than previous generations, but this cohort faces a higher risk of seeing falling living standards in retirement.

Higher income in retirement does not mean being better off if people face more expenses and are living longer. As Forbes contributor Howard Gleckman writes, the biggest threat to over half of earners retirement security -- those in the lower and middle class -- is to not do anything about fully funding and expanding Social Security.

In the end, one of the best portraits of the retirement crisis comes from a compilation of academic work and government statistics. Check out the Chartbook, for snapshots older workers' status and retirement wealth. Make up your own mind about whether we have a problem so big we need to fix the commercial and voluntary system and Social Security. I guess you can still think everything is fine and there is nothing to be done, but I would want to see the numbers. for me the facts show otherwise."
America's Crypto Lag: Lessons From Global Leaders In Crypto Regulation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/09/22/americas-crypto-lag-lessons-from-global-leaders-in-crypto-regulation/,2024-09-22T12:02:46Z,"As digital assets like cryptocurrencies and blockchains, the technology that records and secures its transactional information, continue to grow in importance, the United States finds itself at a regulatory crossroads. With more than $2.21 trillion in market value (according to CoinMarketCap.com as of Sept. 21, 2024) and increasing mainstream adoption, digital assets are no longer a fringe issue -- they are an integral part of the future of finance. Yet, the U.S. lags behind in creating a cohesive and comprehensive regulatory framework for this burgeoning sector.

Other nations are not waiting. Switzerland, Japan, the European Union, and emerging markets like Nigeria have taken decisive steps to regulate digital assets in ways that encourage innovation while protecting consumers. In contrast, the U.S. regulatory landscape remains fragmented, with crypto-focused voters left uncertain as the presidential election nears, trying to gauge any signs of policy shifts from Vice President Kamala Harris or the true motives and credibility of former President Donald Trump.

Senator Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a member of the committee, have joined forces to lead a vocal anti-crypto movement. Their efforts have manifested in various ways, including through the actions of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and prudential regulators such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), all of which play a key role in enforcing their regulatory crackdown on the crypto industry.

However, a growing number of Brown and Warren's democratic congressional colleagues, assert that it is time to turn the page and pivot toward crypto industry-friendly policies that balance consumer and investor protection with support of innovation in the Web3 economy. Even Representative Maxine Waters, the Ranking Member and a vocal critic of cryptocurrency, recently indicated a potential shift in her stance. In an interview on the Native Land Podcast during the Democratic National Convention, she suggested a pro-crypto approach in the next congressional session, should she regain the chairpersonship of the House Financial Services Committee.

If the U.S. continues to delay decisive action, it risks losing its competitive edge. Innovation and investment may soon flow to jurisdictions that have already established regulatory clarity, leaving the U.S. behind in the global digital asset race. As the U.S. grapples with internal debates, several countries have already forged ahead with robust and forward-thinking regulatory frameworks. By examining their strategies, the U.S. can gain valuable insights into how to navigate this rapidly evolving space.

Switzerland has become a global leader in cryptocurrency regulation due to its early efforts to establish clear guidelines. The country's Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) began developing its crypto regulatory framework in 2013. Switzerland categorizes digital assets into three groups: payment tokens (e.g., Bitcoin), utility tokens, and security tokens. This clear taxonomy has allowed businesses and investors to navigate the regulatory landscape confidently.

Switzerland's Crypto Valley in Zug has attracted numerous blockchain startups due to this regulatory clarity and favorable tax policies. However, traditional banks have been hesitant to service crypto companies due to concerns about money laundering risks, prompting some companies to relocate. Despite these challenges, Switzerland remains a hub for innovation, with the successful launch of Ethereum's initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014 serving as a key example of how regulatory clarity can foster growth in the industry.

The European Union is pursuing a unified approach to regulating digital assets through its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), proposed in 2020 and expected to be fully implemented by 2025. MiCA aims to harmonize regulation across the 27 EU member states, providing consistent rules on consumer protection and market integrity.

A key focus of MiCA is the regulation of stablecoins -- cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. MiCA requires stablecoin issuers to maintain adequate reserves and adhere to transparency standards, addressing concerns raised by the collapse of TerraUSD in 2022. While some argue that MiCA's implementation has been slow, the legal certainty it will bring could make Europe one of the most attractive markets for crypto innovation.

Japan was one of the first major economies to regulate cryptocurrencies following the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange. Japan amended its Payment Services Act (PSA) in 2017 to recognize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal forms of payment. The country operates a dual regulatory system: payment tokens are regulated under the PSA, while security tokens fall under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA).

Japan's clear distinction between different types of digital assets has enabled the country to foster a thriving cryptocurrency market while maintaining robust consumer protections. However, smaller exchanges have struggled to meet the stringent requirements imposed by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), leading to closures and consolidation in the market. Despite these challenges, Japan's focus on investor protection has helped restore trust in the crypto market after several high-profile security breaches.

Nigeria provides a unique perspective on crypto regulation. Although the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) banned financial institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, crypto is not illegal. Nigerians have turned to peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin trading, making Nigeria one of the world's largest bitcoin markets.

Cryptocurrency has gained traction in Nigeria as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Bitcoin, in particular, is widely used for remittances, lowering the fees associated with international money transfers. Despite government restrictions, crypto has become a means of financial inclusion for Nigeria's unbanked population, offering stability in an unstable economic environment.

Nigeria's experience highlights the potential of digital assets to empower individuals in developing economies. As the U.S. considers its regulatory framework for digital assets, Nigeria's example shows how crypto can enhance financial access for underserved communities.

The next U.S. Congress has a unique opportunity to learn from these global regulatory approaches and craft a bipartisan framework that provides clarity, promotes innovation, and protects consumers.

If the U.S. fails to act quickly and in bipartisan fashion in Congress's next session, it risks losing its competitive edge to countries that have already established clear, crypto-specific regulations. Innovation and investment could flow to jurisdictions like Switzerland, the EU, Japan, and even emerging markets like Nigeria, India, and Indonesia, leaving the U.S. behind in the global race for digital asset leadership.

For example, according to the 2024 Chainalysis Global Adoption Index released on September 11, 2024, India and Nigeria have already secured the top two positions globally in grassroots crypto adoption, with Indonesia emerging as the fastest-growing market. Indonesia's near 200% year-over-year growth and a $157.1 billion crypto market value demonstrate the shifting tide. These emerging markets, particularly in regions like Central and Southern Asia, are embracing alternative investments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEX) while bypassing traditional regulatory barriers. Their rapid adoption signals a global shift, as these countries seize the opportunity to capitalize on crypto's potential.

The U.S. remains in fourth place on the Chainalysis Index, but continued partisan deadlock could lead to further decline. Emerging markets, often seen as financially underserved, are increasingly adopting cryptocurrency as a tool for financial inclusion and economic innovation. Countries like India, Nigeria, and Indonesia are showing significant growth, reflecting a global shift in digital asset adoption.

For the U.S. to remain competitive, a proactive, bipartisan approach is essential. By fostering innovation and protecting consumers through clear regulation, the U.S. can ensure it continues to play a leading role in the evolving digital economy. With global advancements progressing rapidly, the need for timely action is clear."
Paper Tigers And Presidential Politics: A Fresh Look At Fear-Based Investing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timmaurer/2024/09/22/paper-tigers-and-presidential-politics-a-fresh-look-at-fear-based-investing/,2024-09-22T11:06:03Z,"While Christians and Christianity have taken many often-justifiable hits over the past couple thousand years, the actual person of Christ has remained compelling, even irresistible, for most, including me. Having followed His story for many years, I confess I was surprised, then, to only recently learn the directive that Jesus gave most often in the accounts recorded in the Bible. Do you know what it is?

""Do not fear,"" or some derivative is recorded between 20 and 25 times in the Gospels (depending on translations), putting it ahead of other common refrains of Jesus, like ""Love one another"" and ""follow me."" Fascinating, right?

Indeed, of all the emotions that can steer us toward suboptimal decisions, fear may be the most powerful because of its physiological implications, in addition to its psychological. And it feels like we're in a season of fear, especially now.

It is fear that seems to be the predominant state of our national discourse at present, fear that is used by politicians to drive us to act on their behalf, and it is certainly fear that represents at least 50% of the motivational force of the world's investors at any point in time.

Presently, there is plentiful fodder for investors to fear. Even beyond the many global macroeconomic factors and instability around the world, there's much to fear right now in the U.S. alone -- like sustained inflation, the interest rates that the Fed has pushed higher (until recently) to tamp down said inflation, and yes, a doozy of a political cycle that requires little hyperbole these days to inspire fear. That begs the question:

How should I adapt my personal investment philosophy or portfolio based on international events or politics?

First, the evidence would suggest that we shouldn't make major changes to our portfolios simply based on the occurrence or likelihood of international events or major disruptions in domestic politics. For example, if we focus solely on the fear du jour today, following two of the craziest and most impactful debates that the U.S. has ever seen in presidential politics, let's see what impact the president -- or president's party -- has had on the markets historically:

The difference is visually indiscernible over that long time span. Yet many on both sides of the political spectrum still insist that the markets would, could, or should do better when their party's president has power, so what do the numbers suggest would be the outcomes if we only invested during the stretches when our preferred president is in power?

Over the past 10 years -- a notably contentious stretch of presidential politics, to put it lightly -- you'd have roughly halved your investment return by sticking to just one party. And over the past 70 years, your investment record would look like an abysmal failure if you only stuck to one party -- and a massive success if you invested through both:

Whether it is presidential politics, the rise and fall of international economic powers, the next pandemic, or even the scariest conflicts around the world, these investing fears all fit into the same category dubbed by Amelia Earhart, someone I think we'd all acknowledge knew a thing or two about fear. They're all ""paper tigers,"" a phrase she borrowed with ancient Chinese cultural roots.

Erhart said, ""The most difficult thing is the decision to act. The rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers.""

So, what are your paper tigers?

And, does that mean there is nothing in the world that could happen that could warrant a change to your portfolio or investment philosophy?

Nope.

There are instances in which it may be appropriate to make a shift not based on external events -- but based on your internal response to such events. Because fear has physiological triggers, there are certain things we can't (or won't) necessarily be talked out of fearing. (Giant, hairy spiders, anyone?) Self awareness is the key in this case.

Therefore, if the current or future state of affairs fills you with such angst that you are likely to lose sleep over short-term market volatility -- or to make a spontaneous, wholesale decision, like moving to 100% cash -- it may be wise to reassess your personal goals and adjust your portfolio accordingly, but hopefully moderately.

Of course, you can only calibrate your plan if you have a deliberate and purposeful investment plan in place. Too many investors have a mere collection of securities without purposeful cohesion. If you're looking for help on that front, consider investing in the language of life."
How Modern Leaders Can Navigate Complexity With Confidence,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2024/09/22/how-modern-leaders-can-navigate-complexity-with-confidence/,2024-09-22T10:08:49Z,"In Deloitte's 2024 CEO survey, company leaders pointed to a range of disruptors shaking up their organizations -- from geopolitical instability and inflation to supply chain disruptions and skills shortages. As a leader, your challenge is to steer your organization through this sea of complexities, which includes everything from technological upheavals to shifting market dynamics and the increasing emphasis on ethical practices.

In this environment, effective leadership is not about sticking to the old playbook; it's about adopting an approach that evolves with new challenges and seizes opportunities for growth. To truly thrive, you need to move beyond traditional tactics and embrace a strategy that integrates people, technology, and continuous learning into the core of your mission. These are the key ingredients for a holistic approach to leadership.

Leadership today isn't a one-size-fits-all endeavor. The business landscape is in constant flux, with new challenges cropping up from global economic trends, technological advancements, and shifting consumer behaviors. To lead effectively, agility is essential for anticipating these shifts and adjusting your strategy on the fly. The ability to pivot -- whether in response to a market disruption or a new opportunity -- is non-negotiable.

""Modern decision-making should be agile, collaborative, and deeply embedded in the organization's culture,"" says Zander Ross, senior advisor of change and transformation at BTS Group. This means creating an environment where teams are empowered to act on strategic insights in real-time, aligning their actions today with long-term goals.

Whether it's the volatility of the global economy or the breakneck speed of technological change, staying ahead of the curve is essential. By fostering a culture of adaptability, you empower your team to navigate uncertainty with confidence -- setting the stage for your organization's future success.

Amidst the complexity, it's easy to get lost in strategy and forget the human element. But placing your employees at the heart of your leadership approach is vital for long-term success. People-centric leadership (also called authentic leadership) isn't just about managing tasks; it's about creating an environment where your team feels valued, heard, and empowered to bring their best selves to work.

When you prioritize your team's well-being and development, you build loyalty and resilience within your organization. Supported employees are more likely to go the extra mile, drive innovation, and help your organization adapt to changes. When you put people first, you lay a foundation of trust and mutual respect, leading to stronger collaboration and better outcomes. Research shows that companies prioritizing people in their workforce decisions are 2.5 times more likely to have employees who feel connected to their teams, and those employees are five times more likely to believe the company can build future skills and adapt.

Remember, your organization's greatest asset is its people. Nurture them, and they'll support your mission.

In the digital age, staying competitive isn't just about keeping up with the latest trends; it's about actively embracing technology and innovation. As a leader, your role is to ensure your organization not only leverages existing technologies but also explores new avenues for growth and efficiency. This might involve adopting AI-driven tools for better decision-making, investing in data analytics to understand customer needs, or fostering a culture of innovation that encourages your team to engage in creative problem-solving.

Technology should serve a purpose beyond just being the latest shiny object. It's essential to align technological advancements with your broader business strategy and implement them in ways that genuinely enhance operations and customer experience. ""In a world increasingly driven by data and digital platforms, the real differentiator isn't just technical proficiency; it's the ability to shift from a world of information to one of business insight, from a rules-based to a judgment-based approach to leadership,"" says Ross. The goal is to amplify human potential, not diminish it -- ensuring that your organization remains agile, innovative, and deeply connected. By staying attuned to technological trends and keeping people at the forefront, you position your organization to lead, not follow, in a competitive market.

Ethical leadership is no longer optional -- it's a necessity. Demonstrating integrity and ethical behavior is fundamental to building trust with your employees, customers, and stakeholders. In fact, 60% of consumers surveyed by Statista said trustworthiness and transparency were the most important traits of a brand. As a leader, your actions set the tone for your entire organization. By upholding high ethical standards, you not only safeguard your reputation but also foster a culture of accountability and respect.

Ethical leadership is about making decisions that are not just legally compliant but also morally sound. This might mean choosing the right path even when it's not the easiest or most profitable option. By doing so, you build a foundation of trust that strengthens your relationships with employees and customers alike. Ultimately, ethical leadership is about doing what's right -- and in today's complex world, that's more important than ever.

As Ross explains, ""Leaders who authentically address societal challenges -- seeing them as opportunities for innovation rather than mere obligations -- are the ones who create lasting impact.""

The most effective leaders are those who are committed to personal growth and never stop learning. In a world that's constantly changing, staying relevant requires a commitment to continuous development. This doesn't just mean keeping up with industry trends or acquiring new technical skills; it's about expanding your perspective, challenging your assumptions, and seeking out new experiences that enhance your leadership capabilities.

Lifelong learning allows you to stay responsive to change. By embracing a mindset of curiosity and growth, you set an example for your team and create a culture that values learning and development. Whether through formal education, mentorship, or simply staying curious about the world around you, continuous learning is key to maintaining your effectiveness as a leader.

Navigating today's complex business landscape requires a holistic, multifaceted approach to leadership. By embracing these principles, you can lead with confidence, driving growth and creating a lasting impact. Focus on building a resilient organization that's not just ready for today's challenges, but also poised for tomorrow's opportunities."
"Trump gaining in surprise new stronghold as crime, migrants shift blue voters right",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-gaining-surprise-new-stronghold-crime-migrants-shift-blue-voters-right,2024-09-22T08:16:41Z,"UNIONDALE, N.Y. - The shift of two major New York City suburbs to the political right could be a boon for former President Trump on Election Day, according to insiders on both sides of the aisle.

Traditionally purple, if not leaning blue, Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties went solidly red in the 2022 midterms even though state voter rolls show Democrats outnumber Republicans in both places.

And that may be a bellwether of where things are headed in similar communities around the country.

Former President Trump narrowly won Suffolk County in 2020, beating Joe Biden by fewer than 250 votes. But then, in the 2022 midterms, both Suffolk and the neighboring Nassau County, which borders the Big Apple, saw red waves in local and congressional elections.

ELECTION BOARD IN CRUCIAL SWING STATE ISSUES CONTROVERSIAL RULING REQUIRING HAND COUNTING OF BALLOTS

""I think the real catalyst was the crazy way that the Democrats were managing both Washington and Albany,"" Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican, told Fox News Digital. ""Now, when you talk about cashless bail, when you look at our insecure borders . . . we're spending billions of dollars on people who have been here for 15 minutes rather than hospitals, infrastructure, schools. People are fed up.""

Trump's message resonates more with suburban voters, he said.

""I think the Democrats are the ones that are helping us the most, and I think moderate Democrats and independent voters want to vote Republican now because they're fed up with the policies of Biden-Harris,"" he said.

OWNER OF NYC CRYPTO-THEMED BAR TALKS TRUMP'S VISIT

TRUMP HAS HIGHER APPROVAL RATING IN DEEP BLUE STATE THAN ITS GOVERNOR

Laura Curran, a pro-police Democrat who opposed the state's controversial bail reform law, said despite her positions, rhetoric from far-left lawmakers on Capitol Hill hurt her campaign when she lost her re-election bid to Blakeman three years ago.

""Talking about who is the standard-bearer of your party is really, really important,"" she said. ""That's why its good Biden is gone, and Kamala Harris is in.""

Still, she said, the state's unpopular governor, Kathy Hochul, is another weak spot after a new Siena College poll found that her favorability among New York voters has fallen below Trump's.

FORMER AIDE TO NEW YORK GOV. HOCHUL, WHO IS ACCUSED OF BEING CHINESE SPY, WENT ON A TOUR OF THE WHITE HOUSE

At Trump's rally Wednesday, the former president said former U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, who is from Suffolk County and tried to unseat Hochul in the last gubernatorial race, could have a role in his next administration if he wins re-election. The capacity crowd erupted in cheers.

Hochul squeaked by with a win over Zeldin by less than 5% in a state where registered Democratic voters outnumber registered Republicans by more than two to one.

Crime in general and especially migrant crime are at the forefront of voters' minds, as are taxes and the economy, polls show.

WATCH: Pollster says Trump's running 'way ahead' of where he has in past two election cycles

In Suffolk, the former president's Justice Department played a major role in combating a plague of MS-13 violence, something the police union there hasn't forgotten.

""That was a gang that had a death grip on Long Island,"" said Lou Civello, the Suffolk Police Benevolent Association (PBA) president. ""They were targeting young individuals to either join the gang or die. That's what we were dealing with.""

And the gang carried out numerous brutal murders with machetes as their weapon of choice. In one case, gang members killed a mother and then slaughtered her young child to prevent him from growing up and seeking revenge, Civello said. Then, one of the killers took one of the murdered child's toys and brought it home for his girlfriend's son to play with.

""It was a problem that needed more than just local policing,"" Civello said. ""We needed a federal partner, and President Trump made it a priority.""

The Suffolk PBA became the first police organization in New York to endorse Trump's re-election bid earlier this year.

BIDEN ADMIN'S USE OF BORDER PAROLE REVEALS EYE-POPPING NUMBER OF MIGRANT ARRIVALS IN US

After Trump left office, the Biden-Harris administration gave itself a black eye by reversing Trump's remain in Mexico policy, opening a floodgate that some Republican leaders passed on to sanctuary states and cities, bussing and flying migrants from the border to places like New York, Martha's Vineyard and Chicago.

That led to what New York City police called ""a wave of migrant crime"" earlier this year as the newly imported Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua quickly grabbed headlines for spearheading a spike in robberies.

CRIMEFIGHTING ICON JOHN WALSH RIPS 'INCREDIBLE TRAVESTY' OF SEX TRAFFICKING AT US-MEXICO BORDER

""Every town is a border town now,"" Civello told Fox News Digital.

Trump's message at the rally Wednesday clearly resonated with voters. He pledged to crack down on migrant crime and slammed progressive cashless bail policies, moves he said would make New Yorkers ""love"" their home state again.

Levittown, Hicksville and Uniondale are some of the country's original suburbs, he noted.

ILLEGALS CHARGED WITH MURDER, RAPE AND KIDNAPPING IN WEEK OF SHOCKING CRIMES ACROSS THE US

""These were great, great towns where you grew up, and you loved, and you stayed,"" he said, to cheers.

Still, while he vowed to be the first Republican presidential candidate to win New York in decades, he faces an uphill battle.

Recent Siena College polling shows New York's suburban counties slightly favor Trump over Harris, 50% to 48%, and Trump is ahead in the Upstate region 50% to 45%. But Harris is ahead in New York City 72% to 25%.

A new Fox News Poll shows Trump's suburban advantage in the Empire State is greater than the national average, which favors Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz 51% to 47% for Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

If Trump's gains on Long Island are a bellwether for similar communities in the key swing states, it could be huge for his re-election bid.

""I think Long Island is a very good barometer for suburbia in America,"" said Melissa DeRosa, a top adviser to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

""Suburbs, in general, traditionally are purple,"" she explained. ""They can swing in either direction, and I think women in the suburbs in particular have a lot of voting power in the electorate. When I look at Long Island, and you see this encroachment in the last couple of years, where it's gone completely red, even under a good scenario for us in terms of the lines being drawn, I think it's a real wake-up call.""

Trump continues to deliver messages in different communities specifically tailored to their needs, she said, pitching ""no tax on tips"" in Nevada and tariffs on foreign cars to the United Auto Workers union.

""People respond to leadership,"" she said. ""They respond to a lack of leadership. And I think that the problem is that, in 2020, it was enough to not be Trump. In 2024, it's not enough to not be Trump when, resoundingly, poll after poll after poll, people feel worse off economically . . . when the direction of the country is as negative as it is, when inflation is where it is, when geopolitically, things are such a mess.""

Still, she said, she doesn't expect Trump to win the deep blue state.

But in the key swing state Pennsylvania, suburbs outside Philadelphia are also showing signs voters are headed to the right, according to David Gelman, a Trump campaign legal surrogate whose family owns restaurants there.

""I can tell you, you are seeing Trump flags all over, and it's not even close,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""They're putting a ton of effort into Pennsylvania, because if you win Pennsylvania, there's a good possibility that you're winning the presidency."""
"Working class will come home to Harris, rallygoers in postindustrial Pennsylvania say",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/working-class-come-home-harris-rallygoers-postindustrial-pennsylvania-say,2024-09-22T08:08:59Z,"Fox News Digital spoke to rallygoers in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., about what they expect from Vice President Harris and how she did in the debate.

Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris rallied in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, a key electorate given its decades of Democratic prominence until the Trump era.

Former President Trump upended the political map in 2016 when he won blue-collar, union-heavy counties like Luzerne and neighboring Schuylkill, Columbia and Northumberland as a Republican nominee.

However, many of those who attended Harris' Wilkes-Barre rally predicted that trend was coming to an end.

Jill Purdy, whose nearby home of Northampton County flipped red in 2016 but went for President Biden in 2020, said Harris' strength is explaining her plans for fixing the economy and meeting with foreign leaders.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS'

""I think that what resonated with me is Trump saying at the very end [of the debate], 'I have a concept of a plan.' So, you know, what is a concept of a plan? None of us can get by with a concept, and you have to have something in your back pocket,"" Purdy, a teacher, said.

""So, I really appreciate how she ... I would hope she would have done a little bit more and, hopefully, we hear more before the election. But I think she set [her plan] in motion.""

In Northampton County, Bethlehem Steel's stacks and coke works once puffed smoke at all hours, signaling solid employment and well-paying union jobs for the Lehigh Valley.

Now, its steel stacks instead serve as a backdrop for a casino and other smaller venues on the rest of its former property, a silent reminder of the area's industrial past.

Similarly, in nearby Macungie, Mack Trucks -- now owned by Volvo -- still produces some of its Bulldog-emblazoned vehicles in Macungie, though its former ""world headquarters"" nearby sat vacant after its buyout.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS SOUND OFF ON HER BORDER BLUEPRINT

Even in 1981, singer Billy Joel's ""Allentown"" described the decline in the area's industrial might, and the issue has persisted today.

Since 2016, groups like Auto Workers for Trump have formed, citing concern with the Biden administration's green policies and the offshoring of jobs. And Teamsters President Sean O'Brien became the first such union boss to speak at the Republican National Convention.

But, for voters like Purdy, Harris remains the best hope for her area, she said.

""I do see a lot of Trump supporters in my neighborhood,"" she said. ""Though. I'm a teacher. So, I'm familiar with unions. And I do think they are for the 'common workers,' so to speak. Those doing the grunt work are still going to favor Harris for the reality of what she can say.""

By contrast, she claimed Trump's reassurances are ""just words.""

""I think most of the people that are [part] of unions are starting to really hear that.""

When asked about Trump's overtures to energy workers or autoworkers like those at Mack, invoking green restrictions and the like, Purdy said she would defer on that particular aspect.

""I don't know enough to know whether I hear anything that this is ... personally, I still think Kamala probably has a more logical route [on the topic],"" she said.

""[Harris] did switch a little on the fracking and that type of thing. I'm OK with people changing their mind for a logical reason. I do worry about the environment, but I can't speak to what others are really thinking about.""

Purdy said that, as a teachers union member, she does fear Trump would abolish the federal Department of Education.

The cabinet office was established by former President Carter, and part of the 1980 Republican platform was to do away with the fledgling agency.

Meanwhile, rallygoers Christian and Annette traveled to Wilkes-Barre from neighboring Hanover Township. They took issue with Trump's tack on the affordability crisis.

Fox News Digital asked about the disparity between gas prices at the end of his term and today and the similar dynamic in the housing market.

""I don't believe anything Trump says,"" Annette replied. ""He lies.""

""The reason [gas] was a dollar in the first place was because nobody was on the road -- because there was COVID,"" Christian added, recalling empty Pennsylvania roads in 2020.

Annette said Harris ""really wants to help us.""

""I believe Harris is really for the middle class,"" she said. ""Trump always likes to brag about how much money he has.""

Behind the venue on Franklin Street, Joe Granteed sat in a chair along the major northbound thoroughfare with a sign he said was meant to warn rallygoers and students at Wilkes University against buying what Harris is selling.

Granteed, of neighboring Plains, said it took him some time to think out what he wanted to write on his large poster facing traffic.

""I think she's desperate,"" he said of Harris. ""She needs to get a piece of Pennsylvania, but Trump owns Pennsylvania.""

""Don't be fooled by all her lies. She preys on your youth and inexperience. They promised unity and prosperity and we got chaos and struggles and division,"" Granteed's sign said.

Granteed also suggested Trump got a raw deal from ABC News moderators at the ""3-on-1"" debate, as he put it.

Meanwhile, on Main Street, Chris M. traveled all the way from Manchester, N.H., to see Harris speak.

Chris said Trump had been a political force until Harris came along.

""He mowed down like 16 competitors in 2016,"" Chris said. ""No one figured out how to handle him until she came along.""

While he ""loathes Trump,"" Chris did admit that, amid persistent inflation, it was the Republican nominee who likely originated the ""no tax on tips"" plan both candidates put out around the same time last month.

""I did hear that latest thing about what he said [Friday] about taxes. I think it's a good idea,"" he added.

""[But] Harris hasn't been afraid to address that, even though it's a weakness under Biden-Harris. So, I don't know,"" he said, adding inflation does not feel as bad as it did under former President George W. Bush in 2008.

In line to get into the McHale Center, Kerry Jones from nearby Dallas said Harris ""really puts forth the agenda of the middle class and bringing up the economy for the working people.""

""As opposed to the rich people and the corporate greed and the takeover of our country by interests that are not ours.""

Jones said Harris' housing plan is ""great,"" and that it would help her daughters finally move out of her house.

""She nails home that she's for the working people, and she wants to take our money and put it back into us,"" she said.

When asked about energy prices and the overall affordability crisis, Jones said the president has ""very little"" to do with gas prices because they are subsidized by the feds and assisted by ""Republican tax cuts."""
"FTC sues insulin middlemen, saying they pocket billions while patients face high costs",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/21/nx-s1-5121886/insulin-ftc-lawsuit-pharmacy-benefit-manager,2024-09-21T20:10:20Z,"This picture shows a unit dedicated to the production of insulin pens at the factory of the U.S. pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in Fegersheim, France, on Oct. 12, 2015. Frederick Florin/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Millions of people with diabetes need insulin to survive. For years, many of them have been forced to pay exorbitant prices for a product that's inexpensive to make. Now, the federal government is targeting one part of the system behind high insulin prices.

While out-of-pocket costs have gone down for many people to $35 a month, questions remain on how the drug became so expensive in the first place. In a new lawsuit filed Friday, the Federal Trade Commission said it's going after one link in the chain: pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).

The FTC brought action against the top PBMs -- CVS Health's Caremark Rx, Cigna's Express Scripts, and United Health Group's OptumRx -- saying the companies created a ""perverse drug rebate system"" that artificially inflates the cost of insulin. If the suit is successful, it could further drive down costs for patients at the pharmacy counter.

PBMs are essentially the middlemen between drug manufacturers and insurance providers. Their job is to reduce drug prices. But the process is complex and opaque, and critics say they're actually driving prices up for patients.

The FTC said a big issue is that PBMs' revenue is tied to rebates and fees -- which are based on a percentage of a drug's list price. Essentially, in the case of insulin, when the drug costed more, it generated higher rebates and fees for PBMs.

""Even when lower list price insulins became available that could have been more affordable for vulnerable patients, the PBMs systemically excluded them in favor of high list price, highly rebated insulin products,"" the FTC said in a press release on Friday.

The three PBMs named in the FTC lawsuit make up about 80% of the market. According to the suit, the PBMs collected billions of dollars in rebates and fees while insulin became increasingly unaffordable.

Over the last two decades, the cost of the lifesaving drug shot up 600% -- forcing many Americans with diabetes to ration their medication and jeopardize their health. In 2019, one 1 of 4 insulin patients was unable to afford their medication, according to the FTC. Some people have died.

The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents PBMs, denied many of the allegations in FTC's suit, including that PBM rebates correlate with higher list prices. ""This action not only fails to accurately consider the role of the entire prescription drug supply chain, but disregards positive progress, supported by PBMs, in making insulin more affordable for patients,"" the PCMA said in a statement.

Over the years, about 20 states have passed laws or programs to limit the amount that patients pay for insulin. But some of the biggest changes happened in the last two years.

In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the out-of-pocket insulin costs for Medicare patients. Last year, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi -- the three companies that control some 90% of the U.S. insulin supply -- also pledged to slash some of their prices.

On Friday, Rahul Rao, the FTC's Bureau of Competition deputy director, said the investigation into PBMs shed light on the ""concerning and active role"" that the three manufacturers have played in causing insulin to be unaffordable for many people with diabetes. Rao said the three companies further inflated their list price of their insulin products ""in response to the PBMs' demand for higher rebates."""
The Trump campaign doesn't want to talk about Mark Robinson's porn site controversy,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mark-robinson-trump-vance-porn-site-rcna172090,2024-09-21T16:53:26Z,"It may be difficult for Trump to repudiate Robinson for reportedly calling for the return of slavery on a porn site, given that he has referred to Robinson as ""better than Martin Luther King [Jr.].""

As the fallout continues over a CNN report about North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson's past inflammatory comments on a porn website, his most prominent GOP champion, Donald Trump, has remained conspicuously silent on the matter.

CNN's bombshell reporting on Thursday has shaken Robinson's fellow Republicans and further threatens to sink his flagging bid for governor. But it seems the Trump campaign may be employing a ""wait and see"" approach to the scandal. In the wake of the report, the campaign issued a statement about the importance of winning the state in November, but it did not touch on the salacious details or mention Robinson.

According to CNN, Robinson left comments on a porn website's message board between 2008 and 2012 in which he referred to himself as a ""black NAZI,"" called for the return of slavery and recalled ""peeping"" on women in gym showers as a teenager, among other details. Robinson himself has said that the posts are not his and suggested that they were fake. He has vowed not to drop out of the race.

Although The Associated Press reported that Robinson will no longer appear with Trump at his rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Saturday, the campaign has not disavowed Robinson. Brian Hughes, a senior Trump campaign adviser, denied reports that the campaign has been pressuring Robinson to leave the race, and Trump's campaign press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told NBC News that Trump is not considering pulling his endorsement of the beleaguered gubernatorial candidate.

Trump's running mate has also refused to address the controversy. On Friday, in response to a video showing Sen. JD Vance walking past a reporter who asks about Robinson, Vance wrote on X: ""My comment on Mark Robinson is that Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote on the Inflation Explosion Act and because of that a lot of Americans can't afford groceries.""

It may be difficult for Trump to repudiate Robinson now, given the praise he has lavished on the gubernatorial candidate in the past. Despite Robinson's history of anti-trans, anti-gay, anti-abortion and antisemitic rhetoric, Trump has spoken highly of Robinson, endorsing him as ""better than Martin Luther King [Jr.]"" and calling him an ""outstanding person."""
10 Great Movies Leaving Netflix At The End Of September,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2024/09/21/10-great-movies-leaving-netflix-at-the-end-of-september/,2024-09-21T16:05:13Z,"I'm always blown away by the quality of movies leaving Netflix each month. You have your usual suspects, the sorts of movies that are shifted between streaming platforms on a regular basis. But there are always a few standout gems that mustn't go unnoticed, and that's certainly the case in September 2024. By the end of the month, the world's most popular streaming platform will say goodbye to some great films, including a tense new thriller starring Lily Collins about rich families with dark secrets, a sci-fi romance that constantly reveals new secrets for its unpredictably story, and a war movie based on a true story about a pacifist who refuses to use weapons -- oh, and a wedding movie I consider to be one of the most joyous experiences ever put on film. Yeah, this month has it all.

But you have only have a week-and-a-half left to watch those movies. So which ones can't you miss? Let's review. I've picked out ten great options that appeal to a wide spectrum of movie tastes. And at the end of the article, you will find a full list of every single movie leaving Netflix by the end of September 2024. So whether you like romances or documentaries or thrillers or comedies, this list has something that will appeal to you.

Despite the movie's low rating on Rotten Tomatoes -- in fact, in spite of the movie's low rating -- I'm going to lead this list off with Inheritance. It's not the best movie ever, but I found it to be a very engaging, very taut thriller that slowly unravels its psychological tension, that owns a claustrophobic atmosphere reminiscent of great thrillers from the 1990s. This Vaughn Stein film follows Lauren (Lily Collins), a district attorney, who inherits a cryptic message revealing a dark family secret after her wealthy father dies. This revelation leads Lauren to discover a man named Morgan (Simon Pegg) who has been kept prisoner in a bunker for decades. With this bunker symbolizing the burden of hidden truths and what we hide about our family to protect its legacy, Lauren grapples with how to handle the mysterious man and what to do with the explosive information that could ruin her father's reputation. As Lauren faces this tension, the movie becomes a meditation on the burdens of wealth and power, as well as the moral compromises that accompany privilege inherited by people from wealthy families. Collins and Pegg turns out their usual great performances in this entertaining little mystery movie.

Every time Baby Boy comes to or leaves Netflix, I just can't help myself: I have to recommend it. I have to shout to the high heavens that anybody has hasn't seen this movie must watch it immediately. John Singleton was always one of Hollywood's most underrated directors, and this powerful introspection on the difficulties and pressures of Black masculinity is his best work. The film follows a young man named Jody (Tyrese Gibson in a truly Oscar-worthy performance) who lives in South Central Los Angeles who struggles with responsibility as he learns to mature and become a more dependable partner and father. Caught between his relationships with his girlfriend and mother of his child, Yvette (Taraji P. Henson), and his volatile dealings with his mother's new boyfriend (the mother is Adrienne-Joi Johnson, and the boyfriend is Ving Rhames), Jody must confront the realities of adulthood as he struggles to move past what's expected of him as a Black man. He is emotionally immature and still dependent on his mother, yet pressured by societal and familial expectations to be a ""man"" in the traditional sense -- strong, independent, dominant. This cognitive dissonance is the crux of his journey as he aims to define himself amidst such sociological pressures. You'll also find Snoop Dogg, Omar Gooding and Mo'Nique in this fantastic film.

Ever wonder which New Zealand film owns the highest grossing opening weekend of all time? Believe it or not, it's not any of the Lord of the Ring or Hobbit films, which technically fail to meet the definition of a ""New Zealand film"" according to the New Zealand Film Commission. The real winner happens to be Taika Waititi's breakout film, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which grossed NZ$1,263,000 in its first three days and NZ$12 million in total. This movie, which happens to be one of the most critically revered movies available on Netflix, centers on a rebellious foster child named Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison), who is sent to live on a remote New Zealand farm with a couple, Hec (Sam Neill) and Bella (Rima Te Wiata). After tragedy strikes, Ricky and Hec are forced to go on the run in the wilderness to avoid child services. As a manhunt unfolds, these two lonely, broken individuals create a new definition of family, one based on mutual care and shared experiences rather than blood ties. This winning film combines comedy and adventure in a style that has become Waititi's signature aesthetic, forming a safe environment for these characters to overcome their emotional scars.

From New Zealand to Australia, Muriel's Wedding held the distinct honor back in 1994 of owning the highest grossing opening weekend of any Paul Hogan-less Australian in history, scoring more than AU$2 million in its first three days. It would go on to accrue AU$15.8 million (the equivalent of AU$34.7 million in 2023 after inflation) and earn Toni Collette a much-deserved nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture at the 1995 Golden Globe Awards. This incredibly joyous film follows Muriel Heslop (Collette), an awkward, unhappy young woman who longs to escape her small Australian town and get away from her critical family. She believes marrying ""the man of her dreams"" will be the key to her finding happiness, so she steals money to go on a vacation and reinvent herself. While out, she meets a new friend, Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths), and together they move to Sydney and embrace a new life. While rediscovering herself, Muriel's fixation on weddings leads her down a complicated path about the importance of self-acceptance, about rejecting superficial social norms, about the empowerment that comes from finding one's identity outside of external validation.

In the beginning, the plot of The Adjustment Bureau might not seem super exciting. Our initiation into the story is simple enough: David Norris (Matt Damon), a rising politician, falls in love with a mysterious dancer named Elise (Emily Blunt). He gets her number and is feeling the high of love at first sight -- but that's right when everything goes haywire. In what soon becomes a blend of science fiction and romance, this loose adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short story then follows David as his life takes an unexpected path. Keeping in line with Dick's trademark exploration of the tension between individual agency and a reality shaped by hidden forces, David finds that he is being watched by a secretive organization called the Adjustment Bureau, which controls the fates of individuals to maintain a preordained future. David learns that his relationship with Elise is not part of the Bureau's plan, and that their agents will stop at nothing to keep them apart. Thus, David seeks to regain control of his life, presenting a thrilling exploration of the philosophical tension that exists between free will and predestination. Expect stylized, noir-esque visuals, great chase sequences and a compelling romance -- oh, and appearances from Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, Michael Kelly and Terence Stamp.

Woody Harrelson, Laura Dern, Jason Momoa, Rosario Dawson and Donald Glover. If you saw this cast, you wouldn't waste any time watching the movie, right? Well, what if I told you that cast was not part of a fictional plot, but a documentary -- a documentary that was so important that all these people felt compelled to be part of its important message? That was the case back in 2020 with Kiss the Ground, a documentary that examines how regenerative agriculture -- a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food that focuses on topsoil regeneration and increased biodiversity -- can help combat climate change by restoring the health of Earth's soil. Featuring interviews with environmental experts, scientists and activists, as well as some stunning cinematography that highlights the beauty and diversity of our planet's verdant farmlands and lush forests, this fascinating documentary presents an urgent message in a clear, accessible manner that both informs intellectually and moves emotionally. The film offers solutions to the dire state of climate change, with regenerative agriculture presented not as a distant or theoretical solution but as a practical, proven method that can be implemented on a global scale.

""Sankofa,"" a word in the Twi language of Ghana which means ""go back, look for, and gain wisdom, power and hope,"" is also the name of a critically heralded drama helmed by director Haile Gerima, whom Martin Scorsese described as a ""truly independent filmmaker."" This important independent feature about the legacy of slavery and the African disapora, which has been listed as one of the ""500 Utterly Essential Movies to Cultivate Great Taste in Cinema"" by film professors at Harvard University, tells the story of Mona (Oyafunmike Ogunlano), a modern Black model who is transported back in time to experience life as a slave in the West Indies. Through her journey, she witnesses the inhumanity and brutality of slavery and while gaining a deeper understanding of her identity and heritage. Gerima's bold, symbol-laden aesthetic is enlivened by magical realism that blends the past and present in a way that reflects the film's themes of memory and identity, as well as dream-like sequences set on the shores of Ghana, where the spirit of the enslaved haunts the landscape. The tone of Sankofa is both meditative and intense, and the film serves as an important document that emphasizes the importance of memory, identity and resistance in the face of historical trauma.

Anytime an A24 movie hits theaters or streaming services, it seems to be all anybody can talk about. The year 2022 alone featured X, Men, Bodies Bodies Bodies, Pearl and Aftersun -- oh, and let us not forget the Best Picture winner Everything Everywhere All at Once. But there's one A24 film that went way under the radar that year, even with well-known actor Jesse Eisenberg in the director's chair: When You Finish Saving the World. And I'd argue that it's up there with A24's best releases of the 2020s. The story centers on Ziggy (Finn Wolfhard), a teenaged musician who struggles to connect with his socially conscious mother, Evelyn (Julianne Moore), who runs a shelter for domestic violence survivors. As Ziggy becomes consumed with his online persona in the pursuit of fame, Evelyn becomes increasingly concerned about his detachment from real-world issues, that he's becoming shallow and self-absorbed. This generational conflict is the thematic crux of the film, which critiques both the idealism of the older generation and the self-centered, performative culture of the younger generation. This exploration of emotional disconnect that divides generations is aided by minimalist, intimate cinematography that lingers on life's most uncomfortable, disorienting moments. Expect deadpan humor and legitimately incredible acting from the film's two leads.

In 2004, a documentary called The Conscientious Objector told the story of World War II veteran Desmond Doss, a pacifist and combat medic who, because of his Christian beliefs, refused to carry or use a weapon or firearm of any kind while serving in battle. Doss became the first ""conscientious objector,"" aka someone who refuses to perform military service, to be awarded the Medal of Honor. For 14 years, the movie adaptation of his story was in development limbo until Mel Gibson took on the project, bringing Andrew Garfield along with him in the lead role. The film focuses on the story of Doss (Garfield), who is initially ridiculed by his fellow soldiers before his bravery and courage shines during the Battle of Okinawa, where he single-handedly saves the lives of dozens of wounded men under heavy fire. Filled with brutal, unflinching battle scenes that emphasize the pure chaos of war, as well as religious imagery that frames Doss's actions as acts of faith and spiritual conviction, Hacksaw Ridge displays the human connection that persists even in the face of extreme violence. The film is loaded to the brim with great actors, from Sam Worthington to Teresa Palmer to Luke Bracey to Hugo Weaving to Rachel Griffiths to Vince Vaughn -- I'll go ahead and stop right there. Just watch this movie.

As a journalist, I've long been fascinated with movies about newspapers and media, from classics like All the Presidents and Network to modern winners like The Post and Good Night, and Good Luck. But there's one incredibly interesting, ridiculously entertaining entry into the news movie canon that doesn't get talked about enough: The Paper. Directed by Ron Howard, this fast-paced, super-tense flick that captures the chaotic, high-pressure environment of a bustling newsroom in a single 24-hour period takes place at a New York City tabloid, where editor Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) faces a whirlwind of pressures, both personal and professional, as he works to balance his demanding job with his family life, facing immense pressure from both his editor Alicia (Glenn Close) and his pregnant wife, Martha (Marisa Tomei). As a major news story breaks involving a murder case, Henry must navigate office politics, ethical dilemmas and the race to meet deadlines while dealing with his ambitious boss and the newspaper's struggling finances -- you know, just your average day in the newsroom. This character-driven flick is stuffed to the brim with great performances, with Randy Quaid, Catherine O'Hara, Jason Alexander and Robert Duvall filling out the cast."
Inflation Progress & Labor Market Cooling: The Fed's Rate Cut Thinking,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2024/09/21/inflation-progress--labor-market-cooling-the-feds-rate-cut-thinking/,2024-09-21T11:38:32Z,"Bill Conerly connect the dots between the economy ... and business!

The Federal Reserve made a relatively large reduction in short-term interest rates at its September 2024 meeting. They were not, though, in a panic or worried about an imminent recession. Instead, they were thinking that the old interest rate would not be appropriate going forward. That's a very sensible position.

The phrasing of Jerome Powell's statement to the press is telling: ""Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point."" He did not say they were shifting to an easier monetary policy, but merely reducing restraint. That's a critical distinction.

The economy has been strong. Growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was above trend last quarter and unemployment below its long-run average, though somewhat above its pre-pandemic reading.

The Fed, however, believes that the previous Federal Funds interest rate, 5.33% was restrictive. Bringing it down to 4.83% is simply less restrictive. What they don't know, however, is what exactly is the neutral interest rate. They presume that a neutral rate exists, but they cannot see it in real time. In fact, they can look at rough estimates of past values, and they don't believe it's steady over time. But they are pretty sure it's below the current rate.

Referring to the Fed as if it's of one mind is certainly wrong (though occasionally useful). For the long-run tendency of the Fed Funds rate, the 19 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had 11 different answers, spread from 2.375% to 3.75%.

Adding to the Fed's difficulty is uncertainty about the time lags in monetary policy. Milton Friedman famously concluded that the lags were long and variable. Estimation of the time lags from historical data is confounded by structural changes in the economy. The financial system has evolved in recent decades, as has the role of international trade, the importance of services relative to goods production as well as economists' understanding of the economy.

Saying that the Fed is ""flying blind"" relative to the neutral rate and the time lags may be an overstatement, but ""visibility impaired"" would be entirely accurate.

Although the FOMC vote had one dissent in its latest decision (Michelle Bowman who argued for cutting rates by a quarter percent rather than a half), the Fed has greater differences than their final vote shows. Joseph C. Sternberg recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal, ""The Fed seems skittish about the idea that the children on Wall Street might see the parents arguing in Washington.""

Nonetheless, the is a general consensus on two points: that the Fed has made progress against inflation, and that the labor market is not as strong as it recently was.

The inflation performance is undeniable, with the Fed's preferred measure of inflation dropping from 5.6% in early 2022 to 2.6% in the July reading. (August data are not yet available.) The Fed also thinks that they have more improvement in the pipeline. Remember those time lags. If the old interest rate was restrictive, then additional drops in inflation should be coming, even if the Fed shifts to neutral now. The fact that they believe that interest rates are still restrictive, just less so, means that they really want inflation to come down more.

Great concern about inflation must come from the huge federal deficits being rung up, with more deficit spending on the way regardless of the presidential election. Economists argue among ourselves about the effect of deficits on inflation, but even the slightest role for deficits would imply the Fed needs to keep interest rates restrictive for quite a while.

While inflation has come down, the employment side of the Fed's ""dual mandate"" has turned less hot. Not only is unemployment a little higher than two years ago, but the number of voluntary quits and open job positions have both fallen. Neither is flashing warnings signs, but they are not super-strong anymore. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, a decent leading indicator of the overall economy, has increased since the first of 2024, though it's well below long-run average.

The Fed believes -- and I agree -- that the economy is strong, but in a middle ground going forward. They are likely to continue cutting interest rates through this year and the end of 2025, but what happens after that is a wide open question."
Sri Lankan voters to chose from 38 candidates in consequential presidential election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/sri-lankan-voters-chose-from-38-candidates-consequential-presidential-election,2024-09-21T10:17:34Z,"SRI LANKA -- Following a major economic crisis in Sri Lanka marked by protests that culminated in the overthrow of the government in 2022, voters in the island nation go to the polls Saturday to choose among 38 candidates for president.

Located to the south of India, many voters in the Buddhist majority country of 22 million people -- approximately the same size as West Virginia -- feel disgruntled with the country's political culture as the nation climbs slowly out of its economic crisis.

Reuters reports that after the 2022 collapse due to a severe shortage of dollars, the economy is one of the biggest issues, with inflation reaching as high as 70%. It added that inflation has since cooled and growth in GDP is forecast ""for the first time in three years.""

""Across the island,"" there was a ""lot of confusion"" and people are ""uncertain"" who to vote for.

SRI LANKAN LAWMAKERS FIGHT OVER PM DISPUTE

""Entire segments don't even want to vote,"" Vinod Moonesinghe, a voter, told Fox News Digital.

He predicted ""turnout could be lower"" than in previous years due to disillusionment with many factors -- dynasty politics, the candidates being surrounded by corrupt figures themselves and a general distrust toward the political class after years of corruption and empty promises.

The top candidates in the field of 38 include incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe of the UNP; a right-leaning party opposition leader Sajith Premadasa of the newly created SJB party; Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the socialist, Marxist-leaning NPP; and nationalist Namal Rajapaksa of the SLPP.

The current government, headed by Wickremasinghe has been in power since 2022 and negotiated with creditors and secured an extended fund facility (EFF) program with the country's major debtor, the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Namal Rajapaksa, son of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa from the SLPP (Sri Lanka Podujana Perumana) told Fox News Digital, ""We are the only party that is nationalistic in orientation this time.""

When asked how he will overcome the challenges associated with his party's history, he replied, ""We will continue where my father's term ended in 2015.""

He dismissed criticism his party was pro-China as a global security concern.

""Nobody will use Sri Lanka's land air or sea to launch an attack on another country,"" Rajapaksa said, predicting U.S.-Sri Lankan trade will boom if he wins.

CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL BACKLASH

Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, said ties with the U.S. would remain strong regardless of the outcome.

""The U.S.- Sri Lanka [partnership] will not be affected by whatever candidate or party that will come to power. Sri Lanka's foreign policy is multidirectional and will work with the East and the West to build Sri Lanka.""

Presidential candidate Dilith Jayaweera, media mogul and businessman head of the newly formed Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) told Fox News Digital ""Sri Lanka's landscape [has] completely changed"". He said that ""traditional politicians"" lack ""management skills.""

He believes voters want a new approach to politics, including new candidates. He noted the popular chant of protesters to ""reject all 225,"" the number of seats in parliament, hinting that people wanted fresh new political figures.

Another voter, Usama Ibrahim, told Fox News Digital, ""We stood in [lines] for hours during our worst economic crisis in 2022 and, yes, Ranil Wickremasinghe has got us out of it, but he restructured the debts to pay off later. But will we get back to square one if the winner of this election does not have a solid long-term plan"".

The communist JVP party, which is part of the NPP coalition, seems to have garnered support, according to recent opinion polls. Nihal Fernando, a taxi driver, told Fox News Digital ""the other traditional politicians have a culture of jumping sides and, as we say, playing 'musical chairs' or leapfrogging. So, we now view many of the mainstream parties as being different sides to the same coin. He complained that since independence in 1948, the same political families have been in power and, after three generations, ""change is welcome.""

""Could things get any worse for the working class like myself?"" he asked.

Senaka Seneviratne, a Sri Lankan who has lived in the U.S. for 30 years, told Fox News Digital many in the diaspora want to see Sri Lanka prosper because they are ""concerned about their family members back home."" He noted the general uncertainty about the election among diaspora members is not dissimilar to those in Sri Lanka, noting that some ""may return home to vote.""

Political analyst Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, told Fox News Digital, ""Many are angry and frustrated. This anger and desperation is translating into voting for the JVP, who are the new kids on the block in terms of having never captured wholescale political power.""

He noted that the JVP has not gained traction among minorities as much as Premadasa and Wickremasinghe have.

He noted that ""Wickremasinghe restored a certain amount of political stability"" during his two years in office. He said that the presidential election might go to a 'second round' if there is no majority."
What's Next After The Fed's Big Interest Rate Cut?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreymarcus/2024/09/21/whats-next-after-the-feds-big-rate-cut/,2024-09-21T10:03:56Z,"Our expert contributors explain what the Fed's decision means for investors, businesses, job seekers, home buyers and more.

The Federal Reserve's decision this week to cut interest rates half a percentage point reverberated up and down the U.S. economy, with economists, business owners and investors wondering -- what's next?

""This decision carries profound implications for the trajectory of monetary policy and the broader financial landscape, igniting a spirited debate among market participants, economists, and policymakers alike,"" Forbes contributor Dan Irvine writes.

Irvine, who follows market trends closely, predicted that the robust rate cut ""could stimulate investment, spur consumer spending, and reinvigorate economic activity, fostering a more favorable environment for financial markets"" at a pivotal time for the U.S. economy.

Other Fed watchers, like Forbes contributor Erik Sherman, have expressed concerns that even though this change in policy was expected, recalibrating now may be difficult as prices and employment are still shaking out.

For all the Fed's effort to engineer a soft landing, it remains to be seen if the timing and size of the cut -- and any future cuts -- will be successful.

Forbes' expert contributors help explain what the Fed's move means for investors, businesses, job seekers, home buyers and more.

The stock market didn't initially respond with its usual enthusiasm for rate cuts, writes Forbes contributor Jim Wang, who posits that, ""perhaps the market believes the Fed is a bit behind on cutting rates.""

Investors made their real feelings known on Thursday, when stocks and bonds rallied. The S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq had recorded their biggest daily percentage gains since mid-August, Reuters reported. By the time the markets closed on Friday, they managed to notch a 1% weekly gain, with investors already considering whether the November Fed meeting will bring another half-point cut -- or just .25%.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell had indicated in his news conference earlier in the week that after cutting rates for the first time in four years, more may be coming. But he was careful not to box himself in.

""Powell avoided committing to any specific timetable for rate policy actions, opting instead to underscore that the Fed is data-dependent and that Fed policy is 'not on any preset course,'"" economist Jason Schenker writes.

Indeed, Powell said he will take it ""meeting by meeting,"" though most observers believe ""it is likely to be the beginning of a trend in additional monetary policy accommodation as the Fed cuts interest rates further in the years ahead,"" Schenker adds.

Though unemployment is relatively low by historical standards, Forbes careers contributor Jack Kelly writes that calls for Powell and the Fed to shift from fighting inflation to supporting the job market were mounting.

A cut in interest rates is designed to stimulate spending and lead to a stronger economy and, ultimately, higher employment and a more competitive job market. That can be good for job seekers and those looking to move up or on to better gigs, Kelly writes. But nothing is certain.

""While a rate cut is generally seen as positive for job growth, its effectiveness can depend on broader economic conditions, business confidence, and how companies choose to use the lower-cost capital available to them,"" Kelly says.

The Fed's decision to lower rates is a bet on the longer-term prospects of the economy, but one that can also help small businesses now, writes Rohit Arora, who covers lending and small business growth on Forbes.

""Lower interest rates will lead to reduced interest payments for small business owners,"" Arora says, and could free up money for consumers that are ""hurting badly with all the credit card delinquency and with auto loan delinquency at record levels,"" Arora writes.

Lots of types of businesses are affected. ""High interest rates hurt the economy by making it more expensive to borrow for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards -- or in many cases, for growing a business,"" Forbes contributor Benjamin Adams writes, adding: ""And no sector needs the break more than the cannabis industry.""

The monetary policy shift announced this week represents an opportunity for families and individual investors ""to reassess and optimize their financial situations,"" contributor Brian Menickella writes. Refinancing debt, rebalancing saving and investment plans, and unlocking home-equity potential are all on the table.

""Federal student loan rates will remain unchanged until at least July 1 of next year,"" Forbes personal finance contributor Robert Farrington writes. ""Whereas the impact on private student loans will be more immediate.""

""This isn't great news for those who will or have had loans disbursed after July 1, 2024,"" Farrington says. But variable rates on private loans could drop and borrowers interested in refinancing student loans with private companies, ""may find more competitive rates now than last year.""

Daryl Fairweather, a Forbes real estate contributor and the chief economist at Redfin, was cautiously optimistic in her predictions earlier this summer, advising home buyers to watch carefully.

""The way down for mortgage rates will likely be bumpy as economic data continues to roll in, and the Fed's actions will play a significant role in determining the path for mortgage rates,"" Fairweather said last month.

""Home buyers may want to try to time the market, but getting the timing exactly right is difficult, if not impossible,"" she added.

Cutting the interest rate could 'trigger' additional upside in cryptocurrency prices as greater liquidity drives heightened demand for riskier assets, according to Forbes contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II.

But Dave Birnbaum, who writes about digital assets on Forbes, is less certain. He says that the size and timing of the Fed's policy shift signals that it's in ""damage control mode.""

""While monetary easing typically weakens the dollar, strengthening bitcoin, the speed and size of this cut may indicate that the Fed is seeing something more ominous on the horizon -- a possibility that could lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies,"" Birnbaum writes.

These indicators suggest that macroeconomic instability, sluggish consumer spending and signs of strain on the U.S. labor market continue to stoke fears of a recession even as Powell and the Fed try to stick the landing."
Harris-Trump showdown: The edge is clear on this key issue,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-edge-clear-key-issue,2024-09-21T08:10:08Z,"'Special Report' panelists Juan Williams, Mollie Hemingway and Marc Thiessen discuss the latest Fox News poll numbers and Teamsters not endorsing a 2024 presidential nominee.

With just over six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5 and early voting and absentee balloting underway in a growing number of states, a slew of public opinion polls agree on a couple of key points.

One - the race in the key battlegrounds that will decide the 2024 White House election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump is within the margin-of-error.

Two - Harris has a healthy advantage among voters when it comes to the issue of abortion, while Trump has an equally large margin in dealing with the border and immigration.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN

Three - the economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

""The economy tops voters' minds,"" reads the headline from a new AP/NORC national poll, which was conducted entirely after last week's first and potentially only debate between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.

Nearly eight in ten questioned in the survey said the economy was one of their top issues, far ahead of everything else.

HEAD HERE FOR ALL THE MOST RECENT FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION

A Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

The economy reigns supreme in pretty much every other survey.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic-inflicted recession continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

""An increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family,"" the Fox News poll notes.

When it comes to which presidential candidate can better handle the economy, Trump continues to have the edge - but his margins over Harris differ dramatically depending on the poll.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.

But Shaw added that Trump's ""edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

Boosting Trump when it comes to the economy are apparent fond memories of his tenure in the White House.

Voters questioned in the Fox News poll by a 17 point margin said Trump's policies on the economy were more helpful than harmful. But by 24 points, they said that President Biden's economic policies have been more hurtful than helpful.

""The perception that Trump's policies helped more than Biden's creates some heavy baggage for Harris in this campaign and shows why 'turning the page' is a central theme she's tried to stress,"" Anderson said.

62 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/62-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-09-21T04:18:05Z,"Fox News host Jesse Watters asks how Vice President Kamala Harris is different from President Biden as he accuses her of bombing her first solo interview since becoming Democrats' 2024 candidate on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' (Courtesy: ABC News)

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 62 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Under pressure to sit down for a substantive interview after weeks of stonewalling, Harris finally ended her interview drought last month in Georgia when she was joined by running mate Tim Walz for a pre-taped piece with CNN's Dana Bash that was a far cry from a traditional press conference. She's done more interviews since, including on Tuesday with the National Association of Black Journalists, and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey on Thursday at a star-studded campaign event.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August last week in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris sat for two taped radio interviews last week, and she gave her first solo television interview as the Democratic nominee last Friday in Philadelphia.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

Trump has sought to highlight the contrast in media availability between the two, sitting for several lengthy interviews in recent weeks, in addition to his three news conferences.

In her interview on Friday in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

"Retailers Expect To ""Eat"" Latest Tariff Hikes, Not Raise Prices",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2024/09/20/retailers-expect-to-eat-latest-tariff-hikes-not-raise-prices/,2024-09-20T23:33:18Z,"Companies caught between rising import costs and price-shy consumers are accelerating plans to replace Chinese sources

There's been a good bit of handwringing within the retail industry lately over how to deal with the federal government's latest round of tariff increases. The ""gift"" of inflation triggered by supply chain logjams and funded by the flood of federal stimulus funds early in the pandemic gave retailers the rationale for raising prices. Margins expanded and consumers went on a ""revenge"" spree.

Now, inflation is the ogre under the bridge and shoppers are not so quick to pull the trigger. This year, major national chains have been ""rolling back"" prices, mounting big noisy promotions, and waging a war of sorts that consumers have gotten used to and have learned how to exploit.

Shoppers that used to fear ""missing out"" now patiently wait for and expect promotions and deals.

They have figured out how to flush out the lowest price for the highest value. Thus, the gift of inflation -- price flexibility -- is being replaced by the sting of eroding margins. In recent conversations with several leading retail executives, all said they expected this year to have to ""eat"" higher import prices.

It is an election year and, as usual, candidates for federal offices are beating the drums of geopolitics, calling for more tariff increases -- to flex our muscles, to show who's the boss. Tariff policies are also aimed at encouraging home-grown manufacturing sources and the jobs they create, and to discourage potential trade practices that undermine US companies.

For example, China's automakers have been sitting on a glut of unsold cars. To prevent a plague of cheaper imports that could devastate domestic carmakers, in 2018 the tariff on electric vehicles imported from China was jacked up from 25% to 100%. But tariffs are not so simple.

China is still a major if waning source. China's share of total apparel imports fell from 34% in 2017 to 22% in 2022, according to research conducted for a group of trade associations. The study found that China's share of tariff-specific apparel imports fell from 92% to 88%.

Now the pressure is on fashion merchants to speed up the process of pulling more production out of China and re-shoring to countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka. Latin America and Central America are often mentioned as obvious near-shoring opportunities, but they are said to lack the necessary infrastructure.

Athletic footwear brand Adidas has been an early mover in re-shoring and rethinking sources. The company announced this summer that its goal is to stop procuring from Chinese sources altogether.

Using tariffs as geopolitical influencers and industry protections sounds like a great idea. But a recent study out of the University of Wisconsin found that the US tariff codes are regressive and favor the luxury market over the mundane -- a handbag made of reptile leather has a tariff rate of 5.3%, while a plastic-sided handbag has a tariff rate of 16%.

There is a growing sense of urgency, driven in part by continued overall growth in exports from China to the US and inroads being made by Amazon-like competitors such as Temu and Shein, which can export small orders (less than $800 in value) to the US without any duty. That exemption covers about 70% of Chinese textile and apparel shipments, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.

As life and commerce spin faster and faster, successful retailers will be those which anticipate the unexpected by evaluating multiple sourcing approaches and the kind of flexibility normally found in the high-tech sector. Another learning from cross-industry observation."
"Interest Rate Cuts Won't Impact Election, JPMorgan Chief Dimon Says",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/20/interest-rate-cuts-wont-impact-election-jpmorgan-chief-dimon-says/,2024-09-20T19:15:10Z,"This week's big interest rate cuts will have no discernible influence on the outcome of November's presidential election, the head of the U.S.' largest bank asserted Friday, despite an embrace from Democrats and assertions from former President Donald Trump and his allies that the rate decision from the Federal Reserve had political motivations.

In a Wednesday press release, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic' presidential nominee, celebrated the Fed's cut as ""welcome news for Americans."" On Thursday, President Joe Biden called the decision ""good news"" and a ""declaration of progress"" against inflation, which raged to a 41-year high in 2022, causing the Fed to hike rights from historic lows. Experts have long expected the Fed, which makes monetary policy independent of elected branches of the government, to lower rates this year, but Trump told Bloomberg in June the Fed ""know they shouldn't"" cut rates before the election. Trump struck a similar tune after the Fed made its cut official, accusing the Fed of potentially ""playing politics,"" while his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, appeared Wednesday to swipe at the Fed for making its decision ""in the midst of an election.""

JPMorgan is by far the largest American bank, as its $3.5 trillion in assets were nearly $1 trillion more than the next largest bank as of June 30, according to the Fed, while JPMorgan's nearly $600 billion market capitalization is almost twice as much as the next most valuable U.S. bank, Bank of America, with a roughly $310 billion market cap. Dimon, who is worth $2.3 billion as of Forbes' latest estimates, thanks mostly to his stake in JPMorgan, briefly served as a policy advisor to Trump in 2017 but quickly parted ways, later declaring he is ""smarter"" than Trump. Dimon was floated in 2012 as a candidate for treasury secretary in the Obama administration, and Trump himself told Bloomberg earlier this year he ""would consider"" Dimon for the same post should he win the election, though Trump denied ever making the comments.

This presidential election may be more ""consequential in the short run"" for the economy than prior votes, theorized Dimon. Both Harris in ""price gouging"" bans and Trump in aggressive tariffs have endorsed policies critics panned as negative growth drivers."
Small Business Taxes: Let Me Count The Ways,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamdunkelberg/2024/09/20/small-business-taxes-let-me-count-the-ways/,2024-09-20T18:02:43Z,"According to NFIB's most recent Small Business Problems and Priorities report, tax-related issues continue to be challenging for small business owners. From a list of 75 problems ranked by severity, of the eight tax issues listed, two are in the top 10. Three are in the top 10 if you count ""unreasonable government regulations"" as a tax, it costs money to comply with regulations, ""reasonable"" or not.

NFIB's Small Business Economic Trends report finds that the percent of small business owners reporting taxes and regulations as their single most important problem has declined since 2016 (Chart 2) due to the appearance of a new tax which was even worse - inflation (Chart 3). Government policies are largely to blame for the inflation problem, spending trillions of dollars to support consumers and favorite industries. All of this inflationary spending is financed by increasing the national debt, rather than tax revenue which would have reduced private spending.

Compliance costs are significant, and the tax code is complex. Many of us use some type of professional service to fill out tax forms and keep us up to date with changes in the tax laws that owners have to navigate to stay in compliance. Ninety percent of small business owners hired a professional tax preparer to file their most recent tax return. Of those hiring a tax professional, 88 percent reported that their main reason for hiring one was because the tax laws and requirements are too complex.[1] Firms hire costly outside consultants to manage their taxes, costs that are passed on to customers.

Taxes remitted by companies are priced into the goods and services they sell, adding to inflation pressures. Consumers also pay for all the regulatory compliance costs firms incur, just as they pay for higher energy costs firms encounter. Politicians like to tax firms, not consumers, especially around election time. However, firms must earn a return on the investment in the company or go out of business. All of these added costs make it more difficult for owners to successfully operate their small business and complete with their larger counterparts.

Governments use taxes to accomplish their objectives, a mechanism to redistribute dollars to favored entities. However, consumers (including small business owners purchasing supplies and inventories) are always picking up the tab at the end of the day."
ABC's shameless debate didn't even survive its own fact-check,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/abcs-shameless-debate-didnt-even-survive-its-own-fact-check,2024-09-20T17:53:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As CBS anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan prepare for the vice-presidential debate on October 1, they have two models to choose from: CNN's attempt to avoid ""fact-checking"" the candidates or ABC's aggressively one-sided ""fact-based"" assault on the Republicans.

ABC's immoderate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis uncorked the most flagrantly unfair and unbalanced debate in the history of modern presidential debates, going back to the Nixon-Kennedy debates of 1960. They don't care that anyone objects to their strategic decision to join in debating former President Donald Trump, giving everyone the distinct impression that this was a three-on-one conversation.

Muir appeared on the Disney-syndicated chat show ""Live with Kelly and Mark"" and dismissed all criticism of ABC's shoddy performance as ""noise."" He sounded like Jimmy Kimmel when he told Republicans he didn't want them watching his late-night show. ABC isn't here to please Republicans, only Democrats.

REPUBLICAN SENATOR DEMANDS ABC NEWS TURN OVER DEBATE COMMUNICATIONS WITH HARRIS CAMPAIGN: 'BIASED AGENDA'

""All of the noise that you hear afterward about you know, 'Which candidate won the debate, did the moderators win or lose?'"" Muir said. ""That's just noise. You all know that. The most important thing to remember is you all have the power.""

Voters don't have the power to tilt the election discussion in one direction. Conspiracy theories bubbled up from an alleged anonymous whistleblower about Vice President Kamala Harris getting questions in advance. ABC hired former Democratic Party chair Donna Brazile as a contributor, and in 2016, when she was a contributor at CNN, she sent Hillary Clinton's campaign some topics for a town hall discussion in advance, and CNN let her go.

It could be enlightening to drag ABC before a congressional probe and ask how this incredibly biased debate was organized. But Harris didn't need to have these questions in advance. Team Kamala could know there would be an inflation question, an immigration question, an abortion question, an Israel question, and maybe another mention of her flip-flop on fracking. There were no surprises, and the questions were vague enough that she repeatedly dodged a direct answer and uncorked her prepared speeches, and the moderators naturally allowed it.

Davis gave a revealing interview to the Los Angeles Times, explaining they didn't want to be like CNN. ""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" she said. Those ""people"" are Democrats.

Davis told Times media reporter Stephen Battaglio that she had to turn off her social media accounts to shut out people who accuse her of pulling for Harris. ""There is a stereotype that I am acutely aware of that I can't be unbiased covering this moment,"" she said. Then she went on the debate stage and proved it. Davis, like Muir, had no time for people charging her with blatant favoritism.

Davis also cited her mentor, ABC News veteran Carole Simpson, a woman of color best known for moderating a 1992 presidential debate where she sneered at President George H.W. Bush for calling himself the ""education president."" Simpson openly called Hillary Clinton's election to the Senate in 2000 an ""exhilarating moment"" and in 2007, proclaimed it was time for Hillary to be elected the first woman president. That says a lot.

So how did Team ABC decide to tilt toward only ""fact-checking"" Trump? Davis said she and Muir had studied hours of campaign rallies and interviews to prepare for the debate, so they were ""ready to counter the candidates' most egregious statements."" For example, she fully anticipated fighting back on Trump's supposedly ""erroneous"" claim that the Democrats favor abortion at any time for any reason.

""That was an obvious thing to get on the record,"" Davis said. ABC's partisans should have studied what Trump typically cites, that then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a radio interview about keeping a baby that was born alive ""comfortable"" as they decided whether to kill it (or perhaps let it die unassisted). A state legislator had proposed a bill that she admitted would allow abortion up until birth.

They could have reviewed the 2020 Democratic Party platform, which proclaimed, ""We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion ... Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights.""

Davis gave a revealing interview to the Los Angeles Times, explaining they didn't want to be like CNN. ""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" she said. Those ""people"" are Democrats.

They will fight to overturn barriers, with no exceptions. Liberal ""fact-checkers"" have attacked Trump and many other Republicans (like Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy) for ""lying"" about Democrats supporting abortion on demand, when the facts are there, in black and white. They claim Republicans are debunked because late-term abortions are ""rare."" That's not a factual rebuttal.

On the Sunday after the debate, ABC ""This Week"" host Martha Raddatz, who has specialized in foreign policy, pushed a belated fact-check on Harris's claim that there were no American service members in war zones. ""Our fact-checkers found that to be false,"" Raddatz told Gov. Maura Healey, D-Mass. ""There are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria, 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. All have been under regular threat from drones and missiles for months. We also have action in the Red Sea. Also, every single day, the Navy SEALs, Delta Forces special operators can be part of any sort of deadly raid."" Muir and Davis didn't prepare for that one.

Battaglio apparently had no questions about whether they studied Harris's record for ""fact-checks."" They obviously needed no preparation on that front, since they never touched her. Let's guess that shameless zero occurred because, on the left, any attempt to fact-check a Democrat opposing Trump is objectionable, because it suggests that a Democrat's falsehoods might be made equivalent to Trump's. Every anti-Trump journalist acts on the belief that any measure of neutrality is an atrocity."
Cannabis Leaders Express Mixed Feelings Over Fed Interest Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2024/09/20/cannabis-leaders-express-mixed-feelings-over-fed-interest-rate-cut/,2024-09-20T17:51:55Z,"Earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it was cutting interest rates for the first time in four years. The move comes as a cooling economy replaces inflation as a primary concern.

The half-percentage-point cut brings rates down from 5.3% to about 4.8%, lowering borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.

It's certainly an inflection point in the U.S. economy. Yet it begs the question: What will this bode for the legal cannabis industries? With mixed feelings, several industry leaders weighed in.

John Mueller, CEO and co-founder of Greenlight, a multistate cannabis operator, sounded a positive note, feeling the timing couldn't be better as it will reap handsome dividends for the sector.

""The Fed's 50 basis point rate cut arrives at a strategic moment for the cannabis industry as many operators are renegotiating new debt packages to take advantage of the expanding market,"" he said. ""With current tax rates over double those of traditional businesses, this rate cut plus the imminent rescheduling of marijuana will allow operators to expand and innovate as we continue to cut into the opioid crisis and reduce overall health costs in America.""

Robert Beasley, CEO of Fluent Cannabis Care, a multistate cannabis company headquartered in Tampa, doesn't think the interest cut will have any measurable impact on the industry due to the federal illegality. That could change when rescheduling happens.

""Unlike other industries, we don't benefit from prime ratings and our lending options are much more limited,"" explained Beasley whose company has operations in Pennsylvania, Florida and Texas. ""The real financial breakthrough for cannabis businesses will come with rescheduling, which will likely broaden the pool of available lenders and open the door to traditional capital markets - offering rates more in line with other sectors.""

Adam Wilks, CEO of Carma HoldCo, a holding and licensing company focused on celebrity cannabis brands, agreed that the Federate Reserve interest rate cut will likely not have an immediate impact on the cannabis sector because of the lack of traditional financing access. However, it will be a boon for businesses that are outside the space.

""Lower rates may help ease the cost of capital throughout parts of the supply chain, but generally most cannabis businesses are forced to seek alternative financing due to the lack of traditional financing options,"" said Wilks. ""Financing is critical for retailers and brands who need to adapt quickly to consumer demand and remain competitive in such a challenging industry. Ultimately, lower interest rates are good for the macroeconomic environment - and we hope this will trickle down into the cannabis space - but until cannabis is rescheduled or federally legalized, the impact remains to be seen.""

In late August, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced it had pushed the hearing on rescheduling cannabis to December 2, 2024, following the results of the U.S. Presidential election."
The Future Of Salary Increases: Why Next Year Might See A Decline,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/karadennison/2024/09/20/the-future-of-salary-increases-why-next-year-might-see-a-decline/,2024-09-20T17:44:30Z,"Employees across the United States may need to prepare for a shift in their annual pay raises. An emerging report suggests that salary increases could be smaller in the coming year. A cooling job market and a changing economic outlook are influencing this trend. Pay raises soared during the early post-pandemic period when workers were in high demand. But now, the momentum favors employers. It remains to be seen how that will affect workers, especially their wage demands.

The days of record-breaking job openings and the ""Great Resignation"" seem to be behind us. According to a new poll by WTW, a consulting firm, the typical worker can expect a 4.1% pay raise for 2025, down from 4.5% this year. Based on data from 1,888 U.S. organizations, this projection signals a gradual cooling of the job market from its pandemic-era peak.

Salary increases are mainly driven by labor supply and demand, so they reached a new level in the early post-pandemic period. Millions of American workers switched jobs for better pay. In 2021 and 2022, the job market was booming. There were more job openings than workers, causing a hiring frenzy and record-high turnover. During this time, companies had to raise salaries to compete for scarce talent and retain employees.

Now, the situation is changing. Hiring has slowed, turnover has declined, and job openings have dropped. In April 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, job openings fell to their lowest level in more than three years. There were about 1.2 job openings per unemployed worker, down from a ratio of 2:1 about two years ago.

This cooling trend is reflected in company plans for 2025. Almost half (47%) of U.S. organizations expect their salary budgets to be lower for the coming year. With the job market so competitive, companies feel they can pay less. They're getting fewer applications and have fewer job openings.

The 4.1% raise for 2025 is smaller than in recent years. But, it's a decent return compared to the 3% median raise after the 2008 financial crisis.

The jump to over 4% during the pandemic was notable. Salary growth tends to fall, not rise, during economic upheavals. For instance, raises were 4.5% to 5% before the 2008 crisis. They never fully recovered to those levels until the recent boom.

Interestingly, workers' buying power has improved over the past year. Salary increases may be smaller, but the increase in buying power is the reason. This unexpected outcome is due to the easing of inflation pressures that had previously eroded wage gains.

Real hourly earnings, which measure wage growth after inflation, have been positive since May 2023. This means the average worker's paycheck today buys more than it did a year ago. For the period from May 2023 to May 2024, real hourly earnings grew by 0.8% for the average worker in the private sector.

This trend is strong for non-managerial, rank-and-file workers. Their pay has risen over 25% to $30 an hour. This marks a significant reversal from the period between April 2021 and April 2023. During this time, high inflation outpaced wage growth, leading to a decrease in real wages.

Many workers would be excited by this boost in buying power. It means they can buy more while working the same hours. They could also choose to take on fewer jobs.

Positioning Yourself for a Salary Increase in 2025

As a job seeker, the 2025 market may be tougher than in recent years. So, you must adjust your expectations and strategies. Here are some tips to consider:

With salary increases projected to be modest, companies need to adopt strategic approaches to handle employee compensation expectations.

As we draw closer to 2025, the key for both workers and employers will be adaptability. While salary increases may be smaller, they remain robust by historical standards. Combined with increased buying power, the overall picture for workers remains positive. Employers must balance cost control with competitive pay to attract top talent. The job market is cooling, but it is still strong."
"The Fed Rate Cut, Mortgage, Auto And Credit Card Rates: What To Expect",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/09/20/the-fed-rate-cut-mortgage-auto-and-credit-card-rates-what-to-expect/,2024-09-20T17:21:44Z,"In a rather surprising move, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.50%, bringing it down to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%. Most were expecting a 0.25% cut. Does it indicate a serious problem with the economy? How will this rate cut affect home loans, auto loans, and credit cards? Is such a substantial cut, just before an election, politically motivated?

Immediately after the Fed announced the rate cut, stocks rose on the news. Then, just as fast, stocks fell, indicating some confusion amongst investors. Now that the dust has settled, stocks are higher. Does this larger-than-expected rate cut indicate a problem with the economy?

According to Fed Chair Powell, ""The labor mkt is growing at a strong pace."" Even so, unemployment is slightly higher, but that is largely due to immigration. With the large influx of immigrants, there are more people seeking jobs, pushing the unemployment rate up. Inflation is falling, but prices remain elevated. Overall, the economy has proven to be quite resilient. Therefore, it's likely the Fed is simply trying to get ahead of the inflation struggle, which is why it cut by 0.50%.

I've heard it reported on a few news sites that if the Fed were to cut interest rates (which of course it did), it would translate into lower mortgage rates. This is largely untrue. Fixed rate mortgages are closely tied to the rate on the 10-year Treasury and are unaffected by a change in the fed's short-term rate. However, there is an exception. Home equity loans and variable interest loans do share a relationship with short-term rates and may benefit from the cut.

A rate cut by the Fed is helpful to auto loans as these loans are tied to shorter term rates. Automobile loans from commercial banks are down about 7.5% from their high on October 5, 2022. Thus, the Fed's rate cut should reduce auto loan rates and could spur additional growth in this area. However, according to Kelley Blue Book, auto loan rates may be the slowest to move. Why? Because of the lagging effect of interest rate changes. Specifically, now that the Fed has cut its short-term rate, the prime rate will follow. Since many loans are tied to the prime rate, auto loan rates may be slower to adjust.

Will the rate on credit cards move lower? According to Jonathan Smoke, Chief Economist with Cox Automotive, ""Consumers should see more immediate changes in the rates charged on credit cards, which should help improve the financial status of consumers who have built up balances to maintain spending.""

The short answer is not likely. I put this issue to the test a few years ago while attending a Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I asked two sitting Fed presidents, Dennis Lockhart (Atlanta) and Charlie Evans (Chicago), how fiscal policy, which is under the purview of the federal government, might influence their decisions on monetary policy. Without hesitation, each said the Fed stays in its own lane (i.e. monetary policy) and did not comment on or consider fiscal policy in its decisions.

Today's Fed seems to be more willing to comment on fiscal policy's effect on the economy and has suggested several times that federal government spending is too high. You see, excessive federal government spending tends to stimulate the economy, which is what the Fed has been trying to avoid. While it's not uncommon, the federal government and the Fed are once again working against each other. While the Fed is trying to slow the economy to bring inflation down, the federal government is in campaign mode, spending excessively, which stimulates economic growth.

This rate cut does not seem to indicate a problem with the economy. While the 0.50% cut will help auto loan and credit card rates, the benefit to the mortgage market will be limited to home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and adjustable-rate mortgages.

Finally, it's unlikely this move was politically motivated. Powell was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President Obama (2012), then to the Chair position by President Trump (2018). He was renominated by President Biden. Powell is a Republican."
Micron Technology Stock Earnings Preview: What To Know Before It Reports,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/micron-technology-stock-earnings-preview-what-to-know/,2024-09-20T15:37:04Z,"Micron Technology (MU) is a leading player in the semiconductor industry, and its earnings reports play a pivotal role in shaping investor sentiment. This article covers key factors affecting Micron Technology stock earnings, offering insights into the company's stock performance and what investors can expect from its next earnings report.

Micron Technology, founded in 1978, has grown to become a significant force in the global semiconductor market. The company's core business segments include DRAM (dynamic random access memory), NAND and NOR memory products, which are crucial for numerous industries. Micron Technology stock holds a key position due to the company's influence in the memory chip market, and its earnings reports often set the tone for other players in the sector.

MU stock has shown notable volatility in recent months. Several factors, including global semiconductor shortages, shifting demand trends and geopolitical challenges, have impacted Micron Technology stock earnings. Compared to industry peers like SK Hynix and Samsung, MU stock has been closely watched, as analysts debate whether it will outperform in the coming quarters.

Recent pricing trends in the memory chip market and tech industry as a whole have also influenced investor behavior. Despite macroeconomic challenges, Micron stock has managed to rebound due to strong performance in key segments.

The recent uptrend in memory chip prices, particularly DRAM, has buoyed the stock, though competition from other manufacturers remains a headwind.

Over the past year, Micron stock has gained 27.3%, a good run but easily dwarfed by Nvidia stock's 175% one-year return. On a year-to-date basis, Micron stock is up about 9.3%. Nvidia stock has gained 148% during the same period.

MU stock earnings reports are critical for investors, as they provide transparency into the company's financial health. Key metrics to watch include earnings per share (EPS), revenue growth and gross margins.

Micron Technology stock earnings are heavily influenced by memory chip pricing trends and forward-looking guidance from management is essential for gauging future stock performance.

Several key factors may impact MU stock earnings in the upcoming quarter. The ongoing semiconductor shortage has affected global production, potentially limiting Micron's supply capacity. Furthermore, the price of memory chips, especially DRAM and NAND, will directly influence Micron Technology stock earnings.

Any disruptions in the company's supply chain could affect its ability to meet market demand. Micron's reliance on global suppliers, especially in regions impacted by geopolitical events, could also play a significant role.

Another key factor is the cost of production, which has seen an increase due to inflation and supply chain bottlenecks. This could potentially lower Micron Technology stock earnings if not managed effectively.

Analysts are predicting MU stock earnings to reflect the current dynamics of the semiconductor industry, with consensus estimates placing EPS growth at a moderate rate compared to previous quarters. Micron is expected to report stable revenue as memory chip prices recover.

Analysts' consensus recommends a Buy with a price target of $149.15 a share. Consensus EPS stands at $7.23 per share, and revenue is expected to come in at $34.6 billion for the past quarter. Revenue is projected to rise, though MU stock will still face pressure from competition. A key comparison with the prior quarter's results will be essential for evaluating Micron's performance against market expectations.

Despite challenges, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Micron Technology stock earnings, particularly with the company's strategic focus on new growth sectors, such as AI and autonomous driving technologies.

Investor sentiment towards MU stock has been mixed recently. Institutional investors have remained steady, but some have shown concerns over the slowing pace of semiconductor growth. Micron Technology stock has experienced a slight increase in short interest, reflecting caution from retail investors.

Some analysts have issued downgrades, which temporarily impacted MU stock. However, recent upgrades by major investment firms have sparked a renewed interest, especially as memory chip prices show signs of recovery.

Institutional buying has kept Micron Technology stock afloat, but the real test lies in its upcoming earnings performance. Short interest, while still notable, has decreased slightly in recent weeks as positive sentiment builds.

Micron Technology's primary revenue sources include DRAM, NAND and NOR memory products. Micron Technology stock earnings are largely driven by DRAM, which has experienced growth due to increased demand from data centers and mobile devices.

The NAND segment has also seen growth, particularly from the automotive sector and the Internet of Things (IoT) market. However, pricing pressures in NAND have slightly impacted MU stock performance.

NOR memory, although a smaller contributor, provides stability to Micron's revenue. The diversification of these revenue streams helps stabilize Micron Technology stock earnings during periods of market volatility.

Micron is investing in next-generation memory technologies, such as 3D NAND and advanced DRAM products, to maintain its competitive edge. These initiatives are crucial for driving Micron Technology stock growth as demand for high-performance memory increases across industries.

In addition, Micron is expanding its presence in the AI space, which could open up new revenue streams and increase competition with the best AI stocks. These strategic moves will likely contribute to MU stock earnings growth in the long term.

Micron has also entered into key partnerships to bolster its market position. These alliances are designed to enhance innovation and expand Micron's customer base, further supporting Micron Technology stock earnings in future quarters.

Global economic conditions remain a key influence on MU stock earnings. Inflationary pressures, coupled with geopolitical tensions, have impacted supply chains and memory chip production costs. Micron Technology stock earnings may face headwinds if these trends continue.

At the same time, technological advancements in AI, 5G and autonomous driving are driving demand for Micron's memory products. Nvidia's outlook being boosted by increasing use cases for AI technologies, infuses confidence in payback from Micron's AI spends. These trends could bolster MU stock as the company capitalizes on the growing need for high-performance memory chips.

The semiconductor industry remains highly competitive, with players like Samsung and SK Hynix vying for market share. This competitive pressure could weigh on Micron Technology stock performance, particularly in the DRAM segment.

Micron Technology is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for memory chips in AI, data centers and autonomous driving. These sectors present significant growth opportunities for MU stock as the need for high-capacity memory increases.

However, Micron Technology stock also faces challenges. Geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, could disrupt its supply chain and affect production. Additionally, competition from other major players like Samsung and Intel poses a threat to Micron's market share. Regulatory changes and trade restrictions may limit Micron Technology stock earnings growth, particularly in markets where Micron relies on international partnerships.

During the upcoming Micron Technology stock fourth quarter earnings call, scheduled for September 25, investors should pay close attention to management's guidance for future quarters, especially regarding production capacity and pricing trends. Also, any updates on strategic initiatives, such as investments in AI-driven memory solutions, could provide insights into long-term growth prospects for MU stock.

Micron Technology stock earnings will be heavily influenced by memory chip prices and production capacity. Investors should watch for management's outlook on future demand and pricing trends, as these will be crucial for MU stock performance."
Geographic Decentralization Of Government Could Have Bipartisan Appeal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2024/09/20/geographic-decentralization-of-government-could-have-bipartisan-appeal/,2024-09-20T14:36:57Z,"During a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York in which he outlined second term priorities, former President Donald Trump announced his intention to ""create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government."" Trump added that ""as a first order of business, this commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months.""

Trump added that he would like to put Elon Musk in charge of the proposed efficiency commission, a role for which Musk has reportedly volunteered. Since Trump unveiled the idea, Musk has touted the prospective commission on X as the ""Department of Government Efficiency.""

In praising Trump's proposed government efficiency commission, the Wall Street Journal editorial board described Musk as well suited to lead the venture, noting that ""Space X has demonstrated how a private business can do better than NASA in sending rockets into space."" What's more, the WSJ points out how Musk has ""seen the waste and inefficiency of government first-hand, and he could no doubt call on many people from the private economy to help.""

Trimming back federal government excess is a task that will provide a target-rich environment for Musk and his team, who are likely conclude that many departments and agencies should be scaled back or scrapped altogether. A Federal News Network survey released in April found only 6% of federal workers are in the office five days per week, while nearly 30% of the 6,338 federal employees who were surveyed were totally remote. As such, Musk may conclude that it's unwise for taxpayers to spend money on behemoth but nearly empty buildings occupying expensive real estate in Washington, D.C.

Given his demonstrated willingness to relocate large companies, Musk might conclude, as some sitting members of Congress have, that the federal government should be less physically centralized and that many federal departments and agencies should be moved from Washington, D.C. to other parts of the U.S., as occurred when the Bureau of Land Management was moved from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo. during the Trump administration. The BLM's move to Colorado has since been reversed by President Joe Biden, but it is expected to be reinstated if Trump wins in November. What's more, legislation has been introduced in Congress that, if approved, would go beyond the BLM, moving many other parts of the federal government outside of Washington.

Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) have introduced legislation that would relocate much of the federal workforce away from Washington to economically distressed parts of the U.S. That bill, the Helping Infrastructure Restore the Economy (HIRE) Act, would move 90% of workers at 10 executive branch departments to other parts of the U.S.

There is evidence that, with White House support, the HIRE Act or an updated version of it, could garner bipartisan support. When campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Andrew Yang endorsed relocation of federal departments, with his website stating that centralization of the federal workforce in Washington ""has created a federal government that often feels divorced from large segments of the population.""

Yang's sentiment has been echoed by progressive writer Matt Yglesias, who called for ""taking a good hard look at whether so much federal activity needs to be concentrated in Washington, DC, and its suburbs."" Yglesias noted how relocation of federal agencies and departments would bring more than just the associated government jobs with them. Geographic diversification of the federal workforce would also lead to dispersal of jobs indirectly connected to federal departments.

""Each of these regulatory agencies is surrounded by a swarm of highly paid lawyers, economists, and lobbyists who make careers out of influencing their decisions,"" Yglesias noted. ""Right now, those folks all live in the DC metro area, where they drive up the cost of already expensive housing. Their spending would do a lot more good in Detroit, Milwaukee, or Cincinnati, where they would create secondary jobs and bolster a larger regional economy.""

In addition to decentralizing the federal workforce, a Musk-led department of government efficiency might consider recreating an updated version of the anti-appropriations committee that was used to wind down federal spending in the aftermath of World War II. Led by Senator Harry Byrd (D-Va.), the anti-appropriations committee, often referred to as the ""Byrd Committee,"" was responsible for reducing federal spending by tens of billions in inflation adjusted dollars. Those savings were achieved, in part, through the elimination of Depression-era make-work programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Work Progress Administration.

As with physical decentralization of the federal government, there are already some in Congress who see the value in creating a modern day anti-appropriations committee. Congressman Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.) has introduced the Finding Federal Savings Committee Resolution, which he touts as a ""modeled after the post-World War II era Anti-Appropriations Committee"" that will ""recommend the modification or elimination of underperforming and nonessential federal programs."" If authorized, Obernolte believes the committee ""would significantly decrease federal spending by reducing the size of the federal government while streamlining the mammoth federal bureaucracy.""

""Over the past several years, the size of the federal government, and therefore also our national debt, has grown tremendously. It is imperative that we take immediate action to lower federal spending and bring our debt under control to stabilize our economy and put our country back on track,"" Rep. Obernolte said when reintroducing his bill in 2023. ""My bill creates a bipartisan committee that will help to identify and subsequently modify or eliminate federal programs that are duplicative or just aren't working, trimming the fat of the federal bureaucracy and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent where they are most effective.""

While Musk has firsthand experience in dealing with various instances of federal inefficiency, he also has data on his side documenting how the federal government's fiscal challenge is not insufficient revenue, but overspending. In fact, in the decade from 2014 to 2023, federal government spending grew by 81.7%, far beyond that period's 23.3% rate of population growth plus inflation. Had federal spending grown in line with population growth plus inflation over the past decade, the federal budget would be $2.1 trillion lower than it is today.

A government efficiency commission, or anyone else seeking to reduce federal expenditures, will find a number of ideas out there, some of which have already been introduced as legislation. Some ideas for reining in government spending, like the anti-appropriations committee, have been tried before and proven effective. Other proposals, such as move federal departments and agencies away from Washington, would involve breaking new ground.

Musk, arguably more than anyone else on the planet, has experience in breaking new ground. Meanwhile Trump, with his relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and the BLM to Colorado, has demonstrated a willingness to relocate and geographically redistribute parts of the federal government, even in the face of vehement opposition. Depending on the results of the 2024 election, by January of next year geographic diversification of the federal government may be an idea whose time has come."
Fresh Take: Finding Inspiration Ahead Of Climate Week,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2024/09/20/fresh-take-finding-inspiration-ahead-of-climate-week/,2024-09-20T14:28:03Z,"Before Climate Week kicks off in New York City, Forbes' Chloe Sorvino traveled to Huron, Ohio for the annual Roots Conference at Chef's Garden, where she sampled a variety of fresh produce.

t's about to be Climate Week in New York City, and I've already had a taste of inspiration. I spent some time earlier this week in Huron, Ohio at the beloved speciality grower Chef's Garden for the farm's annual Roots Conference. I let myself take it all in. And I ate! I enjoyed so many bites of raw produce from the farm's bounty -- from fairytale eggplants and cucamelons to a dozen varieties of tomatoes, peppers and squash. The squash blossoms blew my mind, as did the edible flowers and microgreens. The micro lemon balm I snacked on was another one of my favorites.

You may remember Chef's Garden from the video we did with co-owner Farmer Lee Jones on how he bought back the farm his family lost when he was in high school. It's a special story, and I'd recommend a watch if you haven't seen it yet. What makes it so powerful is now that the farm is secure, the Jones brothers have been able to invest for the long-term -- in a way I wish more farms could but few do.

Not only has Chef's Garden fully embraced the principles of soil health and regenerative agriculture, but the farm has gone a step further. It has been working to shore up its on-farm energy supply, thanks to recycled corn cobs and a lot of other projects, and the farm is now going to be able to source 70% of all its electrical demand on its own. That's huge -- especially since energy grids are over-extended as it is, and when an extreme weather event hits, local governments typically prioritize the energy for residents before businesses -- even the ones that feed us.

I'll be taking this energy with me into Climate Week. And I hope I'll see you there! I'm moderating at a bunch of different events, and it's bound to generate real yet hopeful discussions. Check out my panel schedule below, and I'll look forward to hanging out in-person!

Democratic operative who ditched party after DNC blasts 'hypocrisy': 'I don't recognize this party anymore',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-operative-who-ditched-party-after-dnc-blasts-hypocrisy-i-dont-recognize-party-anymore,2024-09-20T13:57:11Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A former Democratic operative ditched the party, explaining how the ""hypocrisy"" and affinity for ""out-of-touch"" celebrity support has left her feeling hopeless about the party's future.

Evan Barker, a former Democratic Party campaign fundraiser, explained why she is now ""fed up"" with the Democrats during ""Fox & Friends"" after Vice President Kamala Harris attended a star-studded virtual campaign event with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday.

""I've worked in Democratic politics a long time. I've raised the millions of dollars and I went to the DNC last month hoping to feel re-inspired, and instead, I just felt like I was in a room with the most out-of-touch and elite people in the world,"" Barker told Lawrence Jones on Friday.

FORMER OBAMA FUNDRAISER SAYS SHE'S DIVORCING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, VOTING FOR TRUMP FOR THE FIRST TIME

In a Newsweek op-ed published this week, Barker described how she went from raising ""tens of millions of dollars"" for Democrats to distancing herself from a party she now believes is ""totally out of touch"" with everyday Americans.

Barker said she was initially ""thrilled"" to volunteer at the DNC, where Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the nomination for president.

""But once there, wandering amidst the glitz and glam, imbibing the gloss and schmaltz of it all, I couldn't escape a sinking feeling. I felt submersed in a hollow chamber whose mottos were 'Brat summer' and 'Joy' -- totally out of touch with regular, every-day Americans and their pressing needs; instead, the most elite people in the world chanted in unison that 'We're not going back,'"" Barker wrote.

Barker said the Democrats' ""hypocrisy"" is a primary reason as to why she distanced herself from the party overall. Donors are the actors who ""control everything,"" including the candidates' policy positions, she argued.

""I'm originally from the Midwest. A lot of the people in my family are union workers or have been in unions, and they are people who once voted for Barack Obama, and now they vote for Donald Trump. And for a long time, I did not understand why, and after raising money for Democrats and just being in these circles, I have realized that the donors control the party,"" Barker said.

RICH DNC SPEAKERS LIKE OPRAH, OBAMAS RAIL AGAINST WEALTH INEQUALITY, US FIXATION ON MONEY

""They control everything. They control what the candidates prioritize, and I know that Republicans also have this issue, too, but Democrats are much bigger hypocrites about it,"" she continued. ""I think what it comes down to is just the hypocrisy and the fact that I don't recognize this party anymore.""

Oprah Winfrey hosted the ""Unite for America Rally,"" a livestream event, featuring several celebrities as well as questions and stories from citizens across the country. The event was held by the ""Win with Black Women"" organization in support of Harris. Over 140 other grassroots organizations took part in the virtual rally, including ""White Women: Answer the Call,"" ""Latinas for Harris"" and ""White Dudes for Harris.""

The event itself took place in Oakland County, Michigan, to an audience of 400 people with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also speaking. Celebrities like Bryan Cranston, Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jennifer Lopez, Tracee Ellis Ross, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep were in virtual attendance as well.

Barker argued the celebrities in attendance are not the everyday Americans impacted by the rising cost of goods as inflation continues to soar, crippling families financially across the country.

""They're just telling us basically that all we need to have is optimism and joy, and that's going to fix our lives,"" Barker said. ""And I'm just tired of it. I'm completely fed up... My grandmother, she lives in Missouri. She voted for Obama twice. She's voted for Trump the last couple of times... She's getting by just on her Social Security check right now.""

""Things have gotten so outrageously expensive, it is so difficult for her,"" she continued. ""I want to see the Democratic Party talk about what they're going to do for my grandmother, not just have a bunch of celebrities fly in and tell us all to be joyful and optimistic. It's cringy. It's embarrassing.""

""They have become the party of Dick Cheney, of Goldman Sachs, of endless proxy wars, of identity politics,"" she said. ""I'm just at a point... I've been very brave the last couple of weeks, and I've gotten a lot of flak from a lot of people. And I'm just at the point where I can't stand it anymore, and I have to speak out.""

Harris Vs. Trump On The Economy: Trump Now Holds Just Slim Lead On Issue In Latest Poll,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/20/harris-vs-trump-on-the-economy-trump-now-holds-just-slim-lead-on-issue-in-latest-poll/,2024-09-20T13:19:55Z,"Americans now only slightly favor Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to lead the U.S. economy over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, according to polling released Friday, as the American economy sits at a potential inflection point heading into the election.

Trump's economic plan has largely focused on deregulation in the energy and financial industries, touting the much-better inflation during his presidency than Biden's, and instituting significant tariffs on Chinese goods. The U.S. economy performed very well under both Trump and Biden by most metrics, with historically low unemployment, strong stock market performance and steady economic output growth occurring during both administrations, save for a 2020-21 global blip during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic (see here for detailed data on how the economy fared under Biden and Trump). The president often has a less direct impact on the U.S. economy than public perception may suggest, considering the difficulty in implementing policies, the global nature of the economy and the fragile nature of the stock market, which ultimately relies on earnings growth for multinational corporations.

Though presidential impact on stock prices is often negligible in the long run, strategists suggest it's likely that stocks in sectors like banking and oil production would get a boost from Trump, while companies which rely heavily on manufacturing in Taiwan (like semiconductor chip maker Nvidia), or on sales in China (like Apple), could be hurt due to Trump's policy in the region."
Stocks Soar To New Highs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/09/20/stocks-soar-to-new-highs/,2024-09-20T12:33:51Z,"Commodities Like Oil And Copper Drop, Raising Global Economic Worries

One day after Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half of percentage point, stocks partied, to quote Prince, ""like it's 1999."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.26%. The S&P 500 gained 1.7%. Both of those indices closed at all-time highs. The Russell 2000 added 2%, while the biggest winner of the day, the Nasdaq Composite soared 2.5%.

I will admit, I was a little surprised by the magnitude of the cut. This particular Fed has tended to move slowly and methodically, in quarter-point increments. I expected them to continue in that manner. Therefore, it's fair to ask why a half-point now? I think there are three potential answers to that.

The first answer has to do with staying in front. The Fed was criticized as being slow to respond when inflation up ticked. We all remember the ""transitory"" characterization offered at the time prices began rising. That led the Fed to embark on a tightening path that went on for quite some time. It's very possible the Fed did not want to make the same mistake this time and opted to be more aggressive.

A second theory has to do with the Fed calendar. The Fed last met in July, where rates were left unchanged. There was no meeting in August and there will be no meeting in October either. Because of that, you could argue the Fed would have cut in either August or October, but since there is no meeting then, they essentially cut twice in September.

The first two theories do not necessarily suggest anything about a weakening economy. You could suggest the economy is fine and inflation has come down, allowing rates to come down. The third theory, however, is a bit more troublesome.

A potential third reason for the aggressive rate cut is that the Fed is seeing something concerning either domestically, globally, or both on the horizon. We have seen a weakening job market and consistent downward revisions to past reports. We're hearing about sizeable layoffs from certain companies. In fact, an article in today's Wall Street Journal says since January, tech companies have cut about 137,000 jobs. During the last earnings cycle, we also heard a number of companies keep forward guidance either at current levels or revise lower. The latest examples of that were FedEx and Mercedes.

Overnight, shares of FedEx tumbled after disappointing earnings. The company missed on both earnings and revenues and also guided lower for the full year. In premarket, shares of FedEx are down 13%. We also heard from Mercedes yesterday, which warned on their future profits as a result of slowing sales in China.

The lowered guidance by both these companies is a little concerning. FedEx is often seen as a proxy for the economy and when they issue warnings, it's usually because they see a slowdown in overall economic activity. With respect to Mercedes, they specifically called out China, which is troublesome because China has been struggling economically. Also, in somewhat of a surprise, despite cutting interest rates back in July, the People's Bank of China unexpectedly left rates untouched this morning.

Additionally, it's worth reiterating oil and copper prices have been trending lower this year, especially in the second half of the year. As I've discussed before, both of these commodities are seen as foundational to economic growth and a drop in prices could be tied to a global slowdown. On the bright side, we've seen a slight reversal higher in these products recently, but overall prices are still down quite a bit.

Finally, turning back to interest rate cuts for a moment, I want to draw attention to past easing cycles that began with a half-point cut. If history is any sort of indication of what to expect in markets, it could be time for investors to be cautious. The last two times the Fed cut rates this much to kick off a period of easing were in 2007 and 2001. If we look at where markets were two years after those cycles began, stocks were down substantially. For the 2001 cycle, stocks fell 31% over the next 24 months. In 2007, stocks were down 26% after two years.

Now, I will point out that the past does not necessarily predict the future. In fact, the recently completed tightening cycle and inverted yield curve did not result in the economic doom in gloom we've seen historically. Therefore, there is no guarantee that we will see a repeat of what happened in 2001 or 2007. I am simply bringing those years up for potential context.

For today, stocks are looking slightly lower in premarket and today is a quadruple witching where equity options, futures, options on futures and index futures all expire. Quadruple expirations like this are a quarterly event and can bring some added volatility. Today's expected move for the S&P 500 is 33 points, which means a total trading range of 66 points is possible. What I would like to see is for stocks to follow through on yesterday's action. Right now, 79% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average and 82% are above their 50-day moving average. That suggests the market is broadly rallying and a continuation of that would be bullish. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives."
Want A More Engaged Organization? Freelancers Can Help,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonyounger/2024/09/20/want-a-more-engaged-organization-freelancers-can-help/,2024-09-20T12:04:49Z,"One of the more aggressive arguments made against freelancing is that freelancers are necessarily less engaged in your work and organization than fulltime employees because they are outsiders. It's a point of view that is widely touted. Its also demonstrably false. In this article let's dig into how freelancers are a positive force for engagement.

What do we mean by engagement?

The engagement narrative, a canon of the management literature, is this: When leaders create a strong cultural and managerial bond among employees, and between employees and managers, good things happen. Work is more joyous and productive, collaboration and teamwork are more regularly found, productivity improves, attrition and absenteeism is reduced, innovation is encouraged, and organization members are willing to give discretionary time and effort to meeting organizations goals. In short, they are thinking about and acting in support of the organization during and beyond working hours.

A recent Forbes article describes employee engagement as a ""hiding in plain sight"" solution to much of what ails the global business community:

""In an era where businesses scrutinize every aspect of their operations for efficiency and profitability, a silent epidemic is ravaging workplaces worldwide: low employee engagement. While companies double down on trimming operational costs, they're overlooking a staggering leak in their collective bottom line. Recent studies from Gallup have unveiled a shocking truth: the global cost of disengaged employees has skyrocketed to an eye-watering $8.8 trillion annually. That's not a typo -- we're talking about a sum larger than the GDP of economic powerhouses like Japan or Germany.""

The problem with employee engagement: it's rare

As defined by Gallup as ""the involvement and enthusiasm of employees in both their work and workplace"" - employee engagement seems a very good thing. But engaged employees are hard to find these days.

According to Gallup, only 33% of US employees described themselves as engaged in 2023 and that number dropped to 30% in the early days of 2024. Overall, 70% of the US workforce is not engaged in their organizations.

Why so low? A recently published WSJ article entitled ""Why Is Everyone So Unhappy at Work Right Now?"" put it this way:

""... It is clear the unhappiness is part of a rethinking of work life that began in 2020. The sources of workers' discontent range from inflation, which is erasing much of recent pay gains, to the still-unsettled nature of the workday. People chafe against being micromanaged back to offices, yet they also find isolating aspects of hybrid and remote work. A cooling job market -- especially in white-collar roles -- is leaving many professionals feeling stuck.""

Strong feelings of identification with their organizations is a high hurdle these days.

Freelancers have a different experience than employees: It's all about the work

Freelancers, by contrast, are a more satisfied and optimistic global community despite the travails of solopreneurship. In the 2021 Global Survey of Freelancers 66% of freelancers described their client relationships as mutually satisfying, and reported enjoying their work (63%), building good reputations (59%), are optimistic about the future (65%), and committed to freelancing (61%). The Human Cloud Freelance Trend Tracker notes that, while concerned about short term market conditions, most freelancers have confidence in the longer term.

Freelancers also don't have the challenge facing fulltime employees: identifying with a specific workplace or organization. They typically work with multiple organizations (generally 2-5 projects) at a given time. What engages freelancers isn't the organization per se but the work itself: meeting client expectations, attracting new opportunities, sharpening their skills, building their network, and managing their business.

Would organizations benefit from more focus on work engagement, and less on institutional identity? Very possibly. According to The Edelman Trust Barometer institutions are increasingly distrusted these days. There's a trust gap between employees and their leaders; for example, employees trust the information of co-workers over leaders. Tenure is also a challenge. According to the BLS, 47m US employees changed jobs in 2021, and 38m more in 2022. With so much job switching, there's hardly time or opportunity to grow the organizational roots that existed in prior times. Emphasizing the work itself could be more a more helpful and realistic framework for engagement and would naturally incorporate project based freelancers as well as fulltime employees.

How might freelancing boost employee engagement?

Can freelancing and greater emphasis on the work help companies turn the corner on engagement?

A blended workforce has many advantages for productivity, cost, and engagement. Here's a short list of how a smart mix of fulltime employees and freelancers, supported by technology, would encourage and reinforce workforce engagement:

What turns on (and turns off) the freelancers working for you

There are, of course, factors that can increase and decrease the engagement of freelancers. The Global Survey on Freelancing helped to identify the conditions that create strong freelancer engagement:

What promotes freelancer engagement in the work, and their interest in continuing to support a given organization, are these factors:

· This client understands and works well with freelancers

· Work deliverables, milestones and timelines are fair and realistic

· This client require top quality work from freelancers

· This client's project managers know how to work well with freelancers

· I have access to the information I need to meet my deliverables for this client

· Client team members are friendly and helpful when I have a question or need

· I am treated fairly and with respect in my dealings with this client company

· Work I'm doing for this client company is interesting and satisfying

· Client team members I work with are technically and professionally competent

· I am paid fairly for my work for this client company

Data from the survey points out key freelance engagement enablers as well as important engagement detractors. Enablers include client expectations for top quality work, freelancer interest in the project, and team member relationships and competence. Detractors include organizations and project managers who don't work well with freelancers, unrealistic deliverables and deadlines, poor communication, and unfair or late payment.

Ways to further improve freelancer engagement

Increasing engagement enablers, and reducing detractors, is a general strategy for increasing freelancer engagement. But within that framework are several specific actions worth considering:

First, HR and Procurement teams benefit from understanding the freelance ecosystem. Smart talent partners establish relationships with freelance marketplaces that are particularly able to address their needs and support the development of contingent work programs. The three main verticals of freelancing - tech, marketing, and independent management consulting - include many excellent providers: for example, Toptal and Malt in tech, Ollo and Uncompany in marketing, and Catalant and Outvise in consulting.

Second, there's obvious benefit in sharing feedback about individual freelancers. Although a private talent cloud makes freelance selection and feedback more available, even informal feedback is helpful in many ways.

Third, include freelancers more regularly. In relevant communication. In training or information sessions where their expertise is helpful. Create events that enable freelancers to share insights, industry best practice or information on new innovations in the market. Invite freelancers with specific expertise to contribute to advisory boards, etc. There are many ways."
Will Rate Cuts Send Harley Stock Back To $50,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/20/will-rate-cuts-send-harley-stock-back-to-50/,2024-09-20T12:01:35Z,"Harley-Davidson stock currently trades at about $38 per share, around 22% below its levels of $50 seen on May 17, 2021 (pre-inflation shock high), and appears to be undervalued. On the other hand, automotive major Ford stock is down by about 10% over the same period. Harley saw its stock trading at around $31 at the end of June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and remains up by about 26% from those levels driven by easing inflation numbers. In comparison, the S&P 500 gained about 45% during this period. Harley's underperformance has been partly driven by inflation and high interest rates in recent years, which have made financing more expensive for buyers of motorcycles and automobiles.

Looking over a longer period, Harley stock has seen some gains. However, gains over the last 3-year period have been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 4% in 2021, 12% in 2022, and -10% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could HOG face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Returning to the pre-inflation shock level means that Harley stock will have to gain about 28% from here. Multiple factors could drive Harley's stock higher. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points this week, marking the first rate cut in close to four years. With the current benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains significant room for the central bank to lower borrowing costs further. The rate cut could help make vehicle financing more affordable, reducing monthly payments and encouraging potential Harley buyers who are on the fence to move forward with their purchases. Moreover, Harley has also been seeing relatively strong demand for its model year 2024 vehicles including its Touring Motorcycles. The company's Q2 2024 results were also better than expected, with adjusted net earnings rising by 34% year over year to $1.63 per share, while sales expanded 12% from the prior-year quarter to $1.62 billion. However, we estimate Harley Davidson valuation to be around $43 per share, about 12% above the market price, given Harley's mixed track record of selling to the next generation of riders as its core millennial customer base ages. Our detailed analysis of Harley-Davidson upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen in recent years and compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how HOG stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

HOG stock declined from nearly $46 in October 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to $10 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying that HOG stock lost almost 78% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered from the 2008 crisis to levels of around $25 in early 2010, rising roughly 150% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

HOG Fundamentals Over Recent Years

HOG revenues declined from around $5.7 billion in 2018 to about $4 billion in 2020, due to the impact of Covid-19 on motorcycle sales. However, sales rose to $5.3 billion in 2021 and to about $5.84 billion in 2023 as demand picked up and also as supply chain issues gradually eased. Net income declined from around $531 million in 2018 to just about $1 million in 2020, although it rose to about $707 million in 2023. The company's financial position is also reasonably strong with the company holding $1.8 billion in cash as of the most recent quarter.

Conclusion

With the Fed's monetary easing now underway, Harley's stock has the potential for gains.

Opinion | Trump is full of big ideas. Too bad they're all such bad ones.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-policy-proposals-election-ideas-2024-rcna171633,2024-09-20T11:50:55Z,"The Republican nominee has proposed a bold agenda that would make things worse.

Some elections are about big ideas: Should slavery expand to the Western states? How should the federal government respond to the Great Depression? How long should the U.S. military remain in Iraq?

Then there are the small elections.

These are the ones where the candidates propose small, carefully designed ideas to win support among key blocs of voters: passing a targeted tax cut or expanding the social safety net in some small way.

And then there's whatever this election is.

In many areas, Vice President Kamala Harris is running a classic small-election campaign. She's proposed lowering prescription drug costs, expanding the tax deduction for startups and passing laws against price-gouging at the grocery store, among other commendable but small-scale ideas.

Underlying her campaign is one very big idea: restoring abortion rights taken away by the Dobbs decision through a new law. But this is mostly about returning to the status quo of just a few years ago, undoing a major change to the fabric of the country that already happened, rather than making a new one.

Donald Trump, on the other hand, is running on big ideas. The problem is that most of them are terrible and it's unclear to voters which ones he'd seriously pursue.

A group of his former aides put together Project 2025, a drastic plan to dismantle the executive branch and give the president expansive new powers. The proposal is so unpopular that his campaign has repeatedly disavowed it, rather unpersuasively.

But even if you set those ideas aside, he has proposed some dramatic ones entirely on his own: imposing an across-the-board tariff on all imported goods, deporting millions of immigrants, abolishing the Department of Education, repealing the Biden administration's efforts to fight climate change, pardoning Jan. 6 defendants, launching politically motivated prosecutions of his opponents and reducing aid to Ukraine for the fight against Russia, among other things.

The consequences of these proposals would be disastrous. Economists warn the tariffs could boost inflation as much as 1.2% while costing a typical middle-class household more than $2,600 per year. Mass deportations would tear families and communities apart while triggering labor shortages and slowing job growth. Conditions on everything from basic democracy to climate change would be worse.

In this context, Harris' small-ball campaign makes sense: It keeps Trump's big, bad ideas in the spotlight and widens the exit ramp from the GOP ticket for Trump-skeptical Republicans and conservative-leaning independents. But it does offer a weird contrast. It's as if you asked your friends where to go for dinner, and one suggested Applebee's and the other a multistate crime spree.

Still, convincing voters of the risks of Trump's ideas can be difficult. Many recall similar apocalyptic warnings about his 2016 campaign and feel like his actual presidency wasn't that bad. Others think his simplistic ideas just might work. Polls show slim majorities favor his plans for tariffs and mass deportations, apparently unaware or disbelieving of their disastrous effects on the economy. And Trump throws out so many ideas in such a haphazard way, some voters simply don't believe he'll follow through on any of them.

After all, he has proposed building 10 futuristic ""freedom cities"" on federal land and developing flying cars. No one thinks he's actually going to do that. And he failed to follow through on most of his 2016 campaign proposals, keeping only 23% of his promises, according to a tally by PolitiFact. These include some of his biggest and most memorable pledges, such as building a border wall with Mexico and repealing the Affordable Care Act.

There's something sad about all of this. Trump's pre-politics celebrity and dedicated fan base allow him unprecedented freedom to propose bold ideas that would sink other politicians. But he wastes it on proposals that would trash existing institutions and hurt the vulnerable. When he does have a good idea -- like rebuilding America's roads, bridges and airports -- he lacks the ability to follow through, leaving it to his successor.

At its best, a presidential campaign can build the will for Americans to do big things: break up monopolies, re-energize the space program or increase access to health care, to name a few examples from the past. That's not the kind of election we're getting this year, and it may be a while before conditions are ripe for another election centering on bold proposals.

Hopefully, when that time comes, the big ideas won't also be bad ones."
Opinion | Kamala Harris' latest poll numbers are good in all the right ways,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-polls-debate-rcna171827,2024-09-20T10:15:35Z,"The vice president is surging in postdebate polls, including in key ""Blue Wall"" swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin.

Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign must be feeling pretty good about a new wave of polls since the recent presidential debate. In just the last few days, we've seen Harris up in both national polls and surveys of swing states against former President Donald Trump. It's an encouraging sign in what is still shaping up to be a close race with just over six weeks until Election Day.

We don't have time to walk through every single survey here, but here's a snapshot. Morning Consult had Harris up 6 points nationally in its survey released Tuesday, 1 point higher than in the snap poll it conducted the day after last week's debate. Another poll from Reuters/Ipsos that dropped last Friday showed Harris leading Trump 47% to 42% among registered voters. And the latest New York Times/Siena College poll sees a tie nationally among likely voters, with each candidate pulling 47% of those surveyed.

Things look even better for Harris in the battleground state polls, in which she had been comparatively weaker than in national surveys prior to the debate. The NYT's poll of Pennsylvania has Harris up 4 percentage points over Trump among likely voters, roughly the same as in August. Tuesday had a poll from Suffolk University/USA Today showing a 3-point lead for Harris in the Keystone State. And almost all of the polls from Marist College and Quinnipiac University of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin show Harris leading, except for Quinnipiac's Wisconsin poll, which joins a new AARP survey in showing a tie.

While most headlines tend to focus on ""who's winning,"" I want to remind readers that polls are also important for helping answer ""but why?"" The Suffolk/USA Today survey, for example, included 21 voters who supported former President Joe Biden in 2020 but aren't backing Harris. When asked why, five said it was because of the economy/inflation, five said it was because they don't know Harris' policies, and five said it was because they're still undecided. Another two each said it was because of the administration's Gaza policy and the border/immigration.

That's a very small sample size, but it speaks to how small a group those potential swing voters are. It also, though, shows there's still room for the Harris campaign to win over some of those former Biden supporters who aren't fully on board yet. If the problem that five of them had is that they don't know her policies, that means there's still time to educate them. The same is true for the five voters in the sample who said they're still undecided. And those 10 potential voters are more than all nine who backed Trump in 2020 and don't anymore, only one of whom said they're still undecided.

A few words of caution though before anyone gets too ebullient. First, most of these polls' results are still within their margins of error. Pollsters are very up-front about these gaps in the math that could throw off their results. For example, the Times/Siena national poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%, so the reality could be Harris is up as high as 50% to 44% or Trump leads by the same amount.

Further, while Morning Consult on Thursday said that state-level polling shows Harris surging post-debate, that's not a guaranteed trend through November. As Axios' Hans Nichols noted in June after Biden's less-than-stellar performance, historically these kinds of bumps have varying durations.

But it's still very much a welcome boost of momentum for Harris as the campaign begins to hit the homestretch. Furthermore, this is the exact thing that you want to see when there are key races up for grabs that will determine Senate control. Likewise, that upward trend line is all the more important when Democrats most likely have the advantage on mobilizing people to the polls, as the GOP suffers from Trump's counterproductive orders to divert resources from the party's ground game. There's still a lot that can happen between now and Nov. 5, but for now it's Harris with the wind at her back as Trump struggles to keep up."

American college students are concerned about the state of the country ahead of the presidential election, they tell Fox News Digital, over everything from its general direction to how Americans talk to one another.

Students at the University of Tennessee and New York University spoke about how they feel about the direction of America and what are their biggest concerns when it comes to their future.

""Right now it's kind of heading in a negative direction,"" New York University student Marina told Fox News Digital.

""It's quite scary knowing how much information is censored these days,"" said University of Tennessee student Kevin.

TRUMP TOUTS 'UNION SUPPORT' AFTER TEAMSTERS SHOCKING ANNOUNCEMENT

""I think we're going in the wrong direction,"" Noah, another Tennessee student, said.

""I think right now it's kind of heading in a negative direction because I feel like everyone's lost hope,"" said Marina, who added that maybe after the presidential election the country can ""aim for something positive"" once the next president is elected.

Lily from the University of Tennessee said it is currently a very divisive time for the country and added that former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are ""complete polar opposites.""

""I think it's really hard to have that conversation with people and kind of have a peaceful conversation about disagreements,"" she said. ""I hope we're going in the right direction. I do enjoy this country. I love the freedoms that we have, and I hope they stay protected.""

However, several said that they are hopeful for their own personal futures, even if they're not as bullish on the country's.

""I would say I'm optimistic. I mean, anything can happen. I'm very optimistic about my future,"" Noah told Fox News Digital. ""But in terms of this country as a whole, I'm pessimistic.""

""I think the US has done a good job at staying like a superpower country and being able to regain control and taking and taking care of the population. So I am optimistic, but more in the long term rather than short term,"" Marina, the NYU student, said.

""I hope everything goes well, and we continue to just be a good country and everybody can find a place of belonging. And, you know, there's a reason why people like to come here,"" Lily said.

Students expressed concerns about the state of the economy and the cost of education.

""I think in a lot of ways also, like with the economy, it's not looking too good,"" said NYU student Arriena, who added, ""in a lot of ways we are progressing when it comes to inclusion and opening ourselves up to new ideals.""

Lily said, ""It would be nice to have decreased prices and everything and just help people to actually be able to afford to live.""

""Lack of engagement in education just really creates a downward spiral,"" said Kevin. ""I think that it is most important for the future that we do everything we can to empower and encourage the next generation.""

Voters on college campuses in Washington, D.C, Milwaukee, Detroit and Houston cited the economy, immigration and foreign policy as their top issues in interviews with Fox News Digital.

""I would say, definitely, inflation and rent prices, the housing crisis is something that I think the Biden administration didn't really tackle nearly enough. So, domestically, I would definitely say that,"" Alex, a student at George Washington University who described himself as ""far to the left"" told Fox News Digital. He added that securing a ceasefire in Gaza was another top concern for him.

Newsom's deepfake election laws are already being challenged in federal court,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsoms-deepfake-election-laws-already-being-challenged-federal-court,2024-09-20T08:21:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

New legislation signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom regulating AI-generated ""deepfake"" election content and requiring the removal of ""deceptive content"" from social media is now being challenged in court.

The new laws build on legislation passed years earlier regulating campaign ads and communications, according to the governor's office.

But two of the three new laws are being challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California by a conservative poster - @MrReaganUSA - Fox News Digital has learned. The account had posted an AI-generated parody of a Harris campaign ad that resurfaced and went viral after Newsom signed the bills.

""This chills free speech, particularly for political commentators like Mr. Reagan, who use satire to critique public figures and rely on social media viewership for their livelihood,"" said the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, the public interest firm filing the lawsuit on behalf of @MrReaganUSA, in a news release.

WATCH ON FOX NATION: THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATIONS OF DONALD TRUMP

The legislation, which Newsom's office says will not ban memes or parodies, will instead require all satire or parody content to either remove their content or display a disclaimer label that the content is digitally altered. One of the laws also exempts ""Materially deceptive content that constitutes satire or parody.""

But the attorney for the account holder suing California, Theodore Frank, told Fox News Digital in an interview that there's a provision in one of the laws that would require social media platforms to have ""a large censorship apparatus and respond to complaints within 36 hours.""

""And what's going to happen is that social media is just going to ban us so that they don't have to have a big infrastructure to deal with it. They're not going to look to see whether something counts as parody,"" Frank said.

""There's a provision that allows lawsuits against the makers of the videos, if, unless there are these really burdensome disclosure requirements that basically require you to use the entire screen to have the disclosure and requires them to take down years of videos and spend hours on hours re-cutting them with the disclosure requirements and then having a disclosure that's louder than the video itself, and that takes away the entire comedic event,"" Frank added.

The law makes it illegal to create and publish deepfakes ahead of Election Day and 60 days thereafter. It also allows courts to stop distribution of the materials and impose civil penalties, per the Associated Press.

NEWSOM, CALIFORNIA BUSINESS GROUP SPAR OVER CONTRASTING JOB NUMBERS AFTER MINIMUM WAGE HIKE

X allows parody accounts so long as they distinguish themselves as such ""in their account name and in their bio,"" per the company's website. The platform does not have rules around individual posts containing parody and has been known to label deepfakes if the poster does not do so.

There are similar laws already in place in Alabama, and Frank said they're prepared to file suit against those, too.

""I don't think Republicans are immune to over-legislating in this area, but there are certainly other states that are doing this. And you know, I think it depends on who's in power and who's getting made fun of,"" he said.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon said, ""The person who created this misleading deepfake in the middle of an election already labeled the post as a parody on X. Requiring them to use the word 'parody' on the actual video avoids further misleading the public as the video is shared across the platform.""

""It's unclear why this conservative activist is suing California. This new disclosure law for election misinformation isn't any more onerous than laws already passed in other states, including Alabama,"" Gardon said. ""We're proud California did expand the law to also include misinformation about election workers for two months after an election -- so that malicious actors don't attempt to disrupt the democratic process.""

Newsom has previously condemned such satirical election content generated by AI. In response to the altered election ad of Harris, which Elon Musk reposted, Newsom said in July. ""Manipulating a voice in an 'ad' like this one should be illegal. I'll be signing a bill in a matter of weeks to make sure it is.""

"Clean Clothes, Clear Conscience: How Dylon Detergent Is Revolutionizing Laundry",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanrabimov/2024/09/19/clean-clothes-clear-conscience-how-dylon-detergent-is-revolutionizing-laundry/,2024-09-20T01:22:50Z,"Learn how this innovation could help reduce waste, extend clothing lifespan, and promote sustainable fashion.

Post-Brexit, the United Kingdom (UK) continues its search for inspiration. Amidst inflation and environmental uncertainty, lifestyle choices have become increasingly selective. Even mundane tasks like doing laundry are now debatable. What does your wash day look like in 2024? Are you mindful of using non-toxic products? Do you follow a routine or adopt a more relaxed approach? It's time to reimagine our relationship with laundry.

It's no secret -- laundry is one of fashion's biggest 'frenemy.' It hasn't seen a revolution since the Tide Pods. Historically, the art of laundry was tied to nature. Early practices involved natural streams of water and flat rocks to remove dirt, stains, and odors. In some cities, public laundry houses were constructed to facilitate this process. As society advanced its understanding of health and hygiene, the washboard emerged as a popular household item. The first electric-powered washing machine made its debut in 1908, marking another shift. Before detergents, soaps made from tallow, lye, and water were the norm. Today, the array of choices for detergents, washers, and dryers is vast. While the sounds and smells of our laundry routines can be comforting, the current global crisis demands a reevaluation of how we care for our clothes.

Our digitized world makes overconsumption easy. Online shopping and rapid delivery may provide immediate gratification, but they take a toll on the environment. The fashion industry alone is responsible for 2.1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. Reducing the amount of clothing we buy and maximizing the reuse of what we already own are key actions for decreasing our carbon footprint. More importantly, the products we use to care for our garments play a crucial role in sustainability. Enter Dylon, a science-backed detergent brand that functions like skincare for your clothes. Dylon is now making its debut in the UK and Ireland, promising to change the laundry game forever.

Dylon's new detergent is part of a larger sustainable campaign by its parent company, Henkel. Launched in 2018, Henkel's #RethinkNew campaign aims to promote a fresh perspective on fashion. Rather than buying new items, the campaign encourages renewing existing wardrobe pieces with scientifically tested formulas. Six years later, #RethinkNew was the motto for its fashion event held during the latest season of Copenhagen Fashion Week. ""Copenhagen is one of the most sustainable cities in the world, and that's why we really wanted to take part in the first place,"" said Nikki Vadera, Marketing and Digital Director at Henkel. ""The event has a heavy focus on making sustainable changes in the fashion industry, so the collaboration for Dylon's #RethinkNew event, which championed how pre-loved clothes can be styled innovatively, allowed us to come together seamlessly to support that message.""

On display was a live microscopic demo of how the detergent works, an interactive exhibition, and, most excitingly, a sustainable fashion show curated by sustainable stylist and new Fashion Director Victoria Lee. This wasn't your typical fashion show. On the runway, 15 influencers from over 10 different countries were styled by Lee in pieces each influencer already owned. ""This is more of a celebration of personal style to show that sustainable fashion can be for any aesthetic,"" Lee said. ""Whether you're minimalistic and simple or if you love a bit of color, you can bring pre-loved clothes and make them completely new by taking care of them."" Some runway standouts included a teddy bear bag that took 15 hours to create and a look reworked using a nurse's scrub. During the styling process, Lee washed the items using the detergent.

After just 10 washes, the detergent restores colors, removes bobbles, and smooths fibers, extending the lifespan of your clothes and reducing the need for new purchases -- an essential aspect of sustainable fashion. ""One of the highlights is just getting to showcase how incredible sustainable fashion can be,"" Lee said. ""We're so conditioned to add to cart and get it in the morning. We should be appreciating our clothes like an investment. Take stock of what's in your wardrobe and how you can represent or style it differently.""

These formulas are a good place to start your sustainable fashion journey. There are three: Color, Dark, and Sport. Each is suitable for different types of clothing, but overall, it works best on high-cotton and high-viscose fabrics. The Color formula works for all colored clothes and is available in a premium and floral scent, Blossom. The Dark formula, available in the same scent, works for dark clothing. The Sport formula works for activewear and removes foul odors that tend to build up during exercise. The triple-renew technology found in the Sport formula helps retain elasticity while restoring breathability of older fabrics.

By creating new looks with renewed clothing, you contribute to sustainable fashion. Plus, the product's eco-friendly ingenuity pushes the earth-preservation conversation among competitors forward. The formula is based on over 95% biodegradable ingredients, the bottle is made from over 50% recycled plastic (the second highest in the UK), and it's fully recyclable. ""We have a carbon-neutral footprint. We've got zero waste from plant to landfill,"" Vadera said.

The detergent is designed to be a gentle wash, achieved using mild surfactants combined with its patent-pending ""renew"" technology. Interestingly, 60% of clothes only need a light wash -- a statistic Vadera emphasized during the event. ""A lot of people wear their clothes for three or four hours and then they go in the wash. Why do you need to use those heavy-stain removal detergents when you can gently clean your clothes?"" she asked. Consumer insight played a huge role in the UK launch. Through focus groups, the brand was able to learn how ready consumers were to align with a brand that keeps the environment in mind. ""We know the UK is very important to the anti-fast fashion movement,"" Vadera explained. ""A lot of companies talk about sustainability, but we're really walking the talk. We don't see it as a fad. We're talking about changing consumer habits to live and breathe sustainability.""

""A lot of people wear their clothes for three or four hours and then they go in the wash. Why do you need to use those heavy-stain removal detergents when you can gently clean your clothes?""

This accessible approach to maintaining your clothes while being environmentally responsible represents a much-needed shift. Amid rising inflation in the UK, a product like this offers long-term savings and presents an exciting opportunity to rethink your wardrobe. The unique aspect of this detergent is its groundbreaking nature -- there's nothing else like it on the market. It's a wonder that we've waited this long for a brand to challenge and break the mold of what a laundry detergent does. ""This, for me, needs to sit in your laundry cupboard and should be your go-to every day,"" Vadera said. ""The only time you don't use it is when you've got your heavy-stained clothes. This is disruption -- disrupting the category for so many important reasons and I'm so excited.""

Clothing has been an integral part of human life for hundreds of thousands of years. Laundry, in some form, has accompanied this journey. We have come a long way from using rocks and water, but there is still much progress to be made towards achieving our sustainable fashion goals."

How The Fed's Interest-Rate Cuts Could Impact The Labor Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/19/how-the-feds-interest-rate-cuts-could-impact-the-labor-market/,2024-09-19T19:44:58Z,"The Federal Reserve made a significant move on Wednesday, cutting its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. This marks the first reduction in borrowing costs since March 2020, signaling a pivotal shift in monetary policy after more than two years of aggressive rate hikes aimed at combating inflation.

The decision reflects the Fed's growing confidence in taming inflation and its renewed focus on supporting the job market.

In July, the unemployment rate in the United States increased to 4.3%, marking its highest level since October 2021, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate remained relatively stable at 4.2% in the following month.

While unemployment remains low by historical standards, the recent government data has signaled a trend of ""cooling"" in the labor market, prompting a letter by three Democratic senators on Monday asking Fed Chair Jerome Powell to ""consider implementing rate cuts more aggressively upfront to mitigate potential risks to the labor market.""

""Employment numbers adjust slowly, so the Fed should frontload rate cuts to avoid sliding towards a potential crisis,"" wrote Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

In the memo, the senators also stated, ""At the end of August 2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released their preliminary benchmark annual review of employment data, which revealed that there were 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months that ended in March of this year than were initially estimated. While these are not job losses, they do indicate that job growth has been much slower than the data previously indicated. Some conservative economists believe that job growth has been even weaker since then.""

A 50-basis-point rate cut by the Fed signals its strong desire to stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates generally make borrowing cheaper for businesses, which can encourage them to expand operations, invest in new projects and potentially hire more workers. This increased economic activity can lead to job creation across various sectors.

For consumers, lower rates can stimulate spending, which in turn can drive demand for goods and services, potentially leading to more hiring to meet this demand.

A stronger economy often results in a more competitive job market. As businesses expand, employers may need to offer higher salaries to attract and retain talent, which would strengthen the bargaining positions of workers in salary negotiations. With the high cost of living, employees may push for larger salary increases to maintain their purchasing power.

In a growing economy, employees may feel more confident about seeking promotions or career advancements, even if it means changing employers. This was evidenced during the Great Resignation, when a large number of workers voluntarily left their jobs. The Covid-19 pandemic triggered a significant shift in the American workforce, with over 50 million employees quitting in 2022, following 47.8 million resignations in 2021.

Rate cuts could lead to a more stable job market, reducing the risk of layoffs and providing greater job security. As companies find it cheaper to borrow and invest, they may be more likely to retain existing staff and potentially create new positions.

Moreover, lower mortgage rates can boost construction activity and create jobs in that sector. While a rate cut is generally seen as positive for job growth, its effectiveness can depend on broader economic conditions, business confidence, and how companies choose to use the lower-cost capital available to them."
Will The Fed Move Win Back The FinTech Bulls Like It Has Stock Market Investors?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2024/09/19/will-the-fed-move-win-back-the-fintech-bulls-like-it-has-stock-market-investors/,2024-09-19T19:44:35Z,"This week the Federal Reserve announced a 50bps interest rate cut taking the Fed Funds Target rate to 4.75 - 5 percent, the first cut in over four years, and signaling that the easing cycle has commenced. The announcement was one of the most anticipated and talked about in recent history.

Coming off the back off sticky inflation, a softening labor market, and persistent global macro and political volatility, the market's anxiety for a soft landing was apparent - you could cut the tension with a knife. Many analysts were arguing for a 25pbs cut and notably, including Fed governor Michelle Bowman who dissented on the size of the cut, the first since 2005.

""Part of the reason I had thought Committee would move 25bps was that it typically likes to move methodically with clear messaging to the market,"" said Michael P. Reinking, CFA, a senior market strategist at the New York Stock ExchaNge, ""One of the risks to not messaging a larger cut in advance was that this would have caused volatility in currency markets, which if you rewound the clock to the beginning of August, was at the epicenter of the volatility with the unwind of carry trades.""

Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair commented in Wyoming last month, ""We will do everything we can to support a strong labour market as we make further progress towards price stability.""

Many market analysts are predicting one further base rate cut in 2024 and for interest rates to fall to around 4 percent by the end of 20225. The Fed's 2025 median projection is for an additional 100bps of cuts to 4.4 percent. Officials see rates back to neutral in 2026 at 2.9 percent with the longer run estimate also ticking higher again.

On the 2025 projection Reinking commented, ""This was not as aggressive as markets were looking for coming in as futures were pricing under 3 percent, but I think the market took some comfort in the fact that 8 of the 19 officials were below 3.25 percent.""

While analysts keep an eye on the labor market, the move appears to have attracted the bulls back to the stock market with the S&P hitting a record high of 5,723.88 on Thursday as global stocks rose in the aftermath of the substantial cut. Of note, the Bank of England appeared unphased by the Fed move and left rates unchanged at 5 percent on Thursday.

The S&P has performed historically well during this recent inflationary period with many firms largely protected from rising rates due to locking in lower rates in 2020 and 2021. Conventional wisdom is that lower interest rates stimulate economic activity by reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which tends to benefit the stock market. S&P 500 performance, however, following rate cut cycles can vary significantly.

The summer sell off of tech stocks had the Mag7 down by over 12 percent in July from their June all time high. The stock market has recovered most of the losses suffered in its summer selloff, but it is isn't being led by Big Tech, which has slumped with the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index falling 5.3 percent this week, and both real estate and utilities gaining 11 percent.

The price of bitcoin popped on the Fed's announcement to $62,524 on Thursday morning, a 1.3 percent gain pushing it above the $60,000 mark for the first time in September. According to CoinMarketCap, the broader crypto market rose 4.4 percent reaching a $2.16 trillion market capitalization. Risky assets like crypto tend to get a bump from lower borrowing costs which are often leveraged.

Global fintech funding suffered what some called a ""bloodbath"" in 2023 following a decade of hyper growth, and bull years in 2021 and 2022 coming out of COVID-19. It is estimated that fintech funding declined by an estimated 70 percent in 2023 from an all time high in 2021.

The poor investment figures were part of a longer global slowdown in early stage venture tech and innovation as the era of cheap money disappeared with rising inflation and interest rate levels not see for 40 years. Silicon Valley Bank's bankruptcy and FTX blowing up crypto did not help. The GenAI hype, sucking the living life out of the available fintech funding pool, also didn't help.

Fintechs found it increasingly difficult to access the capital they needed to grow.

Fast forward to today, the U.S. market led global fintech funding in H1 2024 with $7.3 billion across 599 deals with the half year results in line full year 2014 results. Fintech valuations have fallen, considerably, and now is the time to focus on value investments in those fintechs that have regulatory approvals and can build strong revenue lines, rapidly. Long gone are the days of investors funding a powerpoint vision.

Buyouts are popular vehicles and market consolidation is at the top of the agenda for many VCs, investors and fintechs. Distressed pre-revenue assets that cannot raise further capital are also offering bigger and better funded fintechs the opportunity to add horizontal and vertical bolt-ons that are often market ready, especially those in capital markets and financial market infrastructure.

There are a lot of opportunities to acquire world class technology and talent at a significant discount if you have the cash. As importantly, cheap(er) money is on its way back, the fuel for the fintech fire, and over the next two to three years, we will see fintech funding increase, but in a much more controlled manner, especially in the short term.

Fintech has come of age, and the wild days of youthful exuberance are less tolerated in many investor camps. Now, beyond exuberance, investors are looking for the adult in the room, and the rapid revenue growth story, at more normalized valuations. Fasten your seatbelt, and get ready for the next era of fintech emerging in 2025."
Biden falsely claims he's never spoken to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as President,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-falsely-claims-hes-never-spoken-federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-president,2024-09-19T19:23:24Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

President Biden on Thursday falsely claimed he had never spoken to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as president, despite having a meeting with him at the White House two years ago.

Biden, during a speech to the Economic Club of Washington, said, ""Unlike my predecessor, I respect the Federal Reserve's independence as they pursued a mandate to bring inflation down.""

""And that independence has served the country well. And by the way, I've never once spoken to the chairman of the fed since I became president,"" Biden added. ""We'll also do enormous damage to our economy if that independence is ever lost.""

However, in May 2022, Biden met with Powell in the Oval Office in what Bloomberg described in a report as his ""third in-person session with Powell"" since becoming President.

FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS RATES FOR FIRST TIME IN FOUR YEARS AHEAD OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

""My plan is to address inflation. That starts with a simple proposition: respect the Fed, respect the Fed's independence, which I have done and will continue to do,"" Biden said at the time.

""The president underscored to Chair Powell in the meeting what he has underscored consistently including today -- that he respects the independence of the Federal Reserve,"" then-White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese also said after the meeting, according to Reuters.

Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul's favorability among likely New York voters has cratered, and former President Trump is viewed more favorably by voters in the historically blue state in a new poll.

Siena College released a poll Thursday showing that just 34% of voters in the Empire State view Hochul favorably, with 54% viewing her poorly. When asked about their views on Trump, 39% of likely New York voters told pollsters they view the 45th president favorably, and 57% view him poorly, a figure slightly higher than voters' assessment of Hochul.

""It is also worth noting that Hochul's favorability rating, 20 points underwater, is worse than Trump's, 18 points underwater,"" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in the poll's press release. ""To repeat, Kathy Hochul has a lower net favorability rating in New York than Donald Trump.""

The poll found that Hochul's favorability rating dropped from last month's findings of 39% favorability to 50% disapproval among voters.

FORMER AIDE TO NEW YORK GOV. HOCHUL, WHO IS ACCUSED OF BEING CHINESE SPY, WENT ON A TOUR OF THE WHITE HOUSE

""While Hochul's favorability rating has never been outstanding -- she's never been viewed favorably by 50% of voters in a state where 49% of the voters are Democrats -- it has now hit an all-time low, 34-54%,"" Greenberg said. ""Her job approval rating, 39-56%, is also a record low.""

Trump traveled to his home state Wednesday, where he joined thousands of supporters on Long Island at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. He vowed to the crowd he would ""win New York"" and ""save"" the longtime blue state.

FORMER AIDE TO DEMOCRATIC NY GOVERNOR ARRESTED IN FEDERAL CASE

""The reason I'm here,"" Trump told the crowd, is because ""we are going to win New York.

""That's the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it, and we're going to do it.""

A Republican presidential candidate has not claimed victory in the Empire State since Ronald Reagan in 1984.

""We have to do it. We do it, and the election nationwide is over. We take over the White House, and we fix up our country,"" he said.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PRESS GOV. HOCHUL ON ALLEGED CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY AGENT'S INFLUENCE IN NEW YORK

""I say to the people of New York: With crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump. What the hell do you have to lose?"" Trump told the crowd.

Trump has previously said he has a good shot at winning the traditionally liberal state, including in May as he faced trial in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records.

""I think we have a chance to win in New York. It hasn't been done in, you know, many, many decades as a Republican,"" Trump told ""Fox & Friends"" in May. ""I think we have a very good chance.""

Across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Trump has also campaigned on winning the Garden State, another historically blue jurisdiction.

""We're going to win New Jersey,"" Trump told a massive crowd this spring in Wildwood, sparking exuberant cheers from supporters.

The Siena survey found that, in New York, Vice President Kamala Harris still has a lead over Trump, though it appears to not be as ""deep blue"" compared to previous presidential elections.

""New York remains solidly 'blue' but perhaps not as deep blue as it has been in the last several presidential cycles. In the six presidential elections this century, Democrats have carried New York by at least 18 points, and at least 22 points in five of the six.

CNN reporter lectures boat-owning Trump supporter he shouldn't be complaining about economy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-reporter-lectures-boat-owning-trump-supporter-he-shouldnt-complaining-about-economy,2024-09-19T18:17:53Z,"A Trump supporter in Florida clashed with CNN reporter Elle Reeve after she suggested he couldn't complain about the economy because he owned a boat.

A CNN reporter clashed with a supporter of former President Trump over whether he should have concerns about the economy, in a CNN interview that played on the liberal network on Wednesday.

CNN's Elle Reeve interviewed Trump supporters at a MAGA boat parade in Panama City, Florida about their most important issues heading into the 2024 election. At one point, she got into a heated discussion with Trump supporter Joe Harner because he said the economy was his number one concern, telling Reeve that everything was ""too expensive.""

She chimed in to lecture him for thinking this way.

""Let me maybe ask a slightly impolite question. But you know, if you can afford a boat, you're not hurting so bad, right?"" Reeve asked. ""Because a boat cost a lot of money, and it's a lot of upkeep.""

""Listen, nobody gave me s -- !"" Harner responded. ""I earned everything that I've got. I'm retired military, retired power plant, and I am successful and retired with boats and jet skis because I did it right, and everybody has that chance. Whether they choose or not, that's up to them.""

""I would never try to take anything away from you in that way,"" Reeve responded. ""But what I'm asking is, groceries are probably a smaller part of your budget than say, someone who's like a little worse off.""

""I think it's interesting that people who are a little bit more comfortable are still so concerned about the economy. Do you see what I'm saying?"" she continued.

""Because I want my money to go further. I want inflation to go down. I want interest rates to go back down. I want all that, but that covers everybody in the economy. Not just me, not just the poor, not just the rich, it covers everybody.""

After Reeve asked Harner if he was worried his kids wouldn't be able to afford a house or a car, he said he wasn't worried about that.

""I train my kids and taught my kids properly. They have great educations and they're both successful in their careers. Actually, they're doing better than me,"" he revealed.

Though the rate of inflation has subsided to 2.5% as of August 2024, Americans' budgets are still stretched due to the price increases that have occurred in rcent years. Compared with four years ago, in August 2020, when the country was in the midst of the pandemic and before inflation accelerated, prices are up just shy of 21%, according to FOX Business calculations.

Overall, food prices have risen about 22.8% in the last four years.

To perhaps the man in the interview's delight, however, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a point this week, marking the first reduction in four years.

How Will Stubborn Credit Card Debt Impact Holiday Spending?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nandansheth/2024/09/19/how-will-stubborn-credit-card-debt-impact-holiday-spending/,2024-09-19T16:50:47Z,"As the holiday season approaches, the looming shadow of credit card debt is causing concern for both consumers and retailers. In the first quarter of this year, credit card debt reached a staggering $1.12 trillion, marking a $129 billion increase year-over-year. Adding to this financial strain, a significant portion of Americans - 36% - are burdened with credit card debt exceeding their emergency savings.

With the Federal Reserve's ambiguous stance on interest rates and persistent inflation, a perfect storm is brewing that could significantly impact holiday spending. Here is how these economic factors will shape consumer behavior and how new strategies help retailers artfully navigate the changing landscape.

The Financial Pressure Cooker

Consumers struggling with high credit card debt and diminished disposable income are likely to feel the pinch this holiday season. They might be tempted to curb their spending, prioritize necessities, and become more discerning about where they spend their hard-earned money. Price sensitivity is expected to rise, with shoppers actively seeking out discounts, sales, and promotions to stretch their budgets further.

Navigating the Economic Maze: A Retailer's Guide

Retailers face a unique challenge in balancing the need to drive sales with the reality of financially constrained consumers. Adapting to the current economic climate requires a multifaceted approach.

It's critical that retailers monitor macroeconomic trends. Any adjustments to interest rates can significantly impact consumer confidence and spending habits. With the Fed's .5% interest rate cut -- and potentially more to come -- consumers may start to feel some relief from high APRs. By understanding these factors, retailers can tailor their messaging to resonate with consumers navigating uncertain terms.

Retailers also can't ignore the impact of targeted discounting. Implementing attractive, personalized promotions on products that appeal to specific customer segments can help shoppers feel valued and significantly increase the likelihood of conversions. By offering targeted discounts, retailers cater to individual preferences and budget constraints, enticing shoppers to purchase responsibly despite financial pressures.

Another move to improve a retailer's chances of success this holiday is ensuring they offer a frictionless checkout experience and the flexible payments options that consumers expect. In fact, research shows that 65% of Gen Z and Millennial shoppers have paid via installments in the past year. Streamlining the checkout process and offering a variety of payment options can remove barriers to purchase. The easier it is for consumers to complete their transactions, the more likely they are to finalize their holiday shopping.

Every retailer faces the challenge of boosting sales without sacrificing profit margins through deep discounts. Providing flexible payment options, such as installment plans or similar ""buy now, pay later"" services, can further alleviate financial strain and encourage responsible consumer spending. Paying for holiday purchases in manageable installments can give consumers the confidence that they're in control of their finances, an important consideration for 60% of shoppers.

By offering customers the flexibility to spread out payments, retailers could encourage larger purchases without significantly impacting their bottom line. This win-win approach would allow consumers to manage their holiday spending while ensuring merchants maintain healthy revenues. It's a strategy worth considering as the retail landscape navigates the delicate balance between attracting shoppers and preserving profitability. What's more, 57% of merchants worry that they'll lose business to sellers who offer installment payments, showing that this technology is becoming a competitive advantage in commerce today.

One other tactic that's been proven in recent years is the move to stretch the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season. The trend of starting the holiday season earlier each year can benefit both retailers and consumers. By spreading out shopping over a longer period, consumers can manage their finances more effectively, avoiding the stress of large, lump-sum purchases that quickly deplete their resources. Retailers can capitalize on this by gradually releasing promotions and deals throughout the extended season.

The Path Forward

The holiday season remains a critical period for retailers, even amidst economic challenges. By understanding the impact of credit card debt, inflation, and interest rates on consumer behavior, retailers can strategically adapt their strategies to meet the evolving needs of their customers. By offering targeted discounts, simplifying the checkout experience, providing convenient and flexible payment options, and elongating the holiday season, retailers can ensure a successful and financially manageable holiday experience for all.

The key to navigating these uncertain times lies in empathy, adaptability, and a willingness to meet consumers where they are. By doing so, retailers can not only survive but thrive in the ever-changing retail landscape."
Mortgage Rates 19 September 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-19-09-24/,2024-09-19T16:22:17Z,"If you require any personal advice, please seek such advice from an independently qualified financial advisor.

Bank Rate was held at 5% in September in a 8-1 majority vote by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November .

Steading interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but, for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Cooling and steady inflation has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 5%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.61%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.44% and 4.49% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 4.09%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 4.14% and 3.77% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.51%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stand at 7.15% today, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Halifax's latest house price report (published 6 September) reported that average property values in August were 4.3% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.3% when compared to July. Halifax, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in August at £292,505 - up from £291,268 in July.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
Should Gold Be A Part Of Your Portfolio? (Part 2),Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rmiller/2024/09/19/should-gold-be-a-part-of-your-portfolio-part-2/,2024-09-19T16:13:23Z,"Do you ever wonder if you should add gold to your portfolio? Do you hold some gold now and wonder if you should keep it or sell and invest those assets?

Any of these three beliefs might motivate an investor to hold gold. Spoiler alert - none of them stand up to scrutiny.

In the first article in this series, I delved into whether gold should ever be used as currency in the US. Hint: It shouldn't. If you missed that article, you can read it here.

For this article, I will delve into the concept of using gold as a hedge against inflation.

Belief 2: Gold's value is stable. When inflation is high, gold will retain its value. If we suffer high inflation, my gold will protect me against loss of purchasing power better than my money will.

An inflation hedge is an investment that protects you against a decline in the purchasing power of your cash, bonds and other investments in the event of unexpected inflation. To be an effective hedge, this investment must at least maintain its purchasing power when inflation surprises.

If gold were an effective inflation hedge, we would expect the price of gold to change to match inflation - the inflation-adjusted gold price should be stable.

For example, suppose that the price level doubled, and it took $2 to buy what $1 would have bought. A good inflation hedge would double in price to match.

Let's look at the recent history of gold prices - did gold maintain its purchasing power?

In December of 1980, gold cost $590 per ounce. In June of 2024, gold's price was $2,330 per ounce.

Since 1980, inflation has been significant, however. The price level has increased from 86.3 to 314.175, or a 264% increase. The increase in the gold price has been 295%. That sounds pretty good!

The chart above illustrates that experience. The brown line traces the price of gold in (December) 1980 dollars. The blue line shows what a stable real or inflation-adjusted price of gold would have looked like.

The price of gold has kept up with inflation since 1980. However, there were long periods of time when the shortfall was significant. For example, during 1999, the price of gold in 1980 dollars hovered around $150 vs $590 in 1980. That's about a 75% drop in purchasing power! At least during the last 44 years, gold has been a poor inflation hedge, at best.

What might be a better hedge? TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) are bonds whose face amount adjusts to match inflation. A short-term TIPS mutual fund should match inflation well with limited investment risk. TIPS are US Treasury bonds, so they have minimal credit risk, and a mutual fund holding TIPS with maturities between 0 and 5 years has limited interest rate risk, as well.

The chart above compares the Bloomberg 0-5-year TIPS index against gold between 2003 (the year the TIPS index became available) and 2023. I've set each of them to 100 in December 2003. The TIPS index has done an excellent job of maintaining purchasing power since 2003 - notice that the green line stays very close to 100.

At first blush, you might say that gold has done better. After all, $100 worth of gold at the end of 2003 rose in purchasing power to nearly $350 at the end of 2023! However, we must think about what asset we are hedging, what asset we are going to replace with the hedge. We want the hedge to reduce the risk of our position. If that hedged asset is cash, we want a hedge with stable value. Gold has not had a stable value and has lost value over significant time periods. For example, after gold reached its peak value of $350 around 2011, it dropped to $250 in late 2013, and then to between $200 and $250 for most of the next decade.

Since 2003, the short-term TIPS index has maintained its value a lot better than gold. That index is also easy to access - there are numerous short-term TIPS mutual funds.

In my next article, I'll discuss gold as an investment.

Trump touts support from nearly 60% of Teamsters members: 'Nobody ever expected' this to happen,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-touts-support-nearly-60-teamsters-members-nobody-ever-expected-happen,2024-09-19T16:01:54Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, for the first time since 1996, is not endorsing the Democratic presidential nominee after a poll showed nearly 60% of its members support former President Trump.

""They're going to, I guess, remain neutral. But that was sort of a big event. Nobody ever expected anything like that to happen,"" Trump said on ""Gutfeld!"" Wednesday in his first in-studio appearance on the hit late-night show.

""They actually took a poll of the Teamsters, of the people, the workers, the people that really do the job. And they're good. I've had many of them work for me with the concrete stuff, you know, the frames, they put up the frames, they drive the trucks, so they just announced they're not going to support the Democrats.""

""We had a tremendous advantage with the people,"" said Trump. ""It's been many, many years since they supported a Republican or did this.""

DNC APPARENTLY SNUBS TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT FOLLOWING HIS HISTORIC RNC SPEECH

A New York City union official and former Democrat joined ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday to explain why he cannot support VP Harris.

""For everything that's gone on in the last four years. An open border, inflation, gas prices, oil, mortgage rates. I mean, I can go on and on. The immigrants just getting into neighborhoods, like the neighborhood I grew up in... These are where people worked hard all their life to buy a house in a nice neighborhood, and now it's destroyed by illegal immigrants,"" said Bob Bartels, business manager of Steamfitters Local Union 638.

In a release titled ""Union Workers Support President Donald Trump,"" the campaign highlighted the former president's more than 25-point margin over the vice president in both online and phone surveys of Teamsters.

Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued in a statement that ""the hardworking members of the Teamsters have been loud and clear -- they want President Trump back in the White House. These hardworking men and women are the backbone of America and President Trump will strongly stand up for them when he's back in the White House.""

The powerful union has over 1 million members in the U.S. and is deeply connected to working-class voters in the key Midwestern general election battlegrounds and in other swing states across the country. Until now, it had endorsed the Democratic candidate for president in every election since 1980.

Asked if the move by the Teamsters will affect the election, Trump said, ""I think it will. Yeah, I think so. The Teamsters carry a lot of weight.""

In explaining the reasoning for declining to endorse a 2024 presidential candidate Wednesday, the union said in a statement, ""The union's extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump.""

Teamsters General President Sean O'Brien said, ""Neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business.""

The Harris campaign, in a statement to Fox News after the union opted to remain neutral, pointed to endorsements from ""many Teamsters locals and rank and file.""

""While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said.

""The vice president's strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her -- alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor. As the vice president told the Teamsters on Monday, when she is elected president, she will look out for the Teamsters rank and file no matter what because they always have been and always will be the people she fights for.""

Master-Planned Communities Are Thriving And Growing In Florida,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradhunter/2024/09/19/master-planned-communities-are-thriving-and-growing-in-florida/,2024-09-19T15:42:48Z,"Florida has become a hotbed for the development of master-planned communities (""MPCs""), with real estate developers capitalizing on a confluence of market forces that make these projects increasingly attractive. In our work, we are seeing a large number of new communities of this type now in planning or in development, all around the state of Florida.

Florida's population is growing rapidly, particularly with the movement of many companies from the northeast to this region, generating local jobs, supplemented of course by the steady influx of retirees, remote workers, and international migration. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that Florida's population grew by more than 14% between 2010 and 2020, and this trend continues as more people seek the state's favorable climate, no state income tax, and relatively lower cost of living compared to other major states like California and New York. In addition to the working families, retirees moving in from other states looking for planned environments with access to healthcare, social amenities, and outdoor activities are another source of demand for homes in master-planned communities.

Sales paces in general have been slower this year than last year, but now that mortgage rates have fallen from the high 7s to close to 6%, monthly payments will be in reach for more potential buyers, and builders are already feeling more confident. The outlook is extremely positive for Florida MPCs, given the robust migration into Florida and the high rates of household formation both in the state and nationally.

Master-planned communities are designed to meet the demands of home buyers who want a lifestyle that is supported by amenities such as golf courses, fitness centers, restaurants, and schools within the development. These features create a sense of community and convenience, especially appealing to young families, active retirees, and remote workers.

For developers, this trend presents an opportunity to offer a ""one-stop"" living solution. By integrating residential, commercial, and recreational spaces into a single cohesive environment, MPCs meet the growing demand for work-life balance and convenience. The appeal of ""live, work, play"" communities has become a major selling point, differentiating MPCs from stand-alone suburban developments.

Florida MPCs often offer a range of housing options that cater to various income levels. These developments frequently include single-family homes, townhouses, apartments, and built-to-rent neighborhoods, making them accessible to a broader demographic. Affordability is key, particularly in light of recent inflation and higher interest rates that are challenging many potential buyers.

By providing diverse price points, these communities attract a wide range of residents, from first-time homebuyers to empty nesters. Furthermore, Florida developers often benefit from lower land costs in more rural areas, allowing them to build with a wider variety of housing styles and sizes, which creates more attractive price points for consumers.

Local governments in Florida, especially in suburban and exurban areas, are increasingly offering incentives to developers of master-planned communities. These can include tax breaks, expedited permitting processes, and public-private partnerships to build the necessary infrastructure such as roads, utilities, and public transportation. By offering these incentives, governments are able to promote economic development and attract new residents, which in turn boosts the local tax base.

Lakewood Ranch is the highest-volume all-ages MPC in the country, located in Manatee County. The developer of that community, Schroeder-Manatee Ranch, said builders see master planned communities, especially those with a proven track

record, as being able to provide reliable performance. Buyers are also gravitating to MPCs as they prioritize lifestyle, quality and look for assurances of their investment, particularly in a more challenging market. Builders naturally want to be where their customers favor.

Resale homes in Lakewood Ranch have a median sale price that is 50% above the MSA's median price (as of July 2024 for YTD through June). New construction homes in Lakewood Ranch have a premium of 30%+ compared to new homes in nearby communities.

Lakewood Ranch is a multi-generational community that offers a diverse range of village amenities, home types and price points that appeal to a variety of demographics, including professionals, families, and retirees.

So far this year, 25% of sales were in entry-level villages, 49% in move-up buyer / multi-generational villages, 14% in active-adult targeted villages, and 12% in luxury / custom villages. The median age of our residents is 53, which is half a year younger than the overall Orlando market.

The typical builder sells 11 homes per month in Lakewood Ranch, but the range goes from 1-2 homes per month in the luxury end up to 35 per month from national production homebuilders who are active there.

Lakewood Ranch's builders have consistently outperformed in Lakewood Ranch compared to other nearby communities. MPCs represent quality and offer assurances of investment due to additional layers of services offered.

Sunbridge, being developed by Tavistock, is located near the prestigious and extraordinarily successful Lake Nona Community in the greater Orlando market. Both Sunbridge and Lake Nona are being developed by Tavistock Development Company.

Lake Nona has consistently been ranked in RCLO's Top Selling MPC's with Sunbridge making the list in 2023.

The premium for homes within an MPC such as Lake Nona and Sunbridge can vary significantly depending on the region and the specific characteristics of the community; however, our experience has consistently shown that homes in an MPC can command at least a 15% premium compared to similar new home offerings in the area reflected in the added value from enhanced community amenities to a higher standard of living.

· More than 40% of residents surveyed completed graduate school.

· More than 35% of residents surveyed have a household income of more than $250K.

Builders within Sunbridge sold 387 homes last year, up from 244 the year before (the development started in 2020, and has sold 1,027 since opening. Lake Nona, which has been selling for much longer, has sold 2,095 over the same period, and was running at a pace of 500 per year back in 2015.

A builder's sales pace can vary based on the types of homes available and the pricing strategy employed. On average, builders in Sunbridge are averaging 32 sales per month.

Demand from builders for additional lots within Tavistock's communities is strong, as there is a tight supply of lots in the entire Central Florida market. Additionally, for home builders, MPCs tend to be more resilient during economic downturns. This resilience is largely due to the value and quality that MPCs offer. Buyers, even in uncertain economic times, are inclined to invest in a community that promises stability, superior amenities, and a well-maintained environment. The comprehensive planning and long-term vision that goes into MPCs create a sense of security and confidence among buyers, making these communities a safer investment during economic fluctuations. Furthermore, the diverse mix of housing options and community features can cater to a broader range of buyers.

We continue to track existing and planned MPCs throughout the State of Florida. Thousands of new homes are planned over the next five years in St. Lucie, Brevard, and Martin Counties on the east coast, and thousands more on the Gulf coast, as well as in Central Florida and in the Jacksonville area. Other high-volume MPCs in Florida include Wellen Park, Silverleaf, Tradition, Babcock Ranch, Ave Maria, Westlake, and Viera, each building and selling hundreds of homes each year."
What Does The Bank Rate Freeze Mean For Mortgage Borrowers?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/2024/09/19/what-does-the-bank-rate-mean-for-mortgage-borrowers/,2024-09-19T15:19:24Z,"If you require any personal advice, please seek such advice from an independently qualified financial advisor.

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to hold the Bank Rate at 5% in September. Between August 2023 and August 2024, the Rate had remained at 5.25%, a 16-year high, following 14 successive rises since December 2021 when it stood at just 0.1%, writes Jo Thornhill.

The latest freeze will not affect variable and tracker rate deals (of which there are an estimated 1.4 million, according to UK Finance), although it's worth remembering that lenders can theoretically still change rates that are not directly linked to the Bank Rate.

In August however, when the Bank Rate was cut by 0.25 percentage points to 5%, borrowers paying tracker mortgage rates (which move directly in line with the Bank Rate) saw their monthly payments fall by up to £28 on average, according to the banking trade body UK Finance. It represents an annual saving of £336.

The calculation is based on an average tracker mortgage size of £136,512 and an average tracker pay rate of 6.47% (before the rate cut), according to the banking trade body's data.

Borrowers on fixed rate deals are 'locked in' and will not be affected regardless of what happens to Bank Rate. Lenders have been pegging down mortgage costs in recent months and weeks, so borrowers coming to the end of a low fixed rate deal who need to remortgage should see more competitive fixed deals compared to earlier in the year.

Around 700,000 households on low fixed rates deals are due to remortgage in the second half of 2024, according to UK Finance figures.

The September rate freeze at 5%, voted for by eight of the nine members of the Bank's MPC (the other member voted for a 0.25 percentage point cut), follows years of inflation-calming through sustained interest rate increases. The Bank of England uses interest rate hikes as a weapon to tame rising inflation.

The most recent statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the annual rate of inflation rose slightly in July to 2.2% where it remained in August. However, the figure had been at 2% in May and June, which is the Bank of England's official target.

The MPC's next decision on interest rates is on 7 November 2024. And with the US Federal Exchange reducing its lending rate by 0.5% percentage points to 4.75% in September, a cut for the UK is looking likely.

So what does all this mean for the nation's mortgage borrowers? We rounded up some expert opinion:

Sarah Coles, head of personal finance, Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Those on tracker rates and standard variable rates will be disappointed. When they opted for these deals, they'll have hoped rate cuts would come thick and fast, but cuts have been decidedly skinny and sluggish. Fortunately, there's some hope ahead, with the market expecting more cuts this side of Christmas, and the prospect of their finances finally easing a little.

""The vast majority of the mortgage market is still fixed, and there's better news for those looking for a new deal or facing a remortgage, because the market has already priced in the cuts it's expecting over the next couple of years. The average 2-year fixed rate mortgage is currently 5.37%, a far cry from just three months ago when it was knocking on the door of 6% (5.97%). Competition is hotting up, and we've seen rates launched at less than 4%, which bodes well for buyers.""

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ""There is a strong argument for the Bank to get on and cut rates again, giving borrowers an affordability boost, easing pressure on household finances and in doing so, assisting the wider economy. If worries about the Budget are realised, the need to boost transactions and activity in the housing market will be all the more apparent.

""However, while the Bank of England has failed to take action, lenders are reducing their mortgage rates regardless as they compete for business. Mortgage rates continue to soften, with Santander introducing a sub-4 per cent two-year fix on the back of the lowest two-year Swap rates in two years. There are also plenty of five-year fixes at sub-4 per cent for those looking for certainty over a longer period.""

Mr Harris added that, while rock-bottom rates are 'long gone', reductions in mortgage rates are giving borrowers some comfort: ""Competition between lenders is likely to mean further gentle reductions in mortgage rates as they vie for new business.""

Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said: ""Keeping the headline interest rate on hold will be a blow for mortgaged homeowners and first-time buyers hoping for further respite from high borrowing costs. While easing inflation and the rate cut last month have provided some relief from the sky-high borrowing costs of the past couple of years, it won't have solved all the affordability challenges existing homeowners and prospective buyers are still facing.""

Ms Haine added, the next big decision for remortgagers is whether to lock in another fixed-rate deal, or whether a tracker might work out best over the longer term: ""Whatever option borrowers choose, committing to a new deal is key. Otherwise they risk reverting to their lender's ultra-expensive standard variable rate, with the average SVR remaining high at just below the 8% mark."""
Hispanic voters in Nevada say economic conditions making some consider voting Trump,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/hispanic-voters-nevada-say-economic-conditions-making-some-consider-voting-trump,2024-09-19T15:12:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Hispanic voters in Nevada, a key swing state, told CNN's John King that the demographic was considering voting for former President Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris due to the economic conditions.

""A lot of people are calling me, or calling us - Latinos, you know, talking about voting for Trump,"" Rafael Cerros Jr., who launched a radio station alongside his friend Rogelio Regalado in Nevada in 2020, said. The pair said the economy was ""100%"" why some Latino voters were leaning towards Trump.

King spoke to voters in Henderson, Nevada, about who they planned to vote for in November, as well as what they've heard from others in the community.

""A lot of small businesses are struggling,"" Cerros told CNN. ""It's not 100% yet, to where it was. Especially with inflation.""

POLICY GROUP SAYS HARRIS' SMALL BUSINESS BREAK GETS DROWNED OUT BY OTHER HIGHER TAXES

A Nevada real estate agent, Zoila Sanchez, also acknowledged high prices during the interview, but was confident Harris would be the one to fix it.

However, Sanchez said he heard a lot more Hispanics were considering Trump - male voters specifically.

""I want to understand it,"" she told CNN. ""And I can't. I really can't... I think it is kind of a macho thing.""

Antonio Munoz, a retired police officer, veteran and now bar owner, said he was leaning towards Harris, but wanted to know more about her policy.

""I've been checking her website and you read it, but it's not specific,"" Munoz told CNN. ""We do need to move forward. We need a different plan to get over the hump with this inflation that has caused severe damage to a lot of businesses... She needs to be more direct.""

Munoz also told the outlet that several of his friends longed for Trump's pre-COVID economy, and suggested that because Nevada elected a GOP governor in 2022, the political climate in the state could prove to be better for Trump.

""He has grown,"" Munoz said of Trump's standing among Hispanics. ""I have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.""

A CBS reporter revealed on Wednesday that after visiting multiple restaurants in Nevada, she only found three Harris supporters.

""What was really incredible is, in every single restaurant, of the people willing to talk to us, we could only find one Harris supporter in every restaurant -- and we left no stone unturned. I approached every single person, except for this one guy... But people are really excited about Trump,"" CBS correspondent Adriana Diaz said."
Economic Concerns Are Top Priority For College Voters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meglittlereilly/2024/09/19/economic-concerns-are-top-priority-for-college-voters/,2024-09-19T14:55:54Z,"While much of the discourse about college voters has focused on campus war protests and reproductive rights, America's youngest voting block does not rank these as priority issues. If young voters turn out in high numbers on Election Day 2024, they will likely be driven by economic concerns like the cost of rent, food and college tuition. That's according to the latest analysis from The Brookings Institution, which synthesizes their ongoing research on this critical subgroup of the electorate.

""In short, young voters are experiencing a complexity of economic stress,"" according to the Brookings analysis. ""This includes a dramatic rise in the cost of rent and mortgages that has led many to move back in with their parents; a drastic increase in the cost of higher education that has saddled them with college debt; and limited job opportunities, even for those with college degrees.""

Gabriel R. Sanchez, a primary author of the Brookings paper, says that this is the extension of an underappreciated trend that's been simmering among youth voters for several years.

""Inflation was actually the number one issue for voters 18-29 in 2022, so this is not a new trend among this age group,"" says Sanchez. ""While more ideological issues like abortion are often talked about much more in the national media, young voters have been feeling the economic downturn and are voting based on the economy.""

He points to the results of the 2022 African American Research Collaborative Mid-Term Voter Election Poll which was an early sign of these emerging economic priorities. The findings are consistent with those of the 2024 Harvard Youth Poll and the 2024 Tufts Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement youth poll, both of which found inflation and cost of living as the top concerns among young voters this year.

Young voters are not a monolith, and not all attend college, but these trends appear to hold true among the subgroup of young voters who are currently in college. A 2024 poll from Young America's foundation found that economic issues outrank all social issues for college students, across party lines.

Mike Burns, national director of the Campus Vote Project, points out that, as the most diverse voting block in the electorate, youth voters express interest in a broad range of concerns.

""This generation of college voters is incredibly diverse so they are motivated by a range of issues. However, economic issues such as inflation, cost of rent/housing, and income inequality rank highly for them in surveys just like for older voters,"" says Burns. ""Students are also very concerned about mass shootings. We hear students wanting to see elected officials take strong action to address these issues.""

How these concerns will translate to voter turnout remains unknown. Most of the political data available today predates the July shakeup in the Democratic party, when President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.

Early signs suggest that Harris's entry into the race provided an infusion of enthusiasm among many young voters, including a September poll from Tufts that shows a dramatic increase in youth voter registration since July. In eight states, there are already more young voters registered than there were on Election Day 2020.

Youth voters are always outnumbered by their older counterparts, but the bar for making history is higher than it has ever been.

""2020 was also the highest turnout election in the history of the country and youth and students had especially high voter turnout, even compared to the increase for other groups of voters that election,"" says Mike Burns. ""So we are optimistic that will we again see young people, and students in particular, making their voices heard in their communities up and down the ballot at very high rates."""

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) opted to lower its key borrowing rate by a half percentage point, or 50 basis points. The last time the FOMC cut interest rates by half a point was in 2008, amid a global financial crisis.

""Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2  percentage point,"" Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve of the United States, said in a press conference. ""This decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.""

The Central Bank lowered its key interest rate to about 4.8 percent, down from 5.3 percent -- a two decade high. Inflation peaked at 7 percent to a three-year low of 2.2 percent in August. High interest rates hurt the economy by making it more expensive to borrow for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards -- or in many cases, for growing a business. And no sector needs the break more than the cannabis industry.

The new interest rate cut could make the difference for cannabis operators in need of financial services from loans to real estate investments.

""Surprising to us, the Fed has lowered rates by 50 basis points to get ahead of potential weakness in our economy in the coming months,"" says Anthony Coniglio, president and chief executive officer of Connecticut-based REIT NewLake Capital Partners, Inc, which provides real estate capital to state-licensed cannabis operators.

""It's great to see our Central Bankers firmly move into an easing of monetary policy, although we are more optimistic about economic growth in the near term,"" Coniglio continues. ""This initial rate cut will have limited impact on operator financial performance because many credit facilities are fixed rate. For those with floating rates, a 50 basis point cut only reduces interest expense by 4 percent if a company's floating rate coupon is currently 12 percent. Where this easing cycle can have an impact on the industry is a return to a more risk-on appetite for investors generally and the potential for that to bring in new investors to the sector. This, as well as further rate cuts, will position operators to reduce borrowing costs more meaningfully when refinancings occur over the next 12-24 months."" Last week, NewLake Capital announced that its board of directors has approved its third quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.43 per share of common stock.

Safe Harbor Financial has been providing industry-leading cannabis banking services since 2015, and its leaders are cautiously optimistic about he recent announcement from the Federal Reserve.

""This move is welcomed by both the cannabis industry and its stakeholders across the value chain,"" says Safe Harbor Financial Chief Credit Officer Dan Roda. ""As borrowing costs decrease, we can expect more businesses to seek debt financing and an increase in capital flowing into the cannabis sector in pursuit of higher risk-adjusted returns. However, without federal reform to remove the systemic barriers that have constrained capital access, the near-term impact will remain somewhat limited.""

The lower interest rate could help businesses already impacted by sky high tax rates. Cannabis companies paid over $1.8 billion in federal taxes in 2022 compared to non-cannabis businesses as a result of the general U.S. tax treatment of the cannabis sector, according to industry research firm Whitney Economics -- and only around of quarter of businesses that were surveyed said they were profitable.

The cannabis sector carries among the harshest tax burdens once local and state taxes are levied: Dozens of states levy one type or another of excise tax on adult-use cannabis purchases. These can be manifested in the form of percentage-of-price taxes, weight-based taxes, and potency-based taxes -- stacking multiple taxes. Local governments also levy an excise tax on cannabis.

Unlike a general sales tax, cannabis sales are subject to a ""sin tax"" because the tax is in part imposed to address the negative effects of cannabis use. Additionally, some states tax the purchase of cannabis for medical use, albeit at lower rates.

The recent Federal Reserve announcement provides a glimmer of hope to cannabis businesses that face among the steepest tax rates of any industry, and are often in need of a loan or other financing services."
"S&P 500, Dow Rise More Than 1% To New Highs In Delayed Rate Cut Rally",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/19/sp-500-dow-rise-more-than-1-to-new-highs-in-delayed-rate-cut-rally/,2024-09-19T13:53:32Z,"Equities soared globally Thursday as investors absorbed the Federal Reserve's jumbo interest rate cut, though stocks' bond market counterpart appears not to be sold on the Fed cut.

The bond market has struggled following the rate cut, as the yield for the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note have gained some 10 basis points from its 3.65% level just after the Fed announcement to Thursday's 3.75%, the highest yield in two weeks. Higher yields indicate lower bond values, and though lower interest rates typically help bonds, the move reflects fixed income traders' concerns the Fed may have acted too aggressively with inflation still above the historic norm, resulting in higher interest rates over the long run. The 10-year yield is still about 15 basis points below where it was at the end of August.

The Fed's decision to lower the federal funds rate from 5.25% to 5.5% to 4.75% to 5% represented its first cut since March 2020. A cut looked all but guaranteed, but the central bank opted for the friendlier route of a 0.5 percentage-point move to address slowdown in the labor market and growing angst about an economic downturn. In a Thursday note to clients, Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye described the stock market's jolt and drop as a""a sell the news"" knee jerk reaction. Lower interest rates are almost always seen as a boon for stocks as lower debt financing boosts corporate profit margins, though if such a move from the Fed fails to stimulate the economy and predates an extended economic slump, as it did in 2007, it would likely bring pain for investors."
"Korean Biotech's Shares Quadruple In Seven Months, Becomes Kosdaq's Biggest Stock",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkang/2024/09/19/korean-biotechs-shares-quadruple-in-seven-months-becomes-kosdaqs-biggest-stock/,2024-09-19T13:14:47Z,"Alteogen overtakes EcoPro BM, South Korea's largest producer of cathodes for electric-car batteries, to become the biggest company on the Kosdaq by market capitalization.

hares of Alteogen, a little-known biotech company in South Korea, have quadrupled since late February, and now boasts a market capitalization of 18.6 trillion won (about $14 billion). The stock surge has boosted the net worth of the company's billionaire CEO Park Soon-jae to $2.7 billion, according to Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires list, up from $1.2 billion seven months ago.

Alteogen is now the largest corporation to be listed on South Korea's technology-rich Kosdaq stock exchange, pipping EcoPro BM, the battery-materials-making unit of billionaire Lee Dong-chae's chemicals group EcoPro, for the title.

Based in Daejeon, south of Seoul, Alteogen focuses on biosimilars, which are cheaper versions of brand-name drugs made from living cells, and biobetters, an improved (safer and more effective) version of existing drugs. In recent years, Alteogen has been making more money from ALT-B4, a technology that allows drugs to be administered subcutaneously (into the fatty layer of skin cells) instead of intravenously (into the veins).

Park, 69, first joined the three-comma-club in February when its shares jumped about 25% after it announced a licensing deal with drug giant Merck. The licensing deal with Merck is for the rights to use Alteogen's ALT-B4 for the U.S. drug giant's cancer immunotherapy pembrolizumab. The therapy, better known as Keytruda, is the world's top-selling drug and its main patent expires in 2028. Under the deal, Alteogen will receive $20 million upfront and potential milestone payments of as much as $432 million.

Alteogen shares have steadily risen since the Merck deal. ""The U.S. government's policy measures to lower drug prices in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act and expansion of the biosimilar market are driving the need for big pharmas to develop subcutaneous (SC) versions of their original drugs, as well as the need for biosimilar companies to seek differentiation in strategies,"" analysts at Shinhan Securities said in a research note in July.

""Adding to the signing of an exclusive contract with Merck, expansion of the out-licensing deal with Sandoz clearly shows that Alteogen has the business structure to benefit from U.S. policy direction,"" the analysts added.

In July, Alteogen revised a deal with Sandoz, the generics-and-biosimilars division of Swiss drug giant Novartis. The original deal, signed in December 2022, allowed Alteogen to receive milestone payments of up to 184 billion won for licensing its ALT-B4 technology to develop subcutaneous versions of up to three substances. ""The revised contract between the two likely expanded the total to four or five substances, with milestones estimated at 800 billion won to 1 trillion won aside from royalties,"" the Shinhan analysts said in the note. And instead of using ALT-B4 technology, the revised deal is for Alteogen's new technology using hyaluronidase enzyme -- it's the same enzyme linked with the sperm's ability to dissolve the layers of cells and mucus that surround the egg.

And last week, Alteogen announced that it has applied for approval of a drug called EYZANFY as a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly, in South Korea.

In 2008, Park founded Alteogen with his wife, who served as the company's chief strategy officer and holds a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Purdue University. The company listed on the Kosdaq in 2014. Park, who also holds a doctorate in biochemistry from Purdue University, previously worked at LG Life Sciences and Hanwha Petrochemical, and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

To be sure, South Korea's biotech industry has minted a string of new billionaires who could only hold their status for a limited time before tumbling out of the three-comma club when their fortunes faltered. Last year, Chung Yong-ji debuted on the list of Korea's 50 Richest after shares of his Caregen, which claimed one of its powdered supplements helps with diabetes and weight loss, almost quintupled from 2022 to 2023. Chung lost his billionaire status after Cargen's shares slumped 60% in six months. In 2021, Cho Young-sik followed a similar trajectory after he took his Covid-19 test maker, SD Biosensor, public on the Kosdaq that year, but fell off the billionaire ranks in 2023 as investors turned away from the pandemic-fueled stock."
What Does The Bank Rate Freeze Mean For Savers?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/personal-finance/2024/09/19/what-does-the-bank-rate-hold-mean-for-savers/,2024-09-19T13:14:14Z,"If you require any personal advice, please seek such advice from an independently qualified financial advisor.

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held interest rates on 19 September at 5% in welcome news for savers. Bank Rate had been cut to that level from 5.25% in August, following continued evidence of cooling inflation. But its previous 14 rises between December 2021 and August 2023 had produced increasingly better returns on savers' cash.

The next MPC meeting to decide interest rates falls on 7 November 2024. And, with the Federal Exchange reducing its lending rate by 0.5% percentage points to 4.75% in September, a cut for the UK is also looking likely.

But what does this all mean for the nation's savers? We rounded up some market expert opinion.

Mark Hicks, head of active savings at Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""The decision to hold interest rates steady at 5% is good news for savers. Banks and building societies had started to price in the possibility of a cut over the past few days, and if this had materialised, we would have seen others swiftly follow suit.

""However, this good news is unlikely to last. Further cuts later this year are likely to hit the easy access market the most, because those rates remain the most sensitive to Bank Rate. Fixed rates are still the best option for anyone who doesn't need the money close at hand. They offer similar rates to the easy access market, and mean savers can lock in these rates for the entire fixed period.

""As the downward trend in global interest rates is well under way, it will now become a question of how far rates will fall - and at the moment, the end isn't in sight anytime soon.""

Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst, interactive investor, says: ""With interest rates on a downward trajectory, the message to savers is simple: get your skates on and secure the best savings deals while you still can. For those who can afford to lock up their money for at least five years, consider investing for the potential to achieve returns that outstrip both savings rates and inflation.""

Will Davies, chief deposits officer at savings provider Ford Money, adds: ""It's wise for consumers to review their existing accounts and be prepared to ditch and switch if their provider is offering sub-par rates.""

While interest rate cuts are likely to reduce the amount of interest savers earn, it is important to still be mindful of the Personal Savings Allowance (PSA) threshold. Under the PSA, basic rate (20%) taxpayers can earn £1,000 of savings interest a year without paying tax, while higher-rate (40%) taxpayers can earn £500 of interest tax-free.

Additional-rate taxpayers (payable at 45% for those who earn more than £125,140 a year) don't receive the PSA, which means they pay tax on all their savings at their top rate of tax.

Cash individual savings accounts enable savers to stash up to £20,000 a year and earn the interest tax-free."

In a highly-anticipated move, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates for the first time in four years Wednesday, making an aggressive 50-basis-point cut. The move will make borrowing cheaper, including mortgage rates and consumer loans, while companies will reap the benefits of more accessible credit.

MORE: Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average set records minutes after news of the rate cuts, but all three major indexes ended the day slightly negative. The volatility came as Fed chairman Jerome Powell's presser failed to sell investors on the notion the Fed is all-in on a growth-friendly policy pivot.

Hand-held radios used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on Wednesday, a day after at least 12 people were killed when pagers belonging to Hezbollah members detonated. It's still not clear whether Israel -- a major Hezbollah foe whose conflict with the group has escalated in recent months -- was responsible for the explosions.

TOPLINE One of Russia's most compelling entrepreneurial tales has turned into a deadly nightmare. On Wednesday, at least two people died and seven others were injured after a shooting at the Moscow headquarters of Wildberries, Russia's largest online retailer, according to media reports.

Tatyana Bakalchuk, the self-made billionaire who founded Wildberries, the $5.9 billion (sales) retailer comparable to Amazon in the U.S., blamed her estranged husband and cofounder, Vladislav Bakalchuk, who she said led a group of armed people into the e-commerce giant's headquarters in an attempt to seize operations.

""This is a hostile takeover, or rather, an unsuccessful attempt,"" Tatyana, the richest woman in Russia, said in a Telegram post in the hours after the shooting (Forbes translated the post into English). Vladislav, meanwhile, said in his own Telegram post that guards at the Wildberries office fired on him and his security team unprovoked, leaving some of those who joined him wounded.

Wednesday's tragic events appear to be the latest escalation in a monthslong battle between the Bakalchuks, who have been married for at least 20 years, over the future of the e-commerce giant they long ran together. Tatyana left Vladislav in April and then said in July she'd filed for divorce. One month before filing the divorce petition, Wildberries announced its plan to merge with Russ Outdoor, a Russia-based billboard and outdoor advertising operator once owned by billionaire Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

While Tatyana endorsed the merger as a way to grow the Wildberries business, Vladislav came out publicly against the deal. New reporting by Forbes, however, sheds more light on why these tensions may have bubbled over.

In the months since the merger, publicly available documents reveal that Wildberries transferred all its valuable assets into a joint venture with Russ. Russ, meanwhile, transferred nothing, but gained a 35% stake in the new venture.

The result: Russia's richest woman effectively gave away a 35% stake in her company, worth an estimated $3.4 billion.

WHY IT MATTERS ""A former English teacher who built the Russian version of Amazon, Wildberries founder and CEO Tatyana Bakalchuk was one of Russia's greatest entrepreneurial success stories,"" says Forbes staff writer Jemima McEvoy. ""Up until a few months ago, she appeared to manage her business seemingly independently of the Russian government. However, after a merger with a Russian billboard company, the future of her company -- and its continued independence from the Kremlin -- is now in flux.""

The majority of Americans are concerned about non-citizens voting in the 2024 election, a new poll shows. The poll comes as Republicans have amplified the false suggestion that Democrats are allowing migrants into the U.S. to vote for them, although there is no evidence to support these claims:

51%: The share of American adults concerned about non-citizens voting in the upcoming election

1,634: The number of non-citizens who attempted to register to vote between 1997 and 2022, but none actually voted, according to an audit by Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger

39%: The share of Scripps/Ipsos poll respondents who said immigration is the most important issue facing the country, second only to inflation

In response to Wednesday's decision on the federal funds rate, banks will also adjust their interest rates, which could cut into the growth potential of savings accounts. To prepare, review the interest rates on your current savings accounts -- online banks often provide higher yields. Also consider high-yield savings accounts, or explore money market accounts or certificates of deposit. Regardless of market conditions, automating your savings can help ensure you stay disciplined.

Why The Fed's Lower Rates Will Boost Small Business Earnings,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rohitarora/2024/09/19/why-the-feds-lower-rates-will-boost-small-business-earnings/,2024-09-19T10:11:47Z,"The Federal Reserve's intention to slash interest rates at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Sept. 18, was perhaps the worst kept secret in America. However, the extent of the cut was a source of speculation until Chair Jerome Powell announced a half-percent (50 bps) drop in the Federal Funds rate Wednesday afternoon.

The long-anticipated cut, larger than the typical quarter-percent (25 bps) drop, was the first since the Fed started raising rates in 2022 to curb skyrocketing inflation.

The move came after a split vote at the Fed's scheduled two-day FOMC meeting on Sept. 17-18 and brings the central bank's benchmark interest rate down to a new range of 4.75%-5.0%. For more than a year since July 2023, rates have been stuck at the upper range of 5.5%. The figure was the highest seen in more than two decades.

""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,"" Chair Powell reported. ""Inflation has made further progress toward the (FOMC) Committee's 2% objective but remains somewhat elevated.""

Inflation has slowed throughout 2024. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first half of the year, and data points to a similar rate of growth this quarter. Chair Powell explained that the economic outlook is uncertain, and the FOMC is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping inflation low.

""In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5%,"" he said at his press conference in Washington. ""In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.""

This could mean additional rate cuts in 2024 and perhaps even into 2025. In assessing its next interest rate move, the Fed will take into account a wide range of information, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures and expectations, and financial market and international developments.

What it means for small businesses

The interest rate cuts could lead to increased lending appetite among traditional lenders, as lower interest rates help rebalance their portfolios. This could result in more borrowers qualifying for bank loans, which typically come with more favorable rates than non-bank lenders offer.

Lower interest rates will lead to reduced interest payments for small business owners. Most small business loans are variable rate loans, and the steady stream of rate hikes initiated by the Fed increased the cost of loan repayments, thereby hurting their earnings. Reduced interest payments for businesses should positively impact their earnings in the short term. Mortgages, in contrast, are often fixed rate, which shields homeowners from enduring the cost of rising interest rates.

Additionally, lower interest rates will lead to reduced interest payments for consumers, which should help improve the country's overall economic health. Consumers are hurting badly with all the credit card delinquency and with auto loan delinquency at record levels.

During his press conference, Chair Powell said the U.S. economy is in good shape; it is growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down, and the labor market is strong. This is good news for small business owners whose earnings have been hurt by inflationary costs, as well as high interest rates over the past two years.

One note of caution, however: while short-term earnings may benefit from lower interest rates, the long-term effects on the economy and potential structural changes remain uncertain.

The Fed's decision to cut rates is seen as a bet, and the next few months will reveal whether it leads to a soft landing or a more significant economic impact. Inflation is driven by numerous factors, and the outcome will depend on whether money supply increases lead to higher core inflation or if core inflation remains unchanged. In the coming months, the Fed will no doubt assess the effectiveness of the rate cuts and their impact on the economy to make adjustments accordingly."
Want To Be Rich? Then Avoid These 7 Costly Mistakes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/09/19/want-to-be-rich-then-avoid-these-7-costly-mistakes/,2024-09-19T10:11:28Z,"When building wealth, there's often more focus on what we should be doing, like saving and investing, but less on what we shouldn't be doing. The road to financial freedom is paved not only with the right actions but also with avoiding mistakes that can cost you valuable time and money.

Wishing for wealth is easy, but it's having a plan that turns dreams into reality. Without a clear, actionable plan, you risk aimlessly moving through life without understanding where your money is going or how to maximize it. Set clear financial goals, whether it's to grow your business, invest in real estate, or save for retirement. Without a roadmap, you're leaving your financial future to chance.

The more money you make, the more you may want to spend. This phenomenon, known as lifestyle inflation, can quietly eat away at your wealth. Upgrading your car, buying a bigger house, or splurging on luxury goods can seem harmless since you're earning more. However, these small lifestyle upgrades can add up, keeping you stuck in the same financial position despite increased income.

One of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs and high-income earners make is overpaying taxes. While taxes are inevitable, paying more than necessary isn't. Smart tax planning can make a huge difference in your overall financial picture. Make use of tax-advantaged accounts, claim all possible deductions, and stay on top of tax law changes. If taxes aren't your forte, invest in a CPA or tax advisor to ensure you're maximizing your savings.

If you're relying solely on your business income or savings account to build wealth, that might be a mistake. Inflation will eat away at the value of your savings, making it harder to grow your wealth over time. Investing is a smarter approach because it allows your money to work for you, generating returns that can outpace inflation. Whether through stocks, real estate, or other investment vehicles, diversifying your investments is key to building a more stable and prosperous financial future.

One of the biggest mistakes many people make is relying on a single source of income. If you're serious about becoming wealthy, diversifying your income streams is crucial. Multiple income streams not only protect you in case one dries up but also accelerate your path to financial freedom. Start thinking about how you can add additional revenue to your business or create passive income through investments.

One of the most dangerous mistakes you can make is assuming that what you don't know won't hurt you. In reality, ignorance is costly. Financial education is key to making informed decisions, whether it's managing your business finances, investing wisely, or creating tax-efficient wealth-building strategies. Commit to continuously educating yourself about money and read books, take courses, and learn from experts.

Fear is one of the biggest barriers to wealth. Whether it's the fear of failure, fear of judgment, or fear of taking risks, letting fear dictate your decisions can cost you greatly. Building wealth requires calculated risks, and while you won't always succeed, you'll learn from every failure. The most successful entrepreneurs and wealthy individuals have one thing in common: they weren't afraid to take bold steps toward their financial goals.

The bottom line is that building wealth requires more than just earning money; it's about being intentional with your actions, avoiding costly mistakes, and learning from every misstep. By having a plan, investing wisely, and continuously educating yourself, you'll be well on your way to a richer, more financially secure future. Remember, avoiding these mistakes could mean the difference between simply getting by and truly thriving."
Winners And Losers From The Fed's Interest Rate Decision,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/winners-and-losers-from-the-feds-interest-rate-decision/,2024-09-19T09:49:13Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The Federal Reserve just cut interest rates by 50 basis points, citing cooling inflation and signs of economic slowdown. This is the first time rates have been adjusted since July 2023, which ended a long streak of raising rates to tame inflation.

The latest Fed rate cut will shake things up for consumers -- some folks will score, while others might take a hit.

""If you have more money in the form of debt than you do in savings, then on balance, you will benefit from rate cuts,"" says Stephen Foerster, professor of finance at Ivey Business School, Western University. ""But it's more nuanced. A lot depends on whether you currently have locked-in borrowing or savings rates.""

With the latest rate cut in play, it may be time to reassess your finances. Here's a breakdown of who stands to gain, who could face setbacks and what you can do to make the most of this shift.

Consumers with big credit card debt stand to gain the most from a rate cut, especially those with variable rates, says Mayra Rodríguez Valladares, a bank and capital markets risk consultant at MRV Associates and former Federal Reserve Bank of New York analyst.

However, with average credit card interest rates sitting at well over 20%, a 0.5% drop is unlikely to make a big difference.

Credit card interest rates skyrocketed from 12.9% in 2013 to 22.8% in 2023, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) report. While the Fed's rate changes affect credit card rates, nearly half of this increase is due to credit card companies raising their own fees (known as the APR margin) to boost profits.

So, you may be disappointed if you're expecting a sizable drop in your monthly payment. Consider transferring your debt to a balance transfer card with a 0% introductory APR to avoid sky-high credit card interest rates, which are currently hovering around 27.9% as of September 19.

A rate cut could ease auto loan costs, but past trends suggest only minor savings.

Like credit cards, auto loan rates follow the federal funds rate closely, meaning car loan costs rise quickly when the Fed raises rates. However, when the Fed lowers rates, the relief for borrowers is slower and less noticeable, making rate hikes more immediately impactful than rate cuts.

From 2014 to 2024, auto loan rates for new car 48-month loans closely tracked the movement of the federal funds rate, with a noticeable lag when rates are cut.

In 2016, as the Fed hiked rates to 0.41%, auto loan rates rose from 4.25% to 4.45%. Similarly, in 2023, as the Fed raised rates aggressively to 5.33%, auto loan rates surged to 8.30% by August.

However, when the Fed slashed rates during the pandemic in 2020, auto loan rates dropped only modestly to 5.13% from 5.29%, despite the Fed rate falling to 0.05%. This shows that consumers feel the burden of higher rates much faster than the relief when rates are cut, impacting monthly auto loan payments.

While the recent rate cut might give you a slight advantage, you have the power to influence the auto loan rate you secure. Start by improving your credit scores -- better credit typically means lower interest rates. Be sure to shop around, comparing offers from banks, credit unions and online lenders to find the best deal. Don't buy more car than you can comfortably afford. And, if possible, make a larger down payment to reduce your loan size and land a more favorable rate.

When interest rates drop, both bondholders and stockholders benefit. Bondholders see a rise in bond prices as lower interest rates make their existing bonds more valuable. Stockholders gain because lower rates increase the present value of future cash flows, boosting stock prices.

""For bondholders, there's an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates,"" Foerster says.

That's because when interest rates go down, the value of older bonds with higher interest rates goes up. For example, if you have a 10-year bond paying 6% interest, and new bonds are now offering only 5.5% interest, your bond becomes more valuable because it pays more. This means you could sell it for a higher price than what you paid.

While the Fed doesn't directly set mortgage rates, its moves often influence them. Mortgage lenders typically adjust their rates based on expectations of Fed policy changes, so recent mortgage rate drops already reflect the September rate cut.

If the Fed continues to cut rates, as many experts forecast they will, then mortgage rates may continue to fall, making homebuying more affordable in the coming months -- although rates are unlikely to hit the lows we saw in 2020 and 2021.

It could also mean homeowners are more willing to sell their homes, says Clayton Gardner, CEO of Titan, a wealth management firm.

""Homeowners who purchased during the pandemic period have been hesitant to sell and give up their cheap mortgages,"" Gardner says. ""We expect that Fed rate cuts should help further increase the housing supply, which in turn should lower (home) prices.""

A lower fed funds rate could benefit homeowners looking to refinance by making mortgage rates cheaper. This could lead to lower monthly payments and long-term savings for those able to lock in a new, reduced interest rate on their mortgages.

Remember to factor in closing costs. According to Freddie Mac, the average closing costs for a refinance are about $5,000, but the exact amount depends on the size of your loan and where you live, including your state and county.

For refinancing to make sense, you should figure out how long it will take to recoup the closing costs in monthly savings to determine if it's worthwhile. If you plan on selling your home in the near future, a refinance may not make sense if the rate is not significantly lower.

For example, if you have a 30-year $300,000 mortgage at 7%, your monthly payment would be around $1,995. By refinancing to a 6.25% rate, your new monthly payment would drop to about $1,847, saving you roughly $148 per month. Over a year, you'd save about $1,776; over the full term of the loan, you'd save around $53,280. That means you would need to stay in your home for almost three years to break even if closing costs are $5,000.

You can use a mortgage rate calculator to see if refinancing is a good idea.

Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) could get cheaper now that the Fed cut rates. This happens because ARMs are often tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which closely follows the Fed's rate changes.

When the Fed raises or lowers the Fed Funds Rate, the SOFR typically moves in the same direction. As a result, ARM rates adjust during their reset periods based on these changes. So, if the Fed lowers rates, your ARM's interest rate is likely to dip when it's time for the next adjustment, which means lower monthly payments.

The most common ARM, a 5/1 ARM, has a fixed rate for the first five years, and then adjusts once a year for the remainder of the loan.

If the Fed cuts rates, your savings account interest will likely follow -- just not as quickly. That means your money won't grow as fast, so now's the time to rethink your savings strategy.

In 2019, the federal funds rate was around 2.4%, and the average savings rate for a typical bank savings account hovered around 0.19%.

By contrast, in 2020, as the Fed dropped rates to near 0% to stimulate the economy during the pandemic, savings rates also fell, though the average interest rate for bank savings accounts was 0.12%.

Consider moving your cash into higher-yield accounts like CDs or money market accounts, which often adjust more slowly to rate cuts.

If you're comfortable with a little more risk, you could also look into investments like bonds, which tend to perform better when rates fall. While savings rates won't drop instantly, acting soon can help you secure better returns on your hard-earned cash before they dip even further.

Lower rates typically encourage spending and investment, giving the economy a short-term boost. Businesses may take out loans to expand, which can create jobs and increase consumer spending.

""If a corporation has lower financing costs, then that will lower its overall cost of capital. The hurdle rate on new projects will be lower, which can lead to higher profits going forward, and potentially more hiring associated with increased demand,"" Foerster says. ""The potential effect on wages would be longer-term, depending on how tight the labor market is.""

The risks? If rates remain too low for too long, it can spur inflation and eroding purchasing power. Additionally, people may take on excessive debt due to cheap borrowing, increasing financial risks down the line.

A Fed rate cut is a double-edged sword, offering relief to borrowers while putting pressure on savers. Consumers should be strategic -- borrow wisely, invest carefully and protect their savings by considering alternatives like high-yield bonds or stocks."
10 undecided voters explain why they haven't picked a side in this election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/nx-s1-5118393/undecided-voters-kamala-harris-donald-trump,2024-09-19T09:07:33Z,"People watch the presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump during a debate watch party at Penn Social on Sept. 10 in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption

Most people have decided who they are going to vote for. Former President Donald Trump is well known and polarizing -- people either love him or hate him. Vice President Harris is famous, but voters say they don't know her as well.

Polls show an incredibly tight race between them, and a handful of swing voters could decide the election, depending on who they vote for or if they decide to stay home.

Only a tiny slice of the electorate is considered persuadable -- anywhere from 6% or less to the low teens.

There were nearly four dozen undecided voters in the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll in the last four months who gave permission to call them back to follow up. To understand their current thinking and motivations, NPR tried them all and got in touch with 10 by phone in the days following the Harris-Trump debate. What we found was notable.

First, the debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern. Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.

Many did not want to use their full names; some didn't want us to use any name at all. They cited security concerns. They said in this political environment, they were apprehensive about giving out too much personally identifiable information.

Here's what they had to say:

On the debate, Brady said, ""Kamala [Harris] did a better job articulating her points, obviously.""

He added: ""I don't want to go through another four years of a Trump presidency.""

But his vote is largely contingent on his personal financial situation, and he noted, ""Things have gotten more expensive.""

""I have probably a middle-class income for my family,"" he said, ""and it doesn't feel like it's getting any easier -- even as my wife and I have advanced in our careers.""

Brady said he aligned more with former President Barack Obama, and said he doesn't ""like her policies"" on the economy.

Asked what specifically he doesn't like, he said, ""I can't say I'm super knowledgeable about the specifics, but from a how-our-family-is-feeling standpoint, just not sure.""

Lee did not like how ABC handled the debate, specifically the fact-checking. He felt the moderators ""teamed up on Trump.""

He felt Harris did almost too well, saying it was ""almost like rehearsed."" But he said he ""never got any message from Harris"" and said she ""skirted issues,"" including the Biden administration's ""inability to stop the flow of migrants"" and the economy.

""Trump stuck his foot in his mouth multiple times,"" Lee said, though.

He said he wanted to see Trump, whom he trusts more on the economy, debate again and was unaware that Trump had said he would not do another debate with Harris. When told that, Lee said he was ""disappointed.""

He said he's ""not a big Republican, not a big Democrat."" He voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont, in the 2016 primary and is now leaning toward Trump, independent Cornel West or the Green Party's Jill Stein (not from an environmental standpoint, however, because he thinks the Green New Deal ""went too far"").

""But I don't want to piss away my vote,"" he said, pointing out that he is leaning most toward Trump because of that.

Of the debate, the respondent said, ""I was like, OK, who are these people? They were like bad actors. Kamala, suddenly she was so articulate when it's usually word salad. There was something weird going on there.""

Trump, on the other hand, she said, it was like ""something was in his water,"" and he wasn't his usual self.

She said this of her ideal ticket: ""If RFK [Jr.] was on the ticket with [former Rep.] Tulsi Gabbard [of Hawaii], it would have been a slam dunk for me.""

Of Trump and Harris, she said: ""I am reluctant to vote for Trump, but I have absolutely no confidence about Kamala Harris' ability to do anything about the border at all. We're suffering for it.""

She said she didn't vote in the 2020 election, and that she doesn't trust Trump fully, because he signed the CARES act, a COVID relief bill.

""He is aesthetically lacking,"" she said, laughing, but ""the major Trump haters are missing the whole point. They're not looking at issues; they're looking at personality.""

Proffitt did not see the debate or follow news about it afterward. She said she voted for Trump in 2016 and did not vote for president in 2020. But she is resolved to do so this time.

""I'm going to go out and will vote this year,"" said Proffitt, a mother of five. ""It's a right I should exercise. I want to show my kids that's a right.""

Of the candidates, she said she doesn't know much at this point about Harris' policy positions, but she is leaning her direction because of Trump.

""I feel Trump's disrespect for women is not befitting of a president,"" she said. ""He is not someone I want my girls to look up to as a role model.""

About Harris, she added: ""She's a woman, and maybe having a female president would do the country some good. ... I gave the other guy a try, why not give her a try?""

A Republican and former interior decorator and rancher, Bohlman said she made the switch to vote Democratic when Trump came on the scene.

""No, I have not voted for Trump, nor will I ever,"" Bohlman said. ""I have never been able to stand the guy since he came into the picture years ago. I even took a book away from my 16-year-old son that [Trump] had written about making money. He didn't make his money; he inherited it and lost it. He's not a good businessman. He's not anything but a narcissistic misogynist.""

She was undecided in May, but is now locked in for Harris. She said she saw the debate and thought Harris performed well.

""I will vote Democrat,"" Bohlman said. ""I will vote for Kamala. I liked the way she came across in the debate. She is a very astute, intelligent woman, who knows exactly where she's going. She doesn't hinge her judgment on whether she likes someone or not.""

She went on to cite the overturning of Roe v. Wade abortion protections, which she blames squarely on Trump, as another motivating factor for her to vote for Harris.

""I am so angry about that,"" she said of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. ""It's so unfair that a bunch of men are making decisions for women. I think it's horrific.""

Bohlman also brought up the siege at the Capitol on Jan. 6, which she said was ""appalling,"" called out GOP leaders' hypocrisy in criticizing Trump initially and then trying to get back in his good graces, and she noted that she has lots of family members who are ""adamantly pro-Trump.""

""They do not look at the whole picture,"" she said of Trump supporters. ""I'm sure after this second [assassination] attempt, they'll be saying, 'God is protecting him.' It's just a bunch of crock.""

Annette is a registered independent who generally votes Democratic. In June, she was undecided if she would vote at all because she was concerned about President Biden's age and ability to do the job.

""I didn't realize how bad he was,"" Annette said after watching Biden in the June 27 debate. ""He lost his oomph. He made Trump look good.""

But now, she is enthusiastically backing Harris.

""I would never vote for him,"" Annette said of Trump. She called herself ""happily surprised, maybe not surprised, but happy with [Harris'] presentation"" at the debate. Annette said Harris proved she's ""perfectly capable.""

Remensnyder is a registered independent, but described herself as a ""Republican at heart.""

""I really liked Nikki Haley,"" Remensnyder said. ""I was hoping she would run [as the Republican nominee].""

The retired audiologist voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. Remensnyder said she owned three doctors' practices. As a business owner, she said, ""I thought I could trust Trump. He was a businessman, but he was an absolute disaster"" from the start, Remensnyder said.

And ""as a medical professional,"" she said she thought ""what he did with COVID was embarrassing.""

But this time around, Remensnyder said she was ""despondent"" at the choice between Biden and Trump. She felt Biden's mental fitness had declined too much to do the job any longer.

""I couldn't trust him to run the government. ... It really scared me,"" she said.

When Harris entered, Remensnyder gave her a shot.

""I watched her,"" she said. ""I listened to her. I am a woman, and women's needs are first, even before party.""

Remensnyder is pro-abortion rights and said she liked how Harris has advocated for women's reproductive freedom, and she liked Harris' experience as a litigator.

Remensnyder said she thought Harris did fairly well in the debate, but ""did not answer most of the questions. She did skirt the issues. I don't think she's the best. I really, really wanted Nikki Haley.""

But she added that she is ""confident"" in Harris' ability to do the job, though not confident she will win because of the clear gender divide she sees. Remensnyder said her husband and son are conservative and tell her they are leaving the presidential line on the ballot blank.

""They can't force themselves to vote Democratic,"" she said.

A college student born in Brazil, he described himself as a progressive whose top issue is the war in Gaza.

""Donald Trump won't get my vote,"" Thiago said, pointing out that Trump's position on the war is a nonstarter.

After Biden dropped out, he was waiting to see what Harris would do, but Thiago said her posture on Gaza ""hasn't been a great one.""

""I'm still undecided whether it's worth it to vote for Kamala, given her not-great stance on Palestine,"" Thiago said, ""and given she's reaching out more to conservatives than more-progressive members of her party.""

He watched the debate and said Trump was ""off the ball in the same way Biden seemed entirely way too old and needing to step aside. Trump seemed to inherit that and seemed rattled by Kamala.""

Even if you're on Trump's side, Thiago said, it was ""obvious"" that ""Trump didn't do great in that debate.""

Thiago said he's still going to vote down-ballot, but short of Harris saying she will cut off weapons shipments to Israel, he likely will leave the presidential line blank.

A registered Republican, Gideon voted for Trump in 2016, but didn't vote for him in 2020 ""because of some of the choices he made."" He didn't specify which ones.

Of Trump and Harris: ""They both have their challenges.""

But he won't be voting for Harris. ""I understand her economic plan,"" he said, ""but her liberalism is a little bit too liberal.""

Gideon added: ""This might be a situation where neither one of them gets my vote.""

John is a registered independent originally from Nassau County, N.Y., and has a blue-collar background as the son of a firefighter. He considers himself a ""liberal union Democrat."" He voted for Obama twice, even volunteered to ""work the phones,"" he said, and thought former President Bill Clinton ""did a great job as president.""

He did not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of a personal experience; she didn't show to an event he was involved with planning. In 2020, he said his son, who was 5 then, essentially cast his ballot for Biden, because he wanted to vote for him.

John said he's not following the current presidential race that much, but did watch ""a little bit"" of the debate. His biggest concerns are housing affordability, groceries and gas prices.

""Trump was cuckoo for saying that the dogs and cats were being eaten,"" John said, ""but Kamala Harris wasn't really answering any of the questions,"" especially about the economy.

John said he wants to see something put forward to ""stop the inflation."" John also doesn't trust Harris (mispronouncing her name as ""Camilla"" at one point) because of her changed positions on things like fracking.

""I think Joe Biden did the best he could,"" John said. ""If he could have just grabbed the horns on inflation -- things are through the roof. ... It's gone freakin' nuts."""
60 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/60-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-09-19T04:13:51Z,"Fox News host Jesse Watters asks how Vice President Kamala Harris is different from President Biden as he accuses her of bombing her first solo interview since becoming Democrats' 2024 candidate on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' (Courtesy: ABC News)

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 60 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Under pressure to sit down for a substantive interview after weeks of stonewalling, Harris finally ended her interview drought last month in Georgia when she was joined by running mate Tim Walz for a pre-taped piece with CNN's Dana Bash that was a far cry from a traditional press conference. She's done more interviews since, including on Tuesday with the National Association of Black Journalists.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August last week in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris sat for two taped radio interviews last week, and she gave her first solo television interview as the Democratic nominee on Friday in Philadelphia. She also sat for a radio interview on Monday that aired Tuesday.

As for when she'll actually do a formal press conference, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

Trump has sought to highlight the contrast in media availability between the two, sitting for several lengthy interviews in recent weeks, in addition to his three news conferences.

In her interview on Friday in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

"As The Corporate Transparency Act Deadline Creeps Closer, FinCEN Updates Guidance",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/09/18/as-the-corporate-transparency-act-deadline-creeps-closer-fincen-updates-guidance/,2024-09-19T02:56:20Z,"The Corporate Transparency Act -- or CTA -- requires reporting companies to file reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The deadline for some companies to file is fast approaching -- and some might have already passed. To help companies comply, FinCEN has been rolling out guidance, including new FAQ information posted as of September 10, 2024. Here's what you need to know.

As of January 1, 2024, many companies were required to report information to the U.S. government about who ultimately owns and controls them. This is the result of a 2021 law, the Corporate Transparency Act -- or CTA -- which requires reporting companies to file reports with FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

Companies required to report are called reporting companies. Your company may be a reporting company and need to report information about its beneficial owners if your company is a corporation, a limited liability company (LLC), or other entity created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office in the U.S., or a foreign company formed under the law of a foreign country that has registered to do business in the U.S. by filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office.

A domestic entity like a statutory trust, business trust, or foundation is a reporting company if it was created by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office. The specifics of whether certain entity types, such as trusts, require filing a document with the secretary of state or similar office to be created or registered depend on state law.

There are several exemptions. In fact, 23 types of entities are exempt from the reporting requirements for beneficial ownership information (BOI). These entities include publicly traded companies, nonprofits, and certain large operating companies. You can check FinCEN's Small Entity Compliance Guide for a checklist that may help determine whether your company qualifies for an exemption.

A beneficial owner is an individual who either directly or indirectly exercises substantial control over the reporting company or owns or controls at least 25% of the reporting company's ownership interests (examples include shares of equity, stock, voting rights, or any other mechanism used to establish ownership).

FinCEN says that an individual can exercise substantial control over a reporting company in four different ways:

The report must identify the company, including its legal name and any trade names, ""doing business as"" (d/b/a), or ""trading as"" (t/a) names, as well as the physical address of the company (no post office boxes), jurisdiction of formation or registration, and Taxpayer Identification Number (if a foreign reporting company has not been issued a TIN, include a tax identification number issued by a foreign jurisdiction).

The report must also include four pieces of information about each of its beneficial owners: name, date of birth, address, and a unique identifying number and issuing jurisdiction from an acceptable identification document (and a scanned image of the document) -- that could include a driver's license or passport.

If a company has to report a company applicant, the report will also include the company applicant's name, date of birth, address, and an identifying number from an acceptable identification document (and a scanned image of the document), like a passport or U.S. driver's license. If the company applicant works in corporate formation -- for example, as an attorney or corporate formation agent -- the reporting company must report the company applicant's business address. Otherwise, the reporting company must report the company applicant's home address.

No financial information or details about the business purpose or operation of the company are required.

An initial BOI report should only include the beneficial owners at the time of filing -- there's no need to report earlier owners. However, moving forward, reporting companies should notify FinCEN of changes to beneficial owners and related BOI through updated reports. (Keep reading.)

You'll file online. Click over to the FinCEN website and select ""File BOIR.""

FinCEN has also prepared a video with instructions:

A reporting company created or registered to do business before January 1, 2024, will have until January 1, 2025, to file its initial report. This is true even if the company was created years before 2024.

A reporting company created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, will have 90 calendar days after receiving notice of the company's creation or registration to file its initial report -- the clock starts to run when the company receives actual notice that its creation or registration is effective or after a secretary of state or similar office provides public notice of its creation or registration, whichever is earlier.

Reporting companies created or registered on or after January 1, 2025, will have 30 calendar days from the date of actual or public notice that the company's creation or registration is effective to file their initial reports with FinCEN.

The date of creation or registration for a reporting company is the earlier of the date on which the reporting company receives actual notice of its creation (or registration) or when a secretary of state or similar office first provides public notice, such as through a publicly accessible registry, that the reporting company has been created (or registered).

You could have. April 1, 2024, is the first possible beneficial ownership information filing deadline for companies created or registered in 2024. That's the first possible 90-day mark (for corporations created on January 1, 2024).

Most companies fall under the existing reporting companies deadline -- those created or registered to do business in the U.S. before January 1, 2024, must file by January 1, 2025 -- that's not that far away.

You only have to file an initial report once. This isn't an annual report.

However, if you have any updates or corrections to information you previously filed with FinCEN, you must submit those

changes within 30 days. Those changes could include registering a new business name, a change in beneficial owners (like a new CEO or a change in ownership interest), or any change to a beneficial owner's name, address, or unique identifying number previously provided. If a beneficial owner obtained a new driver's license or other identifying document that includes a changed name, address, or identifying number, the reporting company would have to file an updated report, including an image of the new identifying document.

If a reporting company ceased to exist as a legal entity before January 1, 2024 -- meaning that it entirely completed the process of formally and irrevocably dissolving -- it was never subject to the reporting requirements and is not required to report to FinCEN. That's true for domestic and foreign companies.

However, reporting companies created or registered in 2024 must report even if they wound up their affairs, ceased conducting business, and entirely completed the process of formally and irrevocably dissolving before their initial beneficial ownership reports are due. And reporting companies created or registered in 2025 or later, no matter how quickly they stopped doing business, must also report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN.

Anyone authorized to act on behalf of the company may file a report even after the reporting company ceases to exist. That means if a reporting company ceases to exist before the window for reporting closes, it should make arrangements to have the report submitted on its behalf, even if the requisite filing does not occur until after it ceases to exist. The report should reflect the beneficial ownership information before the reporting company ceases to exist. In other words, failing to exist isn't an excuse for failing to report.

If a reporting company files an initial report and then ceases to exist before the window closes, there is no requirement to file an additional report with FinCEN, noting that the company has ceased to exist.

A company is not required to report its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN if it ceased to exist as a legal entity before January 1, 2024, meaning that it entirely completed the process of formally and irrevocably dissolving.

The same is true for a foreign company. For reporting purposes, a foreign reporting company ceases to be registered to do business in the United States when it entirely completes the process of formally and irrevocably withdrawing its registration(s) to do business there.

FinCEN says that to determine when a company withdraws its registration to do business, consult the law of the jurisdiction in which the company was registered. A company that is administratively suspended from conducting business -- because, for example, it failed to pay a filing fee or comply with certain jurisdictional requirements -- generally does not cease to be registered to conduct business unless the suspension becomes permanent.

Only reporting companies created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, must report company applicants.

A company that must report its company applicants will have only up to two individuals who could qualify as company applicants:

No, unless a sole proprietorship was created (or, if a foreign sole proprietorship, registered to do business) in the U.S. by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office. Filing a document with a government agency to obtain an IRS employer identification number, a fictitious business name, or a professional or occupational license does not create a new entity and does not make a sole proprietorship filing such a document a reporting company.

Yes. A S-Corp that qualifies as a reporting company must comply with the reporting requirements. An S-Corp's pass-through structure for tax purposes does not affect its BOI reporting obligations, nor does it qualify an S-Corp as a ""tax-exempt entity"" under FinCEN BOI reporting regulations.

No. It doesn't matter who you've already filed a report with -- reporting companies must report beneficial ownership information directly to FinCEN.

There's no fee to file the report with FinCEN. However, if you retain a tax or legal professional to help you file, you'll be responsible for paying those fees.

Harris and Trump deadlocked in Pennsylvania as former president trails in other 'blue wall' states: poll,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-deadlocked-pennsylvania-former-president-trails-other-blue-wall-states-poll,2024-09-19T02:13:04Z,"Former President Trump, at a large rally on Long Island, vows 'we are going to win New York.' No Republican has carried the state in a presidential election in 40 years.

With fewer than 47 days until the November election, Vice President Harris and former President Trump are tied with likely voters in Pennsylvania, which could be the state to decide the contest on Election Day.

Trump and Harris each garnered 49% of likely voters in the Keystone State, per a new Marist Poll.

Furthermore, 90% of likely voters who said they had a candidate preference also reported strongly supporting them.

GOP SENS CALL ON SCHUMER, DEMS TO TAKE UP BORDER BILLS AS THEY TOUT IMMIGRATION VIGILANCE

""Pennsylvania is attracting the most attention of the Rust Belt states from the presidential candidates and with good reason,"" said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""It's the biggest prize in the region and the most competitive. Winning Pennsylvania doesn't guarantee the White House, but it goes a long way.""

In two other so-called ""blue wall"" states, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris topped Trump in the survey.

The vice president is up five points in Michigan, 52% to Trump's 47%. However, the margin is razor-thin in Wisconsin, where she only beat him by one point, 50% to 49%.

According to Miringoff, ""of the three so-called blue wall states, Michigan is the one where there is a difference between Harris and Trump.""

SECRET SERVICE TOLD LOCALS THEY WOULD 'TAKE CARE OF' BUILDING USED BY THOMAS CROOKS TO SHOOT TRUMP

""The Michigan vote is being driven by Trump's high negatives with Vance certainly providing no help for the GOP ticket,"" Miringoff added, referencing the 53% of Michigan likely voters that view Trump unfavorably.

Inflation was the top issue for most Pennsylvanians by far, with one-third saying so. Despite it being a campaign priority for Democrats across the country, abortion was the fourth most likely to be a top issue for voters, at just 11%. It was beaten by immigration at 15%, and preserving democracy, which garnered 27%.

The top issue breakdown among Wisconsin voters was similar to that of Pennsylvania, but in Michigan, the issue of preserving Democracy proved to be the most important for the greatest number of voters.

At 30%, the most likely Michigan voters cited it as such. Inflation was close behind, at 29%. Immigration followed at 15%, while abortion received 10%.

In all three states, an at least 20-point gender gap exists between Harris and Trump, with men breaking more often for the former president and women tending to choose Harris.

While the gap exists for both of them, Trump's woes with women seem to loom larger than Harris' issue with men. Trump's gap is particularly wide with women in Michigan, where Harris leads him by the most. In the state, the distance between Harris and Trump among likely women voters is 15 points.

The close polls come as Trump seems to be losing his edge in two critical states, according to the most recent Fox News Power Rankings. Both North Carolina and Georgia, which were once considered Republican strongholds, are now rated toss-ups in the presidential race.

CNN's Bash says you could 'start a drinking game' for every time Harris uses the same talking points,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-bash-says-you-could-start-drinking-game-every-time-harris-uses-same-talking-points,2024-09-19T01:28:41Z,"CNN's Dana Bash and Semafor's David Weigel reacted to Vice President Harris' answers about her economic plan.

CNN's Dana Bash joked that you could play ""a drinking game"" every time Vice President Kamala Harris returns to her same talking points on the economy.

""When you listen to Kamala Harris on what she will do, you can almost start a drinking game every time she says 'small businesses','"" Bash told a CNN panel on Wednesday.

Bash played a clip of Harris speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Philadelphia on Tuesday about her economic plan, where Harris reiterated her proposal to expand the tax credit for new small business owners from $5,000 to $50,000.

""She also talks about being a middle-class kid. That's also the front of her answers,"" Semafor reporter David Weigel told Bash, as another example of her repeating talking points.

HARRIS SERVES UP WORD SALAD IN DC SPEECH: 'THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY'

Weigel suggested Harris leans on her rhetoric because she doesn't ""have an answer"" to voters' most pressing concerns about prices.

""If you look at the interviews they've been doing in local media, and they've opened up a bit more since the debate, the first question is often, 'what are you going to do to lower prices?' Which is a very hard question for an incumbent party to answer. And it has implications that are very Trumpian,"" he continued. ""It is: Trump says he's going to do mass deportation, that'll decrease demand. Trump says he'll explore more energy, that'll decrease energy costs.""

""Democrats can point to the fact that inflation is actually- it was bad two years ago. It's not now,"" Weigel said. ""What people want to hear is how do you make the prices go down? So everything she says is something realistic that could survive a fact check that answers a very hard question.""

""There is not a plan to say that we're going to lower the cost of your grocery bill to what it was in 2019. There was a pandemic. There was money supply inflation. You can't hit the button that makes that go away. But Trump has an answer that gets them through these questions. And Harris, I think, with a different set of incentives and a different relationship to something she can back up in a policy paper, she doesn't have an answer. So she goes to a larger, well, imagine a future where there are more businesses and this starts to ameliorate,"" he continued.

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS IT'S A 'DOUBLE STANDARD' TO ASK HARRIS ABOUT HER POLICIES

During her first solo TV interview since becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris gave a lengthy response about her ""middle-class"" upbringing when asked what ""specific"" plans she has to bring down prices for Americans.

She concluded her answer by bringing up her plan to expand the tax credit for new small business owners.

Harris has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from the current 21%.

Her campaign also reportedly told Marc Goldwein, vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Budget, that it supports all tax increases on high earners proposed by President Biden for the 2025 fiscal year.

During an address Wednesday at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 47th Annual Leadership Conference in Washington, D.C., Harris provided few specific details about the policies she would enact as president.

At one point, Harris spoke about providing families with the necessary resources so that parents can ""raise their children well,"" though she did not say what resources or how they would be provided.

""I grew up understanding the children of the community are the children of the community, and we should all have a vested interest in ensuring that children can go grow up with the resources that they need to achieve their God-given potential,"" the VP said.

Harris also appeared to undercut her own proposed policy to institute a federal price-fixing plan for corporations, telling the crowd that ""very few"" corporations actually ""jack up prices"" for consumers in emergencies."
The Fed's Half Percentage Point Rate Cut Could Mean Worry,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2024/09/18/the-feds-half-percentage-point-rate-cut-could-mean-worry/,2024-09-19T00:28:30Z,"The focus for weeks on the Federal Reserve's rate cut today has been on how large it would be. A quarter of a percent? Half a percent? Now we know it's the latter. The question is what that means for the economy and expectations of the near future.

During the central bank's annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in late August, Chair Jerome Powell made two things clear in his remarks. One was that the ""time has come for policy to adjust."" In other words, a first rate cut would start in September. The amount wasn't clear.

His other point: ""It seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon,"" Powell said. ""We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.""

The formulation was due to the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining price stability and also full employment. Inflation has already been on a path down toward the central bank's 2% target. The last year-over-year inflation figure from the Consumer Price Index was 2.5%.

The labor market, though, has given concerns to many. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised job market reports from April 2023 to March 2024 by a total of 818,000 downward. Previous such annual revisions typically reset the original numbers by 0.1%. This time the correction was 0.5% -- five times as large. There were some categories, such as utilities as well as transportation and warehousing, that saw upward revisions. Nowhere near enough, though, to overcome plummets in manufacturing, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.

Then came the August jobs report, released in early September. The number of new jobs, 142,000, was 11.8% lower than the median economists' forecasts of 161,000 collected by Dow Jones. July had an even larger miss, with 117,000 jobs rather than the expected 185,000. With those numbers were several months of manufacturing contraction and weakening wage growth.

In one aspect, all this was good news for rate cuts, especially among those who have believed economic theories that unemployment has to rise to tamp down wage growth pressure on inflation.

Then there's the other hand. Weakening labor markets also mean that companies don't need as much help because the businesses are looking ahead with the assumption that there will be a slowdown, so why hire now?

As consulting economist Claudia Sahm -- who had in the past worked at the Fed and White House and had advised Congress -- wrote about the coming rate cut, ""The disappointing labor market data since the July FOMC meeting should add another 25 basis points [0.25 percentage points] to the cut"" on top of a similar amount for the falling inflation rate.

There's also the question of economic growth. First, look at a graph of straight-ahead GDP per quarter growth based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and made available by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Seems fine, right? Now look at a graph, by quarter, of year-over-year GDP growth.

A different picture entirely. From the 1940s up to the late 1970s, there was a throughline of increasing growth. The 1980s saw the trend tip over toward a long decline up to the Covid-19 pandemic crash, then an upward spike because there was big growth over the global slowdown. But now, year-over-year growth was sliding.

Whether slowing growth brought worry about a recession or concern about the labor market being a bad sign, the assumptions of a happy time with a ""soft landing"" for the economy should look at what the Fed is doing and reconsider.

Or, as Oxford Economics wrote after the announcement, ""The Fed doesn't like to admit policy errors,"" but it probably started cutting late and is trying to keep a soft landing in sight."
Sheriff calls the border wall 'racist' while seated next to mom of woman allegedly killed by illegal migrant,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sheriff-claims-border-wall-racist-while-seated-next-mom-woman-allegedly-killed-illegal-migrant,2024-09-19T00:12:47Z,"Santa Cruz County Sheriff David Hathaway made his remarks while sitting next to the mother of a woman allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant.

An Arizona sheriff told House lawmakers Wednesday a proposal for a wall on the southern border has a ""racist component"" to it unless a wall is built on the United States' border with Canada as well.

Testifying before the House Committee on Homeland Security on the border crisis, Santa Cruz County Sheriff David Hathaway explained how immigrants have a positive economic effect during an inquiry from Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.

""They actually reduce price inflation. You see help wanted signs all over the United States. If you add productivity to the economy, it makes the economy more productive,"" Hathaway said.

Hathaway then addressed calls for a wall on the southern border with Mexico.

BIDEN-HARRIS BORDER CRISIS: VICTIMS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIME TESTIFY IN HOUSE HEARING

""I hate to use the 'R' word, but it's the 800-pound gorilla in the room,"" he said. ""There's a xenophobic aspect to this. There was never a proposal to build a wall on the northern border, on the Canadian border. There was never any intent to aggressively enforce Title 42 on the Canadian border.""

Title 42 is a Trump-era policy established during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed U.S. officials to turn away migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border because of health concerns.

""So, you know there is this kind of racist component to it that we kind of all ignore, but it's there smoldering in the background,"" Hathaway said.

His remarks came as he sat next to the mother of Rachel Morin, who was allegedly killed last year in Maryland by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador.

TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE SHREDS BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN ON BORDER CRISIS IN NEW REPORT: 'ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW'

""An illegal immigrant that was a gotaway from El Salvador had waited for her on the trail. I was told that they grabbed her, dragged her through the woods, raped her, strangled her, murdered her,"" Patty Morin told lawmakers.

""We were told that her body was blanketed in bruises. And I can tell you from looking at her when I went to the funeral home that it was probably the most graphic thing that I've ever seen.""

The Biden administration has come under fire from Republicans over its border policies that have allowed record numbers of illegal migrants to enter the U.S.

Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., scalded Hathaway, questioning him about his knowledge of the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

""And you're a sheriff?"" Gimenez asked. ""That's one of the most violent gangs that's coming out of Venezuela. That's coming through your town.""

The congressman, an immigrant from Cuba, also took issue with Hathaway's assertion that supporting a border wall is racist.

""I believe that immigration should be legal immigration. I disagree with illegal immigration. Am I a racist?"" Gimenez asked before the sheriff doubled down on his border wall argument."

""We've waited. And I think that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2%, so I think that is what enables us to take this strong move today,"" Powell said during the press conference.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday the ""timing"" of the cut ""is a little suspect,"" before adding the decision is ""welcome news for consumers."" Vice President Kamala Harris called the move ""welcome news for Americans.""

The Fed had not slashed rates since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The reduction brings the federal fund rates down between 4.75% and 5% after it remained between 5.25% and 5.5% since last year, after the Fed moved to aggressively hike rates to combat decades-high inflation. Trump suggested months ago the Fed could cut rates before the election, telling Bloomberg a pre-election rate cut is ""something that they know they shouldn't be doing."" However, the move to lower rates coincided with the cooling of inflation and a rise in unemployment (the Fed usually increases rates when inflation swells), though the 50 basis point cut was on the upper end of consensus estimates. Powell said the decision involved ""a lot of discussion back and forth"" but, despite one dissenting vote within the Fed, there was ""broad support"" for slashing rates 50 basis points.

Fed Cuts Interest Rates For First Time In 4 Years: Here's What It Means For You (Forbes)

How Will Interest Rate Cut Impact Election? Here's What To Know As Fed Makes First Cut Since 2020 (Forbes)"
Opinion | The Fed's interest rate cut reflects an increasingly troubled economy,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-economy-rcna171501,2024-09-18T22:00:36Z,"By Helaine Olen, reporter in residence at the Omidyar Network

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point. The action will take the rate to between 4.75% and 5% immediately. The Fed also announced more cuts are likely before the end of the year.

The combination suggests the Fed is taking the threat of a slowdown to the American economy seriously. It's about time -- in fact, it's long past time.

Yes, at first glance the U.S. economy, appears to be doing ""basically fine,"" as Powell put it in his press conference today. The stock market is booming, and retail sales and consumer confidence remain solid. But under the surface, signs of trouble are increasing.

Credit card debt has been rising over the past year. So, too, have credit card delinquencies, which are now at their highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis. Auto loan delinquencies are up as well. Unemployment, though still a relatively low 4.2%, is nearly half a percentage point higher than a year ago. Payroll growth is slowing, and the job market is stagnating, particularly for white-collar workers.

As a result, many Americans are, if not completely abandoning the YOLO attitudes of recent years, getting increasingly picky about their spending. While overall retail sales are inching higher, restaurant sales are flatlining, and the post-pandemic travel bonanza is slowing, with hotels reporting less demand from vacationers. Aside from Taylor Swift, musicians are struggling to draw crowds. Even Jennifer Lopez canceled a planned tour this summer in the face of flagging sales. Other acts, especially on the nostalgia circuit, joined forces, giving audiences two-for-one deals, seemingly to make it more likely they could fill up the seats. (Elvis Costello and Daryl Hall toured together this spring and summer. So did Rick Springfield and Richard Marx.)

That this would happen has all been clear for some time -- the last of the savings built up over the pandemic ran out in March -- but the Fed cavalierly prioritized its battle against inflation even as it became increasingly obvious that the battle against pandemic-era price increases and gouging is all but won. Last month's consumer price index came in at an annual rate of 2.6%, just a tick higher than it was pre-pandemic. Gasoline prices average about $3.20 a gallon nationally, down 50 cents since April, and some experts think the national average could go below $3. Major retailers like Walmart and Target have dropped prices on thousands of items, so much so they've put pressure on traditionally lower-price-point dollar stores.

The Biden administration has already moved to take on corporate price gougers, and Vice President Kamala Harris says she will continue that effort if elected. Last month, the Justice Department sued software company RealPage, alleging its rent management software offered landlords a backdoor way to collude on rental prices.

The inflation that's hurting American families the most right now is high interest rates -- and the Fed's rate cut can do something about that. Credit card debt now comes with an average rate of well over 20%, while store-branded cards are at a record high with an average annual rate of 30.45%, according to a recently released study from Bankrate. The Fed's move Wednesday should begin to bring these eye-popping rates down.

The same is true of housing costs: While the interest rate on mortgages is most closely tied to the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds -- which are already coming down as inflation eases -- that number is also often influenced by the benchmark rate. The new cut will almost certainly make it easier for millions of Americans to find new homes.

Donald Trump and some of his Republican supporters will most likely argue this was a political decision by the Fed. Trump has said in the past that he believes interest rates are too high but that making a decision this close to the presidential election is ""something they shouldn't be doing.""

Please. This isn't an attempt to throw the election. It's something that should have been done months ago. Powell admitted as much, saying Fed officials ""may have cut earlier"" had they had the economic knowledge they have now in the summer.

As for Trump, always remember: He's only out for one person -- himself. That's why he's complaining both that interest rates should come down and that inflation is higher than ever in U.S. history (as someone who lived through the 1970s, he should know that's a lie). The only purpose of this incoherent position is to argue for his election.

Since 1977, the Federal Reserve has had a dual mandate: to balance and maximize price stability with maximum employment. It's finally back on both cases -- and not a moment too soon."
Here are 4 ways the Federal Reserve's big rate cut could change the housing market,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/nx-s1-5111859/federal-reserve-rate-cut-housing-home-prices-mortgages,2024-09-18T21:55:24Z,"After months of anticipation, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday by half a point.

That will have an impact on the housing market - but it's unlikely to make a huge difference for those struggling to afford a home.

Let's take a look.

Mortgage rates have been pretty high for the last couple years, especially compared to the historic lows they reached during the peak of the pandemic.

Rates bottomed out below 3% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage during 2020 and 2021 when the pandemic led to lockdowns, but then climbed to nearly 8% last year amid a robust economy and rising inflation.

But the prospect of rate cuts has already helped send mortgage rates lower, even before the Fed made its announced its actual decision on Wednesday. Long-term fixed rate mortgage rates are now at 6.2%, the lowest since February 2023. (Though it's worth noting that other factors besides the Federal Reserve's benchmark influence mortgage rates, including economic conditions.)

That means effectively that the rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve may already be priced in -- though mortgage rates are bound to fall a little more given that policy makers have made clear they intend to continue cutting interest rates into next year.

Charlie Dougherty, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, expects mortgage rates to drop ""marginally"" after the Fed's rate cut on Wednesday.

He and his colleagues forecast that the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage will be about 6.2% by the end of this year -- where it is now.

But Dougherty expects the 30-year mortgage rate to fall closer to 5.5% by the end of 2025, still above pre-pandemic levels.

Here's the thing: Lower mortgage rates may not actually make it easier to buy home. In fact it could make it more difficult and lead to higher home prices.

That's because lower mortgages are likely to lure more buyers back to the market, bringing in more competition for a limited supply of houses.

That's tough for first-time homebuyers. Kim Kronenberger, a real estate agent in the Denver area, says she worries for the would-be homebuyers who keep waiting for affordability to improve.

These buyers have struggled to find their first home as many were scared off by bidding wars during the low-interest-rate era -- and were then rebuffed by high mortgage rates and still-high prices.

""A lot of those buyers, they absolutely have regret,"" she says of people who didn't buy a home at the start of the pandemic, when rates were low but home prices hadn't yet skyrocketed. ""Because had they bought four years ago, they would have been in a whole different place than they are now.""

Don Payne, a real estate agent in Columbus, Ohio, says there's more inventory of larger homes for homebuyers trading up: ""Builders are building them, and existing homeowners have those, too.""

The big problem is a lack of starter homes.

""Folks are trying to get their first house, and there's a huge shortage on that,"" he says.

A key reason for high home prices currently is the lack of housing supply: The U.S. is short millions of housing units. Supply has not kept pace with demand, especially as the large millennial generation is forming households and trying to buy homes.

High interest rates didn't help, making it harder for some home builders to get projects off the ground, especially smaller, private developers. That's because the rates on loans that builders get for acquisition, development and construction are closely tied to the rate set by the Fed.

So this rate cut should make it easier for those developers to get building again.

The fact that lower mortgage rates are expected to spur more homebuyers to buy will also serve as an incentive for builders to get building.

That's good news for the supply side of the housing equation -- more homes getting built and into the market will relieve some of the demand that pushes up prices. But, of course, it will take time for those homes to be completed.

Lower mortgage rates can certainly bring down a homebuyer's monthly mortgage payments. But when home prices are sky-high, it will still be hard for many people to find a home they can afford.

Dougherty, the Wells Fargo economist, says home prices have risen by about 50% since early 2020, faster than the average household income growth during that time.

""That has been a really big driver in terms of making housing out of reach for a lot of prospective buyers,"" he says.

During the pandemic, a huge number of homeowners refinanced their mortgages to take advantage of record-low rates. Nearly 60% of active mortgages now have rates below 4% -- rates so low they are unlikely to refinance again.

In fact, most homeowners are still going to be reluctant to sell their current home because they would face a higher mortgage rate today. Lower interest rates will somewhat reduce what's called the ""lock-in effect,"" but won't change homeowners' hesitation.

Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, notes that even as mortgage rates have come down in recent weeks, it hasn't really jump-started the housing market.

""Home prices are still at record highs and inventory remains below pre-pandemic levels,"" he says. ""Neither of those variables are likely to improve dramatically in the near term.""

In other words: It will take more than the Fed's rate cut to fix America's housing problems."
September Fed Meeting: Fed Cuts Rates For The First Time In Four Years,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/september-fomc-meeting-federal-reserve/,2024-09-18T21:38:04Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

In a move that was widely anticipated and hoped for, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) opted on Wednesday to cut its fed funds interest rate by 50 basis points to a new target range of between 4.75% and 5%.

Wednesday's rate cut marks the first time the Federal Reserve has changed its interest rate target since July 2023 and the first time it has lowered rates since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. The Fed's rate cut likely means interest rates will continue to drop in the months ahead, but investors and economists remain uncertain about the pace of FOMC rate cuts moving forward.

In addition to the interest rate decision, the Federal Reserve also said it will continue to allow up to $25 billion in Treasury securities and $35 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to mature and roll off its more than $7.1 trillion balance sheet per month.

U.S. inflation is now well below peak levels in 2022, allowing the Fed to take its foot off the gas pedal and begin easing monetary policy. For more than a year, the Fed has delayed an interest rate cut over concerns about choppy and inconsistent inflation data. Wednesday's rate cut suggests Fed officials are finally convinced they have won the battle against inflation and should now shift their attention to supporting a softening labor market.

The first rate cut in four years is a milestone for the Fed, but the next several months will be critical in assessing whether or not the FOMC can achieve a ""soft landing"" for the economy. If the FOMC cut interest rates too soon, it could facilitate a rebound in inflation and undermine years of progress. But if the Fed waited too long to cut rates, the economy could still slip into a recession.

Markets reacted positively to the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 trading one-half percent higher on the day.

Lower interest rates decrease borrowing costs for both companies and consumers, stimulating economic activity. Unfortunately for the Fed, a stronger economy can exacerbate inflation.

Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.5% year-over-year in August, down from a 2.9% gain in July and well below a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Food and shelter inflation remain stubbornly high, but lower energy prices have helped ease overall price growth.

In late August, the Commerce Department reported the Fed's preferred inflation measure -- the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was up 2.6% year-over-year in July, in-line with its 2.6% gain in June and down from a 2022 peak of 5.3%. The Fed's long-term target for core PCE inflation is 2%.

""The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,"" the FOMC said in its statement on Wednesday.

The Labor Department reported the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, missing economist expectations of 161,000 new jobs. Average U.S. wages were up 3.8% from a year ago and up 0.4% compared to July. August marked the fourth month out of the last five in which job growth has come in below 200,000.

The U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%, but the U-6 unemployment rate reached 7.9%, its highest level since October 2021. The U-6 unemployment rate includes Americans working part-time jobs who would prefer full-time jobs and discouraged workers who have given up seeking employment.

In his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the large rate cut is not a sign the Fed waited too long to begin easing policy and is now forced to play catch-up.

""We don't think we're behind-we think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind,"" Powell said.

""We've waited, and I think that patience has really paid dividends in the form [of] our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%.""

In addition to its monetary policy decisions, the Federal Reserve also updated its long-term economic projections on Wednesday. Committee members estimate a year-end median fed funds rate of 4.4% in 2024, down from their previous projection of 5.1% back in June. The latest rate projections suggest another 50 basis points in rate cuts by the end of 2024.

The Fed's ""dot plot"" depiction of individual members' interest rate expectations indicates nine of the 19 FOMC members believe rates should drop another 25 basis points or less by the end of the year.

The committee projects a 2024 U.S. unemployment rate of 4.4%, up from 4% in June. Fed members cut their 2024 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth projection from 2.1% to 2%. The Federal Reserve also maintained its 2025 GDP growth projection of 2%.

On the inflation front, the Fed's projected 2024 core PCE inflation growth rate dropped from 2.8% to 2.6%.

Some investors have been concerned the Fed waited too long to begin cutting interest rates and the lagging economic impact of higher rates will ultimately trigger a recession. Despite a strong year-to-date performance by the S&P 500, the New York Fed's recession probability model still estimates a 61.7% chance of a U.S. recession sometime in the next 12 months.

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, says an aggressive Fed opens the door for the S&P 500 to rally to new all-time highs.

""The Fed front-loaded this rate cutting cycle with a jumbo 50 bps rate cut and signaled in their statement that they are focused squarely on the labor market, saying they are 'strongly committed to supporting maximum employment,"" Zaccarelli says.

""Although they pay lip service to the other part of their dual mandate (i.e. inflation), clearly they have taken their eye off that ball,"" Zaccarelli continued. ""And although inflation is much lower now than the peak we saw in 2022, igniting a stock market rally and goosing a growing economy with lower rates risks letting inflation come roaring back before this bull market ends.""

According to CME Group, markets are currently pricing in a 64.1% chance the Fed will issue an additional 25 basis-point rate cut at its next meeting, which concludes on November 1. However, investors and central bankers have roughly six weeks of economic data to monitor between now and then that could significantly impact monetary policy.

Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, says the Fed's larger rate cut suggests it is concerned about risks to the labor market.

""Equity markets applauded the Fed's decision to initiate its easing cycle with 50 basis points, as the statement noted that the Fed's dual mandates are in balance,"" Krosby says.

""Given how much discussion has surrounded this move, the announcement certainly wasn't a surprise;, however, the lack of guidance by Fed officials indicates that although there was only one dissent there must have been a forceful discussion and work towards building a consensus.""

In the near term, investors will be watching for the August core PCE reading on September 27 to see if inflation is still trending lower heading into the fourth quarter. In addition, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reading on September 27 will provide some critical insight into the health of the U.S. consumer."

Savings rates are high, but this is a fairly recent development. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, rates trended low -- nosediving after the 1980s and 1990s, decades during which savings interest rates were even higher than they are now.

Looking at historical savings rates can help you predict where rates may go in the future and determine where to keep your savings. Here's what you need to know about the history of savings account interest rates.

Historical Savings Account Interest Rates

Historical Savings Account Interest Rates Prior to 2009

During the 1980s, savings rates climbed as high as 8%. Deregulation caused deposit interest rates to stay higher than financial institutions could sustainably support, which contributed to banking failures during that decade. In the 1990s, savings account rates decreased significantly, typically sitting between 4% and 5%.

The 2000s kicked off with a recession, and savings rates fell to between 1% and 2%. Following the financial crisis of 2008, savings account interest rates fell to historic lows -- below 0.25%.

Historical Savings Account Interest Rates Between 2009 and 2021

In the years following the Great Recession, saving rates continued to fall to historic lows. In 2009, savings rates averaged 0.21% APY but fell to 0.17% in 2010 and 0.11% in 2011. Interest declined year over year until 2013, then remained steady at 0.06% APY through 2017.

From 2018 and 2021, national average savings rates fluctuated between 0.01% to 0.10%, making savings a guaranteed financial loss. Even with the 2010s' relatively low inflation rates of 1% to 2%, money held in savings was a depreciating asset. In 2021, inflation jumped to 4.7%, while savings account interest rates hovered between 0.06% and 0.07%.

Because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low to stimulate growth, savings rates remained at historical lows for over a decade.

Historical Savings Account Interest Rates Between 2022 and 2024

Current Savings Account interest rates remain historically high compared to the last 30 years, although they are starting to fall as inflation cools off. A high-yield savings account is likely to still be a good financial choice for parking your cash for many years to come, even if the rates don't return to their mid-2024 peak.

Current Savings Account Interest Rates

In 2022, the Federal Reserve issued seven consecutive federal funds rate increases to combat inflation. Between March and December, the federal funds rate increased from 0.25% to 4.25%. But banks were slow to raise savings account interest rates. In fact, savings accounts sat at an average national rate of 0.10% or below through July despite a rapidly increasing federal funds rate. National average savings rates hit 0.30% in late December.

However, many credit unions and online banks offered savings rates closer to the federal funds rate in 2022. Rates on some of the best high-yield savings accounts surpassed 4% by the end of the year.

When Will Savings Rates Go Up?

Savings rates are currently going up, and experts believe savings rates will continue to rise in 2023. Beginning in April 2022, online banks began regularly increasing savings rates. With lower overhead and a focus on increasing their market share, these challenger banks have offered higher savings rates since 2018.

Savings account rates also increase due to competition among banks. Banks are once again advertising higher interest rates to attract customers and gain market share, and this should continue to push rates upward as long as the federal funds rate doesn't fall.

If your bank is still only offering 0.01% APY on savings, you're missing out on significant interest earnings. You can easily find banks offering 3.00% APY or above on the best savings accounts. If you have $2,500 in savings at a national bank offering 0.01% APY, you would only earn $0.25 in interest during the first year. Compare that to an online account paying 3.00%, which would net you $75 in interest earnings during the first year.

What Affects Savings Account Interest Rates?

Savings account rates are primarily impacted by Federal Reserve policy. The Federal Reserve's monetary policies attempt to ensure strong economic growth and keep inflation around 2%. When the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, savings rates tend to fall as well. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, banks typically offer savings rate increases shortly thereafter.

In a high-rate environment, banks can lend for a greater profit, so they're more willing to incentivize savings. By offering higher savings interest rates, banks and credit unions gain access to more money they can then lend. This strategy also ensures banks meet reserve requirements put in place by the Federal Reserve to promote appropriate liquidity.

Savings account rates can also be impacted by competition among banks. New or smaller banks may offer higher interest rates to attract customers and increase their market share.

How To Get the Best Savings Interest Rates

You can get the best rates on savings accounts by shopping around and comparing rates at different banks and credit unions. Consider high-yield savings accounts, which offer above-average rates. Look for banks that don't require an opening deposit or minimum balance, and avoid savings accounts with monthly fees that can eat into your interest earnings. Think about setting up regular contributions to grow your savings even faster.

If your current bank isn't offering competitive rates, it's easy to open a new savings account.

Family Offices: Do They Really Make You Richer?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewerskine/2024/09/18/family-offices-do-they-really-make-you-richer/,2024-09-18T21:17:47Z,"In the world of wealth management, family offices have long been touted as the pinnacle of personalized financial services for ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families. But do they actually make you richer? As a fourth-generation trusts and estates attorney and private fiduciary, I've observed some misconceptions about the role and impact of family offices. Let's examine the reality behind these exclusive wealth management entities.

The Wealth Creation Myth

First and foremost, it's crucial to understand that a family office, in itself, does not generate wealth. The primary purpose of a family office is to manage, preserve, and transfer existing wealth, not to create new fortunes.

Families often choose to form or join a family office for reasons beyond wealth creation. These include:

If wealth creation is the primary goal, individuals would be better served by focusing on their Family Enterprise, that is their core business or exploring new entrepreneurial ventures. People should choose to form or join a family office to have more control, more customized services, more protection and more access to people and products that they want. If they join expecting to become wealthier, they will be disappointed.

The Institutional Paradox

Interestingly, while single-family offices aren't typically in the business of making money, institutional family offices operate differently. These entities, which serve multiple families, do aim to generate profits - but primarily for their shareholders rather than their clients. This distinction is crucial for families considering their wealth management options.

Realistic Objectives for Family Offices

For clients of family offices, the most realistic objective is not to dramatically increase wealth, but rather to preserve it against three main threats: Inflation, Fees and Family maintenance costs. A well-run family office focuses on strategies to combat these wealth-eroding factors, ensuring that the family's assets maintain their value over time and across generations. For the client, the only realistic objective is to not lose the money to inflation, fees, or maintaining the family.

The Value Proposition of Family Offices

While family offices may not directly make you richer, they offer significant value in other ways:

Preserving Legacy Assets

Family offices play a crucial role in preserving ownership of legacy assets such as real estate, art collections, or family businesses across generations. These assets often hold significant sentimental and financial value for families, making their preservation a top priority. Family offices can develop comprehensive strategies to maintain these assets within the family, including:

By taking a holistic approach, family offices can help ensure that these legacy assets continue to benefit and unite the family for generations to come, while also addressing practical considerations such as maintenance costs, market fluctuations, and evolving family dynamics.

Wealth Preservation vs. Wealth Creation

While a family office may not directly make you richer, it can play a vital role in preserving and efficiently managing substantial wealth. The decision to establish or join a family office should be based on a desire for more control, customization, and comprehensive wealth management - not on expectations of dramatic wealth increase.

For those seeking to grow their wealth significantly, the focus should remain on their Family Enterprise, that is their core business activities and new ventures. A family office, however, can provide the structure and expertise needed to manage and protect the wealth generated from these endeavors, ensuring its longevity for generations to come.

As with any significant financial decision, it's essential to carefully consider your specific circumstances, goals, and the long-term implications before establishing or joining a family office. The right choice can lead to more effective wealth management, but it's not a magic solution for wealth creation. Remember, a family office is a tool for preservation and management, not a wealth-generating machine."

Key Takeaways

After climbing for the past couple of years, CD rates have been slowly declining in 2024. CD rates tend to track the federal funds rate. When the fed rate goes down, CD rates decline, and vice versa. The Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady for nearly a year but made its first rate cut in September 2024. It is likely to continue making modest rate cuts throughout this year. National average CD rates are higher than in years past but are starting to fall. The average 12-month CD earns 1.88% as of September 2024, according to FDIC data.

As the Federal Reserve starts to cut rates, what's happening to interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs)?

After steady increases over the past couple of years, it appears CD rates are starting to decline. Forecasters say savers should keep their expectations in check.

Here's an overview of where CD interest rates could be headed in 2024 and beyond.

Are CD Rates Going Up?

CD rates are starting to decline. In September 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)lowered the federal funds rate for the first time in four years, this time to a range spanning from 4.75% to 5%.

Banks generally use the federal funds rate as a guide when setting rates on savings and lending products. As the federal funds rate decreases, you can expect CD rates at many banks to follow suit, and vice-versa.

Right now, the federal funds rate is the federal funds rate is likely to keep declining as inflation continues to cool. ""We certainly have made progress on the inflation front,"" says Amiyatosh Purnanandam, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan.

Rates accurate as of September 17, 2024

In January 2022, the typical APY, or annual percentage yield, for a one-year CD sat at a mere 0.13% -- a pandemic low, according to FDIC data. As of September 2024, average one-year CD rates are at 1.88%.

Other CD terms saw similar increases during the same time frame, including two-year CDs and five-year CDs. The average rate for the former increased from 0.17% to 1.55% and from 0.28% to 1.42% for the latter.

While the current averages may not sound very impressive, the best CD rates now surpass 5.00% APY for one-year CDs and 4.50% APY for two-year CDs and five-year CDs.

CD Rates Forecast 2024

The federal funds rate experienced its first cut in four years in September 2024. Rates are expected to continue to fall by the end of the year. The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures market expectations for federal funds rate changes, shows that most experts expect rates to sit between 4.25% and 4.75% by December 2024.

At its 2024 meetings, the FOMC held the federal funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% and 5.50%. It projects one rate cut by the end of the year.

Financial markets expect almost a 96% chance of a rate cut by the end of the year. But the Fed's decisions are going to be very data dependent. Inflation and employment readings over the next few months will be closely watched. For now, we are in a holding pattern.

-- Amiyatosh Purnanandam, Michael Stark professor of finance at the University of Michigan

CD rates will likely continue to drop as the federal funds rate decreases throughout the rest of the year.

CD Rate Trends From 2022 Through 2024

While there are no guarantees concerning how interest rates will move in the coming months, here are two predictions for CD rates moving into 2024.

Banks' Motives Dictate Rates for CDs

Banks will do what's best for their bottom lines, and having a gap between mortgage rates and CD rates increases profit. As the inflation rate cools from its 2022 highs, mortgage rates and CD rates are likely to fall as well, but at different paces.

While mortgage rates increased by over three percentage points in 2022, average CD rates only went up by around 2%. For now, banks will likely increase mortgage rates at a quicker pace than CD rates to maintain profit margins.

Treasury Bonds Will Pay More Than CDs

CD rates may be flattening, but if Treasury yields go down in 2024, CD rates could follow -- regardless of what the federal funds rate does. Banks are often slow to adjust CD rates, which means the rates you find at your bank may pale in comparison to Treasury yields. There's an incentive for banks to keep rates on savings products lower: Banks use CDs and other deposits to fund loans and investments in Treasurys, so the lower the rate they pay, the more they profit.

CD Rates From 2009 to 2023

The graph below uses historical FDIC data to display national average rates on CDs from 2009 to 2023 and highlights how CD rates responded to changes in central bank policies, inflation rates and broader economic indicators over the analyzed time span. Rates have been averaged for each year using data available from every month.

Source: FDIC National Rates and Rate Caps

In the years after the 2008 financial crisis, the country entered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. During this period, the Fed aggressively slashed interest rates to stimulate the economy and restore liquidity to the banking system. As economic conditions improved in the subsequent years, CD rates adjusted accordingly, stabilizing and eventually creeping upward.

In 2019, The Fed cut interest rates again in response to the economic slowdown caused by the U.S.-China trade war.

The year 2020 brought an unprecedented global pandemic that caught the world off guard. Within weeks, this virus spread around the globe and led to severe economic consequences. In the United States, roughly 20.5 million people lost their jobs in April 2020, and the unemployment rate jumped to 14.7%.

In an effort to support the economy, the FOMC dropped the federal funds target rate to a range of zero to 0.25%. However, as the economy bounced back shortly after, so did inflation. The strained supply lines due to Covid-19 -- paired with an increase in demand -- caused prices to surge, and the FOMC had no choice but to implement consecutive rate hikes. CD rates responded accordingly and jumped drastically from 2021 to 2023.

Factors That Influence CD Rates

Just like mortgage rates, savings rates and credit card interest rates, CD rates correlate strongly with the federal funds rate. When the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark rate, interest rates across the economy, including CD rates, increase. Similarly, decreases in the federal funds rate cause CD rates to fall.

Part of the draw of opening a CD is that its earnings are guaranteed regardless of economic environment changes. If you lock in an interest rate by purchasing a CD, you'll be paid that guaranteed rate for the entire term of the CD.

At the beginning of 2023, many Americans believed we were headed for a recession, but current opinions among economic pundits are decidedly mixed. The Federal Reserve typically reacts to recessions by reducing interest rates to trigger an increase in consumer and business spending.

Do CD rates go up with inflation?

Yes, CD rates typically rise with inflation but not directly because of inflation. Rather, the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate to combat inflation. And because interest rates throughout the economy are tied to the federal funds rate, when the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark rate, CD rates generally increase.

Do CD rates go up with the prime rate?

The prime rate is a benchmark widely used by banks when setting interest rates. Returns on savings accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts and CDs typically track the prime rate, which in turn tracks the federal funds rate. When the prime rate goes up, you can expect CD rates to rise.

Do CD rates go up during a recession?

Historical data suggests that CD rates track the federal funds rate, which has held true during past recessions. Typically, the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates during a recession to spur growth and reduce unemployment. Because CD rates follow the federal funds rate, CD rates will usually go down during a recession.

Will CD rates go up when the Fed raises interest rates?

Yes, like other deposit accounts, CD rates tend to rise whenever the federal funds rate increases. Banks and credit unions use the federal funds rate as a guide when setting rates on deposit products like CDs.

How Often Do CD Rates Change?

CD rates are variable, meaning they can change at any time. Most banks adjust CD rates according to fluctuations in the federal funds rate, which can change every month or two when the FOMC meets to make monetary policy decisions.

The FOMC may decide to maintain rates steady, in which case CD rates likely won't change much either. If the Fed rate goes up, CD rates will likely increase shortly thereafter, and if the Fed rate goes down, CD rates will likely decrease.

How To Maximize the Benefits of Current CD Rates

With CD rates elevated, now is the time to take advantage of savings opportunities. Below are some tips to maximize savings benefits with CDs.

Shop around. Compare CDs at several banks and credit unions to find the highest rates. CDs have fixed rates, which means guaranteed returns based on the rate, account balance and term length. Securing the highest rate will help you earn the most interest over the course of the CD term. Choose the best CD term. Consider how long you can keep available funds tied up in the bank when deciding which term length to choose. The last thing you want is to choose a term that is too long and end up having to withdraw funds early and pay a penalty. Also, keep your eye open for banks with higher promotional CD rates on specific terms. Create a CD ladder. Increase your savings while maintaining some flexibility by creating a CD ladder. This strategy involves opening several CDs with different term lengths. When a CD reaches maturity, reinvest the funds into a new CD. CD ladders keep some money accessible in case you need it. Remember to shop CD rates each time you open a new CD to lock in the best rates.

Where To Find the Best CD Rates

It might be a good time to shop around for the best CD rates while APYs are still high, especially if you have funds you won't need access to right away. Here's where to find them.

Online banks often offer the highest rates -- and charge the lowest fees -- because they don't carry the same overhead costs as brick-and-mortar banks. Credit unions are also more likely to offer competitive CD rates. Because they're nonprofit organizations, they can reinvest earnings into providing better accounts and services to members. One-year CDs are currently paying some of the highest APYs. If you're flexible on term length, you can also look for promotional CDs, which pay temporarily elevated rates on unconventional terms (like 11 or 19 months) to attract customers.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Will CD rates go up in 2024?

Not likely. Many experts agree there's a good chance CD rates have topped out for now, and rate cuts may take place later on in 2024.

When will CD rates go up?

Rates are unlikely to go up this year. How various interest rates -- including those on CDs -- move during the coming months will depend greatly on what the Federal Reserve does. The Fed boosted its benchmark federal funds rate numerous times throughout 2022 and the first half of 2023, finally holding rates steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50% through the second half of 2023. Rates may eventually begin to decline in 2024.

How much money should I have in CDs?

The amount of money you should keep in a CD depends on your financial situation and goals, and there's no perfect number you should aim for. Instead, look at CDs as one piece of your overall investment strategy.

Keep in mind that CDs aren't a great option for emergency savings because you'll often pay penalties for withdrawals prior to a CD's maturity. CDs also aren't a good long-term investment option because returns on CDs are generally lower than returns on investments. In any case, you'll need to deposit enough funds to meet the CD's minimum opening deposit requirement.

Should I invest in a CD?

CDs offer guaranteed returns and are federally insured. If you have funds available to invest that you won't need right away, CDs are an excellent way to build up your savings. It's a good idea to have a fully-funded emergency fund in place so you don't have to withdraw money from a CD before it reaches maturity.

If you decide to open a CD, consider future financial needs, how much money you can afford to keep locked up in a CD account, and for how long.

If you're unsure if you can part ways with your cash long-term, you might be better off looking for the best high-yield savings accounts, which may offer rates comparable to CD rates.

Mortgage Rates Are Coming Down. When Does It Make Sense To Buy Or Refinance?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/rates-are-coming-down/,2024-09-18T19:29:14Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Borrowers are finally starting to see signs of hope.

Mortgage rates are at their lowest point in 18 months -- and expected to fall further -- after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by 0.50% or 50 basis points for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.

If you're debating whether to refinance or thinking about buying a home, this new environment presents a question: When should you act?

Don't expect mortgage rates to fall dramatically after the Fed's decision to cut the federal funds rate.

""The first rate cut has been baked in,"" says Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist at the National Association of Realtors (NAR).

Mortgage rates are influenced by 10-year Treasury yields rather than the federal funds rate. Bond traders have been expecting a lower rate environment for a while, which has resulted in 10-year yields dropping from roughly 5% in October 2023 to around 3.60% now.

Over the same period of time, the rate on a 30-year mortgage fell from 7.79% to 6.20%, according to Freddie Mac.

While mortgage rates are expected to continue to decline, they may not fall as fast in the near future.

When we look at the last 11 rate hikes set by the Fed and mortgage rate trends in the table below, the weekly average 30-year fixed mortgage rate saw minimal changes immediately following each meeting. The significant changes are seen over a longer time horizon.

That's because the economy has remained relatively strong, growing at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3% in the second three months of the year, and is currently forecast by the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow Tool to grow by 2.9% in the third quarter.

And inflation, which has decelerated in recent months, is still above the Fed's 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation metric, the core personal personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, shows prices were 2.5% higher in July than a year prior.

The Fed, then, will be cautious as it lowers rates further.

Since 10-year Treasury yields tend to fall when the economy is expected to slow, it's entirely possible mortgage rates will settle at a level well above where they were before the pandemic.

The Mortgage Bankers Association expects mortgage rates to level off at about 6.4% this year, 5.9% in 2025 and 5.5% by the end of 2026, compared to 3.70% at the end of 2019.

In the meantime, buttress your credit score before you apply for a mortgage.

""You want to have your best credit score, your best scenario of income when you apply for a loan,"" says San Francisco-based certified financial planner Sarah Behr.

It's hard to take advantage of better rates if you've recently racked up credit card debt or experienced a job loss or lower income. Make sure you're using a small proportion of your available limit on your credit cards and that you've been gainfully employed over the past two years, preferably with the same employer without interruption.

You'll have difficulty receiving a loan if you've been out of work for more than six months in the preceding two years or if your overall debt level exceeds 36% of your income.

This could be a challenge for some since credit card debt now sits at a record $1.14 trillion, per the New York Fed, and the unemployment rate has jumped 0.7 percentage points over the past year to 4.2%.

Check these boxes before considering a new loan.

If you bought a home when mortgage rates were around 8% and have a clean financial record, you may be itching to refinance your mortgage.

But you don't want to refinance just because rates are lower. The plurality of homebuyers in 2022, according to NAR, purchased a home with a rate between 5.5% and 6%.

Refinancing comes with closing costs typically from 2% to 6% of the loan. If you've got $500,000 left on your mortgage, that means you'll owe somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 in fees.

Given the costs, you should put off a refinance until you can save 2 percentage points on your mortgage rate, says David DeVita, a wealth advisor at Girard, a Univest Wealth Division.

With tens of thousands of dollars in fees, you don't want to find yourself refinancing every few years, especially if you just closed on the house a few years earlier.

""You need to get into the math,"" says DeVita. ""If you're only saving a couple hundreds of dollars a month, let's find something else in your budget that you can cut.""

Your goal, says Behr, is to knock off enough from your monthly payment to cover your refinance fee within a year or so.

The trade-off in waiting for a lower interest rate, though, is dealing with higher interest payments now.

While it's ideal to wait for lower rates, you may want to pull the trigger more quickly if you overextended yourself to purchase your current home.

""If you're struggling financially, where you are in the range where it'll make a significant difference to your monthly cash flow, then it's something to consider now,"" says DeVita.

If you can't afford the upfront costs, your lender will let you add it to your new loan. But that just adds to the amount you'll owe.

The past few years have been the worst time to buy a home in at least the past 15 years, according to the Atlanta Fed's Home Ownership Affordability Monitor.

The index looks at housing conditions, such as average prices and interest rates, and creates an index with an affordability threshold of 100. Anything higher than that tells buyers that homes are broadly affordable, while a lower reading signifies the market is frothy.

The average reading in 2023 was 71.9 and 70.9 in the first half of 2024. To put that in perspective, the reading was 73.7 in 2006.

In 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, it was 105.2.

The good news is that conditions are starting to improve.

The median sales price on homes sold was $412,300 in the second quarter of 2024, which is roughly $25,000 lower than two years ago. Mortgage rates are coming down, and the supply of homes for sales has ticked up in recent months, according to NAR.

If you're looking for a new home, you don't want to wait to make a bid just because mortgage rates may fall in the months to come.

Builders in housing developments can offer incentives in terms of lower prices or reduced financing costs if you use their preferred lender, Behr says.

This can take the form of credits that lower closing costs when you finalize your mortgage or a lower interest rate for a set period of time, such as two years.

You can use the savings on closing costs today toward refinancing fees when you ultimately go to apply for a lower rate.

Mortgage originations declined by 6.8% in the first quarter of the year, according to data firm ATTOM, and have declined in 11 of the last 12 quarters to their lowest level in 24 years.

Since demand has been low, potential buyers have a good opportunity to make lenders compete against themselves for your business.

""You need to shop for your mortgage,"" says Phoenix-area CFP Raman Singh.

Once you have a good quote, contact your other potential lenders to see if you can get a better deal.

If your finances are lined up, and you've found a house you like, put in an offer soon.

With interest rates set to decline over the next few years, the demand for homes could rise, thereby causing prices to rise.

""If you want to buy a house and you wait until rates come next spring, there could be pent-up demand -- and then you're back into bidding wars,"" says Behr. ""You can buy a house now and plan to refinance in two years as long as you're not overextending yourself.""

While there's no October FOMC rate-decision meeting, experts predict more rate cuts in November and December. What's more, those experts also expect more rate cuts as we move into 2025. This makes for a crucial time to keep an eye on the market as a home buyer or homeowner looking to purchase or refinance.

At this point, it's unclear what future rate cuts may look like, but Goldman Sachs analysts are forecasting another 25 basis point rate cut in both November and December."
Maryland Signs On To IRS Direct File And Adds A Free Direct State Filing Option,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/09/18/maryland-signs-on-to-irs-direct-file-and-adds-a-free-direct-state-filing-option/,2024-09-18T19:18:23Z,"Taxpayers in Maryland will have another option for filing their taxes in 2025. Code for America and Maryland have announced a partnership that will enable Maryland residents to file their federal and state tax returns online -- and for free.

Taxpayers in Maryland will have another option for filing their taxes in 2025. Code for America and Maryland have announced a partnership that will enable Maryland residents to file their federal and state tax returns online -- and for free.

Maryland is the ninth new state to announce plans to allow its residents to file taxes through IRS Direct File. The state joins Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which have signed on to the next filing season. That's in addition to the 12 states from the pilot program (Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming).

The partnership will make FileYourStateTaxes, a civic tech nonprofit organization's integrated state tax filing tool, available to Direct File taxpayers in Maryland. The result is that Direct File users in the state can also file state returns for free.

""Partnering with the IRS to offer Direct File to eligible Maryland taxpayers in the 2025 tax season is an exciting opportunity and fundamental to our core priority of modernizing our agency to make government work better for all Marylanders,"" said Comptroller Brooke E. Lierman.

""In countries across the globe, residents enjoy much simpler return-free tax systems. While our state and nation are not there yet, with Direct File and our agency's new Maryland Tax Connect system for individuals coming this term, Maryland will have the most transparent, efficient, and modern system in the nation.""

In addition to signing on to Direct File, Maryland becomes the second new state partnered with Code for America to make free online filing available for the next filing season (the other was North Carolina). Code for America previously partnered with two states -- Arizona and New York -- during the 2024 tax filing season.

As part of a pilot program in 2024, eligible taxpayers in 12 states could file their federal tax returns for free directly with the IRS using Direct File.

The pilot was announced in October 2023 and closed after the filing season ended in April 2024. The IRS has called it a success, saying that several hundred thousand taxpayers across 12 states signed up for Direct File accounts, and 140,803 taxpayers filed their federal tax returns using the new service. Eligibility was limited to taxpayers with simple returns in those states.

The IRS began promoting the program in January of 2024, with a more robust push to taxpayers when the program fully opened in March. The March rollout of the pilot program included making the service available in Spanish.

During the pilot, four states built companion state tax filing tools that allowed Direct File users to file their state returns seamlessly. In a survey of taxpayers in the two states partnered with Code for America -- Arizona and New York -- 96% were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the program.

The key to the program is federal-to-state data transfer. Specifically, Direct File taxpayers could transfer their federal return information to a state product without having to start from scratch.

""The IRS has this information,"" says Gabriel Zucker, Program Director for Tax and Partnerships at Code for America, and ""it's your data.""

And while federal and state tax systems are separate, much of the data required to prepare your federal income taxes is also needed to prepare your state forms. Taxpayers are used to filing federal and state tax returns together, and don't want to re-answer questions or re-enter data.

The solution? Data portability. The result, explains Zucker, was to build a state product that tied together two independent products but that reads as one experience for the taxpayer. The data from the federal system could be used to populate the state returns, usually requiring only a couple of additional questions. (Remember, at this stage, these are simple returns.)

If that doesn't sound ground-breaking, it's not -- at least not in the private sector. It's reminiscent of the experience you might have when using other tax preparation software. So, why not create the same experience -- for free -- through federal and state programs?

The result so far has been positive. A significant majority of those who used the program -- 95% -- found the transfer to be ""seamless and quick."" From the time of the data transfer, 88% of filers completed and submitted their state return within 15 minutes.

That's pretty remarkable considering that these programs were just ideas not so long ago. Zucker marvels that there have been ""light years of progress in a few short years.""

That doesn't mean that every state can or will make the switch. So far, the state programs will only be available in states either with no income tax or where a solution has been built.

It also doesn't mean state taxpayers must lean on a Code for America platform. Zucker notes that other companies are also working to build solutions, and some states have made a version of the platform available to taxpayers on their own.

While taxpayers appear satisfied, that doesn't mean that they haven't raised concerns. Those worries are largely the same as those associated with the federal version of Direct File -- like getting assistance.

As part of the pilot, the IRS dedicated staff to Direct File help options like Live Chat. Zucker says the same thing is happening on the state side. However, he noted that there are not typically a lot of questions on the state side (again since the additional work required on these versions of state returns is typically not significant).

As for concerns about errors? Zucker notes that no system is foolproof. When taxpayers were entering data by hand, there was potential for error. ""You could make a mistake then,"" he says, and ""you can make a mistake now."" However, he notes that the more you rely on one-stop shopping for data entry, the better (meaning, for example, it's less likely that you'll see number mistakes, like transposed numbers on a state return if the correct information is transferred over from the federal system).

With respect to security, Zucker emphasizes that the programs use industry-standard best practices. And, he says, since information is not provided to advertisers (no private third parties have access to your data), your data is more protected than it may be on commercial sites.

Zucker says that the Direct File program and the state programs ""put taxpayers first.""

Direct File is driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), through which Congress tasked the IRS with delivering a report on the cost of developing and running a free direct e-file tax return system. The IRS released the report to Congress in May 2023.

According to the 2023 report, the IRS studied how an IRS-run free direct e-file tax return system might work. Most taxpayers surveyed by the agency reported interest in using an IRS-provided tool to prepare and file their taxes.

When the filing season opened in January 2024, the IRS announced the limited-scope pilot, which it claimed would allow the IRS to evaluate the costs, benefits, and operational challenges associated with providing the option to taxpayers. The pilot was, the IRS says, a success. According to the IRS, Direct File users reported a high degree of satisfaction and quick answers to their filing questions. In a GSA Touchpoints survey of more than 11,000 Direct File users, 90% of respondents ranked their experience with Direct File as ""Excellent"" or ""Above Average."" Most survey respondents who filed taxes in the prior year reported having to pay to prepare their taxes last year. Among survey respondents, 47% of users paid to file their taxes last year, and 16% did not file last year at all.

When asked what they particularly liked, respondents most commonly cited Direct File's ease of use, trustworthiness, and that it was free. Additionally, 86% of respondents said their experience with Direct File increased their trust in the IRS.

(You can read what some taxpayers had to say to Forbes about their experiences here.)

In May of 2024, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel announced that the program would be permanent and available to all 50 states and the District of Columbia for the 2025 filing season. However, not all taxpayers will benefit immediately. Yellen acknowledged the challenges in rolling the program out to all taxpayers, saying, ""Over the next few years, we will expand Direct File so that it supports all of the most common tax situations.""

Zucker hopes that the same energy will continue. In a few years, he hopes to see the program in all states.

Code for America is a civic tech nonprofit that works with community leaders and governments to build equitable, accessible digital tools and services. Founded in 2009, Code for America believes that government can work for and by the people in the new digital age.

In 2021 and 2022, Code for America helped build GetCTC.org, which made it easier for families to claim the expanded child tax credit (CTC). Over the course of 2021 and 2022, nearly 200,000 households claimed an estimated $685 million using GetCTC.

Currently, Code for America works with GetYourRefund.org, a nonprofit service offered in partnership with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) organizations across the country. To date, GetYourRefund has helped 154,000 people successfully file their taxes."
What The Fed's Rate Cut Means For Bitcoin,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2024/09/18/what-the-feds-rate-cut-means-for-bitcoin/,2024-09-18T18:46:49Z,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points today (bps), bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The aggressive rate cut, doubling the widely expected 25 bps reduction, signals deepening concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. For bitcoin, a unique asset often heralded as a hedge against central bank mismanagement, this decision introduces both opportunities and possible near-term risks.

The Fed's decision to cut by 50 bps represents more than just monetary policy adjustment - it's a clear acknowledgment that the economy is struggling more than policymakers have publicly let on. After a year of aggressive tightening aimed at taming inflation, this shift signals that the central bank is now in damage control mode. It reflects growing anxiety over potential recessionary forces, stagnating job growth, and the underlying structural weaknesses in the financial system.

Bitcoin has traditionally thrived on economic uncertainty, positioning itself as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement. However, today's rate cut presents a more complex reality. While monetary easing typically weakens the dollar, strengthening bitcoin, the speed and size of this cut may indicate that the Fed is seeing something more ominous on the horizon - a possibility that could lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies.

For bitcoin, the 50 bps cut sends mixed signals. Historically, rate cuts have been positive for hard assets like bitcoin, as such cuts are inflationary, leading to capital find its way into assets that can serve as stores of value. But this rate cut doesn't feel like a traditional monetary easing; rather, it's a borderline emergency response to growing economic instability. If the markets interpret this cut as a sign that the U.S. economy is in deeper trouble than anticipated, bitcoin could be caught in a risk-off selloff.

In recent weeks, bitcoin has struggled to hold onto the gains it made earlier in the summer. After reaching highs of $65,000 in August, its exchange rate with the dollar slipped under $59,000, reflecting broader market uncertainty and concerns about the Fed's next move. With today's 50 bps cut, bitcoin could face even more turbulence in the coming weeks as investors reassess the state of the economy.

Today's rate cut comes against a backdrop of growing macroeconomic instability. The U.S. labor market, which had been resilient in 2022, is showing signs of strain. Last week's jobs report revealed troubling data, with the U.S. economy creating fewer jobs than expected and a notable rise in unemployment to 7.1 million. This weakness, coupled with sluggish consumer spending and declining industrial output, paints a picture of an economy that may be slipping into a recession.

Globally, the picture is equally concerning. Europe remains mired in stagnation, with the Eurozone posting lackluster GDP growth of just 0.2% last quarter. In Japan, the central bank faces mounting inflationary pressures while attempting to unwind decades of ultra-loose monetary policy. Meanwhile, China's economy continues to falter, with a slowdown in factory output, consumption, and rising unemployment threatening its once-robust growth engine.

The Fed's 50 bps cut, therefore, isn't just about managing U.S. economic risks; it's about responding to a global slowdown that could have far-reaching implications for all asset markets. For bitcoin, this means navigating a highly volatile environment where macroeconomic forces exert influence on price movements that is difficult to predict.

Despite the short-term volatility that this aggressive rate cut may introduce, the long-term case for bitcoin remains strong. As central banks around the world grapple with economic weakness, their collective response is to increase the supply of money. Whether through rate cuts, quantitative easing, or other forms of liquidity injections, the financial system is increasingly reliant on monetary expansion to maintain even modest growth. In such an environment, bitcoin will continue to be valued as a global financial network independent of any single jurisdiction or central bank policy.

In the long run, this wave of monetary easing will likely reinforce bitcoin's appeal to those seeking refuge from fiat debasement. However, in the short term, the price of bitcoin may be subject to increased volatility, particularly as the market digests the implications of today's 50 bps cut.

The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points marks a significant moment in the ongoing saga of global economic instability. For bitcoin, this could mean a turbulent few months ahead as markets react to the potential for a deeper economic downturn. However, as central banks resort to repeated monetary intervention, bitcoin's fundamentals continue to strengthen.

In a world where fiat-based economies face ever-growing pressure from mismanagement and politicization, bitcoin continues to offer a compelling alternative. Investors may face volatility in the near term, but those with conviction in bitcoin's role as a decentralized, sound money system will see today's rate cut as another step toward validating its long-term value."
"Kamala Harris Breaks With The ""College For All"" Orthodoxy",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulweinstein/2024/09/18/kamala-harris-breaks-with-the-college-for-all-orthodoxy/,2024-09-18T18:46:35Z,"""As president, I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs to increase jobs for folks without a four-year degree."" Those words from Vice President Kamala Harris signal a major shift in higher education policy, one which recognizes that earning a college degree costs too much, and not every job should require one.

Since the late 1960s, progressives have supported the expansion of financial aid for college in the belief that a college degree was the key to expanding the American Dream. Pell Grants, student loans, and college tax incentives were all enacted and expanded under Democratic Administrations.

For many years this strategy worked. College enrollments dramatically increased, rising from 8.5 million in 1970 and peaking at around 21 million in 2010. In addition, there are now more women undergraduates than men and some 45% of students come from diverse populations.

But this policy also has a cost. The expansion of federal aid for higher education allowed colleges to raise tuition at rates far exceeding inflation, and total student loan debt is now more than $1.74 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.

As Taylor Maag noted in a paper for the center-left think tank PPI , most Americans (62%) do not have a college degree, yet we spend 3 times as much on aid for higher education than we do for workforce development. Furthermore, colleges and universities have not done their part to make sure that those students are paying a fair price. Instead, they have dramatically increased the size of their administrative workforce, tried to cover up their unwillingness to manage expenditures with higher tuition and more junk fees (like charging students a fee to graduate), created more online degrees, and dramatically increased the number of international students who can afford to pay full price.

Vice President Harris' proposal recognizes we cannot simply subsidize our way out of this problem. It acknowledges that young Americans have choices, and if they exercise them, they may find a better path towards success. For this she should be applauded.

But it's also time to call on colleges and universities to do their fair share. Getting the cost of tuition and fees under control must become a priority if taxpayers are going to continue to be asked to subsidize the cost of a college education. This means college and university presidents must cut costs and reduce administrative bloat. They also need to charge faculty with redesigning their curriculum so that more students can finish degrees in 3 years (and cut tuition costs by up to 25%), as they do in other countries.

A future Harris Administration could help move this process forward by tying future increases in student financial aid to real reductions in the cost of tuition and fees. They could also mandate, as states like Texas and Ohio have, that schools reward students for work completed before they enroll in college, such as automatically awarding credit for scores of 3 on AP exams.

Vice President Harris has taken an important step in the right direction on higher education policy. Recognizing that college is important, but not the only pathway to success, shows she understands that young Americans deserve more choice when it comes to their future careers. By leveraging the purchasing power of the federal government, she can create more opportunity for those who chose not to earn a college degree, as well as making college more affordable by holding school presidents more accountable."
GDP By State: States With The Biggest 5-Year Growth In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdepietro/2024/09/18/gdp-by-state-states-with-the-biggest-5-year-growth-in-2024/,2024-09-18T18:46:29Z,"The stock market has been beating back worries about an imminent recession. The Fed still has rate cuts up its sleeve. On the ground, unemployment is still at historic lows. In most but not all sectors, businesses are doing quite well. And, whether for better or worse, home values and prices continue to climb.

In order to discern the strength of state economies, economic data was analyzed, sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on real GDP in chained 2017 dollars, used to provide a true picture of economic growth as opposed to using nominal GDP figures, which don't account for inflation. Read on to find out the strength of the economy in terms of states by GDP and see which are the fastest growing states in terms of GDP growth over the years.

Examining the change in quarterly real GDP by state, the state that has the experienced the most significant five-year growth is Idaho. From the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2024, Idaho's real GDP grew by 23.3%, from $79.57 billion to $98.12 billion, respectively (in chained 2017 dollars).

But that's looking at quarter-to-quarter over five years. What about annual real GDP growth from, say, 2018 to 2023 (since 2024 isn't over, there's no annual GDP). By this standard, Idaho is still No. 1, growing 22.2% to No. 2 Florida's 21.8%, and No. 3 Utah's 20.4%. Idaho's real GDP grew from $77.65 billion in 2018 to $94.91 billion in 2023. 2023, from $1.08 trillion to $1.28 trillion. And this is in chained 2017 dollars, which means it accounts for inflation. Regular GDP growth, unadjusted, was 40.5%, from $84.55 billion in 2019 to $118.79 trillion in 2023.

Below is a table of states by GDP ranked by greatest five-year growth, from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024:

The percent change in real GDP from fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024, Idaho's grew by 5%, which is the highest quarter-over-quarter rate out of all 50 states. What's most revealing though is that the biggest contributing industry to this 5% growth was real estate and rental and leasing; this industry contributed 0.97 percentage points to that 5%. Initially, much of Idaho's explosive real estate markets was due to the pandemic-induced remote work policies, with many flocking to the state for relocation. Yet, this boom is still going.

Florida's 22.8% real GDP growth from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024 is second to only Idaho. Florida is also second to Idaho only in terms of its annual GDP growth over the last five years, 21.8%. Like Idaho, real estate and rental and leasing was the biggest contributing industry, responsible for 0.49 percentage points of Florida's 3% growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024.

Arizona too has put up fantastic numbers. In in terms of real GDP, Arizona's grew from $366.27 billion in Q1 2019 to $423.94 billion by Q1 2024. That's growth of 20.2% over five years. In terms of annual real GDP, the five-year growth of 19.6%. Not coincidentally, it is once again the real estate industry that's responsible for the greatest growth, contributing 0.76 percentage points to 3.2% of growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. The retail trade industry contributed 0.61 percentage points.

Below is a table of states by GDP ranked by greatest five-year growth, annually, from 2018 through 2023:"
"The Fed Just Cut Interest Rates, And More Rate Cuts Are Coming",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/18/the-fed-just-cut-interest-rates-and-more-rate-cuts-are-coming/,2024-09-18T18:36:08Z,"The Federal Reserve announced an interest rate policy decision to cut interest rates by 0.5% on September 18. This decision was accompanied by FOMC member forecasts, which reflect expectations of additional Fed interest rate cuts through the end of 2026.

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate today by 0.5%, targeting a range between 4.75% and 5%. An interest rate cut was largely expected across markets, as seen in the CME FedWatch Tool. However, market expectations were divided between a 0.25% and a 0.5% rate cut.

A rate cut of 0.5% is bigger than many market participants had expected, and it is likely to be the beginning of a trend in additional monetary policy accommodation as the Fed cuts interest rates further in the years ahead.

The Fed has a dual mandate to foster full employment and keep prices low and stable. Given the relatively solid labor market but elevated consumer inflation, future interest rate cuts are coming, although the Fed still has the license to cut interest rates slowly.

Investors, economists, and business leaders anticipated an interest rate cut on September 18. They were also eagerly awaiting the quarterly forecasts of the Federal Open Market Committee, especially the FOMC member median forecasts of future interest rates.

Accompanying the September 18 Fed decision, FOMC forecasts were released in a table with interest rates, GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the unemployment rate. The forecasted interest rates also appeared in a graphic depiction that economists and investors refer to as the dot plot, which shows anonymized individual FOMC member forecasts of future interest rates.

As Prestige Economics expected, the dot plot of median FOMC member forecasts conveyed that Fed members expect to enact additional rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.

The last set of FOMC forecasts was released in June 2024. The FOMC median forecast of interest rates was 5.1% for the end of 2024, 4.1% for the end of 2025, and 3.1% for the end of 2026.

The updated September FOMC median forecast of interest rates was lowered to 4.4% for the end of 2024, lowered to 3.4% for the end of 2025, and lowered to 2.9% for the end of 2026.

Fed member forecasts of future real GDP growth remain relatively positive and inflation is expected to improve more than previously forecast. Unemployment is expected to be weaker than previously forecast.

The median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 unemployment rate was raised to 4.4% from 4%. Meanwhile, the median year-on-year real GDP forecast for Q4 2024 was lowered slightly to 2% from 2.1%.

On the upside, the median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 and Q4 2025 year-on-year PCE and Core PCE inflation improved, although they are expected to remain above the Fed's 2% target in both Q4 2024 and Q4 2025.

The September Fed rate cut was bigger than some investors had expected, even though the CME FedWatch Tool had reflected the 65% chance of a 0.5% rate cut as of 9:30 a.m. ET on September 18.

A larger-than-expected interest rate cut often presents upside risks to equity and bond prices while weighing on the dollar. Plus, the September interest rate cut is expected by the FOMC to be one of many cuts, which is also supportive of equity and bond prices and bearish for the greenback. This is especially true, given the FOMC forecasts of more interest rate cuts than previously

As always, this isn't the end of the Fed's story today, and a great deal of attention will be paid to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks in his 2:30 p.m. ET press conference on September 18, especially about the timing of future additional Fed interest rate cuts.

What do you think of the September 2024 Fed policy decision and FOMC member forecasts?"
Muhlenkamp's Total Return Approach To Stock-Picking,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/09/18/muhlenkamps-total-return-approach-to-stock-picking/,2024-09-18T18:35:58Z,"In this article I showcase the total return strategy used by Ronald Muhlenkamp and give you a list of stocks currently passing the AAII Muhlenkamp screen. The Muhlenkamp approach seeks companies with high return on equity (ROE) ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. As of August 30, 2024, our Muhlenkamp screening model has an average annual gain of 26.4% over the past five years, versus the S&P 500 index's 12.4% return over the same period.

Muhlenkamp has devoted his entire business career to the professional management of investment portfolios. Muhlenkamp started his career as a portfolio analyst and soon was directly managing assets. In the early 1970s, Muhlenkamp undertook an extensive study of both fundamental and technical investing philosophies and practices and developed a proprietary method for evaluating both stocks and bonds -- he still uses it today. Muhlenkamp founded Muhlenkamp & Co. in 1977 to manage accounts for individuals and institutions and launched the Muhlenkamp und (MUHLX) in 1988. Muhlenkamp takes a total return approach to investing, seeking out investments that offer the best return prospects relative to their risk. While Muhlenkamp is normally invested in stocks, he can invest in bonds if they are attractive relative to domestic or foreign stocks, and small or large companies. The complete public market makes up his investment universe.

Muhlenkamp uses a bottom-up approach to selecting stocks, but adjusts his benchmarks based on the broad economic environment. Muhlenkamp begins by looking for companies with a return on equity above the average return on equity since World War II, which was 14.0% at the time of his writing.

Return on equity is a popular measure of profitability and corporate management excellence. The measure is determined by dividing the annual earnings of the firm by stockholder's equity. It relates earnings generated by a company to the investment that stockholders have made and retained within the firm. Stockholder's equity is equal to the total assets of the firm less all debt and liabilities. Also known as stockowner's equity, owners' equity, book value or even simply equity, it represents investors' ownership interest in the company. On the balance sheet, it is the sum of preferred stock, common stock and retained earnings.

Muhlenkamp looks for an above-average return on equity, but the price he is willing to pay for that company depends on the current and expected levels of inflation and interest rates.

Muhlenkamp uses prevailing inflation and interest rates to help establish his investing hurdles. Higher inflation leads to higher required interest rates, and stocks must therefore be priced more affordably to attract investors. The end result is that in a high inflation and high interest rate environment, price-earnings (P/E) ratios should be relatively low.

While much of Muhlenkamp's approach is qualitative, AAII has some quantitative data to construct a basic screen to seek companies with high return on equity ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. AAII's Stock Investor Pro screening and database program was used to construct the screen. Criteria are based on historical data and are not adjusted for current inflation.

The first filter looks for companies with a current return on equity (earnings per share over the most current 12 months divided by book value per share as of the latest quarter) greater than 12.0%.

Muhlenkamp seeks good companies trading at a discount. The return on equity should be stable and sustainable. The next filter looks for companies whose average return on equity over the last five years is also above 12.0%. This helps highlight companies that have performed consistently. If you wish to use a more stringent screen, you can specify a high return on equity for each of the last five years. Averages can be skewed due to a few very strong or weak years.

Muhlenkamp wants to acquire companies that are attractively priced relative to bond rates and inflation. The Muhlenkamp screen requires a current price-earnings ratio below 17.0. This number is based on historical data and has not been adjusted for current inflation.

Muhlenkamp feels that the smaller the company, the more you have to get to know management. But by and large, if there's good management, it comes through in the numbers. His analysis looks at companies in four ways: growth, profits, financial strength and labor relations.

Growth is an important consideration in a number of ways. The relationship between growth and return on equity is key. If the return on equity is higher than the growth rate, the company is probably generating free cash flow. An important consideration is how the company uses this excess cash.

Growth rates higher than the return on equity are not sustainable in the long run without additional equity or debt financing. Taking on debt has absolute limits and must be done carefully by companies in volatile industries. Issuing additional equity dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders, making their stock worth less on a per-share basis. Muhlenkamp prefers companies with a return on equity that can comfortably fund growth.

The first set of growth filters seeks companies with positive growth in earnings per share over the last five years that have experienced higher growth than the norm for their industry.

Sales growth, or top-line growth, drives the company's bottom line. Revenue tells you whether the public is buying the product. The next filter requires that the five-year growth in sales be greater than or equal to the five-year growth in earnings per share.

Profit is another critical factor. Muhlenkamp points out that the way to make profit is cost control, so he always looks at this factor. The net profit margin -- net income divided by sales -- reflects how efficient a firm is in operations, administration, financing and tax management per sales dollar. The greater and more stable the net profit margin, the better. A gain in profit margin translates into a gain in earnings for a given level of sales. Industry comparisons are critical for all of the profitability ratios.

Margins vary from industry to industry. A high margin relative to an industry norm may point to a company with an advantage over its competitors. The advantage may range from patent protection to a highly efficient operation running near capacity.

The Muhlenkamp screen requires that a firm's net margin exceed the industry median.

Muhlenkamp then looks at the strength of the balance sheet. What do the finances look like? Is the company going to need more capital one of these days?

While the use of debt can help boost the return on equity when the company is performing strongly, it can also saddle the company with interest payments that must be made throughout the business cycle, thereby slowing return on equity when business slows down and increasing the risk that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments.

Basic leverage screens look at factors such as debt to equity or liabilities to assets. Companies in more stable industries can safely assume greater levels of debt. The Muhlenkamp screen first looks for companies that have a percentage of liabilities to assets that is lower than their industry median. The screen then requires that free cash flow -- cash flow from operations less capital expenditures (capex) and dividend payments -- be positive.

The fourth factor that Muhlenkamp studies is labor relations. This is very much a qualitative screen that must be considered when examining candidates passing all of the filters.

Additional filters were added requiring minimum liquidity by specifying that a stock be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq or the NYSE American. Finally, foreign-listed stocks trading as American depositary receipts (ADRs) were excluded.

Muhlenkamp attributes his long-term success to sticking with something that works while keeping an open mind.

Muhlenkamp provides a helpful framework to consider economic and market conditions when selecting stocks. Like all screens, our interpretation of the Muhlenkamp approach represents a starting point for further analysis.

How Will Interest Rate Cut Impact Election? Here's What To Know As Fed Makes First Cut Since 2020,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/18/how-will-interest-rate-cut-impact-election-heres-what-to-know-as-fed-makes-first-cut-since-2020/,2024-09-18T18:24:15Z,"The Federal Reserve announced its first interest rate cut in four years Wednesday, one of its most consequential decisions in recent memory, a move panned by former President Donald Trump and likely celebrated by Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris and Trump have sparred over the Fed before. Trump made waves in August when he proclaimed the president should have a ""say"" in Fed decision making, saying he specifically is qualified because he ""made a lot of money"" and has ""better instinct than...people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,"" though Trump later walked back the stance by saying the Fed staff doesn't ""have to listen"" to him.

The U.S.' central bank's most important function is arguably determining the federal funds rate, the interest charged for capital reserve transactions between financial institutions, set by a panel of Fed officials known as the Federal Open Market Committee. The federal funds rate is often broadly just referred to as interest rates, considering its outsized influence on most U.S. borrowing from corporate bonds to new car loans. The bank historically runs independently from the rest of the federal government, guided by a ""dual mandate"" to minimize inflation and maximize employment, meaning its goal is to set the U.S. economy on a long-term path of growth. The Fed typically raises rates when inflation is too high, like it did in 2022 and 2023, and lowers rates when there's a threat of a serious economic downturn, like it did in early 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Other than conducting its monetary policy objectives, the Fed also regulates commercial banks and controls how much money is in circulation.

Little to none in theory, given the Fed's pride in independent decision making. However, the president appoints and the Senate confirms the Fed's seven board of governors, who have permanent seats on the 12-person Federal Open Markets Committee. Biden appointed four of the Fed governors, though Trump tapped Powell to the top central banker job he's held since 2018.

The Fed's Federal Open Markets Committee lowered the federal funds rate Wednesday from 5.25% to 5.5% down to 4.75% to 5%, with the 50 basis point reduction on the high end of consensus estimates. The consensus was unusually split on what the Fed would do, with market-implied probabilities of the Fed decision the least settled since Bank of America research began tracking the metric. Derivative trades monitored by CME Group priced in a roughly 60% chance of a 50 basis-point cut announcement Wednesday and 35% odds for a 25 basis-point move (the 75 basis points suggested by Warren did not have much legs). However, the market-implied odds of at least a 0.25 percentage point cut were firmly at 100%, meaning the first rate cut since March 2020 was all but certainty to come Wednesday.

Not all Republicans agree with Trump's opposition to a rate cut Wednesday. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) recently told Politico ""the time is right"" and ""you've got to put the greater good ahead of looking political,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told the publication ""it is time"" for a cut and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) concurred it's ""probably time"" for the move and focusing on the data, rather than perhaps controversial timing, is ""the way the Fed should operate.""

Project 2025, the controversial political roadmap laid out by Trump allies, though Trump has denied his involvement in the project, calls for a significantly diminished Fed, even laying out a scenario in which the central bank is ""effectively abolished"" in favor of a far more laissez-faire approach."
The Federal Reserve starts cutting interesting rates in a big moment for the economy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/nx-s1-5115909/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-inflation,2024-09-18T18:10:56Z,"The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates Wednesday, signaling a turning point in the long-running battle against inflation. Win McNamee/Getty Images North America hide caption

The Federal Reserve moved aggressively Wednesday to start cutting interest rates as easing inflation fears give way to growing concern about the job market.

The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, which will make it cheaper to get a car loan, finance a business or carry a balance on your credit card.

Wednesday's rate cut is the Fed's first since 2020, but it won't be the last. On average, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee expect borrowing costs to drop by another half-percentage point this year, and an additional full point next year. That's a more rapid decline than committee members were projecting just three months ago.

The shift to lowering interest rates marks a major turning point in the Fed's two-and-a-half year battle to curb inflation. The central bank began raising rates in March 2022 in an effort to tamp down demand and bring prices under control. By last summer, interest rates had climbed to between 5.25 and 5.5%, their highest level in more than two decades.

The rate cut on Wednesday comes as the annual inflation rate has fallen sharply, to 2.5% last month, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.

At the same time, job growth has slowed and the unemployment rate has inched up to 4.2%, leaving Fed officials worried that high interest rates could become an unnecessary drag on the economy.

""The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said last month, during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo. ""The time has come for policy to adjust.""

The pace of future rate cuts is still uncertain, however. One member of the committee, Michelle Bowman, wanted to proceed more cautiously on Wednesday, cutting the benchmark rate by just a quarter percentage point. Committee members are divided on how much further rates will need to fall next year.

While falling interest rates will help borrowers and potentially spur economic growth, they come with a cost for savers. The interest paid for online savings accounts and money market funds will likely decline.

The timing of the Fed's move is politically sensitive, coming less than seven weeks before a presidential election in which the strength of the economy is a key issue for voters. Powell has said repeatedly that he and his colleagues try to do what's best for the economy and are not swayed by partisan politics."
Can You Bank On These Three Consumer Lending Stocks?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/09/18/can-you-bank-on-these-three-consumer-lending-stocks/,2024-09-18T18:10:18Z,"In this article I use AAII's A+ Investor Stock Grades to provide insight into three consumer lending stocks. With rising consumer confidence, the potential for interest rate cuts and a stable labor market, should you consider the three stocks of Enova International (ENVA), Qifu Technology (QFIN) and Regional Management (RM)?

U.S. consumer confidence has reached a six-month high, with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index climbing from 101.9 in July to 103.3 in August. This indicates growing optimism about the economic outlook. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that consumers' median inflation expectations for three years ahead fell 0.6 percentage points to 2.3%, as of July 2024. Meanwhile, the U.S. labor market remains stable, as indicated by a slight decrease in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week of August 24.

Consumer lending companies stand to benefit from these economic conditions. Individuals are likely to feel more secure about their financial situations and more comfortable about taking on new debt. This, in turn, can drive higher loan origination volumes, boosting revenues for consumer lenders. In addition, as inflation expectations ease, consumers may have more disposable income, making them more likely to finance large discretionary purchases. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it will lower borrowing costs for consumers, making loans more affordable and accessible. This can lead to an increase in demand for various types of consumer loans, such as personal loans, auto loans and credit cards.

Given these economic conditions, consumer lending companies have the potential to benefit. For investors looking to capitalize on these dynamics, should Enova International, Qifu Technology and Regional Management be considered?

When analyzing a company, it is helpful to have an objective framework that allows you to compare companies in the same way. This is why AAII created the A+ Stock Grades, which evaluate companies across five factors that research and real-world investment results indicate to identify market-beating stocks in the long run: value, growth, momentum, earnings estimate revisions (and surprises) and quality.

Using AAII's A+ Stock Grades, the following table summarizes the attractiveness of three consumer lending stocks -- Enova International, Qifu Technology and Regional Management -- based on their fundamentals.

AAII's A+ Stock Grade Summary for Three Consumer Lending Stocks

Enova International (ENVA) is a technology and analytics company that provides online financial services, including loans and lines of credit, to consumers and small businesses in 37 states across the U.S. and Brazil. Enova International also extends financing to small businesses in 49 states and Washington, D.C. The company's clientele comprises small businesses with bank accounts that use alternative financial services due to limited access to traditional credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. Enova International's product offerings include consumer and small business installment loans, lines of credit, credit services organization programs and bank programs. Its financing products are marketed under the brands CashNetUSA, NetCredit, OnDeck Capital, Headway Capital and Pangea USA LLC.

Enova International has a Momentum Grade of A, based on its Momentum Score of 92. This means that the stock's momentum has been very strong in terms of its weighted relative price strength over the last four quarters. The weighted four-quarter relative strength rank is the relative price change for each of the past four quarters, with the most recent quarterly price change given a weight of 40% and each of the three previous quarters given a weight of 20%. The ranks are 94, 45, 91 and 30, respectively from the most recent quarter. The weighted four-quarter relative price strength is 14.1%.

A higher-quality stock possesses traits associated with upside potential and reduced downside risk. Backtesting the Quality Grade shows that stocks with higher grades, on average, outperformed stocks with lower grades from 1998 through 2019.

The A+ Quality Grade is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of return on assets (ROA), return on invested capital (ROIC), gross profit to assets, buyback yield, change in total liabilities to assets, accruals to assets, Z double prime bankruptcy risk (Z) score and F-Score. The score is variable, meaning it can consider all eight measures or, should any of the eight measures not be valid, the valid remaining measures. To be assigned a Quality Score, though, stocks must have a valid (non-null) measure and corresponding ranking for at least four of the eight quality measures.

Enova International has a Quality Grade of A, based on a score of 85, which is very strong. The company ranks strongly in terms of its buyback yield and Z-Score, which measures bankruptcy risk. Its buyback yield of 13.3% ranks in the 96th percentile among all U.S.-listed stocks, and its Z-Score of 10.79 ranks in the 91st percentile. Enova International also has a return on assets of 3.9%, which is above the sector median of 0.9% and ranks in the 72nd percentile.

The components of the Growth Composite Score consider a company's success in growing sales on a year-over-year and long-term annualized basis and its ability to consistently generate positive cash from its core operations. The company's Growth Grade is B, which is strong. Enova International has generated positive annual cash from operations in the past five consecutive years and has a five-year annualized sales growth rate of 4.8%.

Qifu Technology (QFIN) is a China-based company specializing in credit technology services. The company's services are categorized into credit-driven services and platform services based on the nature of the service and the associated credit risk. The credit-driven services involve matching potential borrowers with financial institutions, allowing these institutions to acquire borrowers, conduct credit evaluations, facilitate fund matching and provide post-loan services. The platform services, offered under a capital-light model, include comprehensive loan assistance, post-loan services, intelligent marketing services, referral services and risk management software as a service for financial institution partners through the Intelligent Credit Engine model.

The company has a Value Grade of A, based on its Value Score of 96, which is deep value. The Value Grade is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, price-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-book-value (P/B) ratio, price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) ratio, shareholder yield and the ratio of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).

The company has a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 3.9, ranking in the seventh percentile among all U.S.-listed stocks. Its price-earnings ratio is 6.1 and its enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio is 2.7, ranking in the eight and sixth percentiles, respectively. Its shareholder yield is 10.6%, ranking in the sixth percentile.

Earnings estimate revisions indicate how analysts view a firm's short-term prospects. Qifu Technology has an Earnings Estimate Revisions Grade of A, based on a score of 88, which is very positive. The grade is based on the statistical significance of its latest two quarterly earnings surprises and the percentage change in its consensus estimate for the current fiscal year over the past month and past three months.

Qifu Technology reported a positive earnings surprise of 27.8% for the second quarter of 2024, and in the prior quarter reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.9%. Over the last three months, the consensus earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2024 has increased from $7.72 to $10.01 per share, due to one upward revision. The consensus earnings estimate for full-year 2024 has increased from $30.980 to $36.757 per share, based on four upward revisions.

Qifu Technology has a Growth Grade of C, which is average. The company ranks in the 45th percentile for its five-year annualized sales growth rate of 29.6%.

Regional Management (RM) is a diversified consumer finance company that provides installment loan products, primarily to customers with limited access to credit from banks, thrifts, credit card companies and other lenders. The company offers both small and large installment loans. Small installment loans range from $500 to $2,500, with terms up to 48 months, while large installment loans range from $2,501 to $25,000, with terms between 18 and 60 months. Additionally, Regional Management provides optional payment and collateral protection insurance, including credit life insurance, accident and health insurance, involuntary unemployment insurance and personal property insurance. The company also offers indirect retail installment loans up to $7,500. Regional Management operates under the name Regional Finance.

Regional Management has a Quality Grade of A, with a score of 82, which is very strong. The company ranks strongly in terms of its return on invested capital and its F-Score. The F-Score is a number between 0 and 9 that assesses the strength of a company's financial position based on its profitability, leverage, liquidity and operating efficiency. The company's return on invested capital of 541.3% ranks in the 99th percentile among all U.S.-listed stocks, and its F-Score of 6 ranks in the 71st percentile. Regional Management has a Z-Score of 4.55, above the sector median of 3.69.

Regional Management has a Value Grade of A, based on a score of 83, which is deep value. The company ranks in the 35th percentile for its shareholder yield and in the 25th percentile for its price-to-book ratio. The company has a shareholder yield of 1.4% and a price-to-book ratio of 0.91. A lower price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is considered better value, and Regional Management's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 1.3 is below the sector median of 13.2. The price-to-sales ratio is 0.55, which ranks in the 21st percentile.

The company has a Momentum Grade of B, based on its Momentum Score of 70. This means that the stock's momentum is average in terms of its weighted relative price strength over the last four quarters. The ranks are 78, 88, 38 and 27, respectively from the most recent quarter. The weighted four-quarter relative price strength is 1.6%.

Regional Management has a Growth Grade of A, which is very strong. The company ranks in the 73rd percentile for its five-year annualized sales growth rate of 12.4%.

"CEOs Are Confident In Hiring And The Potential Of AI, According To KPMG",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/18/ceos-are-confident-in-hiring-and-the-potential-of-ai-according-to-kpmg/,2024-09-18T16:49:05Z,"Despite a significant decline in confidence about the global economy over the past decade, top business leaders are remarkably optimistic about the future prospects and growth of their respective corporations.

While only 72% of CEOs are confident in the world economy's direction, down from 93% in 2015, an overwhelming 92% plan to increase their workforce in the next three years, according to the latest KPMG CEO Outlook survey.

This buoyant hiring outlook -- the highest since 2020 -- comes even as CEOs face mounting pressures and shifting threats to growth, with supply chain and operational issues now outranking geopolitical and cybersecurity concerns.

In the last 10 years, chief executives have actively worked to foster confidence in their organizations through strategic initiatives. They have significantly increased investments in innovation and technology, most notably artificial intelligence, recognizing these areas as key drivers of market dominance. Additionally, CEOs have prioritized human capital, placing employees at the center of their growth strategies.

In a conversation with global CEO and chairman of KPMG International, Bill Thomas shares insights on how business leaders continue to build resilient companies capable of navigating an increasingly complex and uncertain corporate landscape.

CEOs are increasingly recognizing the pivotal role of human capital in harnessing the full potential of generative AI. Despite financial challenges, most business leaders are doubling down on AI investments, with 64% ranking it as their primary focus for 2024.

""The last 10 years has been framed by a backdrop of volatility and change, from a global pandemic to surging inflation and the rise of AI,"" Thomas stated. ""In the face of such pressures, CEOs are steadfast about the need to invest in the future.""

He said leaders must demonstrate ""resilience, agility and innovation"" in a rapidly changing environment. Over the next decade, CEOs who implement ""bold strategies"" and invest in the appropriate technologies and talent will be positioned to achieve sustainable, long-term growth.

According to projections by Goldman Sachs, major technology companies are expected to invest over $1 trillion in AI initiatives over the next five years.

Anticipated benefits of this fast-emerging technology include boosting efficiency and productivity, preparing the workforce for future challenges through upskilling and fostering increased organizational innovation.

While the majority view AI as a leading force of expansion and innovation, they are taking a measured approach, with nearly two-thirds anticipating returns on their AI investments within a three to five-year timeframe.

Employers are also turning their attention to workforce-related issues that could impede the future growth of their organizations.

While 76% of CEOs anticipate that AI won't significantly alter their overall headcount, there is a notable skills gap when it comes to the adoption of GenAI. Only 38% of leaders believe their current staff are adequately equipped to maximize AI's potential. This has prompted over half of employers to reevaluate the skill sets needed for entry-level positions, the report stated.

Nearly one-third of CEOs express concern about changes in the labor market, particularly the imminent retirement of many employees and the scarcity of qualified workers to fill their roles. Recognizing this potential talent gap, 80% of CEOs support the idea that companies should invest in upskilling and reskilling programs.

As a proponent of ""staying curious,"" Thomas emphasizes that it is incumbent upon both organizations and individuals to commit to lifelong learning, a value that is embedded into KPMG's own culture: ""Excellence means relentlessly delivering quality work to the highest professional standards. We do this by staying curious and taking personal responsibility for our learning.""

Additionally, there is a corporate push toward traditional in-office work, despite employees seeking work-life balance and flexibility from their employers. In fact, an overwhelming majority of CEOs are anticipating a complete return to office within the next three years, with 83% expecting this transition -- a marked increase from 64% in the previous year.

This trend is further reinforced by the 87% of respondents who indicate a willingness to reward employees who make the effort to come into the office, offering incentives, such as preferential assignments, salary increases or career advancements.

The shift from hybrid work to full time in the office is already underway. On Monday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced in a company blog post that the tech giant is mandating its employees to return to the office five days a week, starting January 2, 2025.

""When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,"" Jassy wrote in the memo. ""We've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another. If anything, the last 15 months we've been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits,"" he added."
Book Review: George Gilder's Excellent and Crucial 'The Israel Test',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/09/18/book-review-george-gilders-excellent-and-crucial-the-israel-test/,2024-09-18T16:03:56Z,"Without defending some (or a lot) of its anti-growth economic policies, the easily-forgotten truth is that California is by far the most enterprising, entrepreneurial state in the most enterprising, entrepreneurial country in the world. Evidence supporting the previous claim can be found in the fact that 60% of the world's venture capital investment annually flows to startups based in California, not to mention that if the Golden State were a country, it could lay claim to being the world's 4 largest economy. When conservatives oddly politicize what booms as a ""basket case"" (and other pejoratives like it), they shrink themselves.

The great George Gilder has long recognized the herculean genius of California's entrepreneurs, along with that of the remarkable investors who match west coast genius with capital. As he observed in his spectacular 2023 book Life After Capitalism, it's not just the economic activity taking place within California that people should marvel at, it's the surges in productivity that California-based innovation has long made possible outside the state. California is decidedly not an economic basket case, but the world economy would most certainly be a basket case without California.

Gilder's past insights came to mind quite a bit while reading his highly informative, excellent and crucial new book, The Israel Test: How Israel's Genius Enriches and Challenges the World. This essential read gives life to Gilder's assertions about California's economic impact on the world, an impact that is very much informed by technology and financial sectors well populated by Jews.

For those who don't know why California thrives despite certain policies normally inimical to success, they'll understand better from The Israel Test. As Gilder makes plain on the book's very first page, ""we Americans still face our Israel Test, our humbling need to not only recognize our dependence on the genius of the Jews in the United States, but also to acknowledge our reliance not only for innovation but even for our national security on this diminutive and embattled Middle Eastern ally."" While the focus of The Israel Test is not California, what's apparent is that Israel, like California with its sizable Jewish population, is similarly instrumental to global economic health and security. Yes, it's increasingly true that the world economy would be a basket case without Israel.

In Gilder's words, ""Planetary prosperity depends on the outsized genius of a tiny minority of human beings."" More and more of this ""vital few"" (HT: Reuven Brenner) talent resides in Israel. Which is the purpose of Gilder's book, one that should (and hopefully will) attain a large global audience. Particularly as Israel's enemies spew hideous rhetoric of the ""river to the sea"" variety, those who know better need to understand that the words aren't just ugly, not just sickeningly inhumane if acted upon, they would also be globally disastrous economically.

Looked at through a U.S. economic prism alone, Gilder writes that ""most of America's preeminent technology companies"" along with its healthcare giants ""still depend on crucial inventors, engineers, intellectual prosperity, and laboratories in Israel."" Considering our military planes like the F-16, numerous inputs for the latter are crafted in Israel. Assuming an all-out missile attack on the United States, Gilder asserts that ""Israeli technology will be the reason we likely survive it."" Despite this, the country suffers an ""insidious spate of abusive nonsense detailing the alleged flaws - indeed the sins - of Israel.""

What's odd is that the abusive nonsense directed at Israel frequently originates in the United States. Odder still, as Gilder conveys through brilliant Israeli entrepreneurs like Shaul Olmert (son of Ehud, former prime minister), is how much of the criticism of the country comes from Israelis themselves. Gilder laments that Jewish outperformance isn't just financial, technological and cultural, that the Jews ""outperform all rivals even in the arena of anti-Semitism.""

Looking at the U.S. alone, Gilder is of the view that ""the United States has all too often failed the Israel Test"" through its perception of ""Israeli power, prosperity, culture, genius, and self-defense as a problem rather than a supreme global asset."" And a global asset it is. At the same time, it requires stress just how much of a local asset Israel is.

Gilder writes that before the Jews returned to Israel (1/6 of 1 percent of the total Middle East land mass), the land ""scarcely counted as a desirable asset or a prize to be awarded to anyone before the Jews reclaimed it and made its economy valuable and its land capable of supporting life."" And it was surely not desired by Arabs who now make pushing the Jews into the sea from this tiny bit of land their modern raison d'etre. Major evidence required to make this claim can be found in what the land surrounding Israel looks like now, not to mention what Israel would look like if the Jews departed or were pushed out.

Which explains Gilder's assertion that contra all the rhetoric about ""occupation"" and forced ""settlements,"" the ""Jews were not occupying a nation,"" rather ""they were building one."" What they built has proven rather appealing to non-Jews, including Arabs. Gilder notes that ""Arabs flourish in Israel as they do nowhere else.""At present, ""Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank accommodate some 5.5 million Arabs, with a population density ten times that of Jordan."" Human migration is the purest market signal of them all, and the migration of Arabs into and around Israel signals the soaring economic opportunity that reveals itself wherever the commercially skillful take their talents. Genius, per Gilder, is ""a source of wealth and opportunity for all.""

Which raises obvious responses to the frequent critiques of Jews and their ""settlements."" To say these movements are negatives is like saying it would harm a limping U.S. neighborhood if well-to-do, upright neighbors moved in, or that a business district would be harmed if a McDonald's, Whole Foods, or Apple Store showed up. Obviously not. Where prosperous people and businesses go, other thriving businesses and people frequently follow. Where the Jews go, vast improvement follows. Gilder writes this in more of a protective sense for Israel from guns and bombs, but when he writes that ""Israel is not too large but too small,"" it's easy to apply the previous assertion to the wellbeing of the non-Jews in the region not fortunate enough to live in Israel.

Sadly, this view is not shared by Hamas, Hezbollah, the PA, and a myriad of other entities that have directed so much ugly rhetoric, violence and murder at Israel and its people. Even though the Jews have made enormously desirable what formerly wasn't, Hamas et al obviously want the land back. Or do they? Considering the look of the lands abutting Israel, what a disaster for the various terrorists groups if the Israelis were to pull an Atlas Shrugged of sorts and leave.

For now, Hamas and other terrorist organizations like it somehow frame Israel's prosperous, world-enhancing existence as the problem for the region. Worse, they get help not just from Israel's critics, but also its defenders. Gilder writes that ""the central error of Israel's defenders is to accept the framing of the debate by its enemies, whose idea is that peace depends on some marginal but perpetually elusive improvement in Israel's behavior."" Which is something to think about given the Arab population within Israel itself.

While the Israelis live next to Arabs and Christians within Israel, while Arabs and Christians serve in the Knesset, Gilder notes that ""the dispute over the settlements is an argument over whether Jews may reasonably expect to be permitted to live among Arabs anywhere."" Not now, it seems. It's accepted as a ""natural right"" of Palestinians ""to be squeamish about living anywhere near Jews.""

It brings us to the why (or the presumed why) behind the hatred. Religion doesn't seem to suffice, which means it's difficult to countenance the belief of some that ""The Jew carries the burden of God in history [and] for this has never been forgiven."" Gilder references the latter as a good summation of what Joseph Telushkin and Dennis Prager (Prager writes the foreword to The Israel Test) believe, but it didn't ring true and Gilder says as much. Such a view ascribes thought that's hard to find behind all the hatred.

More compelling is the explanation offered by Russian writer Maxim Gorky (and cited by Gilder) that anti-semites ""dislike the Jew only because he is obviously better, more adroit, and more capable of work than they are."" Gilder seems to agree with Gorky. He writes that ""The source of anti-Semitism is Jewish superiority and excellence."" Gilder and Gorky are difficult to argue with, but as Gilder himself notes, Israeli prosperity within Israel has been a magnet for Arabs. Which is important to stop and think about.

Bringing California back into the discussion, it's an undeniable fact that the Jews largely created a film industry that has lured millions west over the decades. More modernly, the technology industry that is heavily populated by Jews similarly exists as a major lure for non-Jews. Perhaps oddest of all, consider how Iranians and Jews live peacefully around each other in Beverly Hills at the same time that Iran the country is very public about its desire to destroy Israel.

It's all a long way of saying it reads as perhaps a little too simplistic to say as Israeli journalist (cited by Gilder) Caroline Glick does, that ""The enviers hate Israel."" There's got to be something more? The view here is that it's rooted in a lack of freedom. Where people are free to live and work as they wish, all the while broadly free of the excessive tax, regulatory, trade, and monetary barriers to production, they prosper alongside the Jews all the while recognizing how much they gain from getting to work alongside such remarkable talent. Again, Jewish prosperity is a magnet for much bigger populations that aren't Jewish.

It brings to mind a question once asked of an old boss: why was Hollywood giant Lew Wasserman so greatly revered? What was it about him? The reply was that Wasserman was ""Michael Jordan"" in the film industry. He made everyone better around him. The desire to be better resides within us all, but when government gets in the way with policy errors that limit the human ability to prosper, those most capable of outrunning government error are scapegoated.

Considering the above argument through the prism of the United States, no doubt there's anti-Semitism in the U.S. But arguably a major reason it's not nearly as evident in the U.S. has to do with all the immense economic opportunity that exists stateside. Contrast this with Germany and the Holocaust. It's seriously hard to imagine that Hitler ever attains power absent the gruesome devaluation of the mark in the aftermath of WWI that robbed so many of all that they'd worked for.

Where people are prospering, they don't have time nor the inclination for racist or murderous thoughts, nor do they seek scapegoats. As in, if the world were freer and by extension more unequal (in a free society genius is rewarded the most) and prosperous, the bet here is that anti-Semitism and its frequently murderous offshoots would be much less evident. This viewpoint shouldn't be construed as an attempt to excuse hideous, frequently gruesome behavior, but it is to say that prospering people are happier and less violent. Freedom is the fix for so much in the world, including anti-Semitism.

Conversely, opportunity suffocated unleashes anger and the desire for scapegoats. History is clear that Jews are routinely the scapegoated, and particularly because they've proven more capable of overcoming barriers to prosperity erected by governments. Gilder references Jewish fortitude with his discussion of what happened to the former Soviet Union under Gorbachev when ""the bulk of Soviet Jews"" were released. He describes what subsequently unfolded as the economic equivalent of ""a frontal lobotomy"" for the U.S.S.R. Yes, even where there was little to no freedom to prosper, Soviet Jews managed to prosper in a relative sense as Anya Gillinson anecdotally notes in her excellent new memoir, Dreaming In Russian.

It further speaks to the economic boom taking place in Israel now. The Soviet Union's loss was the world's gain; that, or parts of the world gained immeasurably from the unshackling of so much talent. Gilder writes that ""the most precious resource in the world economy is human genius,"" and a substantial portion of the Soviet Jews found their way to Israel once freed from the Soviet Union. Getting more specific, Gilder writes that ""immigrants from the Soviet Union constitute fully half of Israel's high-tech workers,"" and that VC outlays in Israel soared ""nearly sixty-fold from $58 million to $3.3 billion"" between 1991 and 2000 subsequent to their arrival. This looms large in consideration of the fact that ""Israel has become a center of innovation second in absolute achievement only to the United States."" Stop and think about it.

In thinking about what the Soviet Union (or Russia) lost in concert with Israel's gain, think back to the needless Cold War. Leaving aside the U.S.'s arms buildup, Ronald Reagan's much greater insight, one that Gilder doubtless helped Reagan arrive at, was that economically, culturally and personally unfree people would be no match for free people and the fruits of their freedom. No argument there, but stop and contemplate if Gorbachev (and those who came before him) had recognized the towering genius that was within the U.S.S.R./Russia all along. Russia quite simply had the people to be a global economic (and military) powerhouse if they'd just set the genius residing with Russia's borders free. It staggers the mind.

Lest we forget, Gilder believes deeply in a tee-shirt slogan spotted by his editor (Richard Vigilante) during an Israel visit, and which said ""Don't Worry America, Israel Is Behind You."" As he sees it, both the U.S. economy and its military would be substantially reduced without the existence of the same Israel that's been so profoundly lifted economically and militarily by Jews from the former Soviet Union. It's a long way of saying that when Vladimir Putin claims the collapse of the Soviet empire ""was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,"" he's engaging in non sequitur. More realistically, the Soviet Union's or Russia's failure of its own Israel Test was right up there among the biggest Russian tragedies.

As for greatest catastrophe of the century, geopolitical or economic, it would have to be World War II whereby so much of the world's genius was tragically exterminated. About this mass slaughter of Jews, Gilder is so very correct with his assertion that ""the rest of the world has suffered even more in absolute terms by the loss of the vast potential of the six million Jewish victims whose only sin was being Jewish on the European continent in the twentieth century."" About Gilder's oh-so-correct statement, one that he in no way wrote to minimize the suffering of Jews, let's please allow it to exist as yet another indictment of a profession (economics) that makes astrology appear serious by comparison, and whose PhDs assert near-monolithically that the upside of World War II was that it ended the Great Depression.

It would be difficult to find a sicker and more ferociously obtuse viewpoint than the one held by the vast majority of ""trained economists"" about WWII's (and war in general) allegedly positive growth implications. Nothing could be further from the truth, or more dangerous. As Gilder makes plain, ""no one can be rich alone."" Oh well, according to economists Gilder is incorrect. So deluded are they by the GDP ""gains ""achieved via killing, maiming, wealth destruction, and the rebuilding of wealth destroyed, that they've somehow come to the conclusion that the latter ended the Great Depression, after which American producers were allegedly rendered better off by a supine Europe suddenly bereft of its vital few. Worse is that economists have spread their tragic misunderstanding of prosperity to high-level thinkers like Yuval Levin and Edward Conard at American Enterprise Institute who claim that what makes the 1950s so attractive to nostalgic Americans is that so much of the rest of the was destroyed. Adam Smith is no doubt looking down mystified.

What happened in Europe alone doesn't just indict an economics profession that embarrasses itself in all sorts of ways all day and every day (those same economists also believe economic growth causes inflation), it also to some degree exposes American conservatism as less serious than its practitioners would like to believe. Think ""Eurosclerosis"" and the various pejoratives lobbed at Europe by conservatives in similar fashion to how they denigrate California. According to conservatives, the biggest driver of ""Eurosclerosis"" is excessive rates of taxation that deaden the incentive to work.

About the good of lowering taxes all and every way possible, no argument against will be made here. Taxes are a price, or a penalty placed on work and investment. At the same time, conservatives shrink themselves yet again when they ascribe Europe's relative lack of prosperity to ""tax rates."" What has Europe less prosperous was anti-Semitism that revealed itself in the most murderous of ways. Absent it, stop and think how rich Europe would be today, and by extension how much better off the world would be.

Quoting Gilder the same way but a second time, ""the most precious resources in the world economy is human genius."" It lifts us all, only for sickening envy (Gilder, Gorky, Glick) or a lack of freedom (Tamny, surely many others) to reveal itself occasionally in the form of anti-Semitism that shrinks the portion of the population most crucial to cultural, health, and economic progress.

What Gilder believes about the importance of the individually brilliant brought to mind quibbles on occasion. In particular, his chapter about Benjamin Netanyahu as the man that propelled Israel ""into the modern world of finance"" wasn't as compelling as the book's many other arguments. For one, capital always and everywhere finds genius as Gilder's own VC stats for Israel (a sixty-fold increase between 1991 and 2000) indicate. For two, the previous surge was per Gilder himself a function of the arrival of brilliant Soviet Jewry.

This isn't to say that Nethanyahu didn't bring better, more pro-growth policies to Israel. If Gilder says he did, than he did. At the same time, and as overtaxed and over-governed locales like California and New York remind us, talent trumps policy by many miles.

More on Netanyahu, the book plainly went to print before the tragedy of October 7, 2023. No expert on Israel (I've never even visited), isn't the primary job of the prime minister in Israel to protect the people from the many terrorists who mean it the worst of harm? If Netanyahu is so heroic, doesn't he deserve the slings and arrows of the present, and much, much more?

Which leads to another quibble with Gilder's analysis. He writes that anti-Zionists view Israel as a mistake because of ""discrimination against Arabs, sorely maldistributed wealth and income, a runaway engine of west bank settlements that represent an imperial 'occupation,'"" etc. Maybe that's the consensus view, but my problem with Israel is that as presently constituted, it places the most brilliant people on earth directly in harm's way.

The above had me wanting to ask Gilder while reading his spectacular book if Israel itself passes the Israel Test? By Gilder's own estimation, many of the best and brightest within Israel share the negative views of the country held by some of its most ardent critics. That being the case, how can it survive? This is important precisely given Gilder's own assertion that ""no nation is more important to the survival of the United States and the world than Israel."" If true, or even if not true, is Israel itself passing the Israel Test?

About this question, in the aftermath of 10/7 I found myself arguing with Jewish friends that Israel must cease wasting Israeli lives on these wars. What is gained? Gilder argues that ""conspicuous weakness is a prime cause of war,"" and that's long been the right's consensus, but what good did the latter do the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan, and seriously, what good has it done Israel? Its military superiority well established time after time (think 1948, 1967, 1973, and many times since), the killers keep coming.

Back to the argument made, I wanted Netanyahu to not respond, to let the hideous videos of heinous Hamas acts travel around the world in concert with intense quiet from Israel. I then wanted Netanyahu to announce that there would be no invasion of Gaza given an aversion to wasting even one more precious Israeli life on a war that never ends. That instead, Israel had hired the Wagner Group to man the country's borders. If the Arabs can't be asked to live among Jews, they would henceforth no longer be allowed to work with Jews inside Israel. In concert with the arrival of Wagner, a wall would be built with the money saved by not going to war yet again with people who value life much less than the Jews do.

None of what's been written is meant as yet another apology for Israel's alleged mis-behavior. Not at all. At the same time, it's a stab at what your reviewer imagines to be realism: the Arabs will never give up. Since they won't, it's time to put to bed the right's mantra about ""conspicuous weakness"" as the ""prime cause of war."" Let's replace it with government is always and everywhere incompetent, and governments are populated with too many people too eager to go to war. It's not working.

Beyond that, by Gilder's own admission Israel is heavily populated with Shaul Olmert-types who are remarkably brilliant, but who are uncomfortable with Israel vis-à-vis those who surround it and who mean it harm. The mention of Olmert once again isn't an expression of agreement with him, but it's a comment that he arguably represents a growing portion of the Israeli population eager to innovate over engage in endless war. Though militarily quite skillful, the Jews aren't a warring people, period. Worse, they're up against people with less to live for, and who are seemingly willing to wait them out.

Three quarters of the way through The Israel Test, Gilder cites a speech given by Nobel Prize winning Israeli game theorist, Robert Aumann. At a presentation of his that Gilder attended in Toronto, Aumann observed that, ""over history many peoples have been expelled from their homes. Only the Jews have been expelling themselves, their own people. From their own homes and synagogues, towns and farms. From Sinai, from Gaza, from the West Bank, from Jerusalem, only the Jews."" Aumann's observation is the counter to the assertion that the Israelis should just take their genius elsewhere, and far away from the Arabs. Aumann makes a hard-to-argue-with case that the Jews have been compromising for way too long, and it's beyond wrong to ask them to move again.

At the same time, and per Gilder, ""if the Arabas or Iranians desired peace, they would have long ago achieved it."" Absolutely. Which is telling. Peace isn't the goal, and it's something to keep well in mind in concert with Gilder's correct assertion that ""the survival of the Jews is vital to the triumph of free economies."" In that very real sense, it's difficult to conclude from this remarkable book anything other than that the United States and Israel are failing The Israel Test, and that their ongoing failure threatens the rest of the free world."
"Pressed on grocery prices, Trump struggles to answer (again)",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-grocery-prices-trump-struggles-answer-rcna171646,2024-09-18T15:58:29Z,"The problem is not just that Trump struggled with a simple question about inflation. The problem is that he keeps struggling with the same simple question.

At his latest town-hall-style event, Donald Trump was asked by a woman in Michigan how, in a second term, he'd bring down the cost of groceries. The former president responded with a great many words, including comments about windmills, though he didn't quite get around to answering the question directly.

To the extent that there was a kernel of an idea in the Republican's response, Trump suggested that he expected to lower food costs for consumers by restricting food imports, which really doesn't make any sense.

This was not, however, an isolated incident. The GOP candidate also fielded some voters' questions in Wisconsin a few weeks ago and was asked about how he'd lower consumer prices. Trump struggled to answer then, too.

Three weeks before that, he also fielded questions from voters at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota, one of whom asked about high consumer prices. Trump initially responded by talking about his popularity among those at the event, before suggesting that oil drilling -- which the United States is already doing at record levels -- will solve everyone's troubles.

In other words, Trump has faced variations of the same question three times in two months, and in each instance, he's struggled to present voters with coherent answers.

Why is that? Putting aside the obvious fact that the former president doesn't know or care about public policy, there are three elements to keep in mind.

The first is that inflation rates are already falling, putting Trump at a disadvantage: He's vowing to make progress on an issue on which the country is already seeing progress.

The second is that the Republican nominee simply doesn't have anything resembling a credible plan related to consumer costs. Trump has presented a handful of bumper-sticker-style slogans, and he's talked about asking others to help him come up with ideas he lacks,

Finally, there's the inconvenient fact that Trump's agenda includes a variety of priorities that would almost certainly make inflation worse -- as economists keep trying to tell the public.

Keep this in mind the next time the GOP candidate flubs the same question, which will probably be soon."

Federal law requires voters to swear on their registration forms that they are U.S. citizens, under risk of perjury, but it does not require them to provide proof. Studies consistently show attempts to break the law are rare, including an audit by Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that found 1,634 non-citizens attempted to register to vote between 1997 and 2022, but none actually voted. The libertarian Cato Institute also determined ""there is no good evidence that noncitizens voted illegally in large enough numbers to actually shift the outcome of elections or even change the number of electoral votes.""

Congress has until midnight on Sept. 30, the end of the 2024 fiscal year, to approve a new spending plan to avert a government shutdown. Some Republicans have threatened to oppose any bill that does not include the voting provision, and Trump has urged lawmakers to allow a shutdown without it. The House is expected to vote Wednesday on legislation that would extend the existing plan temporarily to give lawmakers time to work out a deal for a new fiscal year 2025 budget. The House bill, with the voting provision attached, is dead-on-arrival in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

39%. That's the share of Scripps/Ipsos poll respondents who said immigration is the most important issue facing the country, second only to inflation.

Trump is planning a litany of strict anti-immigration policies if he's re-elected, including prohibiting undocumented immigrants from receiving any benefits, reinstituting his so-called ""travel ban"" from certain countries and ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants. He has also promised to shut down the border to asylum seekers. Trump has repeatedly, and wrongly claimed, Harris is responsible for an increase in illegal immigration as the White House ""border czar,"" mischaracterizing her responsibilities related to immigration related to her role in looking at developing policies to curb migration from three Central American countries. Harris has not provided extensive details on her immigration policies, but she has blamed Trump for urging Republicans to kill a bipartisan border bill that would have installed new limitations for asylum seekers.

How Will Interest Rate Cut Impact Election? Here's What To Know Ahead Of Key Fed Decision.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/18/how-will-interest-rate-cut-impact-election-heres-what-to-know-ahead-of-key-fed-decision/,2024-09-18T15:26:40Z,"The Federal Reserve's final meeting before Election Day concludes Wednesday, one of its most consequential meetings in recent memory as the central bank is likely to enact the first rate cuts in 4.5 years, a move panned by former President Donald Trump and likely celebrated by Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris and Trump have sparred over the Fed before. Trump made waves in August when he proclaimed the president should have a ""say"" in Fed decision making, saying he specifically is qualified because he ""made a lot of money"" and has ""better instinct than...people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,"" though Trump later walked back the stance by saying the Fed staff doesn't ""have to listen"" to him.

The U.S.' central bank's most important function is arguably determining the federal funds rate, the interest charged for capital reserve transactions between financial institutions, set by a panel of Fed officials known as the Federal Open Market Committee. The federal funds rate is often broadly just referred to as interest rates, considering its outsized influence on most U.S. borrowing from corporate bonds to new car loans. The bank historically runs independently from the rest of the federal government, guided by a ""dual mandate"" to minimize inflation and maximize employment, meaning its goal is to set the U.S. economy on a long-term path of growth. The Fed typically raises rates when inflation is too high, like it did in 2022 and 2023, and lowers rates when there's a threat of a serious economic downturn, like it did in early 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Other than conducting its monetary policy objectives, the Fed also regulates commercial banks and controls how much money is in circulation.

Little to none in theory, given the Fed's pride in independent decision making. However, the president appoints and the Senate confirms the Fed's seven board of governors, who have permanent seats on the 12-person Federal Open Markets Committee. Biden appointed four of the Fed governors, though Trump tapped Powell to the top central banker job he's held since 2018.

One of the Federal Open Markets Committee's eight annual meetings takes place Tuesday and Wednesday, which is crucially the last meeting before the Nov. 5 election. Consensus is unusually split on what the Fed is expected to do, with market-implied probabilities of the Fed decision the least settled since Bank of America research began tracking the metric. Derivative trades monitored by CME Group price in a roughly 60% chance of a 50 basis-point cut announcement Wednesday and 35% odds for a 25 basis-point move (the 75 basis points suggested by Warren does not have much legs). However, the market-implied odds of at least a 0.25 percentage point cut is firmly at 100%, meaning the first rate cut since March 2020 is an all but certainty to come Wednesday.

Not all Republicans agree with Trump's opposition to a rate cut Wednesday. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) recently told Politico ""the time is right"" and ""you've got to put the greater good ahead of looking political,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told the publication ""it is time"" for a cut and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) concurred it's ""probably time"" for the move and focusing on the data, rather than perhaps controversial timing, is ""the way the Fed should operate.""

How Crushing Sovereign Debt Supports Bitcoin Price And Stablecoins,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/18/how-crushing-sovereign-debt-supports-bitcoin-price-and-stablecoins/,2024-09-18T15:20:06Z,"There have been waves of Bitcoin adoption -- from individuals to institutions to now some of the largest nation-states in the world. It can be dizzying to keep track of with Bitcoin stuck in a price valley and yet closing to new highs in terms of awareness. One trend that has been quietly brewing has been a crisis of debt issued by nations.

It's estimated that more than one in three countries is in an acute debt crisis, especially after the post-COVID era. The reasons vary from incompetent leaders to economic crises after the response to COVID-19. The long-term trend of so much state debt creates a strong foundation for Bitcoin and a potential bridge for stablecoins - that might be hard to separate from stagnation around the $58,000 price level and a persistent medium-term correlation with financial speculation.

1- The United States is creating massive amounts of debt - and Tether is sponging it up

The United States Treasury, the debt issued by the US federal government, is the bedrock of the world financial system. Countries choose to save it as a reserve asset. The price of debt worldwide often depends on the rates set within. Books like Paper Soldiers have described how the United States is now weaponizing this dollar dominance and system. However, BRICS countries such as China and Russia are responding to this weaponization and sanctions regime by turning away from American debt, most notably China, which had been one of the world's largest buyers of Treasuries. Foreign reserves in dollars are around 58% - the lowest on record.

Stablecoins are filling some of the demand as top-down states seek to move away from each other by offering broader US dollar virtual accounts outside of the domestic banking system, including to many Chinese buyers. Tether, the world's largest stablecoin, mostly buys Treasuries as collateral to maintain a 1:1 reserve for every Tether issued. Their US Treasury custodian, Cantor Fitzgerald, is an American company embedded deeply in world finance as one of 25 primary dealers that can trade directly with the Federal Reserve. In the halls of Congress, the discussion of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies reigns high - and will only continue as stablecoins like Tether start playing a major role in buying up Treasuries in a world where the United States is more indebted than it ever has been. Tether itself has claimed it may become the largest new buyer of treasuries, leapfrogging countries and US allies, such as the United Kingdom.

2- As domestic currencies are debased, inflation grows, and currencies lose value relative to Bitcoin

Over the long run, weaker currencies are already undergoing periods of having large sovereign debt and weak currency demand. The United States is in a position where large fiscal deficits can be sustained because of the foreign demand for US debt, the cornerstone of the world financial system. Other countries aren't as fortunate. Interest rates on their domestic bonds must go down to sustain paying debt. Any debt they pay that is dollar-denominated involves swapping out domestic currency for the US dollar and creating more money supply - and inflation that comes with it as their currency weakens.

Bitcoin is now playing a role along with stablecoins like Tether for weaker countries that don't have as many financial services or access to the bedrock US dollar. Some choose to hedge against their domestic currency with Tether and other stablecoins. States like Venezuela, which has high inflation, also see high Bitcoin and stablecoin usage.

3- Eventually, China and the United States look like they're in short-term difficulties that may require more debt. A seismic flipping moment would be when Treasuries and USD are in trouble, which could be decades in the making

The idea of Ethereum displacing Bitcoin was once a meme. Now that Ether is trading at record lows vs. Bitcoin (not seen since 2021), Tether may be about to flip Ether, showing that demand for stablecoins seems to have caught up with the various applications proposed. Now, the question becomes whether you want digital savings and transactions in a system enmeshed in the old world or the potential new one. With China's bout with deflation and (relative) economic stagnation and the United States at all-time highs in absolute debt, both governments have structural reasons for why debt may continue growing in the case of the United States and where China's need to stimulate the economy may lead to a looser money supply and a weaker Yuan.

These factors may persist into the longer term of decades. As unlikely as it might seem now, lessons can be drawn from the United States dollar's rise to world reserve currency for Bitcoin.

Ultimately, even though the US dollar took many decades, a strong industrial base, and multiple wars to make its mark - the fact that so many people from across the world demand Bitcoin and Tether peer-to-peer regardless of what border separates them presents a growing movement: on the one hand, states that must issue more and more debt and which are running away from global integration of the world economy. On the other hand, people operating in a peer-to-peer manner holding Bitcoin. In the short-term and medium-term Bitcoin and stablecoins will likely command some attention from those looking to flee domestic debt crises. In the long term, if Bitcoin commands economic gravitas the way nation-states used to give their paper money to the United States for the world's largest gold reserves, it has a path to becoming the world's preferred money."
"""Crecimiento"" Movement Seeks To Make Argentina A Crypto Hub",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/astanley/2024/09/18/crecimiento-movement-seeks-to-make-argentina-a-crypto-hub/,2024-09-18T15:02:31Z,"Argentina's crypto community is seeing president Javier Milei's bull in a china shop approach to reform as a once-in-a-generation opportunity.

Enter the Crecimiento movement, which has united Argentina's crypto pioneers and global players behind a shared vision of turning the country into a hub for crypto innovation. The movement has amassed a community of 1,500 strong, both locals and gringos alike, on Telegram.

While Milei has never fully articulated his views or intentions towards cryptocurrency, his ethos - broadly aligned with that of crypto - along with other macroeconomic factors have created an Overton window for novel solutions.

The idea is to fuse Argentina's unique combination of homegrown crypto talent, innovation by necessity and a political window afforded by Milei to create an environment for incubating blockchain startups and solutions. Ideally, these innovations will help to undue nearly 70 years of economic and monetary policy failures.

""The end goal of Crecimiento is to transform our country into a crypto and blockchain country, attract capital, and attract talent to add on to the talent that we already have,"" Diego Fernandez, Secretary of Innovation and Digital Transformation for the city of Buenos Aires, said in an interview.

Argentina is already known as a global hotspot for crypto adoption, particularly stablecoins. The country placed 15th in the Chainalysis 2024 Geography of Cryptocurrency Index - widely regarded as the gold standard on such matters.

Triple digit inflation and currency controls have forced people to find alternative means of storing value and transacting.

""It's not only that we can't rely on our own currency, it's that we're legally blocked from relying on other ones,"" said Mili Santamaria, a crypto attorney now working with the Crecimiento core team.

Crecimiento aims to tackle these problems at the technological level. The movement kicked into high gear in August with Aleph, a month-long ""pop up city"" that convened more than two thousand builders, investors, mentors and enthusiasts in Buenos Aires with the goal of incubating startups and solutions. Blue chip industry names like Avalanche, ZKsync, Solana, Worldcoin, Polygon, and IPFS and Filecoin founder Juan Benet - ponied up financial support for the initiative. My employer Filecoin Foundation was a sponsor of the Aleph hackathon.

The Aleph city has created a physical manifestation of the digitally native Crecimiento community. At its facility in the Palermo neighborhood one finds a large co-work space offering daily programming, workshops and hackathons, as well as yoga, meditation, football tournaments and other leisure activities.

68 startups are now heads-down working on unsexy yet actionable solutions such as payment rails, new stablecoin models, privacy features, and RWA tokenization that could one day rewire Argentina's financial plumbing.

But impacting Argentina's trajectory for the better will require more than just attracting talent and generating buzz. As such, a core goal of Crecimiento is to ensure sustainable growth opportunities by improving Argentina's shaky business and regulatory climate.

""We're very volatile not just in terms of currency but also on the regulatory and tax front,"" said Santamaria in an interview, emphasizing that the goal is not just to spin up promising crypto startups, but to make sure that they don't leave.

She has been leading an effort to identify pain points for startups and address them through the public policy process. Solutions like special economic zones, special tax zones and regulatory sandboxes, could -- if successfully implemented -- provide the clarity needed for the local startup scene to thrive.

""We have the local talent, but we need better regulations to achieve our dream of having Argentina and Buenos Aires as one of the capitals, or the capital, of the crypto industry."""
"Raising Corporate Tax Rate To Expand Child Tax Credit Would Hurt Economy, Says New Study",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2024/09/18/raising-corporate-tax-rate-to-expand-child-tax-credit-would-hurt-economy-says-new-study/,2024-09-18T14:07:37Z,"Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) expire at the end of 2025, including the individual income tax cuts and the doubling of the standard deduction. This looming expiration means the next President and the 119 Congress will have to pass a new law to prevent tax increases on the middle class at a time when families are still struggling with inflation. Some have suggested a larger child tax credit (CTC) be included in any new law, but a new study finds that raising the corporate tax rate to pay for a bigger CTC would reduce economic growth, wages, and employment.

Prior to the TCJA, the maximum CTC was $1,000 per child under 16 and it phased out after $75,000 for a single earner or $110,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The TCJA expanded the CTC to $2,000 per child and increased the phase outs to $200,000 for a single earner and $400,000 for a married couple, along with some other small changes.

Many Democrats did not think the changes in the TCJA went far enough, so an even larger CTC was included in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) passed in 2021 on partisan lines with all Republicans opposing. The ARPA temporarily increased the CTC to $3,600 per child aged zero to five and $3,000 for each child aged six to 17. Vice President Kamala Harris has supported this larger CTC and will likely advocate for it during any negotiations next year if she wins in November. Some Republicans in Congress have also signaled support for a larger CTC.

One possible way to pay for a larger CTC is to raise the corporate tax rate. The TCJA permanently reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and studies show this change increased investment and wages. It follows that reversing this tax cut to pay for a larger CTC would undo at least some of these economic benefits, and that is precisely what a new study from the American Action Forum (AAF) finds. The study estimates that the corporate tax rate would have to increase by 10 percentage points to 31% to fully pay for the permanent, expanded CTC. This tax increase would reduce GDP, after-tax wages, investment, and jobs, as shown in the table below.

The AAF study is consistent with other studies that show that increases in corporate tax rates reduce wages, investment, and employment. Given these harmful economic effects, lawmakers should think twice about raising the corporate tax rate to pay for the CTC or any other government program.

To the extent a bigger child tax credit is needed, there are dozens of ineffective federal programs that could be reformed or cut to pay for a child tax credit. The Government Accountability Office recently identified $236 billion in improper government payments last year alone, which is more than enough to pay for a larger CTC.

There are better ways for policymakers to help families that do not involve raising taxes. A strong economy that provides plentiful job opportunities is the best way to strengthen families and reduce poverty. The federal government can eliminate unnecessary red tape and reform rules like the National Environmental Policy Act to make it easier for us to build things like housing, roads, mines, and power plants. Construction creates good-paying jobs, especially for people without four-year college degrees, and children from families with at least one consistently working parent do better than those from families where the parents experience long periods of joblessness.

State policymakers also have a role to play in creating a strong economy. Like federal regulation, state regulation can slow the economy and hurt the labor market. Structural reforms such as the one recently passed in Kansas that requires legislative approval for high-cost administrative rules give elected lawmakers more control over regulations. Ultimately, this can lead to better, less burdensome regulation by increasing transparency and accountability.

Raising the corporate tax rate is not a good way to help children or families. Though it may seem harmless, studies consistently show that higher corporate tax rates reduce wages and employment, and AAF's new study shows these costs offset any benefit that may come from a larger CTC. Strong economic growth is the best way to help families, and lawmakers should remember this when tax negotiations start."
These factory workers were swamped by medical debt. Then their employer stepped in,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5100642/medical-debt-solution-free-primary-care,2024-09-18T13:41:54Z,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Like most medical offices, the small suite of exam rooms at the PhiferCares Clinic fills daily with patients seeking help with bumps and bruises, sore throats, and stuffy noses.

But there's an important difference about this clinic in central Alabama: No one gets a bill, including for prescriptions.

That's because the clinic is owned by a manufacturing company with a specific agenda. ""We don't want you to spend money on health care,"" said Russell DuBose, vice president of human resources at Phifer.

Phifer, a global manufacturer of window screens, opened the clinic five years ago in a bid to control its health care costs and stop big medical bills from driving its workers into debt. The strategy has paid big dividends. Phifer has saved so much on health care that the company was able to open a free summer camp for the children of employees.

Workers have dramatically boosted retirement savings, too. And Phifer is now adding chiropractic care and orthotics, all at no cost to workers.

Benefits like these remain out of reach for most U.S. workers, millions of whom drain savings, take out second mortgages, or cut back on food and other essentials to stay ahead of health care debt. Overall, about 100 million people in the U.S. are burdened by some form of this debt, according to an investigation by KFF Health News and NPR.

Many of those people have health plans through employers who, unable to control their health care costs, now force workers to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket when they go to a doctor. Phifer has shown there's another way. The company not only saved itself money, it's sharing the benefits with workers and shielding them from debt.

""It's really remarkable,"" said Shawn Gremminger, president of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which works with employers on improving health benefits.

""If I had to point to a single employer in our network that's been the most aggressive tackling this problem and coming up with the most innovative solutions,"" he said, ""it's a relatively small, privately owned manufacturer in a small town in the South.""

Phifer is a family-owned company founded after World War II by a former pilot.

J. Reese Phifer saw an opportunity to turn aluminum produced for the war effort into window screens for America's booming suburbs.

Today Phifer still makes screens at a cavernous plant outside Tuscaloosa that stretches over more than 34 acres of factory floor. Inside, massive rolls of aluminum coil are unwound, stretched, and spun on rows of spools and looms. Elsewhere, fiberglass is woven into material for window shades, patio furniture, and other products.

Business has been good for the company, which employs about 2,000 people and operates plants in Alabama and overseas. A few years ago, though, Phifer noticed its workers weren't saving enough for retirement. The culprit was medical bills.

""Copays, coinsurance, cost sharing. All these things were taking money away from our plan members,"" DuBose said. ""The amount of money employees were having to spend on health care was unacceptable.""

That's not unusual. Most U.S. workers and their families are in a health plan with significant cost sharing, requiring they pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket before coverage kicks in.

The average deductible for an employer-provided health plan now exceeds $1,500, data shows. And for family plans, deductibles can be several times that. That's a big reason health care debt is such a big problem, even for people with health coverage.

For Phifer, which relies on skilled workers to operate its machines, reducing employees' financial stress became a priority, DuBose said. ""When you have somebody who wants to be here every day, wants to be here every year,"" he said, ""they can do some pretty awesome stuff.""

Phifer landed on a deceptively simple idea: Make it easier -- and cheaper -- for workers to see a doctor and fill a prescription. That, the company reasoned, could improve employee health and control costly complications.

The cornerstone of this plan was the PhiferCares Clinic and pharmacy.

The company set up the clinic in a small park and recreation space Phifer owned down the road from the factory. It contracted with a local health system to provide the physician and nurses. Inside is a small pharmacy.

At no cost, employees and their families can go in for basic primary care, including checkups, vaccinations, and help managing chronic illnesses like diabetes. ""It's almost a concierge service,"" DuBose said.

Phifer did something else, too. It directs patients to specialists and hospitals with the highest quality ratings. That can save money for patients and the company. Workers who choose one of these providers typically don't get a bill.

That kind of no-cost access makes a huge difference, said Ronald Lewis, who visited the PhiferCares Clinic recently for a checkup.

""I'm saving thousands of dollars, easy. Easy $3,000,"" said Lewis, whose wife works at the plant. ""All you've got to do is come in, make an appointment, and they come in and see you. ... It is a life-changer.""

The clinic has helped Lewis lose weight and keep his blood pressure in check. A doctor also caught early signs of prostate cancer.

Cherry Wilson, who has worked on a production line at Phifer since 2017, said she still has medical debt from a gallbladder surgery she had before she joined the company. But when she broke her foot more recently and got surgery from a preferred specialist, there were no medical bills. ""I don't pay anything here,"" she said.

Other companies have experimented with workplace clinics with mixed results.

Running a medical office can be expensive. The strategy may not work if employees aren't centrally located or if employee turnover is high. And savings can take a while to materialize. But research on employer health benefits has shown that reducing how much workers pay for primary care and prescription drugs yields better outcomes for workers and can save everybody money.

Phifer is reaping rewards.

Despite years of high inflation nationally, the company's net spending on health care was lower in 2023 than in 2019, declining from $15.8 million to $14.9 million in constant dollars, according to data provided by DuBose.

The cost of the company's most popular health plan -- which comes with no deductible and includes dental benefits -- is lower, as well. Phifer workers pay $394 a month for this family plan. By comparison, workers nationally contribute $548 monthly on average for family coverage that typically comes with a sizable deductible.

""We've seen the power of prevention,"" DuBose said.

With savings from its health care strategy, Phifer opened the summer camp last year. And the company is offering college scholarships to workers' children.

Workers are saving more, too. About 90% are hitting their retirement goals, DuBose said, up from around 75% five years ago.

The protections from big medical bills have had another benefit, said Jerry Wheat, who has worked for Phifer for 38 years and runs a production line for fiberglass screens.

""It makes you want to take care of yourself and do better for the company,"" Wheat said. ""If somebody's going to take care of you, don't you want to take care of them? That's the way I look at it. But I'm old-school."""
Make Bitcoin Nonpartisan Again,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/18/make-bitcoin-nonpartisan-again/,2024-09-18T13:27:37Z,"Bitcoin is not just for Republicans. Or Democrats. Or even Libertarians.

Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the annual Bitcoin conference this year in Nashville was the predominance of political figures, including former President Trump. They hail from both sides of the aisle, though lean Republican. The Bitcoiner community embraced the politicians with open arms, at times fawning over the very political gatekeepers that Bitcoin, in principle, opposes.

It is unsurprising that in an election year, all conversations become political. And a presidential candidate speaking at a major Bitcoin conference is a big step for Bitcoin. Who would have thought that a white paper posted on an obscure mailing list would get attention from the current front-runner in the US presidential election? This was a milestone, no doubt about it. It is also unsurprising that the current debate around Bitcoin has a political overtone. After all, Bitcoin's fundamental idea separates politics from money, and therefore has its roots in libertarian political philosophy. Many of the opponents of Bitcoin today have come from the government, whether that is the Chinese Communist Party, who banned Bitcoin, or certain Massachusetts senators.

However, advocating for Bitcoin along political lines would be a mistake. For one, Bitcoin is a technology, and like all technology, does not discriminate on political beliefs. The technological foundation of Bitcoin -- public-key cryptography, computer networking, and economic incentives -- is based on science, not politics. Your own views on the size and scope of government do not matter for the digital transfer of value across a distributed network of computers.

And Bitcoin's ability to store value through its unique mechanism of digital scarcity is also not a partisan issue. As Michael Saylor noted during his keynote at the Nashville conference, every asset experiences some kind of inflation or tax: equities are subject to the whims of the CEO or corporate management; land is subject to the decisions of mayors and the city council; bonds and real estate returns depend on the choices of the central bank. Bitcoin rests on an algorithm enforced by a global network of computer nodes and is scientifically less privy to manipulation and capture.

The history of sound money is rooted in Austrian economics, most notably intellectuals like Hayek, Rothbard, and Mises. While it is tempting to argue that their ideas are more conservative than liberal, the truth is, classical liberal thinkers like them are equally ignored by both the political right and left. Mainstream macroeconomic thought from both sides of the political aisle equally embraces the concept of a central bank, which is now embedded into the collective consciousness of the modern world. Bitcoin's focus on private property, individual liberty, and self-sovereignty upends the political beliefs of both Democrats and Republicans.

And so, it is a mistake to pigeonhole Bitcoin into just one political ideology. I was happy to see Congressman Ro Khanna join a panel on the progressive case for Bitcoin. The errors of the Federal Reserve took place under both Republican and Democrat administrations, and the mistakes of fiat banking are felt by all, regardless of their political affiliation. The logic of scarce, sound money applies equally well to the political left and right.

So let's not be too quick to cheer for one party over another in its embrace of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will have succeeded if it becomes as politically controversial as vanilla ice cream on a hot summer day."
Fed Rate Cuts Are Set To Begin,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/18/fed-rate-cuts-are-set-to-begin/,2024-09-18T13:10:25Z,"Investors, economists, and executives eagerly await a cut in the federal funds rate today. The size of the Federal Reserve's September rate cut today is up in the air. However, cuts are set to begin, which could provide a much-needed boost to interest-rate-sensitive industries, the labor market, and growth.

The Federal Reserve is likely to cut the federal funds rate today. However, while an interest rate cut is expected, market expectations are divided about the chance of a 0.25% or a 0.5% rate cut.

As of September 18 at 8:29 a.m. ET, the CME FedWatch tool reflected the odds of a 0.5% rate cut at 45%, with the odds of a 0.25% rate cut at a higher 55%. These odds have changed greatly in the past week. In fact, the odds of a 0.5% rate cut was only 14% on September 11.

The Fed has a dual mandate to foster full employment and keep prices low and stable.

The labor market is solid, with a low unemployment rate of only 4.2% in August and almost 7.7 million open jobs in July. Jobless claims also remain relatively low.

However, inflation remains elevated, with year-on-year Total CPI up 2.5% and Core CPI up 3.2% in August. The latest PCE inflation data is for July when the U.S. PCE was up 2.5%, and Core PCE was up 2.6%. All of these key year-on-year consumer inflation rates are above the Fed's 2% target.

Since inflation is elevated, this is likely to keep the Fed from raising rates very quickly or significantly.

While financial market participants will be watching the Fed's interest rate decision closely, they will also be paying close attention to the forecasts of the Federal Open Market Committee -- or FOMC. Most important will be the FOMC member median forecasts of future interest rates.

A table of all the FOMC forecasts will be released today at 2 p.m. ET, including interest rates, GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the unemployment rate. The forecasted interest rates also appear in a graphic depiction that economists and analysts refer to as the dotplot, which shows anonymized individual FOMC member forecasts of future interest rates.

Prestige Economics expects the dotplot of Median FOMC member forecasts are likely to convey that the Fed members expect to enact additional rate cuts in 2024 and 2025. Any change from the June 2024 dotplot will be critical for financial markets.

The last set of FOMC forecasts from June 2024 reflected that the FOMC median forecast of interest rates for the end of 2024 was 5.1%, for the end of 2025 was 4.1% in June, and for the end of 2026 was 3.1%. Fed member forecasts of jobs and GDP growth were still generally positive in June.

If the median end-of-year expectations for interest rates fall in the September FOMC forecasts, this would likely weigh on the dollar and bond yields, while also being supportive of equity, industrial commodity, and bond prices.

Following the FOMC statement and forecasts, a great deal of attention will be paid to Fed Chair Powell's remarks in his press conference, especially the timing of future additional Fed interest rate cuts. He is likely to reiterate the notion that Fed policy is not on a set course and that the FOMC will be data-dependent in their decision-making.

What do you expect from the Fed's policy decision and FOMC member forecasts today?"
U.S. Bank Wealth Management BrandVoice: How Presidential Elections Affect The Stock Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/us-bank-wealth-management/2024/09/18/how-presidential-elections-affect-the-stock-market/,2024-09-18T12:43:43Z,"While investors take an interest in the election, it helps to maintain a proper perspective on the potential impact on capital markets.

While the year began with a fairly predictable Presidential election matchup, much has changed over the summer months. Former President Donald Trump easily cruised to his third consecutive Republican nomination. However, just days after July's Republican National Convention ended with Trump selecting first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, Democratic President Joe Biden chose to drop out of the race, endorsing his Vice President, Kamala Harris as his replacement. Since that time, Harris earned the formal nomination and added Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to the ticket as her running mate.

The revised Democratic slate appeared to shake up the state of the contest. While former President Trump came away from the Republican convention with solid momentum and an edge in what are considered the ""battleground"" states most likely to decide the election's outcome, Vice President Harris' campaign rapidly gained momentum. The race is again considered to be fairly even based on the latest polling.1

The stock market experienced some volatility during this period of electoral tumult, but that's largely attributable to economic concerns related to a recent disappointing jobs market report. Markets reflected anxiety about the economy's resilience and whether the Federal Reserve (Fed) had delayed interest rate cuts for too long. This is one factor obscuring the capital markets impact of the Presidential race. ""The market today is more focused on corporate earnings and the potential for Fed interest rate cuts,"" says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. However, with election season heating up, the outcome's potential impact might draw greater investor focus.

Changing electoral dynamics

While the presidential contest's dimensions have changed, what's not clear is what the implications could be down the ballot, particularly with House and Senate races that will determine Congressional control.

Along with the headline Presidential race, one-third of the seats in the U.S. Senate (currently under narrow Democratic control) and all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives (currently under narrow Republican control) are also on the ballot this fall. Here, too, a small margin may determine control beginning in 2025, with winners in many closely contested seats difficult to predict. It is conceivable that the election outcome could result in one-party control of both houses of Congress and the Presidency, or a split between the two parties, as exists today.

""A key consideration for investors would be the policy direction of the winning candidate,"" says Haworth. ""The biggest policy advancements occur when one party controls the White House and both houses of Congress. Based on polls, we're a long way from that scenario at this point.""

As the November election nears, investors are likely to be more attuned to the potential ramifications of the election's outcome for businesses, the economy and capital markets. ""We need some clarity around key issues to be able to identify potential market winners and losers based on who wins the election,"" says Haworth. Candidates will likely draw more definitive policy distinctions as we enter the fall and the campaign becomes more focused. A scheduled September 10th Presidential debate between Harris and Trump is an opportunity to spell out such differences.

How issues might play out

Tax policy is one issue beginning to take shape. The most visible discussion centers on what happens to provisions of the Tax Cut & Jobs Act (TCJA), most of which are set to expire at the end of 2025. When passed in 2017, the package represented the most prominent domestic policy initiative of the Trump administration. If the provisions are extended, keeping tax rates lower, as former President Trump proposes, it creates new federal budget deficit concerns from the resulting tax collection reduction. To this point, the Trump campaign hasn't specified how to address deficit concerns, although it has raised the possibility of additional tariffs on imported goods as a method of boosting revenue (more on tariffs below).1

If some or all provisions of the TCJA aren't extended, tax rates could be higher for up to 60% of tax filers. Other expiring provisions would impact the standard deduction, child tax credits, and estate and gift tax exemption amounts and tax rates. For corporations, an expiration of TCJA would result in the top corporate tax rate moving from 21% back to 35%.

When still in the race, President Biden called for extending tax breaks for those earning $400,000 or less. At the same time, he proposed that provisions benefiting those earning more than $400,000 be allowed to expire. His plan also backed raising corporate tax rates and implementing a global minimum tax.2 Vice President Harris has not yet specified whether she also supports that approach. In the meantime, Trump recently proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 20%.3 Both Trump and Harris have also stated support to eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.4

Much more discussion and definition around potential tax policy is likely in the months ahead. ""It's still too early for investors to game out exactly how tax issues will play out over the election season,"" says Haworth.

Tariffs, particularly those placed on Chinese goods, have emerged as another issue. During his term as President, Trump implemented tariffs, and President Biden continued most of them and recently added more tariffs, reflecting a move away from previous free trade policies. The next President is likely to pursue fiscal stimulus policies to boost the economy, although likely with different combinations of tax incentives and higher spending.

Haworth says party control may have more impact at the sector level. ""For example, if Republicans win, there is likely to be more of a push for development of fossil fuels, while a Democratic win might further promote renewable energy development."" Yet Haworth says such policy tendencies don't always translate into investment outcomes. ""Ironically, businesses tied to renewable energy saw their stocks perform better under the Trump administration, while stocks of oil companies and other traditional energy companies have performed better under the Biden administration,"" notes Haworth.

How do election outcomes impact markets?

An old saying goes that ""elections have consequences."" But how do those results influence capital markets? And what are the potential ramifications for you as an investor? To better address this question, U.S. Bank investment strategists studied market data from the past 75 years and identified patterns that repeated themselves during election cycles.

The analysis points to minimal impact on financial market performance in the medium to long term based on potential election outcomes. The data also shows that market returns are typically more dependent on economic and inflation trends rather than election results.

What may be more important to investors is what the parties represent. ""Party platforms, which are hammered out at national conventions, often tell the markets more important information than the name of the winner or loser of the general election,"" says Haworth. ""Investors will try to determine which party is likely to be in power, and how that will benefit particular industry sectors of the market.""

How have election outcomes affected market performance in the past and how might potential scenarios play out in the 2024 presidential election?

A historical look at presidential elections' impact on the stock market

U.S. Bank investment strategists reviewed market data going back to 1948. Using average 3-month returns following each election outcome -- and comparing those with the average 3-month return during the full analysis history -- strategists calculated the statistical significance of the relationship between political control and market performance using a calculation called a t-statistic, or t-test.

A t-test determines whether one group of variables (in this case, the political composition of the White House and Congress) has a measurable effect on another variable (in this case, average three-month S&P 500* returns during the control period).

The analysis also looked at the exact periods of time when parties took control of different branches of government (rather than starting from election dates themselves), although this analysis resulted in similar outputs and conclusions.

Results of the analysis contradict conventional wisdom that a Republican or Democratic ""sweep"" of the presidency and Congress is most likely to cause market disruption. In fact, historically there has not been a statistically significant relationship between single-party control of both the White House and Congress and market performance.

Rather, the data uncovered three divided-government outcomes with a statistically significant relationship to market performance.

Two scenarios corresponded to positive absolute returns in excess of long-term average returns:

One scenario corresponded to positive absolute returns modestly below long-term average:

Historical economic and inflation trends and market performance

While investors may closely monitor election results for their potential effect on stock market performance, it's important to recognize that other factors that may have greater impact on their portfolios. The historical data suggests that economic and inflation trends, more so than election outcomes, tend to have a stronger, more consistent relationship with market returns.

In general, rising economic growth and falling inflation have been associated with returns that are considered above long-term averages, while falling growth and rising inflation have corresponded to positive but below average market returns. For investors, staying focused on these patterns is probably more insightful than potential election outcomes when it comes to forecasting market performance.

Stock market performance in midterm election years

When looking at midterm election data (elections held in between presidential elections), U.S. Bank investment strategists found that the S&P 500 consistently outperformed in the year after midterms compared with non-midterm years. Just like presidential elections, which party controls Congress generally was not a factor in projecting overall equity market performance.

These equity and bond market trends were consistent over time unless there was a dramatic disruption. Read more about how midterm elections affect the stock market.

Specific stock market sectors and key policy issues to watch in election years

While the analysis doesn't point to elections having a meaningful medium-to-long-term market impact, they could affect individual sectors and industries. Different election outcomes have the potential to affect proposed policies, regulations, or global conflicts.

The following are policy issues to monitor throughout the presidential nomination and election process:

In any election, there's also the potential for delays in verifying an election victor, particularly in closely contested races. At the presidential level, this occurred in both the 2000 election (settled with a Supreme Court verdict) and 2020 election (when the result was challenged by one candidate). In these instances, ensuing delays could lead to more uncertain election outcomes, in which case riskier asset classes might decline until clarity emerges.

Looking to the 2024 presidential election and post-election period

Harris and Trump are now officially the major party Presidential nominees. The composition and control of Congress resulting from the 2024 election is still up in the air but is another aspect of this year's election cycle that bears consideration. It also makes sense to keep an eye on which sectors are most likely to be affected by the potential for key policy changes. Despite the constant headlines revolving around elections, investors are well served to remain focused on factors such as economic growth, interest rates, inflation and corporate earnings when making portfolio decisions.

U.S. Bank Wealth Management BrandVoice: How To Invest In Today's Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/us-bank-wealth-management/2024/09/18/how-to-invest-in-todays-market/,2024-09-18T12:43:38Z,"Bond markets have struggled, as interest rates trend higher this year.

While the U.S. stock market set new record highs - led by a narrow band of large-cap stocks - in the first half of the year, many other S&P 500 sectors haven't kept pace. And bond markets continue to face challenges as long-term interest rates linger higher for longer.

Where today's market stands

S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite indexes continue to extend their respective bull market rallies, which date back to October 2022. As was the case last year, equities are led by tech stocks in 2024.

Stock market's year-to-date performance

So far in 2024, stock results have been widely divergent. Through June 30, 2024, the S&P 500 generated a total return of 15.29%. Meanwhile, the Russell MidCap Index gained a more modest 4.96%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index rose just 1.73%. International stocks also lagged the U.S. market.

Bond market's year-to-date performance

After a period dating back to 2022 when interest rates moved up dramatically, the bond environment has recently demonstrated more stability. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy is the main bond market driver. While investors anticipated the Fed would begin cutting interest rates earlier in 2024, the Fed has, to this point, held the line on the federal funds target rate it controls. Even though the Fed succeeded in its goal of lowering inflation from peak levels reached in mid-2022 (over 9%), the Fed has indicated that it remains concerned that inflation remains above 3%. Market reactions to Fed interest rate inaction moved yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up and down over the course of the year's first half.

U.S. economy still growing

The underlying economic environment remains positive, although growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) slowed in 2024's first quarter. GDP grew by an annualized rate of 1.4% over the first three months, down from 2023's 2.5% growth rate.2 ""1.4% is not a stellar rate of growth, but it's still positive,"" says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""As we look forward from here, most of the data points to a still-expanding economy."" The economic environment proved beneficial for equity markets, while inflation's persistence created some challenges for bonds.

""The economy today can best be described as resilient,"" says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Freedman attributes the economy's ongoing expansion to persistent consumer activity. ""Consumers have been spending more than most thought they would, and that has boosted corporate profits."" Freedman also notes the strength of business capital expenditure spending as a contributor to ongoing economic growth.

""The economy today can best be described as resilient,"" says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Consumers have been spending more than most thought they would, and that has boosted corporate profits.""

""The economy's held up reasonably well to this point because of the strong labor market (unemployment at 4%), and consumers' fairly strong financial position,"" says Freedman. ""Our U.S. Bank economics teams believes these factors continue to help us avoid a recession in the near term.""

Still, with interest rates elevated, consumers and businesses face higher borrowing costs. That could slow economic activity as consumers reassess potential big-ticket purchases or businesses re-think capital expenditures. Yet consumers remain engaged. ""The strong labor market and solid wage gains have given consumers the wherewithal to maintain enough spending activity to keep the economy on track,"" says Haworth.

What's driving the markets

As was the case in 2023, much of the market's strong 2024 performance can be attributed to technology-oriented stocks. Earlier in the year, leadership broadened out to other sectors, but in May and June, investors were increasingly focused on companies positioned to benefit from recent and projected advances in artificial intelligence (AI). ""Below the surface of the headline numbers, there's a fair amount of turmoil in equity markets today,"" says Haworth. ""To this point, most of the upside movement is about AI and the earnings growth it provides.""

In the fixed income market, Haworth says opportunities are more limited. ""With the Fed holding the line on interest rates, bonds, especially among investment grade categories, had a negative start to the year,"" says Haworth. ""Fixed income investors may want to consider other options outside of traditional Treasury and investment-grade corporate bonds.""

What to invest in right now

Haworth says given the degree of uncertainty in the market, some may want to consider dollar-cost averaging as a way to effectively invest in equities. ""By making regular investments over a period of time, you aren't anchored to an investment at a single price; you stretch your investment out at different price points over time,"" says Haworth. ""It also gets you going on an investment plan so you can start growing your wealth now.""

Assets that are set aside to meet funding needs in the next 18 months should capitalize on today's elevated interest rate environment by utilizing higher-yielding savings accounts, CDs and money market mutual funds.

""Be prepared to take what the capital markets offer given the current environment's realities,"" says Freedman. He advises that long-term investors consider positioning their portfolios with an above-neutral mix of equities and real assets (such as commodities), while reducing weightings in fixed income investments. Freedman adds, ""It's critical to have a financial plan that's tied to the specific goals you hope to achieve."" With a plan in place, you can more readily identify investment strategies that align with your goals.

Based on your situation and goals, other portfolio strategies that can play a potentially contributory role in your portfolio include:

Discuss options with your wealth management professional and be sure to understand the risks associated with each of these investments. Determine whether any can help you more effectively diversify your portfolio.

Freedman adds it's important to regularly review your plan with your wealth management professional. Determine whether there are opportunities to rebalance your portfolio in ways that more appropriately reflect your investment objectives, time horizon, risk appetite and the current market environment.

A Climate Investor Backed By Laurene Powell Jobs Gets $100 Million In Federal Funds For Greenhouse Gas Reduction,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2024/09/18/a-climate-investor-backed-by-laurene-powell-jobs-gets-100-million-in-federal-funds-for-greenhouse-gas-reduction/,2024-09-18T12:09:50Z,"lemental Excelerator, a non-profit climate investor backed by Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective, received $100 million in federal greenhouse gas reduction funding. The Honolulu-based firm, which will rename itself Elemental Impact, expects to mobilize investors and philanthropists from its network of more than 1,000 firms and individuals to distribute far more than that amount. The federal program has a goal of adding nearly seven dollars from private funds for every dollar of public monies received.

""One of the key success metrics is the ability to bring in private capital and coinvest with these dollars,"" Elemental founder and CEO Dawn Lippert told Forbes. ""That fits in really well with what Elemental's strategy has been over the past 15 years.""

Since its 2009 founding, Elemental, which has received a total of $210 million in philanthropic and government funding, has invested more than $80 million in some 160 climate-tech companies with a focus on filling the gaps in funding for startups as they scale from idea to commercial. All told, these companies have received $10 billion in co-investments and follow-on funding, according to Elemental. The non-profit also offers startups technical assistance and help with community engagement.

Elemental joined with Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective in 2017. Powell Jobs now serves as Elemental Impact's chair of the board, while Lippert is a senior climate advisor at Emerson Collective.

Powell Jobs inherited her fortune, which Forbes estimates at $14.6 billion, from her husband, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. With Emerson Collective and Waverley Street Foundation, she has established herself as one of the nation's most important philanthropists and impact investors.

Elemental expects to use the funds to invest in areas that include energy, transportation, water, agriculture and industry.

Its existing portfolio includes a wide array of climate tech startups. Among them: geothermal developer Fervo Energy, which raised $244 million earlier this year; critical minerals refiner and recycler Nth Cycle; and C16 Biosciences, which is creating a sustainable and conflict-free alternative to palm oil from microbes.

A report by Elemental and Boston Consulting Group in June calculated the so-called ""scale gap"" - between the funds raised and those needed - at $150 billion. Headwinds that include high interest rates, inflation, capital markets volatility and global hostilities contributed to a near 40% drop in climate-related funding in 2023, according to the report.

As technologies for combating climate change have outpaced ways to fund those innovations, the scale gap has grown, Lippert said. ""They [climate startups] can't get the cost of capital they need to compete against fossil fuels,"" she said. ""If we don't fix this, we will continue to lose companies that have technology that is working because they don't have the capital they need to scale.""

The new investment is part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by the Environmental Protection Agency.Part of the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act, it's intended to combat the climate crisis by mobilizing funding for projects that reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution in communities across the country.

Lippert said that Elemental is currently doing due diligence on companies that it is considering for investment, and that it hopes to be ""among the first"" to start doling out the GGRF funds. ""Time is not on our side with climate,"" she said."
Pick FedEx Stock Ahead Of Q1?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/18/pick-fedex-stock-ahead-of-q1/,2024-09-18T11:03:57Z,"FedEx (NYSE: FDX) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2025 results on Thursday, September 19 (FedEx's fiscal year ends in May). We expect the company to post an upbeat quarter, driven by an overall improvement in volumes. Furthermore, its cost reduction actions are expected to bolster its bottom-line growth. Although we think FedEx navigated well in Q1, its stock appears to have little room for growth from its current levels of around $300. Our interactive dashboard analysis of FedEx's Earnings Preview has more details on the company's revenues and earnings for the quarter. So, what are some trends likely to drive FedEx's results?

Firstly, let us look at FedEx's performance in the previous quarter. FedEx's Revenue rose 1% y-o-y to $22.1 billion, primarily due to slightly higher yields for both Express and Ground segments. The average daily volume was down 1% for Express but up 1% for the Ground segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin expand by 40 bps to 8.5% in Q4'24. This clubbed with a 2% decline in average shares outstanding, amid share repurchases, resulted in a 10% rise in the bottom line to $5.41 on an adjusted basis.

Coming to the latest quarter, we expect revenues to be around $22.1 billion, reflecting a roughly 2% y-o-y rise - slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of a little under $22 billion. FedEx has had a tough few quarters amid falling delivery volumes. The weakening consumer demand in the wake of high inflation has weighed on overall volumes. However, the company has seen market share gains lately and this should aid overall sales growth. Average daily volumes are also expected to now improve after seeing weaker demand over last year. Additionally, FedEx's Q1 results should benefit from its ongoing cost-cutting initiatives that aim to reduce $4 billion in costs by the end of fiscal 2025. We estimate the bottom line to be $4.90 on an adjusted basis, reflecting 8% y-o-y growth.

With the U.S. Fed expected to announce a rate cut now, consumer sentiment is expected to improve over the coming quarters. However, the broader markets will react to the quantum of the rate cut. A lower-than-expected rate cut will likely result in a correction. Curious about the impact of a market crash on FDX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can FedEx Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.

Looking at FDX stock now, we think it has little room for growth. We estimate FedEx's Valuation to be $318 per share, reflecting an upside of less than 10% from its current levels of around $300. FDX stock is already trading at 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $21.00 per share, which is aligned with the stock's average P/E ratio seen over the last five years.

Even if we look at a slightly longer term, FDX stock, with 15% gains since early 2021, has underperformed the broader markets. Its annual returns are considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Overall, we think FedEx will post an upbeat Q1, and it will likely have more positives to look forward to on the back of improving volumes and margin expansion. While much of this appears to be priced in, the stock could still see higher levels if the company were to raise its full-year outlook and the overall volume shows further signs of improvement.

While FDX stock will react to its Q1 results, it is helpful to see how FedEx's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
Student News: Average Maintenance Loan Leaves Students With Shortfall Of More Than £500 A Month,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/personal-finance/2024/09/18/student-updates/,2024-09-18T10:39:31Z,"18 September: The average UK student now spends £1,104 per month on essential living costs, according to the latest National Student Money Survey - £504 more than the typical monthly maintenance loan payment, writes Bethany Garner.

Save the Student polled 1,010 university students between April and August 2024, and found that the vast majority of students (81%) worried about making ends meet with almost half (48%) having considered dropping out due to lack of funds.

A third of respondents (33%) said their grades had suffered due to money worries, while two-thirds 60% said it had impacted their mental health.

Almost one in 10 (9%) said they had used a food bank.

Tom Allingham, communications director at Save the Student, said: ""Sadly, this is not a surprise. In England in particular, the Maintenance Loan has lagged behind inflation to such an extent that, on average, it now falls short of living costs by £504 per month. Students are having to cut back on even the most basic necessities to make ends meet, with 67% skipping meals at least some of the time.""

Save the Student is calling on the UK government to increase the amount students can borrow through Maintenance Loans, and ensure they keep pace with higher living costs.

Maintenance loans for English students increased by 2.5% for the 2024/2025 academic year. While this is broadly in line with inflation - currently at 2.2% - students continue to be worse-off in real terms than they were prior to the cost of living crisis.

According to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), maintenance loan payments underwent a real terms cut of 11% between September 2020 and September 2023 (see story from 25 January).

Finding funds

The majority of students rely on work to fund their studies with 58% in a part-time job and 30% running their own business or side hustle.

More than half (51%) of students received a maintenance loan, and half (50%) were supported by parents. This figure is down 9% from the 59% who received parental support in 2022, suggesting the cost of living crisis left some parents unable to help.

Students who receive parental support are given £171 per month on average.

Save the Student found that a quarter of students (25%) were able to secure grants and funding to support their studies, while 49% used savings.

Student bank accounts were another significant funding source, with 37% of respondents using an overdraft to help fund their living costs. A further 15% used credit cards.

Rental payments are the single largest cost students face, at £540 per month on average, marking a rise of £101 on last year's figure.

Students spend an additional £144 per month on groceries, £11 more than last year, and £76 on bills.

Average spending fell in other areas, however. The average student now spends £18 less on takeaways and eating out, and £18 less on going out per month than in 2023.

In total, average living costs increased £26 between August 2023 and August 2024.

Unspurpsiginly, students in London spend the most on essential living costs, averaging £1,264 per month, closely followed by students in the South West (£1,189) and the South East (£1,187).

Students in Northern Ireland reported the lowest living costs, spending £926 per month on average.

All the usual contenders in the student banking market have now unveiled their current account offerings for 2024. Bethany Garner rounds up what's on offer.

Santander: Students opening Santander's Edge Student Current Account between now and 30 September will be entered into a prize draw to win a cash prize worth up to three years' tuition fees.

The provider is offering 50 prizes in total - 20 worth three years' tuition fees in England (£27,750), and the remaining 30 worth one year's tuition (£9,250).

To be eligible, students must open a Santander Edge Student Account, credit it with at least £500, and keep it open until 14 October. Winners will receive their prizes by 10 November.

Prizes are paid directly into the winners' current accounts, and there is no obligation to spend the money on tuition fees. Official student loans, used to pay tuition fees in the majority of cases, only have to be repaid when the individual is earning £24,990 a year or more.

The account also includes a complementary four-year 16-25 Railcard, and customers can sign up to Santander Boosts for occasional cashback and discount offers with partner retailers.

Santander's interest-free student overdraft allows students to borrow up to £1,500 in their first three years of study, £1,800 in their fourth year, and £2,000 if they remain in education for a fifth year.

Nationwide's FlexStudent account is offering a welcome bonus of £100, plus £120 in Just Eat vouchers when students sign up by 14 December. These vouchers are paid in 12 monthly instalments of £10 each.

To be eligible for the offer, students must credit their FlexStudent account with at least £500 within 14 days of opening.

Nationwide's interest-free overdraft allows students to borrow up to £1,000 in their first year of study, £2,000 in their second year and £3,000 in their third year.

NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland have renewed last year's student offer - a welcome bonus of £100 in cash, plus a four-year Tastecard membership worth £55 per year.

Tastecard holders receive discounts of up to 50% with partner restaurants across the UK.

To be eligible for these perks, applicants must apply for the account online or via mobile banking, and can not have received a student offer from NatWest Group since 1 July 2020. There's currently no end date on this offer, but it can be withdrawn at any time.

Both NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland also offer comparatively generous interest-free overdraft limits. In their first term, students automatically qualify for a £500 overdraft, and can request an increase up to £2,000 in years one and two, and up to £3,250 from year three onwards.

Overdraft limits are not guaranteed, and the maximum amount students are offered will depend on their individual circumstances.

Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said: ""One of the most popular features of a student bank account is the interest-free overdraft. This year NatWest offers the most generous tariff and will also give applicants £100 in free cash and a Tastecard as sweeteners.

""There are a few other brands now confirming their latest student account perks which could entice those looking to save some cash when travelling or eating out. It is worth keeping in mind that any discounts need to be used frequently to maximise the benefits.""

Lloyds Bank has also launched a welcome offer of £110, when students open its Student Current Account and pay in at least £500 by 31 October 2024.

Elsewhere, account holders receive a minimum 20% discount on select University Union events in England and Wales, and 5% (AER) interest on balances up to £5,000.

The account provides an interest-free overdraft of up to £1,500 in the first three years of study, which can be extended to £2,000 if the account holder remains in education for a fourth, fifth or sixth year.

HSBC, Halifax and TSB have not introduced welcome offers for the 2024 to 2025 academic year, but continue to provide students with interest-free overdrafts.

Average food and rental costs for UK students rose 7% between May 2023 and May 2024, according to a study by interactive investor, writes Bethany Garner.

Broadband prices underwent the highest level of inflation, rising 10.4% in the year to May, while private rental costs increased 8.7%, and bus and coach fares rose 8.4%.

You can search for competitive student broadband here.

The analysis, based on ONS data, also calculated year-on-year inflation for a basket of 17 other goods and services, including books, health and beauty products and bus fares and internet providers. On average, the price of these purchases rose 3.65% in the 12 months to May.

These figures outstrip the latest increase in the maximum student maintenance loan, which rose by just 2.8% as of the 2023/24 academic year. This means, in effect, students have received a real-terms cut in the loan support they receive.

The overall UK inflation figure stood at 2% in the 12 months to May.

Source: interactive investor using ONS CPI inflation and The Price Index of Private Rents (to end May 2024)

Prices fell significantly in just one category - energy tariffs, down by 15.9% - due to a reduction in the price cap set that came into effect from 1 April.

Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, said: ""The spiralling cost of living at university is a significant concern that threatens to have an adverse impact on students' academic performance and mental health.

""As accommodation, food, and transport costs continue to rise, many students are compelled to take on part-time work to make ends meet. The financial strain is particularly severe for students from less affluent backgrounds, who face greater challenges in affording essential resources like textbooks and technology.""

Almost two-thirds of UK students (64%) say they're struggling with housing costs, with 40% considering dropping out of their course altogether due to difficulty affording rent, according to research by website Save the Student, writes Bethany Garner.

The report, which surveyed 1,007 UK students between 17 November 2023 and 12 January 2024, found that 61% had borrowed money to cover the cost of their rent. Of these, 36% turned to parents and 13% to friends, while others relied on credit, with 25% covering housing costs by taking a bank loan or overdraft, 8% using a credit card and 3% taking out a payday loan.

A further 45% of students said their studies have suffered as a result of rental costs, while 72% say their health has suffered.

Kellie McAlonan, chair of the National Association of Student Money Advisers, said: ""Struggling to pay rent is a reality for many students, and it isn't good enough. Core funding packages need to be good enough to support student success, and safe and affordable housing shouldn't be a lucky find.

""The Maintenance Loan in England needs a revamp. Students can't be expected to plug the gap between basic living costs and the student funding they receive, and it is becoming increasingly more difficult for institutions to shoulder the burden of a system that is not working.""

On average, UK students pay £550 in rent each month, but the sum varies significantly by region. London remains the most expensive area to rent as a student, costing £778 per month on average. At the other end of the scale, those studying in Scotland paid £469 each month.

Despite high rental prices, many students reported issues with their rented accommodation. Damp was the most common problem, affecting 37%, followed by a lack of heating or water, which affected 29% of those surveyed. Almost half (45%) think their accommodation is poor value for money.

Tom Allingham, communications director at Save the Student, said: ""The prolonging of the cost of living crisis is largely thanks to below-inflation increases to the Maintenance Loan in England. And, with just a 2.5% increase announced for 2024/25, these real-terms cuts are becoming baked into the system.""

Inflation was 4% in December, according to official figures.According to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, maintenance loan payments underwent a 11% real terms cut between September 2020 and September 2023 (see story below).

Maintenance Loan payments are set to rise by 2.5% for students in England from September 2024, the government announced today, writes Bethany Garner.

The loan, designed to cover student living costs such as food and housing, will increase in line with the forecast inflation figure for the 2024/25 academic year.

The government will also contribute an extra £10 million to university hardship funds - earmarked to support students who are struggling financially - in a bid to combat rising living costs.

Despite the upcoming increase to maintenance Loans, however, students in England will continue to be worse-off in real terms due to the high inflation experienced in recent years. The latest inflation figure from the Office for National Statistics shows it running at 4% in December - it reached 11.1% in 2022.

According to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), maintenance loan payments underwent a real terms cut of 11% between September 2020 and September 2023, leaving students worse off by £107 per month.

Tom Allingham, money expert at Save the Student, said: ""The 2024/25 maintenance loan rates are utterly inadequate, and risk condemning students to a never-ending cost of living crisis.

""Although inflation is falling, the real-terms cuts to the loan have not been reversed. Even if this 2.5% increase matches inflation in the next academic year, students from the poorest backgrounds will still be £1,300 per year worse off in real terms.

""We're calling on the Education Secretary, Gillian Keegan, and the wider government to take heed of our petition and increase Maintenance Loans to catch up with inflation.""

Student Awards Agency Scotland (SASS), which oversees student loans in Scotland, is set to increase maintenance loans to £9,400 from September 2024, marking a 34% increase from the £7,000 earmarked for the previous academic year.

SAAS also provides students below a certain household income threshold with non-repayable bursaries, as does its Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts.

Northern Ireland and Wales are yet to announce their 2024/25 loans.

Almost nine in ten first-year students (86%) are worrying about their finances amid cost-of-living pressures, according to a poll from Nationwide, writes Bethany Garner.

The study, which surveyed 1,007 students starting university in September 2023, also found that 76% of first-years said living costs were a key consideration when it came to choosing a university. A further 72% had considered living at home to cut costs.

Students' families also appear to be feeling the pinch, with 69% of new students saying the cost-of-living crisis has reduced the amount of financial support their parents or guardians can provide.

However, 56% of students say they expect to receive at least some financial support from a parent or guardian, compared with just 28% who said their family would not be able to support them at all.

To bridge the gap in living expenses, 31% of students said they will rely on part-time work as their primary source of income while at university. Of these, 47% plan to work up to 10 hours per week, while 42% expect 11 to 20 weekly hours.

Tom Riley, director of retail products at Nationwide, said: ""Heading off to university should be a joyous time for students, but our research shows they are making that journey with a significant amount of financial trepidation.

""This is especially prevalent at the moment with the cost-of-living crisis impacting how much parents and guardians can provide.""Despite their financial concerns, 42% of respondents said they had not opened a student current account. These accounts typically offer an interest-free overdraft, and may also come with perks - such as cashback or a free railcard - that could help students manage their budget.

The average student now spends £1,078 a month on essential living expenses, according to the latest National Student Money Survey - equal to a 17% annual inflation rate, writes Bethany Garner.

Save the Student polled 1,786 UK university students between May and August 2023 and found, on average, they must find an extra £154 each month just to cover essential costs.

Rent was the single largest monthly expense, costing on average £439 a month - an increase of £21 year-on-year - while the average cost of groceries rose by £17 to £133 per month.

However, student Maintenance Loans for the 2023/24 academic year have largely failed to keep pace with rising living costs, with students in England seeing an increase of just 2.8%.

In Northern Ireland maximum loans increased by 9.4% for this academic year, and between 11.1% and 17.6% in Scotland, depending on household income. Only in Wales did Maintenance Loans clear the student inflation rate with a 40% increase.

Overall however, the average Maintenance Loan now falls short of living costs by £582 per month, or almost £7,000 per year.

Tom Allingham, communications director at Save the Student, said it was the 'most troubling set of results ever seen in the National Student Money Survey'.

""Save the Student is calling on the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, to increase the Maintenance Loan to catch up with inflation, and avoid driving thousands more students into financial turmoil.""

London remains the most expensive region to study, with average monthly living costs at £1,211 - an increase of £122 since 2022. Student life is at its least expensive in Northern Ireland where monthly costs average £905.

However, in every region, students spend more than £900 on living expenses each month.

Faced with soaring costs, 82% of students said they worried about making ends meet and 55% reported a decline in their mental health.

A further 30% found their grades had suffered, while 38% said their relationships were affected.

Almost a fifth (18%) of survey respondents told Save the Student they had used a food bank - up from 10% in 2022. Meanwhile, almost half of students (42%) admitted they skipped meals to save money.

Financial pressure has led 54% of students to consider dropping out of university altogether.

The majority of students rely on their parents to help make up the shortfall when it comes to living expenses.

According to Save the Student, 53% of students receive financial support from parents - down slightly from the 59% who received this support in 2022 - suggesting some parents may no longer be in a financial position to help.

On average, students receive £227 from their parents per month, which is £77.20 higher than the figure for 2022.

And despite the increase, 15% of students feel their parents' contributions are not enough to cover living costs.

A further 56% of students said they had a part-time job, earning £544 per month on average, while 46% fund their studies with personal savings, 35% use a student overdraft and 26% utilise grants and other funding.

Over a fifth of students (21%) said they have used their university's hardship fund - a 9% increase compared with 2022. Students who used a hardship fund were granted £905 on average.

Kellie McAlonan, chair of the National Association of Student Money Advisors, said: ""The system is broken when our students start their journey needing to address a gap in funding, leading many to stretch themselves with working hours that inevitably impact their student experience.

""The government needs to consider that struggling to fund basic living costs is a reality for many students, and it isn't good enough.""

More than half of current and prospective students (54%) have considered not going to university because of the financial costs incurred, according to research from the Association of Investment Companies (AIC), writes Bethany Garner.

The study - which gathered responses from 1,000 current and prospective university students, as well as 1,000 parents with children aged 13 to 21 - also found the number of students worried about the cost of university has increased.

In 2022, just 35% of students said they had thought about not going to university because of how much it would cost.

The figures come in the run up to A-Level results day on 17 August.

The AIC study also found that, despite rising living costs, the majority of students (59%) say their parents are able to financially support them. Over half (52%) of parents with children at university said supporting them through their studies was a top financial priority.

Despite their willingness to help, however, 76% of parents said the rising cost of living has made it more difficult to offer this support.

As well as worrying about making ends meet during their studies, university students are also concerned about paying off their debts when they graduate. Just 44% of respondents who have, or plan to have, a student loan believe they will pay it off in full before the debt is cancelled.

Currently, the Student Loans Company (SLC) clears any remaining debt an individual has borrowed 30 to 40 years' after graduation - depending on their plan and when the loan was taken out.

Men were significantly more likely than women to expect to repay their loan in full. Among male students 60% expected to clear their debt entirely, compared with just 33% of their female counterparts.

University students leaving halls of residence face a jump in rental costs up to just shy of 50% according to a new study, writes Bethany Garner.

The research, conducted by shared living space provider, Gravity Co, compared the cost of an en-suite room in student halls at 10 of England's largest universities with the average cost of a one-bed home in each city's private rental market.

It found that students in Bristol and London face the largest jump in prices when moving from halls of residence to a privately rented home - a common transition for students completing their first year of study.

Renting a one-bed property in Bristol cost £249 per week on average - 49.2% higher than an en-suite room in student halls.

Meanwhile, students in London pay an average of £401 per week for a one-bed flat, compared with £270 per week for an en-suite room in halls. This represents a price increase of 48.4%.

In Sheffield, renting a one-bed home costs 21% more than an en-suite room in halls, on average. In Manchester this discrepancy falls to 12.9%, while in Leicester it's 6.6% and 4.1% in Leeds.

Coventry had the smallest price discrepancy between student halls and private rental homes. The average one-bed property costs £163 per week to rent, while the city's student halls cost £160 per week.

These price differences reflect the growing cost of renting. According to ONS data, the average UK rents rose 5% in the year to May 2023.

However, three cities - Birmingham, Nottingham and Liverpool - were found to have private rental accommodation at a lower price than halls of residence.

In Birmingham, renting a one-bed home costs £163 per week on average - 3.9% lower than an en-suite room in halls. Similarly, an average one-bed home in Nottingham costs £163 per week in rent, while an en-suite room in student halls would cost £169.

Elsewhere, students in Liverpool can expect to pay 22.1% less rent per week, on average, for a one-bed home in the private rental market than they would for an en-suite room in university halls.

Riccardo Tessaro, co-founder and chief executive officer of Gravity Co, commented: ""The jump in living costs will be especially sharp for those in Bristol and London, where university halls can be as much as 50% cheaper than renting privately.

""Escalating costs in the rental sector [also] makes it more challenging than ever for those embarking on their careers, as a higher proportion of their income will be paid out in rent.""

While the study revealed some dramatic price discrepancies between student halls and privately rented homes, the two types of accommodation may not always be equivalent.

Many halls of residence include shared spaces - such as kitchen or laundry facilities - while a one-bed home or studio flat is typically self-contained.

Some students leaving halls behind may be able to save money by grouping together and splitting the cost of renting a home with two or more bedrooms.

UK students are set to spend a collective £4.5 billion as they prepare to head to campus this Autumn, according to the annual Back to Campus report from UNiDAYS - a student affinity platform.

The average student plans to spend £1,585 - a steep 54% increase compared with 2022, when the figure stood at £1,027.

The report, which surveyed 947 UK university students, found that UK students plan to spend a collective £1.5 billion on laptops and computers in the run up to the 2023 academic year, dwarfing other categories and representing a year-on-year rise of 37%.

Just over a third (34%) of students plan to purchase a new computer, budgeting £525 on average. First-year 'freshers' intend to spend less, laying out an average of £380 for their computer.

A further 29% of the students surveyed plan to buy a smartphone or tablet before the new term begins, spending £277 on average.

After tech, students plan to spend more on subscription services than any other category - totalling £1.08 billion.

More than half of students (64%) plan to purchase a gym membership, while 48% will sign up for a TV streaming platform. A further 64% plan to pay for a music streaming service, and 20% will pay for gaming services.

On average, students expect to spend £381 per year on their subscriptions, rising to £383 or first-year students.

As living costs continue to rise, students are also budgeting for home cooking essentials. The average student plans to spend £59 on kitchen goods before the new academic term, and a further £83 per week on groceries.

Despite incoming students being 'digital natives' who grew up with the internet, 48% told UNiDAYS they plan to browse products in person as they shop for the new term.

Alex Gallagher, chief strategy officer at UNiDAYS, said: ""The countdown to campus has already started, and with a lot of students planning ahead.

""Now is the best time for companies to catch Gen Z attention and connect with students through exclusive student discounts and engaging shopping experiences both in store and online.""

Over half of UK students say they have not received the £400 discount on energy bills from the government, writes Bethany Garner.

Save the Student - a money website - has found that 56% of students have not benefited from the government's Energy Bills Support Scheme which applies an automatic monthly discount of £66 between October and March to household electricity bills.

The website's poll of 1,869 UK students carried out between December and January, found that 82% of those living in university halls of residence and 70% living in private halls had not received a discount.

Just under half (47%) of those renting privately from a landlord had also seen no reduction in costs.

Students are missing out on the discount because they often have energy bills included in the price of their rent, said Save the Student.

However, the scheme was designed to extend to all tenants - including students - who are living in properties with domestic energy contracts where bills are included in the rent.

In these cases landlords should 'pass the discounted payments appropriately' in line with regulator Ofgem rules, according to the government.

Tom Allingham, money expert at Save the Student, said: ""While many people in similar forms of accommodation, such as care homes, have received the funding, 82% of students in university halls have not.

""Given that rent in at least some halls will inevitably have increased to cover rising energy costs, it's concerning that many students haven't received the necessary support in return.""

The vast majority of students -- 95% -- reported to be worried about keeping up with energy payments, found the survey.

The average monthly energy bill for these students was £85 - an increase of £276 over the course of a year compared to 2022.

More than half (52%) of students said they were avoiding turning on the heating, 50% were spending more time in bed to keep warm, while a further 35% were spending longer on campus.

Mr Allingham added: ""We're calling on the government to stop overlooking students, and instead ensure that they can benefit from all energy bill support -- both now and in the future.""

The Department of Education has announced that maintenance loans - which support students with living costs - will rise by 2.8% in the 2023/24 academic year, writes Bethany Garner.

But with inflation running at 10.7%, higher education professionals have warned students will be worse-off in real terms.

Vivienne Stern MBE, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ""Although it's an increase, it does not make up for the real terms cut to maintenance that students have experienced since inflation began to rapidly increase.

""Currently, the student maintenance package in England is at its lowest value in seven years.""

According to analysis by student money website Save the Student, the average maintenance loan currently falls £439 short of average living costs each month.

Faced with stretched budgets, 52% of students have considered dropping out due to money worries, a 2022 survey found (see story below).

As well as increasing maintenance loans, the Department of Education announced tuition fees will be frozen for two years, and an extra £15 million will be added to university hardship funds.

Robert Halfon, minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said: ""We recognise students continue to face financial challenges, which is why we are increasing loans and grants for living and other costs for a further year.""

Hardship funds are distributed by individual universities, and eligibility criteria are often strict. Grants are only available to undergraduate students who can prove they are experiencing unpredicted financial hardship through no fault of their own.

Many universities, including the University of Southampton, Queen Mary University of London and the University of York, are also introducing their own cost of living support schemes.

Rising day-to-day costs are prompting more students to consider leaving university before finishing their course, writes Bethany Garner.

According to research from student money website, Save the Student, 52% of students have considered dropping out of their course due to money issues.

Further research by credit management company, Lowell, revealed that more than three-quarters (77%) of students develop personal debt problems at some point during their studies.

Lowell also found that many students relied on credit to make ends meet, with 27% using credit cards, 32% using overdrafts, and 15% using buy now pay later (BNPL) schemes to supplement their income.

A further 9% said they used payday loans to get by -- a form of borrowing that can incur APRs of up to 1,500%.

Less than half (42%) of students who took part in the survey in August last year described themselves as financially supported by family, while 36% had personal savings to use.

The average student is saddled with £2,332 in personal debt - not accounting for tuition fees and student loans - by the time they graduate, found the study, which takes an average of 3.8 years to pay off.

However, some graduates who responded to the survey reported considerably higher levels of personal debt, with 15% saying they left university with additional borrowing worth over £5,000. A further 16% of graduates said it took more than four years to pay off.

John Pears, chief executive at Lowell, said: ""University should be an exciting and rewarding experience, but for those young people who move away from home and can't depend on money from their family, it can also be a costly one.

""Getting into debt while at university can be worrying, especially if you don't have a regular source of income or a job secured for when you graduate.""

More than nine in 10 (91%) higher education students say they are somewhat or very worried about the rising cost of living after seeing their costs increase in the past year, writes Bethany Garner.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which gathered responses from 4,201 higher education students between 24 October and 7 November 2022, 50% of respondents say they are experiencing some degree of financial difficulty.

A further 15% of students said they are experiencing 'major' financial difficulty.

More than three quarters of students (77%) are concerned that the rising cost of living will impact how well they perform in their studies. With financial concerns on their mind, 45% of respondents said their mental health had worsened since the start of the autumn 2022 term.

In response to rising costs, 62% of students are spending less on food shopping, while 72% have cut back on non-essential shopping. A further 38% are using less electricity and gas at home, and 18% say they're considering moving back in with family to cut costs.

Almost a third of respondents (31%) say they are avoiding extra course-related events such as conferences and field trips, while 27% are coming to campus less often due to travel costs.

A fifth of those surveyed (19%) are considering switching to fully remote learning, while a further 19% are thinking about pausing their course altogether.

Along with cost-cutting, more than half of students (52%) said they had dipped into their savings to get by, while a quarter (25%) reported taking on new debt.

Of these, 66% said they turned to debt because their student loan was not enough to cover living costs. For almost half of the students surveyed (48%), turning to family for money was not an option.

The average student expects to spend £1,027 preparing for the start of the new academic year. It marks a rise of 19% from last year in the wake of soaring living costs, according to the Back to Campus report from UNiDAYS - a student affinity platform.

For first-year 'fresher' students, planned spending is higher still at an average of £1,215.

Groceries and household goods was the most popular category of spend with 65% of returning students and 75% of first-year students expecting to make these purchases.

The majority plan to shop with larger stores such as Tesco and ASDA amassing a total spend of £281 million before the new academic year gets underway.

However this is dwarfed by the staggering £948million due to be spent on electronic gadgets, according to the report. In total, 38% of UK students say they will buy new laptops or other hardware before the start of term, while freshers are expected to spend 42% more in this category than returning students.

Of those students surveyed by UNiDAYS, 64% say they plan to buy clothes, spending an estimated £252m at favoured retailers including ASOS, Primark, Zara, Nike and New Look.

The report also found that 64% of students plan to buy cosmetics before the start of the new term, spending a collective £136 million.

Despite the cost-of-living crisis, most students are factoring entertainment into their budgets with 53% planning to purchase a home entertainment subscription, and 62% intending to sign up for a music streaming service.

Alex Gallagher, chief strategy officer at UNiDAYS said that this year's new and returning students are facing 'significantly increased costs' to prepare for the year of study ahead - and warned that retailers must adapt.

He said: ""It's crucial that brands adjust their offering - adopting a strong pricing strategy which will help them to better resonate with the Gen Z audience priorities and values during the current economic climate.""

UNiDAYS also found that a third of students plan to live at home during their studies during the next academic year, reducing expenditure on groceries and other essentials.

More than 425,000 students have been admitted to university or college this A-Level results day -- the second-highest number on record.

Grades are lower on average than the teacher-assessed results of 2020 and 2021, but higher than 2019 when students last took in-person exams.

Dr Jo Saxton, chief regulator of exam regulator Ofqual, said: ""Today's results are a testament to students' hard work and resilience.""

Students starting university this September face record-high living costs, with inflation soaring to 10.1%.

Although these rising costs pose a challenge, there are steps incoming students can take to save money and make the most of their budget:

Nationwide says 66% of university students are struggling to afford housing costs or falling behind on their rent - a sign of the UK's deepening cost-of-living crisis.

The building society surveyed 1,000 students throughout the UK and found that, to contend with soaring rent, food and energy prices, 73% of students have borrowed money from family members.

Around half (47%) say they feel ashamed or embarrassed about asking to borrow money, while 36% feel they cannot ask their family for money at all. A further 42% of students rely on their overdrafts to meet essential living expenses.

Another study by HSBC revealed similar findings. The bank's poll of 2,002 current and prospective students found 57% rely on borrowing to cover essential costs. Of these, 42% use loans from family, and 37% have taken out an overdraft or bank loan.

Faced with record rental prices, 24% of students told Nationwide that housing costs were an important factor when deciding which university to attend.

A significant number of students also say they are teetering towards homelessness. In Nationwide's survey, 14% of respondents feared they could become homeless within the next six months.

Among students who do not expect to become homeless themselves, 22% know someone who has been homeless in the last 12 months.

Although students face financial pressures throughout the UK, the percentage who worry about homelessness varies by region.

In the West Midlands, 21% fear homelessness in the next six months, compared with 20% of students in London and 17% of Yorkshire and Humber.

Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: ""No student should have their education derailed because they're worrying about how to make ends meet.

""Yet record-high rents and crippling food and fuel bills are pushing worrying numbers of university students to the brink of homelessness.""

Students turn to 'side hustles' to make ends meet

When they arrive at university, a significant number of students turn to part-time work to cover essential living costs.

HSBC's study found 61% of students have a 'side hustle' such as an online business to supplement their income, while 51% work a part-time job.

As well as earning and borrowing, more than half of students (55%) are cutting back on their spending in the face of rising living expenses.

Tom Wolfenden, head of retail banking at HSBC, said: ""A-Level results day marks the beginning of an exciting period for students. Many are finalising decisions around university choices and planning to leave home for the first time.

""However, we also know that in the current climate, students are facing more financial pressures than usual.""

Interest rates on student loans in England and Wales will be fixed at 6.3% from September, the government has announced -- lower than the 7.3% cap it initially proposed in June.

Rates on student loans are reviewed every August, and calculated based on the current Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3%. Because soaring inflation has pushed up RPI graduates would be facing a 12% interest rate without intervention.

The new lower rate means that graduates with a typical student loan balance of £45,000 will now accrue £210 less interest each month compared to if the rate had jumped to 12%.

Angela Jenkyns, minister for skills, further and higher education said: ""We understand that many people are worried about the impact of rising prices and we want to reassure people that we are stepping up to provide support where we can.""

""For those starting higher education in September 2023 and any students considering that next step at the moment, we have cut future interest rates so that no new graduate will ever again have to pay back more than they have borrowed in real terms.""

A spokesperson for the Student Loans Company (SLC) said that borrowers do not need to take any action to benefit from the reduced interest rate -- the change will be applied to their account automatically.

However, while the rate change lowers the amount of interest graduates accrue on their student loans - and therefore the total debt owed - it will not translate into lower monthly payments.

Student loan repayments are income-dependent, with borrowers paying 9% of any earnings above £27,295 a year. But, according to the government's own figures, an estimated 80% of students starting an undergraduate degree in 2021 or 2022 will never repay their loan in full. This means they will see no benefit to the rate reduction.

The changes will not affect graduates who began their studies before 2012, Scottish graduates, or those with postgraduate loans - as these rates are calculated differently.

Interest rates for Student Loans are due to be reviewed again in December.

University students entering into privately rented accommodation are at risk of missing out on the government's energy discounts.

Renters whose energy bills are included in the cost of their rent may not benefit from the discount, consumer charity Citizens Advice has warned.

With average energy bills reaching record highs of more than £300 a month, the government has committed to give every household a £400 discount on their bills this autumn.

The discount will be applied to energy bills automatically, in six instalments between October 2022 and March 2023.

Where the landlord is responsible for the energy bills, the discount will be applied to them rather than tenants. And there are concerns that renters whose utility bills are included in their monthly rent payments may not have the rebate passed on.

According to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, 13% of renters -- accounting for 585,000 homes -- have energy bills included in their rental payments.

This kind of rental arrangement is especially common among students. A 2018 survey by utilities provider Glide found that 63% of students had utility bills included in their rent.

Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: ""Tenants whose energy bills are included in rent or service charge cannot directly claim the energy discount. Instead, they will be at the mercy of their landlord passing on this much-needed support.""

Although landlords are not legally obliged to pass on the £400 energy discount, they are not allowed to overcharge tenants for energy.

To ensure you only pay what you owe, Shelter recommends keeping track of how much energy you are using by taking regular electricity and gas metre readings.

Polly Neate adds: ""It is unfair that those at the very sharp end of this crisis could miss out on this much-needed support. The government is looking into this as they've acknowledged it's not right.""

Organisations including Renters Rights London are urging tenants to contact their landlord in writing if they do not pass on the government's energy rebate.

You are within your rights to whether it will be delivered via bank transfer, or deducted from a future rental payment. If your landlord does not pass on the discount, contact Citizens Advice or Shelter for guidance."
Stablecoins Surge Amidst Regulatory Scrutiny,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/beccabratcher/2024/09/18/stablecoins-surge-amidst-regulatory-scrutiny/,2024-09-18T10:03:45Z,"As digital currencies reshape the financial landscape, stablecoins are emerging as a pivotal player.

Earlier this month, Castle Island Ventures partnered with Brevan Howard Digital and Artemis to produce an in-depth report on stablecoins, sponsored by Visa. Based on their findings, ""There are over $160 billion worth of stablecoins in circulation today, up from single digit billions as recently as 2020.""

The report argues that stablecoins have found increasing use cases, stating, ""In emerging markets, adoption of stablecoins for payments, currency substitution, and access to high quality forms of yield is accelerating.""

Stablecoins offer the promise of price stability while maintaining the innovative potential of digital assets. Their rise has not been without controversy. Notably, stablecoins face scrutiny over their transparency, regulatory compliance with KYC and AML, and underlying technical mechanisms.

In May of 2022, TerraLuna's stablecoin, known as Terra (UST), collapsed. This catastrophic event triggered one of the most significant events in cryptocurrency history. UST was an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar through its sister token, Luna. However, when market confidence in UST began to falter, the mechanism that tied UST and Luna broke down. Luna's price plummeted due to massive token issuance, causing a hyperinflationary spiral. This led to UST losing its peg entirely, wiping out over $40 billion in value and devastating investor confidence.

Since this event, the market has been recovering and demanding transparency. Consumer demand for stablecoins continues to increase.

The whole purpose of a stablecoin's design is to maintain a stable value. Typically stablecoins are pegged to a traditional asset, like the US dollar, a commodity, or a basket of assets. The purpose of stablecoins is to reduce the volatility common in other cryptocurrencies. Thus making them more suitable for everyday transactions, savings, or as a hedge against market fluctuations. The report mentioned above found that over 95% of stablecoins ""are linked to the US dollar.""

The referenced stablecoin findings go on to say, ""The divergence that appeared throughout the cooling off period in crypto exchange volumes in 2022-23 suggests that stablecoins have meaningful usage outside of mere speculative uses.""

Many types of stablecoins exist, including fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, and algorithmic stablecoins.

The purpose of stablecoins is pairing cryptocurrency innovation with price stability. Beneath the surface lies a complex debate over how this plays out. Since their public entrance into the world of digital assets in 2014, stablecoins continue to be a vehicle for fraudulent activity.

However, the narrative is shifting.

In Castle Island's stablecoin report it found that, ""In the first half of 2024, stablecoins settled (according to our adjusted estimates) over $2.6 trillion dollars worth of value.""

USDT (Tether) is the most widely used stablecoin. USDT's purpose is for cross-border payments, remittances, and as a hedge against currency fluctuations and inflation. However, due to its anonymity and ease of transfer, Tether has also been exploited for illicit activities, including black market transactions and money laundering.

In April of 2024, Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) announced a press release regarding their stablecoin bill. Gillibrand stated, ""Passing a regulatory framework for stablecoins is absolutely critical to maintaining the U.S. dollar's dominance, promoting responsible innovation, protecting consumers and cracking down on money laundering and illicit finance.""

A key issue for regulators is balancing the legitimate benefits of stablecoins, with the need for stronger oversight to combat illicit use. All while promoting financial inclusion and faster transactions for users.

Some stablecoins are more transparent than others.

Nic Carter, one of Castle Island Ventures founding partners, said, ""Each blockchain offers tradeoffs in terms of settlement assurances, fees, speed, etc.""

One of cryptocurrency's appeals is that it is not associated with any government. When asked if a government might employ stablecoins in the form of a Central Bank Digital Currency, Carter states, ""We haven't encountered any government-backed stablecoins just yet."" He goes on to say, ""My guess is CBDC's, when they are deployed, will not use blockchain rails, because governments will want to embed more surveillance into these systems, and crypto transactions on public blockchains are less surveillable and give end users significantly more autonomy. So I am skeptical we will see a government launch on a public blockchain.""

As stablecoins evolve, their growing adoption reflects their potential to revolutionize digital finance. Balancing innovation with regulatory oversight and ensuring transparency will be crucial in shaping the future of stablecoins within the global financial system."
Gavin Newsom: Critics said California's minimum wage increase would be a job killer. The opposite happened,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gavin-newsom-critics-said-californias-minimum-wage-increase-would-job-killer-opposite-happened,2024-09-18T09:10:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

About a year ago, I signed into law an increase in the minimum wage for fast-food workers. The legislation created new protections for these hard-working people and gave them a greater voice in establishing workplace standards.

That bill, which took effect on April 1, increased the minimum wage to $20 per hour for workers at fast-food chains with 60 or more locations and created new health and safety standards.

Predictably, this modest law prompted fainting spells from conservatives and their enablers in the media. Even before I signed the bill, they quickly said it would lead to devastating job cuts and cause scores of businesses to close.

It was used as a scapegoat for businesses declaring bankruptcy, firing workers and more. As reported by the Los Angeles Times, the corporate restaurant industry even pushed out fake numbers to make it seem like thousands had been fired because of the wage increase.

NEWSOM, CALIFORNIA BUSINESS GROUP SPAR OVER CONTRASTING JOB NUMBERS AFTER MINIMUM WAGE HIKE

Now, the data is in. It shows that the opposite is happening: California now has more fast-food jobs than ever.

We believe in fairness, equity and the idea that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. And these results dispel the cynics who say we must choose between protecting workers and growing the economy.

In fact, fast-food jobs have increased every month this year. Since the law was enacted, California has added 11,000 new jobs in the industry. As of July, our state boasts a historic 750,500 fast-food jobs.

But the benefits of a higher minimum wage extend well beyond these job numbers. A quarter of fast-food workers are the primary income earners for their families, and two-thirds are women. These workers are more likely than most to deal with workplace retaliation, extreme heat, unsafe working conditions, wage theft and more.

Because of California's compassion for working people, these men and women living paycheck to paycheck now enjoy better working conditions, reduced financial stress and greater opportunities for upward mobility. Families are finding it easier to make ends meet, reducing their reliance on public assistance programs and contributing to a healthier, more prosperous state.

US STATES LOOKING TO BOOST MINIMUM WAGE TO $20 AS INFLATION ISSUE CONTINUES

This is an industry that has seen profits soar while wages stagnate. Last year, the top 10 fast food chains saw surging growth, including McDonald's, which had a 63% increase in profits. Also, last year, the 10 biggest fast-food companies spent $6.1 billion on stock buybacks - largely benefiting Wall Street investors.

Contrast those profits with the stories of real people working to support themselves and their families.

Julieta Garcia, a Los Angeles Pizza Hut worker, said, ""Before the increase I had to choose between paying rent or bills on time every month."" Dionicia Cerbacio, who works at a McDonald's in San Jose, said she's ""hoping to save up and take my grandkids to Disneyland for the first time."" Karina Ceballos, who works at a Castro Valley Jack in the Box, saw $400 extra in her check and said, ""I might be able to even save some money.""

Our commitment to raising the minimum wage is a testament to California's values. We believe in fairness, equity and the idea that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. And these results dispel the cynics who say we must choose between protecting workers and growing the economy.

The positive impacts we are seeing - job growth, improved working conditions and enhanced economic stability - prove that this policy is not only economically sound but the right thing to do for California families."
Trump Says He Will Meet Another Foreign Leader Next Week -- Indian Prime Minister Modi,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/09/18/trump-says-he-will-meet-another-foreign-leader-next-week-indian-prime-minister-modi/,2024-09-18T05:39:37Z,"Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he visits the U.S. next week, adding to a growing list of foreign leaders Trump has met since becoming the Republican presidential nominee this year.

If the meeting takes place next week, Modi will be the latest in a string of foreign leaders who have met with Trump since he became the GOP's presidential candidate. In April, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida in an attempt to persuade him to back additional military aid for Ukraine. At the time, the British Foreign Office said it was ""standard practice for ministers to meet opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement"". A few weeks later, Polish President Andrzej Duda met Trump in New York. Duda, who had once proposed renaming a military base in his country to ""Fort Trump"", was praised by the former president, who said he was doing a ""fantastic job"" and ""he's my friend."" In July, Trump hosted Hungary's far-right leader Viktor Orban -- who appeared to endorse his candidacy -- at Mar-a-Lago. During last week's presidential debate, Trump named Orban as one of the foreign leaders who respects him, in response to Vice President Harris' jibe that world leaders are ""laughing"" at the former president. Later in July, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- whose relationship with Trump had soured after he congratulated Biden in 2020 over his election win -- met with Trump in Mar-a-Lago.

Trump, who previously called India the ""king of tariffs"", outlined his own plan to use tariffs on imports from countries like China and India, saying: ""So we're going to do a reciprocal trade. If anybody charges us 10 cents, if they charge us $2, if they charge us 100% or 250, we charge them the same thing. And what's going to happen? Everything's going to disappear, and we're going to end up having free trade again. And if it doesn't disappear, we're going to take in a lot of money."" Economic experts, however, have warned that across-the-board tariffs will end up raising prices for American customers and trigger inflation.

Trump says that 'only consequential presidents get shot at' during Michigan event,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-only-consequential-presidents-get-shot-at-during-michigan-event,2024-09-18T01:24:35Z,"FLINT, Michigan - Former President Donald Trump argued that it is ""consequential"" presidents who face the threats he has over the last few months at a town hall event in Flint, Michigan, the former president's first since surviving an assassination attempt Sunday.

""You wonder why I got shot at right. You know, only consequential presidents get shot at right,"" Trump said during the town hall at Flint's Dort Financial Center.

The event marked Trump's first official campaign stop since the latest attempt on his life Sunday, when a lone gunman was spotted by U.S. Secret Service agents while Trump was playing a round of golf at Trump International Golf Club in Florida.

A DECISION TO MAKE: HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON'S GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILL DIVIDES REPUBLICANS

The gunman, identified as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, was spotted by Secret Service agents as Trump moved between holes five and six on the course, with the agents firing at Routh after spotting his rifle and scope poking out of the brush.

Trump, who was about 300-500 yards away from the shooter at the time of the incident, escaped uninjured.

The attempt marked the second time Trump faced an assassination attempt, coming just over two months after the former president was grazed in the ear by a bullet fired at him during a rally in Butlery, Pennsylvania.

Trump reflected on the attempts on his life during the Michigan event, saying being and running for president is a ""dangerous business.""

""It's a dangerous business. However, being president, it's a little bit dangerous. It's. You know, they think race car driving is dangerous. No, they think bull riding. That's pretty scary, right? No, this is a dangerous business, and we have to keep it safe,"" Trump said.

The former president spent much of the event, which took place in a critical swing state, hitting Vice President Kamala Harris on issues such as inflation and the auto industry.

""'I'll say this for Michigan, if I don't win, you will have no auto industry within two to three years,"" Trump said. ""China is going to take over all of your business because of the electric car and because they have the material we don't.""

The Bond Bulls Better Be Right,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobhaber/2024/09/17/the-bond-bulls-better-be-right/,2024-09-18T00:31:29Z,"We are still in the midst of one of the most fascinating bond market periods ever in history -- and ""ever"" is a long time. Just a few years ago, we had grown accustomed to ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy), with rates near zero across maturities, and even negative in large parts of Europe and Asia. Then came 2022, with an inflationary shock not seen since the 1970s, driven by aggressive fiscal spending -- cash flowing from the federal government directly to businesses and consumers, all financed by Federal Reserve money printing. This was a real-world trial of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), though before that term was coined, it was more accurately known as Weimar Treasury Theory. Add supply chain disruptions to the mix, and we saw the most aggressive global interest rate hikes since the Volcker era, leading to the worst bond market returns on record.

After bond investors went through this punishing period, they were left speculating whether the Fed's policy was too restrictive and when rate cuts might begin. This period saw the longest yield curve inversion in history -- from July 2022 to September 2024, lasting 24 months. Holding anything other than cash during this time meant enduring low returns and high volatility. Yet, not holding longer-duration bonds left investors at risk of missing out on a future bond rally that ""was bound to happen"" someday.

Finally, after two years, during the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium this August, where the current ""Lords of Finance"" (as chronicled in Liaquat Ahamed's excellent book) meet amidst the scenic Wyoming backdrop, Jerome Powell hinted that it was time to reduce interest rates and focus more exclusively on the labor market. His remarks sparked a 'bull steepening trade,' where short-term yields fell faster than long-term yields. The market took this as a signal, and now the forward rate curve projects as many as 10 rate cuts -- over 200 basis points -- by the end of 2025.

This 200-basis-point figure is particularly noteworthy, as history provides a precedent that suggests it might be on target. In late 2022, I wrote an article for Forbes titled titled ""I'm a believer"" (The Monkees big hit of 1966-67, written by Neil Diamond)"", outlining the bullish case for equities by drawing on a similar period in 1967, when an inverted yield curve did not lead to a recession. At that time, the Fed Funds Rate dropped from a median of 5.76% in November 1966 to a low of 3.69% in July 1967, a dramatic decline in just nine months -- without the instant market feedback we get today through social media or Bloomberg terminals.

The Fed's nearly 200-basis-point cut in 1967 did have short-term merit. Real GDP growth fell to just 0.3% (SAAR), corporate profits declined by 7.5%, and unemployment rose from 3.6% to 4.0%. These figures pointed to a soft-landing scare, which motivated the Fed to cut rates. However, in hindsight, then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin admitted upon his retirement in 1970 that he felt he had failed, possibly recognizing that those 1967 cuts had opened Pandora's box for future inflationary problems.

Today, the market is betting that the Fed Funds Rate will be at 3.00% by this time next year. Unlike in 1966, though, today's stock market is near all-time highs, corporate profits are strong with nearly 11% growth, and while the labor market may be sending mixed signals, the effects of mass immigration over the last four years on the labor force are unclear. More importantly, the services sector remains robust, household and corporate balance sheets look solid (according to Federal Reserve data), and the Treasury continues its stimulative spending.

So why is the bond market betting on 200 basis points of rate cuts? Are we about to lift the lid on another Pandora's box? Could the bond market be preparing for yet another U-turn?"
"5 'Ironclad' Rules To Grab 8%+ Dividends, Upside",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/09/17/5-ironclad-rules-to-grab-8-dividends-upside/,2024-09-17T23:16:14Z,"Interest rates are (finally!) set to fall. As they do, we're going to bag bargain-priced 8%+ dividends from a pattern we can set our watches to at times like this.

I'm talking about the mainstream crowd's habit of ""reaching for yield"" when Powell & Co. drop rates, eroding yields on CDs, Treasuries and the like.

As these investors go on the hunt for higher payouts, I expect them to flock to closed-end funds (CEFs), one of our favorite income plays, thanks to the 8%+ yields these funds kick out.

But of course, we need to make sure we're front-running the crowd into the right CEFs: those with high, safe, and ideally monthly payouts, while sidestepping the many dogs out there. We'll do that with my 5 ""ironclad"" rules for CEF buying, which we'll get into below.

First, to get a sense of the gains I see in store for CEFs in the next year, we need to start with the past, specifically the (seemingly innocent!) days of late 2018.

Back then, the Fed had just brought in its last hike of a cycle that started in late 2015. Then, starting in mid-2019, it made three rate cuts between then and the societal dumpster fire that hit in March 2020.

That's the kind of downward drift we're likely to see in rates in the coming months, whether this week's cut is 25 basis points or 50 -- especially after last week's CPI report, which showed inflation still moving lower, but the so-called ""core"" rate still ticking up just a bit more than expected month-over-month.

Of course, we'll get the details on the Fed's first rate cut when Powell and Co. drop their latest decision tomorrow. Futures markets, for their part, see rates down 125 basis points or so by the end of January, as of this writing.

That's a slightly stronger downward move than we saw in 2019, but it's in the neighborhood, so that time period is worth a look now.

How did CEFs do back then? Just fine!

The Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund (CSQ) -- a good benchmark for CEFs, since it holds two-thirds of its portfolio in stocks (in a sector breakdown similar to the S&P 500) and the rest in stocks and bonds -- soared:

It makes sense: Most CEFs use leverage to bolster returns, and the resulting lower borrowing costs flow straight to their bottom lines (and to us through their rich 8%+ dividends!).

Meantime, with a hard landing looking less likely (as I discussed in my September 11 Contrarian Outlook article), continued strength of the US economy pushes up their share prices.

With that in mind, let's roll through the five steps we need to take to unlock life-changing (and often monthly paid) dividends, as well as upside, from CEFs:

The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund (DSL) has been a strong performer since we added it to our Contrarian Income Report portfolio back in April 2016. DSL yielded 11% when we bought, just a touch higher than the 10.2% current yield today.

And indeed, DSL has performed well for us, easily beating the corporate-bond benchmark SPDR Bloomberg High-Yield Bond Fund (JNK) and delivering an 80% return to date during our holding period, a strong performance from a bond fund.

Even so, traditional analysts have always missed the beauty of DSL and other CEFs because they only focus on price charts. But because CEFs throw off huge dividends, looking at price alone gives you at best half the picture, and sometimes much less than that!

DSL's performance from its bottom during the COVID crash in March of 2020 until this writing illustrates the point perfectly:

As you can see above, the price action (in the third column) is a lot lower than the dividend-reinvested total return (in the fourth column) in this timeframe.

That's not an indictment of CEF price performance, by the way. It simply shows that we need to look at CEFs -- especially those with truly massive payouts like DSL -- much differently than stocks and ETFs.

The bottom line: Take price-only CEF charts, which are the norm on screeners like Google Finance and Yahoo! Finance, with a grain of salt. Brokerage statements typically report price-only returns, too.

A closed-end fund can pay you from some combination of:

Of the three, investment income is preferable because it's usually the most reliable. Many CEFs pay monthly distributions, so it's best if they match up their payouts with steady income streams.

Capital gains from rising bond or stock prices can further boost distributions. But they are at risk of disappearing if the markets drop.

Finally, everyone assumes that return of capital is bad because it's simply shipping your money back to you. But if the fund trades at a significant discount, this can actually be a savvy way to kick-start the closing of a discount window. More on this shortly.

In a little more than eight years, we've collected 83% of our original purchase price in dividends from DSL, likely headed to 100%. Once you clear that level, everything else you pocket -- in dividends and price upside -- is gravy.

That's what makes CEFs so compelling for retirement investing -- when you buy CEFs with high, steady payouts, they act like an annuity, but better!

Most investors are conditioned to a fault by their experience with mutual funds and ETFs to search out the lowest fees. This makes sense for investment vehicles that are roughly going to perform in line with the broader market. Lowering your costs minimizes drag.

Usually, but not always. Closed-end funds are a different animal. On the whole, there are more dogs than gems. It's critical to find a great manager with a solid track record. Great managers tend to be expensive, of course, but they're well worth it.

The stated yields you see quoted, by the way, are always net of fees. Your account will never be debited for the fees from any fund you own. They are simply paid by the fund from its NAV. You receive the yield you see -- a rare and happy case of truth in packaging!

One aspect of the CEF structure lends itself perfectly to contrary-minded investing: a fixed pool of shares.

Mutual funds issue more shares whenever they want, fixed each day at NAV. But CEFs have a fixed share count, with their units trading like stocks. As a result, from time to time a fund will fall out of favor and find its shares trading at a discount to its NAV.

This is basically ""free money"" because these underlying assets are constantly marked to market (unlike mutual funds). If a CEF trades at a 10% discount, management could theoretically liquidate it and pay everyone $1.10 on the dollar. Or it can buy back its own shares to close the discount window (and boost the share price).

A discount is a great start, but context matters a lot here, since many funds have discounts that simply never change, so we want to make sure management has a plan to close it. Even better if that plan is backed by a discount that's sharply narrowed, or swung to a premium, in the past, so we can ""ride along"" to price gains the next time it shrinks."
Why Money Is Stressing 45% Of Americans Right Now,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcperna/2024/09/17/why-money-is-stressing-americans/,2024-09-17T22:09:08Z,"Write a plot twist for the better in your personal 'money story.'

Stressed about your money? You're far from alone. A new survey by Ally Financial found that 45% of Americans are concerned about their personal finances. Yep -- almost 1 in 2 people are experiencing some level of financial pressure at any given moment.

And many times, they'll tell you about it. A majority (72%) don't find money a taboo subject anymore, and many actively seek out emotional support for managing their finances on at least a monthly basis. Generation Z is the most likely to do this at 55%, followed by 42% of Millennials, 33% of Gen X and 22% of Boomers.

We all know that the economy isn't making things any easier right now. Many people are experiencing significant financial hardship due to things like inflation, cost of living, student loan debt, low or stagnant wages and other variables.

At the same time, if this many people are expressing anxiety over their financial situation, it may be time to step back and look at the bigger picture -- or rather, the inner picture. What's going on inside our heads that is making money so hard?

It's these intrinsic money challenges that Ally Financial is interested in solving through its new MoneyRoots program. Launched with a 'money tree' giveaway last month at the World Trade Center in New York City, this program seeks to empower individuals to dig into the reasons they approach money the way they do -- and how they can give their own 'money story' a plot twist for the better.

""Each person has their own money story with factors that contribute to financial stress or concerns,"" says Jack Howard, Head of Money Wellness at Ally. ""Finances are never a one-size-fits-all.""

I recently connected with Howard to discuss why so many people are worried about money -- and how a psychology-based approach might just change the game. Here's what we covered.

Money anxiety is something almost everyone experiences, but individual circumstances and mindsets can have a big impact on how deep that anxiety goes. ""We live in a society that makes mindless spending very easy with click-and-buy technology that makes it easier than ever to impulse shop, which may not reflect your personal goals and values, often leading to credit card debt,"" says Howard.

Then, there's the temptation to keep up with what seemingly everyone else is doing. ""For many, social media is a highlight reel of all the positives in life -- a trip to Italy, a new car or tickets to a weekend music festival, to just name a few,"" says Howard. ""Mindless scrolling through our feeds might have us feeling ashamed or depressed that we're not doing the same things our friends are doing and can cause a spiral of overspending to try and keep up with what we see online.""

Add today's external financial pressures to the mix, and it's easy to see why so many people are finding it hard to relax about their money.

""There are many emotions, ranging from shame to fear, that cause people to ignore their money issues or change their spending habits,"" says Howard. ""By understanding the psychology behind a person's earliest experiences with money and emotions tied to financial habits, we can start alleviating those feelings of anxiety -- helping people rewrite their money story and beliefs to better align with their financial goals and personal values.""

Although most people will discuss money, the conversation can be hard to have. ""Most of the time when people are feeling stressed or embarrassed about their past money history, it's because they know the decisions and habits they've developed simply don't align with their current values, beliefs and goals,"" says Howard. In other words, they're feeling shame.

Howard points to the example of someone who learned the lesson ""money buys happiness"" from their parents who used money as a form of retail therapy. ""But as they got older and had more experiences with money, they realized this taught them to overspend as a form of short-term gratification,"" he says.

The same can also be true for people who grew up in a family that did not have a lot of money. ""You may see signs of hyper-saving as an adult despite having the income and net worth to enjoy money,"" says Howard. ""This person may fear 'looking rich' or have a scarcity mindset that creates the feeling that there will never be enough money.""

All of this, he says, can lead to feeling embarrassed, ashamed or stressed -- especially when we get older and realize how the emotions that came from those early life experiences with money influenced bad financial habits that no longer serve us.

""Reflecting on these experiences and identifying ways to change those hard-wired behaviors is a crucial first step for those who want to feel more aligned to goals and values that reflect who they are today,"" says Howard.

In contrast to older generations who kept money matters more private, Howard says Gen Z has introduced trends like 'loud budgeting' that encourage people to take control of their money, stop spending frivolously and be proud of being money conscious. ""Younger generations, especially Gen Z, are not afraid to tell their peers when they don't have money to go out for a social event or pay money for a vacation with friends,"" he says.

In many ways this frankness has been born of their financial experiences thus far, which have often been less than great. ""Gen Z has gone through their fair share of economic crises -- from seeing their parents grapple with the 2008 recession, to the COVID-19 pandemic bringing the world at a standstill, to rising college tuition and debt, to a tough housing market that is making it more difficult than ever for people to experience the American dream,"" says Howard.

""This is a generation that understands that finances influence their mental wellbeing, and that's why it was important for Ally to develop a financial wellness program that's shame free, grounded in empathy and reflective of the younger generations' goals to ultimately create a better relationship with money.""

Howard points out that although there is no lack of tools and training in the 'hard skills' of money management, Americans are still racking up record-breaking debt and feeling financial stress and anxiety like never before.

""I've spent the last 14 years helping people better understand money through financial education initiatives at Ally,"" he says, ""and during my experience, I came to realize people not only need to understand the skills of money -- how to save, spend and invest -- but in order to create real change, people need to understand their mindset around money and the why behind their spending and saving decisions.

""Getting to the root of your money relationship creates the space to find the joy in money, and in life.""

In an increasingly complex and challenging financial landscape, it's no longer enough to know 'how' to manage our money. We also need our personal 'why.'"
The Federal Reserve is on the verge of cutting interest rates. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5115907/federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation,2024-09-17T22:05:32Z,"The Federal Reserve is about to start cutting interest rates for the first time since 2020, but a big question looms: How far will they go?

It won't be an easy call. For more than a year, the Fed has kept borrowing costs at their highest level in more than two decades. That's made it more expensive to get a car loan, finance a business, or carry a balance on a credit card.

Now that the Fed has made clear it will be cutting interest rates, it will need to decide whether to opt for a modest quarter-percentage-point rate cut, or a more aggressive half-a-point cut.

That uncertainty has made this meeting one of the most highly anticipated in a while.

Here are three things to know ahead of the Fed's decision, due out at 2 p.m. ET.

The only certainty is that the central bank will be cutting interest rates. That's not exactly a ""stop the presses"" headline. Fed chairman Jerome Powell telegraphed it nearly a month ago.

It's the size of the rate cut that remains in doubt.

It's a tough call. Inflation has fallen substantially, with consumer prices rising by an annual 2.5% in August, down from a pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But prices are still climbing somewhat faster than the Fed would like.

At the same time, the U.S. job market is starting to show some weakness. Hiring has slowed and unemployment is inching up, hitting 4.2% last month.

All in all, the data is not pointing in a clear direction, meaning the Fed could really go either way.

Some economists who worry about the labor market believe the Fed should go bigger, delivering a half-percentage-point cut. Others feel the Fed can be more patient, starting with a quarter-percentage-point cut while it continues to assess the incoming data.

Bets on a quarter- vs half-a-percentage point cut have swung wildly on Wall Street. As of late afternoon on Tuesday, investors thought a larger cut was nearly twice as likely as the quarter-point move.

The size of the rate cut is bound to create split opinions in markets, but analysts also say that at least one thing is clear: Wednesday's rate cut won't be the last.

Investors expect the Fed to continue cutting rates in the next few months, marking a turning point from an extraordinary period in the U.S. economy when the Fed was forced to sharply raise interest rates to fight surging inflation.

Uncertainty about the pace of rate cuts will continue -- but Wall Street also has other things on its plate, including the looming presidential election.

September is historically a bad month for markets -- and, in election years, that rough patch extends through October. Investors are also keeping an eye on the tech sector, which has been volatile amid fears that companies are spending too much on artificial intelligence for too little return on their investments.

It's a lot to juggle, and analysts are urging investors to be patient.

""I'm a little dubious about the rate cut reducing uncertainty,"" says Steven Wieting, the chief investment strategist for Citi Wealth.

But Wieting also noted some of this uncertainty will likely die down in the coming months, especially following the U.S. elections.

""Ultimately, we'll get a clearer direction,"" he adds.

Borrowing money is going to get a little bit cheaper. Interest rates on car loans and credit cards should come down a bit. For people with money in the bank, on the other hand, the interest rate they get on their savings might also drop.

Meanwhile, mortgage rates have already come down in anticipation of the Fed's move. The average rate on a 30-year home loan is now 6.2%, the lowest since February 2023. That's still higher than the rates around 3% common during the pandemic, but it's down substantially from the peak last year of nearly 8%.

But here's one thing to keep in mind: Whether the Fed cuts rates on Wednesday by a quarter-percentage-point or by half-a-percentage point, it's going to take some time for these falling rates to really make a difference in the economy.

Monetary policy is like the hot water in some older houses. You can crank the water all the way to hot, but it still takes time for it to get there."
Puncturing The Phillips Curve Myth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2024/09/17/puncturing-the-phillips-curve-myth/,2024-09-17T20:45:58Z,"We are approaching September 19th when the Fed is widely expected to cut the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, if not more. The Fed's twin mandate, keeping inflation under control and aiming for low unemployment is really in the service of the American economy and in the public interest. Most of the other functions are regulatory. The choice between the twin mandates are meant to be expressed in the Phillips curve. The Fed and the economic establishment relies on the Phillips curve based models to help them choose between the Scylla of high unemployment and the Charybdis of inflation.

""Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,"" was the theme of the economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming in August. The Fed telegraphed that rate cuts are on the way. They give themselves credit for falling inflation, which they claim is due to the ""Effectiveness and proper Transmission of Monetary Policy"". They were late to raise interest rates, and now they are late to cut. Mostly, this is due to their reliance on flawed models. Add to this the delay and lack of integrity in the measurement of various economic indicators. Bad models plus bad data yield results once in a while, similar to a broken clock that is right twice a day. The first paper presented during the symposium extends the Phillips curve towards the vertical leg of the Phillips curve.

The Phillips curve, interpreted today as the classic seesaw between unemployment and inflation, was created from pre-WWI data for the UK. That such a curve fitting exercise on local empirical data from the long eclipsed British Empire has become the staple of economic theory and the rationale for action or the lack of it, is completely normal in a discipline that hopes to measure, and control complex phenomena. Today's economic conditions bear no resemblance to the late Victorian era.

Economics is not physics. Even physics is not an exact science when it comes to modeling complex phenomena such as weather and climate. Models depend on simplification. Linking two economic measures such as inflation and unemployment is one of those simplifications. The economic establishment glosses over this simplification.

Low inflation for two decades lulled the economic establishment into a transitory mindset as inflation started going up in 2021. The Fed held down the overnight and fed fund rates. As Jerome Powell noted in his Jackson hole 2024 address team transitory was vanquished and the Fed tightened interest rates in an unprecedented manner. Prominent economists such as Lawrence Summers opined in 2022 that we need huge unemployment over multiple years to bring inflation under control. This is a Phillips curve maximalist view. Some of them even predicted that inflation cannot be controlled without a recession.

The Phillips curve has undergone revisions and updated thinking. This defense of a model, which has lost its predictive power, especially at the ends of its curve speaks to the myths of economics and the paucity of tools that have predictive or even analytic power. Revisions and add-ons have yielded at least nine Nobel prizes. Phillips himself did not consider the eponymous curve significant. The Phillips curve has become somewhat of a shibboleth in economic circles. The fact that an orthodoxy exists is due to the fact that almost all of the economists of note and power in the government and in control of major economic publications come from a handful of institutions. An echo chamber that amplifies these myths.

Phillips curve as Phillips created it was not about inflation at all. The curve shows the relationship between unemployment and rate of change of wages in the years 1861-1913 in the UK. As part of the myth-making process of the 70s and before, the rate of change of wages was meant to stand in for the money supply in the economy. When there is more money, people are willing to pay more for the same goods or services. When people are willing to pay more, then inflation takes hold. Or so the argument goes. As the economist James Forder has shown, the myth of the Phillips curve as a choice between inflation and labor costs was created by an anti-labor cost sentiment among economists. You can read about it in ""Forder, James (2014). Macroeconomics and the Phillips curve myth. Oxford University Press.""

There was a period of low inflation coupled with low unemployment in about two decades leading up to 2020. This phenomenon caused economists to concentrate on the horizontal part of the Phillips curve. Then inflation took hold during the post-pandemic period and later post Ukraine invasion. Further shocks were delivered by the Gaza war. Such unexpected inflation may very well have to do with the amount of money in the system; due to low unemployment as well as pandemic spending. In a globalized economy, the complete stoppage of production in China during the zero-covid period caused supply side ructions and hence higher costs. Rising energy costs due to supply constraints as Russia went offline for most of the developed world as well as the recent disruptions in the supply routes by the Gaza invasion contributed as well. Apportioning inflation to supply or demand is a tough challenge. Nonetheless, it has not deterred academics from trying, they attribute 60% to low unemployment and 40% to supply shocks. They do some fancy somersaults to justify these figures.

If inflation can be traced to price-inflation, because of greed and because of the shutdown of the Chinese economy, America's factory then the Fed is helpless to control it. It does not seem to be wage-inflation that is the main culprit. The executive branch and fiscal policy are also off the hook.

The myth of the Phillips curve as a trade off between unemployment and inflation was born during the ideological struggles of the 70s. This myth focused on short run Phillips curve being flat by the labor friendly economists. It is nearly vertical as unemployment reaches a low point. It is as if, it hit a wall. Arguments about union aggressiveness, the natural rate of unemployment and other such myths get trotted out when inflation rises and unemployment goes down. There is almost no justification for inflation to tend toward infinity as the unemployment rate goes below 1.5 percent. Labor's power to effect wages has also gone down over the years as union representation has gone down. This is notwithstanding the victories eked out in the recent year by the UAW, the Teamsters and others.

The fact that many goods get manufactured globally, the role of innovation and increase in productivity and many of the economic facts of modern production and consumption are not present in a Phillips curve based interpretation of inflation vs. unemployment. Globalization and the export of manufacturing and even services to other countries is not factored in. Immigration is another phenomenon missing in the Phillips curve based analysis in the recent past in the US. Immigrants both legal and illegal have contributed to productivity and lowering labor costs. The numbers in the late Victorian era for the British empire have also been subject to globalization. Captive raw materials, both agricultural and otherwise, flowed into the British Isles. A boom in British manufacturing followed. The Phillips curve should be retired. A new paradigm needs to be born.

A paper presented at the Jackson Hole symposium injected the Beveridge threshold at the lower end. The authors of the paper contend that when the Beveridge threshold is breached, the Phillips curve percentage of wage increases are almost vertical, tending almost to infinity.

Only in dreams can labor hope to get wage increases tending to infinity as unemployment goes down. Instead of abandoning the Phillips curve as they should have, economists double down on it. Creating many variants, this time with the Beveridge threshold.

That there is an inverse relationship between unemployment and wage increases is not a great revelation. That wage increases trigger inflation is not a given. This is true especially when goods and services are produced in lower cost regimes, with lower labor protections and costs. These goods are then shipped to countries that can afford to pay for them. They are also targeted to these richer nations. It is doubtful whether items such as Santa figurines will find much of a market in China or India.

Added to this there are problems with measurement of basic economic data. Vacancy rates, unemployment itself, prices and other data that feed inflation measurements have a lot of lag. They are also often revised, even after actions to counter the wrong numbers have already launched.

So what can be done to bring macro-economic policy closer to reality. Models are important, however we need more insight into what the models lack and to be a little more objective. Milton Friedman had suggested replacing the Central Bank with an algorithm. His concept of the algorithm was a steady increase in money supply, say four or five percent a year. There are others who have also argued for the complete elimination of the Fed.

Without the Fed, the 2008 crisis would have seen the bottom drop out of the world. However, the Fed did bail out the wrong parties. Big institutions, banks and the investors got bailed out over main street. We have seen how this drama plays out without Fed intervention. Decades of misery such as during the Great Depression. Ditto with the pandemic. Intervention and counter-cyclic action is paramount. This sort of immediacy and daily intervention is part and parcel of Open Market Operations. The Fed intervenes in the overnight lending market through OMO to stabilize the economy.

We have much more sophisticated tools now. How about collecting data at the source? The first step is collecting and aggregating such data in a verifiable and audited manner through the intermediary of a decentralized apparatus such as a blockchain, which is excellent for provenance. Once the data has more integrity, AI would be effective to steer the economy, with human intervention of course. Monetary policy changes will be made more frequently than the 9 times a year that the FOMC meets. This would go a long way towards the elimination of what is called the business cycle. A steady state is what the Fed and all of us are after. Close to full employment without run-away inflation. Reliance on outmoded and incorrect tools such as the Phillips curve results in our current state where every forecasted move of the Fed causes market volatility and the destruction of perfectly viable enterprises."
6 Best Fidelity Mutual Funds To Invest In,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-fidelity-mutual-funds-to-invest-in/,2024-09-17T18:22:14Z,"Fidelity is among the top five largest fund families in the world. The brand has a strong reputation in no-transaction-fee funds with low expense ratios that provide access to popular market segments. An example is the Fidelity 500 Index Fund, which is the third-largest U.S. mutual fund in terms of net assets.

There are more than 2,100 Fidelity funds specializing in U.S. equities, plus hundreds of other choices for investors seeking debt and international exposure. Across that sizable catalog, six funds stand out as excellent wealth-building vehicles for novice investors with long timelines. Read on to meet those six Fidelity funds below.

Before diving into fund specifics, let's touch on the advantages of mutual fund investing. The big ones are diversification and breadth of choice.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said that diversification protects you against being wrong. He meant it in a negative sense, but the reality is that investors -- even experienced ones -- can be wrong more than they're right. That is why diversification is an important risk-management strategy for most of us.

Mutual funds provide quick diversification. A single fund position holding hundreds of different assets is cheaper to buy and easier to manage than a portfolio of individual stocks.

Even better, the breadth of mutual funds available makes it easy to implement a targeted asset allocation, whether you want a two-fund portfolio or something more complex.

With that context, let's define the features that make our six best Fidelity mutual funds so attractive. All six meet the criteria below.

Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts.

The table below introduces the six selected Fidelity mutual funds that stack up well against peers, in terms of returns and expenses.

Table data source: Fidelity.com

Despite the shared characteristics noted above, these funds do vary in their investment strategies. Let's review each to help you decide which, if any, fit your investment goals and risk tolerance.

The Fidelity 500 index fund invests in all S&P 500 stocks. As a reminder, the S&P 500 includes leaders in each of the 11 economic sectors that meet size, profitability and liquidity requirements. Cumulatively, S&P 500 companies account for 80% of the value in the U.S. public stock market.

FXAIX provides low-cost access to a stock group that has historically performed well. Over the long-term, the S&P 500 has grown about 7% annually on average after inflation. The fund's low expense ratio allows nearly all the underlying returns to benefit fund shareholders.

The fund is a good choice as a sole equity position or as a core holding in a more complex allocation.

Another Fidelity index fund, this large-cap growth portfolio tracks the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes stocks within the large-cap Russell 1000, which have higher price-to-book ratios, optimistic growth outlooks from analysts and relatively high sales per share growth over the past five years.

FSPGX targets large companies with growth characteristics. There is an overlap between the Russell 1000 Growth and the S&P 500, so you probably don't want to hold this fund alongside the previous one on this list. The S&P 500 fund has more positions and a lower expense ratio, while FSPGX could produce greater returns -- albeit with more volatility.

FSPGX did outperform the S&P 500 fund over the last one-year and five-year timeframes. However, the S&P 500 fund had a slightly higher average return over the past three years.

Fidelity Equity Income Fund invests in a portfolio of large-cap stocks that collectively deliver a higher dividend yield than the S&P 500. The portfolio stocks primarily fall into the value category. Top sector weightings are financials at 19%, healthcare at 15% and industrials at 12%.

FEQIX provides both income and capital appreciation from its large-cap portfolio. This fund is somewhat less risky than the two funds above, which means it's suitable for investors with a more moderate risk tolerance. Most of the fund, 83%, is in U.S. stocks. There is also exposure to Europe, Canada and emerging markets.

Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts.

The Fidelity International Fund tracks the MSCI EAFE index, which includes large and midcap stocks from developed countries not including U.S. and Canada.

Individual foreign stocks are more volatile than their domestic counterparts. Fortunately, this fund is heavily diversified across more than 750 positions. Top holdings include Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk, semiconductor supplier ASML Holdings and food and beverage maker Nestle.

The FSPSX portfolio provides diversified and low-cost international exposure without overlapping U.S. large-caps that often dominate core holdings. Since foreign stocks can be volatile due to exchange rates and changing sociopolitical environments, most investors will want to hold FSPSX in a smaller allocation versus U.S. stocks.

The Fidelity Multi-Asset Index Fund invests in Fidelity stock and bond index funds to maintain a targeted asset allocation across both asset classes. The fund provides exposure to domestic stocks, developed and emerging market equities, investment-grade bonds, U.S. Treasury bonds and international bonds.

FFNOX is a complete portfolio that invests in roughly 85% stocks and 15% bonds. With its low net expense ratio of 0.11%, the fund is ideal for investors who want global diversification with minimal effort. There is no rebalancing required, nor do FFNOX shareholders need to hold any other positions -- that is, unless they also want exposure to alternative assets like cryptocurrency or real estate.

FFNOX shareholders should revisit their risk tolerance and goals periodically to ensure continued alignment with the fund's asset allocation.

Fidelity Investment Grade Bond Fund invests in high- and medium-quality debt securities. U.S. Treasury securities comprise nearly 52% of the portfolio, while corporate bonds make up another 24%. There are smaller positions in mortgage-backed and asset-backed debts.

FBNDX has a balanced portfolio that delivers a nice yield with moderate interest-rate sensitivity. This isn't the lowest-risk bond fund out there, but it's not overly aggressive either. FBNDX can complement and stabilize an equity-heavy portfolio while delivering relatively reliable income payments monthly.

Fidelity has a large catalog of mutual funds, many featuring popular exposures and competitive expense ratios. Novice, hands-free investors with a long timeline can't go wrong with Fidelity's Multi-Asset Fund. Those with more experience may prefer teaming a U.S. large-cap fund with smaller holdings in international stocks and investment-grade bonds."
What Have Harris And Trump Said About Interest Rates? Here's What To Know Ahead Of Key Fed Decision.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/17/what-have-harris-and-trump-said-about-interest-rates-heres-what-to-know-ahead-of-key-fed-decision/,2024-09-17T18:00:33Z,"As the Federal Reserve heads into one of its most consequential meetings in recent memory, here's how the presidential candidates have addressed the Fed and its management of interest rates during the campaign cycle, and, while former President Donald Trump has been far more outspoken, allies of Vice President Kamala Harris have not completely shied away from nudging for action.

The U.S.' central bank's most important function is arguably determining the federal funds rate, the interest charged for capital reserve transactions between financial institutions, set by a panel of Fed officials known as the Federal Open Market Committee. The federal funds rate is often broadly just referred to as interest rates, considering its outsized influence on most U.S. borrowing from corporate bonds to new car loans. The bank historically runs independently from the rest of the federal government, guided by a ""dual mandate"" to minimize inflation and maximize employment, meaning its goal is to set the U.S. economy on a long-term path of growth. The Fed typically raises rates when inflation is too high, like it did in 2022 and 2023, and lowers rates when there's a threat of a serious economic downturn, like it did in early 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Other than conducting its monetary policy objectives, the Fed also regulates commercial banks and controls how much money is in circulation.

Little to none in theory, given the Fed's pride in independent decision making. However, the president appoints and the Senate confirms the Fed's seven board of governors, who have permanent seats on the 12-person Federal Open Markets Committee. Biden appointed four of the Fed governors, though Trump tapped Powell to the top central banker job he's held since 2018.

One of the Federal Open Markets Committee's eight annual meetings takes place Tuesday and Wednesday, which is crucially the last meeting before the Nov. 5 election. Consensus is unusually split on what the Fed is expected to do, with market-implied probabilities of the Fed decision the least settled since Bank of America research began tracking the metric. Derivative trades monitored by CME Group price in a roughly 65% chance of a 50 basis-point cut announcement Wednesday and 35% odds for a 25 basis-point move (the 75 basis points suggested by Warren does not have much legs). However, the market-implied odds of at least a 0.25 percentage point cut is firmly at 100%, meaning the first rate cut since March 2020 is an all but certainty to come Wednesday.

Project 2025, the controversial political roadmap laid out by Trump allies, though Trump has denied his involvement in the project, calls for a significantly diminished Fed, even laying out a scenario in which the central bank is ""effectively abolished"" in favor of a far more laissez-faire approach."
How Perfection Will Derail Your Retirement,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanshenkman/2024/09/17/how-perfection-will-derail-your-retirement/,2024-09-17T17:26:09Z,"One of the biggest obstacles investors face on the road to a secure retirement is the pursuit of perfection. This may seem counterintuitive. Our culture touts ""practice makes perfect"", we should be continuously training to achieve perfection. Unfortunately, in the world of investing, striving for perfection generally leads to inaction and missed opportunities. Continuously searching for the ideal set of circumstances, which never seem to materialize, causes folks to delay the important planning necessary to prepare for one's financial future.

The below list highlights several traps into which investors fall in their quest for investment perfection. Investors should be aware of these missteps and not let them inhibit their ability to achieve their financial objectives.

1. Waiting for the optimal time to invest: While keeping 3 to 6 months' worth of cash on the sidelines is important in case of an emergency, keeping several years' worth of money sitting in cash, money market funds, or short-term bonds is imprudent for most investors. It is common for people to want to wait for an ideal time to put their money to work. In truth, there is never a perfect time to invest. There will always be some type of turmoil in the world that gets people nervous: war, geopolitical risks, market gyrations, increasingly high stock valuations, a global pandemic, a presidential election, and more. Trying to time the market for the best entry point could just lead to years of waiting and missing out on compound interest.

This issue is particularly relevant today, when investors are tempted to sit on the sidelines given yields on cash are at multi-year highs. Money market funds are paying attractive rates relative to what they were paying over the past 15 years. However, over time the returns on cash or cash equivalents will not be able to outpace inflation. Maintaining too large of a cash position may seem prudent, but it only provides a false sense of security and will lead to losing buying power.

2. Searching for the perfect investment: Every investment carries risk. Sometimes investments work out, and sometimes they don't. Remember that risk and reward are inextricably linked. The purpose of taking risk is to generate a return on one's money. If you want high returns, you will need to take a high level of risk. These risks can encompass a variety of things, including illiquidity, default, and leverage. It is a fruitless pursuit for investors to spend an inordinate amount of time searching for a perfect investment opportunity that provides high returns with no risk. It's far better to spend time developing a strategy that provides a high probability of achieving an investor's financial objectives and balancing risk by diversifying one's funds across asset classes.

3. Buying at the best price: It's human nature to want the best deal. However, waiting for the market to trade at some arbitrary price often leaves investors waiting indefinitely. If you have a prudent strategy in place, then hoping for the market to trade at certain levels is ill-advised. Moving forward immediately with your strategy is generally the right decision. The best time to invest is always today.

4. Implementing the perfect portfolio: There's an infinite amount of literature on portfolio construction. Two investors with the same risk profile, goals and time horizon may have different portfolios suggested to them by various investment firms. All those portfolios may be reasonable. In fact, the more one reads, learns and researches, the more one concludes that there is no one correct way to invest in the market. There are only wrong ways, which include overconcentration in one investment, having no liquidity, or pursuing esoteric strategies. As long as you are diversified in a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and cash, you are likely ready to get started.

5. Delaying savings until attaining an ideal life situation: When young professionals approach me, I always encourage them to save as much money as possible into their company's corporate retirement plan. Even if their cash flow is not great. When you are young, with fewer responsibilities and financial commitments, is generally the best time to save.

6. Refusing to act until you're in an optimal tax situation: Some sophisticated investors stall on making decisions because of the tax ramifications. I know investors who have delayed implementing a more sensible strategy because they are paralyzed by a particular tax liability that would be triggered from repositioning their portfolio. There is no question that taxes are an integral part of any financial plan. However, investors should not remain stagnant because they will need to pay taxes. As I tell these clients, ""Don't let the tax tail wag the investment dog."" Folks who fail to act because of taxes oftentimes end up taking on other risks within their portfolio that will cost them dearly. This includes underperforming investments, overconcentration in one particular stock, and an allocation that is no longer aligned with their goals. Instead of focusing on the tax minutiae, look at the big picture.

At the end of the day, the simple act of getting started on an investment strategy is often the hardest part of any financial plan. It's important to overcome the urge to try to find a more perfect situation. Perfection is a theoretical construct and not attainable. It's far better to make progress, however imperfectly, and adjust along the way. Remember, procrastinating in search of perfection is a decision, and it's usually the wrong one."
New HarrisX/Forbes Poll: Harris Won Debate -- But It Largely Hasn't Changed Voters' Minds,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/17/new-harrisxforbes-poll-harris-won-debate-but-it-largely-hasnt-changed-voters-minds/,2024-09-17T16:45:26Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris is up four points over former President Donald Trump in a new Forbes/HarrisX survey taken after last week's debate -- the latest poll that shows voters believe Harris outperformed Trump in the debate, but it largely hasn't changed her standing in the horserace.

""For the next 45 days this election Trump v. Trump and Harris v. Harris -- or who is best able to build themselves up with the 8% of undecideds and 18% of swing voters yet to make up their mind who are issues voters and don't care much about presentation and rhetoric,"" Nesho said.

Harris outperformed Trump in every debate metric the survey asked about: their behavior/temperament (53% to 36%), their grasp on the policies/issues (49% to 44%), the values they communicated (52% to 41%) and their vision on the future (52% to 44%). More voters (48%) said they feel more confident in her ability to govern as president after the debate, compared to 35% who said the same about Trump. Some 33% said it made them less confident in Harris' ability and 19% said it had no impact, while 40% said it made them less confident in Trump and 25% said it had no impact.

33%. That's the share of voters who said inflation is the most important issue in the election. Voters were split, at 40%, on whether Trump or Harris demonstrated a better grasp on the issue during the debate, with 11% saying neither and 9% saying they don't know.

Harris has erased Trump's national polling lead since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, and she announced her campaign on July 21. In a HarrisX poll days before Biden left the race, Trump led the president 48%-40%, or 53%-47% with leaners. The race is still within single digits nationally and is even closer in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election. Harris and Trump met -- and debated -- last week, their first and likely only face-off of the campaign as Trump has said he won't debate Harris again.

How CFOs Can Start Implementing AI In The Financial Department,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/09/17/how-cfos-can-start-implementing-ai-in-the-financial-department/,2024-09-17T16:02:53Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

IBM's new Global CFO Study finds that CFOs are in a position to make big changes in their companies. Technological innovation, understanding of data and risk, and broad opportunities to influence company decisions put CFOs into the driver's seat in achieving strategic outcomes.

The study states that CFOs should be ""both guardians of stability and agents of transformation. At the epicenter of strategy development and execution, CFOs, working hand in glove with tech leaders, supercharge technology as the transformative force in their organization."" More than six in 10 CFOs said they need to rewrite their organizational playbook, bringing new strategies to the fore and taking advantage of technology. CFOs ranked modernizing technology as the most important driver of competitive advantage over the next few years, with many eyes on using AI to make standard calculations more efficient and make more effective predictions.

Some high-performing CFOs are taking advantage of all that is in front of them and playing a key role in strategy, the study found. However, several CFOs could do more to accelerate their influence, and they seem to be more hesitant to push for major changes. The report reviews what CFOs can do to be better and more effective change agents. Many have to do with data and AI: Work closely with your CIO on tech priorities. Upgrade data management so the information is more useful with AI systems. Use that data to transform strategic principles into measurable metrics. Learn your company's risk tolerance and make calculated bets. Look for ROI, but be sure you're investing in both short-term and long-term payoffs. And make sure your team is trained in areas including data security, data curation and sustainability.

These strategies are not all easy to employ, especially given finance departments have generally had set policies and procedures for decades. However, IBM's study shows that there can be rewards for CFOs who take a position more central to company strategy. Leading CFOs tend to outperform their peers in finances -- returning 39.3% more revenue growth and 10.6% more revenue growth last year -- and with retention, strategy, brand reputation and tech maturity.

How, exactly, can technology help your finance department? Jeff Bronaugh, a partner in financial advisory firm CrossCountry Consulting's national business transformation practice, explained some of the ways to start using it, and provided some advice on implementation. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Today's the day that countless economists, financial professionals, executives and investors have had circled in red on their calendars for more than a month: The beginning of the Federal Reserve Board meeting at which interest rates are going to be cut. The announcement will come Wednesday afternoon when the two-day meeting concludes, but it's an understatement to say their decision is anxiously anticipated.

Interest rates have been at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% since July 2023, and economists are currently wondering how much they will be cut: 25 or 50 basis points. But with last week's consumer price index report showing 2.5% inflation compared with August 2023, and the unemployment rate for August ticking up to 4.2% amid weak job growth -- as well as assurances from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell himself, it's clear something will happen this week.

However, a rate cut won't be an automatic cure-all for the economy's woes. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last week that an overly aggressive rate cut could cause stagflation -- economic stagnation and high inflation and unemployment, writes Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly. Dimon warned that too-aggressive action from the federal government could lead to overspending, which could keep the rest of the economy from fully recovering. Dimon has been an economic pessimist overall; he projected a high chance of a recession last month.

Last week, labor unions showed what businesses would portray as the best of times and the worst of times. On Thursday, about 33,000 unionized machinists in the Pacific Northwest working for Boeing went on strike after rejecting a deal the aerospace manufacturer proposed. Nearly 95% of union members rejected the deal in a vote, and 96% supported going on strike.

The contract Boeing offered employees would have provided 25% pay raises, shifted more health insurance costs to the company, and guaranteed that the company's next plane model would be built in the Puget Sound area. Employees felt they didn't go far enough, and did not flinch from their demands of 40% pay raises and the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan.

Also on Thursday, about 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants represented by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants overwhelmingly approved a five-year contract with the airline, writes Forbes senior contributor Ted Reed. The new contract provides raises of up to 20.5% starting next month, as well as boarding pay and retroactive pay that will reach five figures (up to $50,000) for many. APFA President Julie Hedrick said that while the contract is ratified, there's still work the union needs to do with American Airlines: Make the corporate workers better understand the human side of flight attendants.

The presidential election is seven weeks from today, and Republican candidate Donald Trump sidestepped the campaign Monday night to announce a new family business venture: A cryptocurrency called World Liberty Financial. The new cryptocurrency, which was announced on a livestream on X, would be run by Trump's older sons Don Jr. and Eric, though 18-year-old Barron Trump -- who the former president says is a crypto enthusiast -- is also listed on a white paper describing the business as a ""DeFi Visionary."" Details of the cryptocurrency, including when it would be available, its purpose or details of how it will work were scarce on the livestream, media outlets reported.

In the past, Trump was not a supporter of cryptocurrency, calling bitcoin a ""scam"" in 2021. He's been slowly changing his tune, and has pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler for his agency's crackdown on bad crypto actors and recent attempts at regulation. This year, he's heavily courted the cryptocurrency industry, accepting crypto campaign donations and speaking at the Bitcoin Conference this summer.

Vice President Kamala Harris has not taken any specific position on cryptocurrency.

Ethics experts are concerned Trump's direct involvement in a cryptocurrency could be a serious conflict of interest if elected. Trump would be able to set government crypto policy tailor-made to World Liberty Financial. He also could move the U.S. toward a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, which he's said he plans to do in speeches -- a huge policy shift, and one from which he could directly benefit.

While there's so much talk about bringing AI into the finance department, the practical applications sometimes get lost in the conversations. I talked to Jeff Bronaugh, a partner in financial business advisory firm CrossCountry Consulting's national business transformation practice, for some practical advice and applications. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

How can AI help in the CFO's office today?

Bronaugh: Most CFOs are looking for AI to help out by driving efficiency. Within the office, there's enhanced productivity, generating financial reporting from source documents. There are products that ingest leasing terms and can report on the lease payments. They can create content for external and external and executive reporting. They can write technical accounting memos, board decks, and PowerPoint.

Another area we're seeing AI particularly prevalent is in strategic finance. Products can help provide a predictive element to forecasting, or even provide corporate due diligence on companies using public documents and natural language.

AI's picking up around reconciliations and closed workflow. There are a lot of products that can help provide workflow around the close, and automate reconciliations and accounts, generate commentary when account balances have issues. The idea is taking the monotonous work out of the accountant's hands and having them spend more time on value-added activities.

What kind of advice would you give to a company trying to bring AI into its financial organization?

Start small. Think about solving smaller problems before you try to tackle the macro and look for quick wins.

When you're standing up AI in the organization, it's important that it's done in a constructive way. There has to be governance around the AI. Set up a governance committee so you're thinking holistically about how you want to deploy the architecture within the organization, and drive standards and consistency across business units. If you don't have the framework in place, it is going to be next to impossible to really corral that effort.

When I think of a governance model, there are four key areas that I like to focus on. One is learning and development. The second is around system monitoring and adoption. Think about managing KPIs, making sure it's up and running and that the user can get benefit out of it. Third is really around data privacy, compliance and ethics and making sure that PII or other sensitive information isn't being exposed. And then the fourth is innovation governance. How do we define use and business cases around AI in a way that captures ROI and measures the benefit to the organization to make sure that we're doing things that structure or drive value to the imperatives of an organization.

Many organizations are looking for the efficiency AI can bring. Do you see a lot of them ready to implement AI or do they need to do more in terms of cleaning their data or getting their systems in order?

Organizations that don't have a strong enterprise architecture in place, as I mentioned earlier, are going to struggle with adoption across the entire firm. Data is critically important. I always think of data as garbage in, garbage out. If you don't have good data and good information, it's going to be very tough for an organization to get good value out of AI.

However, the days of mapping AI to data maturity in an organization have gone. There are so many point solutions where AI can be injected in different parts of the financial process that you may not necessarily need to have gold-standard data. AI can still read the invoices, correctly map them, code them, and operate within your ERP. If you have good system controls in place, there are opportunities for AI to come in without a perfect set of information or data.

As you think about larger sets of information, data becomes much more important, particularly when you're marrying internal data with external data around geopolitical economics or industry-related data. That's where good data standards, good data governance are really important.

There are many ways that AI can be used to enhance your business's operations, but there are also many great ideas that won't work. There's a good chance that you may make a wrong choice, and that's OK.

Brace For Crash And Trillions Wiped Out With Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/17/brace-for-crash-and-trillions-wiped-out-with-fed-rate-cut/,2024-09-17T15:28:12Z,"Markets are now pricing a roughly 60% chance for a 50 bps rate cut by Chair Powell's Federal Reserve on Wednesday. Results will be announced at 2 pm EST after the conclusion of the Fed's September 17/18 FOMC meeting.

We're scared of this high expectation.

We believe this is a recipe for huge disappointment. In fact, we consider a 25 bps cut by the Federal Reserve more likely. We certainly hope this doesn't happen but offer this analysis so investors can consider the full range of scenarios as a contrast to our more optimistic views of the Fed's next move.

The thing is, if Chair Powell goes with a 25 bps cut and doesn't add language that comforts investors, markets will pull back in a big way.

This could be much worse than the $2+ trillion wipeout the benchmark S&P 500 index witnessed in the first 3 days of August. We see the magnificent 7 - especially high-growth firms like Nvidia - dropping by 10-20% just like they did last month; erasing hundreds of billions of investor money among them. Expect the broader market to see a drop of at least 5% in the next couple of days with the Nasdaq index losing more. The small caps index Russell 2000 is likely to be hit the worst. Smaller companies, on average, have less cash in hand and rely on near-term debt to finance their operations. Higher rates don't help them. (Do you know how the Trefis HQ strategy, which has outperformed S&P, works with downside protection?)

What's worse?

Just see what happened last month - the S&P 500 had one of its worst string of days when the market wiped out more than 20% from companies like Nvidia (how low can Nvidia go?), with significant drops across the tech sector for giants like Google and Amazon, and for the S&P 500 as a whole. Investors had nowhere to hide. If the Fed decides to go with a 25 bps rate cut on Wednesday, it will be much worse this time around. Things can turn uglier in a hurry if a few bad jobless claims reports over the coming weeks show increased unemployment and inflation continues to stay flat near-term. This will conjure images of a recession in the minds of investors.

In all of this - what can we learn from history? How low can stocks and ETFs/indices go - from the S&P 500 to tech innovator AAPL to pharma giant Merck, which stocks dropped most during past market crashes? Of course, we believe investors will be better off not being too reactive. However, bad times don't make for calm participants.

The truth is companies like Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft are fantastic investments in the long run. However, the near-term volatility for individual stocks can be hard to stomach. If you don't like the rollercoaster ride, learn how the select 30 stocks that constitute the Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) strategy have outperformed the S&P 500 - consistently. And how we add downside protection to HQ. HQ has seen >80% return since its Sep 2020 inception. Hint: it's simple, and right there in the HQ strategy's performance metrics. It is not just about the size of the companies, but also their defensible revenue growth and margins, strong balance sheets, and other quality criteria.

The Debt Bomb

Bad times also focus the mind on follies. The current U.S. debt situation is not just a folly - in some quarters it's considered a ticking time bomb. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently raised a big red flag about the now $1 trillion in annual interest payments the U.S. owes on its debt. This is unprecedented. It is uncharted territory. The point is near-term unfavorable data in the event of a 25 bps drop can quickly lead to new stories of doom and gloom imagined - adding to the downward spiral in investor sentiments, and the stock market.

The other risk is default on loans. All market crashes happen because someone can't pay back their loans. For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while, Covid's work-from-home gift was a big curse for the Retail and Office real-estate sector. In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break, though that hasn't happened - and with Fed rates finally on the downtrend, it's less likely.

Finally, there is consumer defaults - personal loans, auto loans, and credit card loans in particular. That makes banks like JPM, Citigroup, and BofA with large credit card books vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). We hope this risk is transient - because we believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to create a soft landing.

In fact, as we've argued in our contrasting scenario of the Fed's moves - with rates as high as they are currently, the Fed has even more power. There is a lot of room to cut rates and release more liquidity if things go south. They can do a 100 bps cut if things come to that. The Fed can rapidly infuse liquidity if the economy needs a shot for any reason. The big question is - will they do it in the near term?

The sum of it all

All things considered, we believe the short term is likely to be volatile. And we are particularly uncomfortable with high expectations of a 50 bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve. We see a higher chance of more attractive market conditions in the medium term, though, and that's good for investors.

We've developed Trefis strategies to take advantage of such opportunities, especially HQ with downside protection, while carefully managing risk in developing our Trefis portfolio strategies."
Examining The Fed's Rate Cut Conundrum,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danirvine/2024/09/17/examining-the-feds-rate-cut-conundrum/,2024-09-17T15:04:05Z,"The Federal Open Market Committee, the pivotal decision-making body of the Federal Reserve, finds itself at a critical juncture as it prepares for its highly anticipated policy meeting this week. Amidst a backdrop of wide-ranging economic narratives, the committee faces a consequential choice: implement a substantial rate cut of 50 basis points or opt for a more measured approach with a 25 bps reduction.

This decision carries profound implications for the trajectory of monetary policy and the broader financial landscape, igniting a spirited debate among market participants, economists, and policymakers alike.

The Case For A Jumbo Rate Cut

Proponents of a substantial 50 bps rate cut argue that the current economic landscape warrants a bold and decisive move by the Federal Reserve. One of the primary drivers behind the call for a jumbo rate cut is the recent softening in the labor market. While the August employment report revealed a respectable addition of 142,000 jobs, the pace of job gains has slowed considerably compared to the first half of the year. Moreover, downward revisions to job growth in June and July have further amplified concerns about the robustness of the labor market.

Advocates of a larger rate cut, such as former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Bill Dudley, argue that a proactive approach is necessary to safeguard the labor market's resilience and prevent a potential downward spiral. In a Bloomberg op-ed, Dudley contends, ""...a bigger move now makes it easier for the Fed to align its projections with market expectations, rather than delivering an unpleasant surprise not warranted by the economic outlook.""

By lowering borrowing costs and stimulating economic activity, a substantial rate reduction could help sustain job creation and mitigate the risks of a more severe labor market downturn. Additionally, in the face of heightened uncertainty and concerns about an economic slowdown, a substantial rate reduction could serve as a powerful signal of the Federal Reserve's commitment to supporting the economy and promoting financial stability.

By injecting liquidity into the system and lowering borrowing costs, a 50 bps rate cut could stimulate investment, spur consumer spending, and reinvigorate economic activity, fostering a more favorable environment for financial markets.

The Case For A Measured Approach

While the arguments for a substantial rate cut carry weight, a significant contingent of market participants and policymakers advocate for a more cautious and measured approach. They contend that a 25 bps rate reduction strikes a prudent balance between addressing economic concerns and maintaining policy flexibility.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Goldman Sach's chief economist Jon Hatzius said he believes a 25 bps cut is ""...more consistent with the data that we've seen,"" adding, ""I would also expect them to signal clearly, as Governor Waller did on Friday, that they'd be very willing to scale up the pace if the data disappoint.""

Another concern is the potential for unintended consequences stemming from an overly aggressive rate cut. By opting for a smaller rate cut, the Federal Reserve could strike a balance between supporting economic growth and maintaining financial stability, mitigating the risks of unintended consequences that could undermine the economy's long-term health.

Navigating Uncharted Waters

Since 1954, there have been ten recessions, each occurring during a rate-cutting cycle. However, two rate-cutting cycles did not lead to recessions, highlighting the non-deterministic nature of monetary policy actions. And while past rate-cutting cycles often signaled impending recessions, the present situation demands a more nuanced interpretation. The U.S. economy, emerging from an unprecedented period of growth and stimulus following the COVID-19 pandemic, is exhibiting a controlled deceleration rather than a precipitous decline.

Key economic indicators paint a picture of an economy transitioning from extraordinary highs to more sustainable levels. Although GDP growth is slowing, it's important to contextualize this deceleration as an adjustment from historically high, unsustainable levels towards long-term averages, a process that aligns with the Federal Reserve's objectives.

Job creation continues, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the record-breaking post-COVID years, with the current unemployment rate of 4.2% remaining historically low. Consumer spending persists at historically elevated levels, significantly above long-term averages, suggesting underlying economic resilience.

The effectiveness of previous rate hikes is evident in the moderation of inflation, with the Consumer Price Index approaching the Federal Reserve's target range of mid to low 2.5%. These factors collectively suggest that the U.S. economy, while decelerating, maintains considerable strength, characterized by a controlled slowdown rather than an imminent recession, distinguishing it from many previous rate-cutting cycles.

The Road Ahead

Regardless of the initial rate cut size, it is widely anticipated that the Federal Reserve will continue to adjust its policy stance in the coming months. Many economists and market analysts expect additional rate cuts to follow, with projections generally ranging from 100 to 200 bps in total reductions by the end of 2024.

The Federal Reserve's ability to navigate this complex economic landscape will hinge on its commitment to data dependence, clear communication, and a nuanced understanding of the intricate interplay between monetary policy, economic growth, and financial stability.

As the world watches, the FOMC's decision next week will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of the global economy and financial markets, serving as a pivotal moment in the ongoing quest for sustainable growth and economic resilience.

As the Federal Reserve weighs each approach's potential benefits and risks, it must strike a delicate balance between addressing pressing economic concerns and preserving policy flexibility. Ultimately, the success of the Federal Reserve's actions will be measured not only by their immediate impact but also by their ability to foster long-term economic resilience and sustainable growth."
Market Internals Signal Upside Breakout,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2024/09/17/market-internals-signal-upside-breakout/,2024-09-17T14:29:25Z,"The focus last week was on the latest data on inflation from the Consumer Price Index and the markets focused on the fact that the ""increase in overall inflation slowed to 2.5% from 2.9% and hit the lowest levels since 2021.""

The price action in the S&P 500 reflected an important change in the market outlook as it declined for the first 90 minutes to a low of $539.96. That was a 1.6% decline from Tuesday's close. The S&P rallied from the lows to close at $554.36, a gain of.2.6% for the day. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was also down sharply early in the day and then closed with a 2.2% gain for the day.

For the week the gains were even more impressive as the Spyder Trust (SPY) was up 4% and the QQQ rose 6%. For the week on the NYSE Composite, there were four times more advancing than declining stocks.

The weekly chart of the Spyder Trust (SPY) shows that it tested the rising 20-week EMA at $541.91 last week before closing strong. I have often found that this weekly EMA to often be a reliable level of support when it is rising strongly as it was at the April correction lows (see arrow). In August SPY dropped well below the EMA but then closed the week back above the EMA.

The positive price action is confirmed by the market internals as the weekly S&P 500 Advance/Decline Line made a new high last week. It is leading prices and does project a new high for the SPY with the weekly starc+ band at $584.80. The A/D line rose above key resistance, line a, in December 2023 which was a major bullish development

The NYSE All A/D line that tracks all instruments on the NYSE Composite also made a new high last week as it rose sharply. This A/D line moved through resistance, line b, early in 2024 and has stayed above the strongly rising EMA all year. The NYSE Stocks Only A./D Line is rising strongly but has not yet made a new high.

The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) has been out of favor since it peaked in July at $503.52 as it then dropped below its weekly starc- band in early August (see arrow) with a low of $423.51. The strong close last week at $475.34 was not enough to convince many that QQQ still had upside potential. On a move above the August high at $485.54 the weekly starc+ band is at $509.60 with chart resistance, line a, at $522.81. There is support at the two-week low of $448.19.

The weekly Nasdaq 100 A/D line reveals a much more positive outlook than the chart as it moved above resistance, line b, just one week after the August low (point 1). The A/D line made a new high last week that projects a new high in the QQQ. This was the case for the S&P 500 in June 2023. For the weekly A/D line analysis to turn negative it would have to drop below its WMA and the August lows.

The weekly relative performance (RS) rose last week after reaching support at line c. It now needs to move above its WMA to signal that QQQ is again leading the S&P 500. Even though the major averages were higher on Friday there was a slight loss of upside momentum and this turned my focus on Monday's trading.

In Monday's trading, the Dow Industrials were up 228 points to close at a new high while the S&P futures were just barely higher but the Nasdaq Composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 were down almost 0.50%. More importantly on the NYSE, there were 1987 advancing stocks with just 814 declining stocks. The Nasdaq A/D numbers were also positive.

There is daily chart support for the QQQ at $467.55 with the monthly pivot at $461.75. Once above last Friday's high at $476.53, then the August high at $485.54 is the next barrier on the upside. The monthly R1 resistance is at $500.06 with the R2 at $523.84.

The QQQ decline in early September increased the negative sentiment but the Nasdaq 100 A/D line just retested the breakout level at line c, before reversing to the upside. The A/D line moved to a new high last Thursday and was a bit higher on Monday.

This is a bullish setup leading into the FOMC meeting and the expected rate cut announcement on Wednesday. While the A/D line could drop back to its rising EMA but only a drop below the early September lows would turn the analysis negative.

I also often look at fundamental data from a technical perspective. Over the past year the negative public view of the US economy to many has been in contrast to the strong economic data that many of us have observed.

The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment reports their readings from their surveys twice each month. It peaked at 75.40 in early 2024 and then dropped to a low of 66.40 in July. This was during a period when inflation seemed to be declining, employment was strong as were corporate earnings, and GDP forecasts.

Consumer Sentiment had been in an uptrend since the 2022 low of 50 as the downtrend, line a, was broken in late 2023. In last week's mid-month reading, the sentiment rose to 69, after testing the uptrend, line b. I expect these numbers to improve further as both mortgage rates and crude oil prices continue to move lower. This is likely to translate into increased consumer spending.

Another strong market rally may again be led by the growth stocks which were also out of favor in early 2023 and 2024 but turned out to be the leaders. Many reasons including the uninverted yield curve recessionary fears, too expensive stocks, and negative earning forecasts are likely to be used as arguments against investing in stocks.

Those sectors that look to best to me are the Communication Services Sector (XLC) which is already close to an upside breakout. I also like Heath Care Select Services (XLV) and Financial Select Sector (XLF). Stay tuned for regular updates as I just finished a long-overdue overseas vacation."
Consumer Demands Outpacing Digital Offerings In Banking,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2024/09/17/consumer-demands-outpacing-digital-offerings-in-banking/,2024-09-17T14:08:41Z,"Heading into the final months of 2024, U.S. consumer sentiment about their personal finances and the general economy is mixed at best. While there are signs of slight optimism, consumers' expectations are tempered by uncertainties around inflation, political developments, and economic stability.

During times of economic uncertainty, consumers are increasingly focused on how best to manage finances. This creates a valuable opportunity for financial institutions to step in as trusted advisors. As consumers seek to interact with their banks in a variety of ways, it's essential for these institutions to be prepared to answer the call at a moment's notice.

""U.S. banks have collectively spent hundreds of billions of dollars on technology, with a significant portion of that deployed to improve the self-service and digital experiences for their customers,"" said Emily Steele, president, and COO of banking operations software provider Savana . ""The downside is this has created more silos, rather than unifying operations between self-service and assisted banking channels, and that can hamper a banker's ability to truly assist customers when it matters the most, especially at times of economic uncertainty.""

According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, 22.5 percent of respondents feel ""somewhat insecure/financially vulnerable."" Gen-Z particularly feels this way at 27.2 percent. While 16.8 percent of overall respondents described themselves as feeling ""very insecure/financially vulnerable,"" that figure rose to 21.4 percent among Gen-X consumers. Boomers appear to have the most confidence in their finances as 14 percent of them are said to be ""very secure/financially stable,"" while 12.3 percent believe they are ""very insecure/financially vulnerable.""

Consumers have shown that, regardless of their overall financial confidence, they will seek to communicate with their financial institutions in both good and bad times. Despite the efforts banks have made with AI chat programs like Bank of America's Erica chatbot over recent years, consumers overwhelmingly prefer to speak with an actual human being.

According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, 86.4 percent of respondents prefer to speak with a live person at a bank as opposed to 13.6 percent that preferred an AI chat program. This preference is high across all demographics, especially Boomers at 93.7 percent. Even Gen-Z, which is usually at the forefront of adopting the newest technologies, would prefer to speak with a human as 81.7 percent of respondents in that demographic chose this method. Among those respondents that did prefer to communicate with a bank via an AI chat program, Millennials led the way at 19.6 percent, followed by Gen-Z at 18.3 percent. Only 6.3 percent of Boomers said they would prefer to communicate with a bank via an AI chat program.

Since consumers overwhelmingly prefer to communicate with a live person when dealing with a bank, it's crucial for these institutions to ensure their backend systems are seamlessly connected. According to a 2023 report by PwC, 82% of U.S. consumers want more human interaction as technology improves. Whether it's ATMs, call centers, or digital banking experiences, most banks have invested the necessary funds to keep pace with evolving consumer expectations, which in recent years has come via the likes of Amazon and Uber. However, this spending has introduced a new problem into banks: a variety of disparate systems has made it difficult for the bank employee to be efficient at their jobs.

If consumers overwhelmingly prefer to speak to a live person, this can prove to be daunting task for banks. Something as simple as a change-of-address inquiry can become complex when there are multiple systems of record at a financial institution. ""When we envision what that looks like for a call-center employee, they're usually 'swivel chairing and alt-tabbing' between applications to handle this one customer service task,"" Steele said. ""Not only is this time-consuming for the employee, but the chance for human error is also high. This causes a lost opportunity to engage in financial consultative conversation because the bank employee does not feel equipped with just the right information while they have the customer on the phone. ""

This issue of disparate systems wreaking havoc with the consumer experience also extends to the physical branch, where consumers still do like to do business. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, 20.6 percent of respondents still prefer to do business at a physical location. Not surprisingly, Boomers lead the way with this method at 24.6 percent, followed by Gen-X at 20.2 percent and Gen-Z at 17.3 percent. Overall, bank customers overwhelmingly prefer to interact with financial institutions remotely. Some 39.1 percent of respondents prefer to do business via a mobile app. That jumps to 51.5 percent with Gen-Z consumers, and 50.9 percent with Millennials.

But even for consumers that prefer remote contact with a bank, physical branch operations should not be understated.

The largest banks for years have promised their customers the ability to start more complicated transactions online, and then seamlessly finish them in the branch if needed. But what's happening at most institutions is an inconsistent experience when customers interact with their bank in-branch versus through a mobile/online device.

""If a customer begins a credit card or mortgage application online and hits a snag, they should be able to pick it up right where they left off when they visit a branch for assistance,"" Steele said. ""This approach strengthens the overall digital experience banks today are seeking to perfect, particularly when consumers prefer digital interaction.""

The challenge for banks lies in balancing technological advancements with the enduring demand for personalized, human touchpoints, Steele added. The current siloed nature of many banking systems can complicate even simple transactions, leading to inefficiencies and increased potential for errors. ""Addressing these issues is essential not only for improving the customer experience but also for maintaining trust and satisfaction in a competitive financial landscape,"" she said.

Moreover, while digital and remote banking options are favored by many, the importance of consistent, high-quality service across both digital and physical branches cannot be overstated, Steele added.

As consumers navigate their financial futures, banks must ensure that their services are both accessible and reliable, whether customers choose to engage online, through mobile apps, or in person at a branch. This approach will be key to sustaining consumer confidence and loyalty in the months ahead as economic uncertainty continues to be top-of-mind."
Campaign To Weaken EU CO2 Rules For EVs Spurs Opposition,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2024/09/17/campaign-to-weaken-eu-co2-rules-for-evs-spurs-opposition/,2024-09-17T14:08:30Z,"It was no surprise when high-profile green lobby group Transport & Environment attacked the growing clamor from auto manufacturers to water down the European Union's aggressive policy to force its citizens into electric vehicles.

But support from Stellantis came out of the blue.

Various significant automakers, including Volkswagen and Renault, and the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), had warned of the catastrophic impact of the rules, which next year demand a big cut in carbon dioxide emissions which could cost companies failing to meet them up to a total of €15 billion ($16.6 billion) in fines.

But Stellantis, the multi-brand giant including Citroen, Fiat, Peugeot, Opel, Vauxhall, Alfa Romeo, Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, and Maserati, declared it was happy to keep the rules, according to Automotive News Europe. CEO Carlos Tavares has been a high-profile critic of the EU's push to end the sale of new internal combustion vehicles by 2035. He declared that it made no sense for politicians to decide technology winners. That should be down to engineers.

Stellantis withdrew from ACEA in 2022.

Tavares, in an interview with Agence-France Presse, said because the industry had known about the rules for a long time, there was no excuse for saying it was unprepared. His words echoed those of T&E.

""This is cynical and absurd. Carmakers made over €130 billion in profits in the last two years and had years to prepare for the target. Now they want the EU to declare a state of emergency so they can continue selling dirty cars and making large profits. This is not a war or a pandemic, but a self-serving stunt,"" said T&E''s Julia Poliscanova in a statement.

Pressure has been building to persuade the EU to mitigate its rules.

Renault CEO and ACEA president Luca de Meo said the auto industry could face fines of €15 billion if EV sales remain at current levels. Volkswagen chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch wanted the EU to give the auto industry more time to meet the CO2 targets.

According to ACEA, sales of EVs in the EU in July fell 10.8% to 103,000, with market share slipping to 12.1% from 13.5% a year before. From January to July, 815,000 new EVs were sold for a 12.5% market share. Italy wanted the CO2 emissions review scheduled for 2026 brought forward to next year, when a big hurdle needs to be met. ACEA reportedly wants a 2-year delay in 2025's tightened CO2 target.

Meanwhile, the EU's rules imply sales of EVs in Western Europe must at least more than quadruple by 2030 from 2024's around 2 million to reach the interim close to 80% target. Sales have stalled and aren't expected to accelerate for perhaps two years. Currently, the 2030 target looks impossible. The target would require current niche sales to suddenly balloon into a mass market, boosted by cheap EVs which don't exist yet, and which don't seem imminent.

Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of Germany's Center for Automotive Research, said European demand for EVs has been harmed by German policy.

Germany unexpectedly removed consumer subsidies, undermining the market, only to suddenly decide to reinstate them.

Dudenhoeffer doesn't want to dilute the rules but make them a little more user-friendly.

""Yes, it is true that the rules have been known for a long time. But Germany, as the most important market, has destroyed the EV through its politics. The industry is feeling this and people have relied on German politics. So Berlin is largely to blame for the fact that we are now in this difficult situation,"" Dudenhoeffer said in an email exchange

""My suggestion. Leave the regulations and fines, but set a payment deadline of 10 years, also with the reason that bonuses will be distributed in the following years. So anyone who stays under regulation over the next 10 years will get a credit or have it ""offset"" against their penalty payment.""

""We want a regulation that encourages people to go into EVs and not a regulation that destroys our industry,"" Dudenhoeffer said.

Benjamin Kibies, Senior Automotive Analyst at Germany's Dataforce, said if the EU changes its rules now, it wouldn't be fair on many companies who have already made sure they comply.

But EV market conditions have changed. Finance has become more expensive, and Chinese competition looks formidable.

""On the other hand, circumstances did change over the last 5 years. Under the impression of high inflation and interest rates, fewer buyers can afford the extra costs. And the technological advantage of Chinese (manufacturers) is becoming even larger. When strict targets force European (manufacturers) to form emission pools with foreign ones, the European car industry will sponsor the market entry of their competitors,"" Kibies said in an email exchange.

Kibies said stretching out the compliance demanded for 2025 over some years would make sense.

T&E said EU lawmakers must reject the demands of automakers to invoke a crisis clause to delay the 2025 car CO2 targets by two years.

""Manufacturers can comply by increasing sales of battery electric and hybrid vehicles next year. EV sales will be boosted by seven new models priced below €25,000 arriving still this year and in 2025,"" T&E said.

That's easy to say. But EV demand has plateaued in Europe as all the early adopters have adopted, and the corporate market looks sated. The next step depends on the emergence of a mass market where sales depend on individual buyers parting with their own money. That is much more demanding and requires huge price cuts, an end to range anxiety with improved (solid state) technology, and the emergence of a consumer-friendly charging network.

The charging network must be as quick and convenient as the ICE system. That basic requirement doesn't even look close."
New Trump website reveals how much money a Harris presidency could cost taxpayers,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-trump-website-reveals-how-much-money-harris-presidency-could-cost-taxpayers,2024-09-17T13:38:03Z,"FIRST ON FOX: The Trump campaign unveiled a website Tuesday that tabulates how much voters in each state can expect to pay in taxes if the Trump tax cuts expire next year.

""Kamala Harris voted against the Trump Tax Cuts and will let them expire if she's elected,"" the website, dubbed KamalaTaxIncrease.com, says.

""Democrats in Washington don't care about you - they will work together with Kamala Harris to make sure you pay more taxes and have less money in your pocket. According to the Tax Foundation, if the Trump Tax Cuts expire, most taxpayers will see a notable tax increase,"" it adds.

Using data from the Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Tax Foundation, the Trump campaign's new website displays a map of the U.S. with a breakdown on what residents in each state could expect to spend in additional taxes.

CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE CALL TO EXTEND TRUMP TAX CUTS, AVOID 'LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN AMERICAN HISTORY'

TRUMP TO LAUNCH CRYPTO PLATFORM: WHAT TO KNOW

""When Kamala is in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin this week - will she tell voters that on average they will pay more than $2,000 in extra taxes each year if she is elected and lets the Trump Tax Cuts expire? The choice is simple - more money in your pockets with President Trump or higher taxes with Kamala Harris,"" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, told Fox News Digital.

The national average tax hike falls at $2,580.57, while residents in blue states such as California and Washington can expect an average increase of $3,360 and $4,375, according to the website.

TRUMP PROMISES TO HALT TAXES ON SOCIAL SECURITY; CITES 'INFLATION NIGHTMARE' FOR SENIORS

Florida residents face an average tax hike of $3,505 per year, while Nevadans can expect a $3,523 spike, and Wyoming residents $4,254, according to the data.

The Tax Foundation additionally has a calculator on its website that can tabulate expected increases based on an individual's personal background, such as income and marital status, to view more in-depth data.

Trump and Republican lawmakers passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which drastically overhauled the nation's tax code, including reducing the top individual income tax bracket to 37% from 39.6% and nearly doubling the size of the standard deduction.

The law, however, is set to sunset in 2025, with Vice President Harris vowing to reverse the Trump-era cuts. She is proposing to raise the rate that major businesses pay from 21% to 28%, and also seeks to increase the federal government's small business tax deduction tenfold, from $5,000 to $50,000.

TRUMP'S ECONOMIC SCORECARD: WHERE HE STANDS ON TAXES, TARIFFS AND MORE

Trump has pledged to make the entirety of his 2017 tax law permanent if he is re-elected in November.

""He wants to let our tax cuts expire,"" Trump said in May at a rally in New Jersey. ""Instead of a Biden tax hike, I'll give you a Trump middle-class, upper-class, lower-class, business-class - big tax cut. You're going to have the biggest tax cut.""

Last week, the Chamber of Commerce and 500 businesses spread across the nation published an open letter to Washington lawmakers and the next presidential administration, calling on them to keep the Trump tax cuts in place or risk the U.S. facing ""the largest tax increase in American history.""

TRUMP, HARRIS TOUT TAX PLANS AHEAD OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

""While the impact of a massive tax increase on individual Americans is clear, it is critical for policymakers to understand that the expiration of many pro-growth business tax reforms from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) also will dramatically increase costs for families and customers, harm main street businesses, reduce take-home pay for workers, and result in the loss of innovation and American jobs,"" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement of the letter.

""Pro-growth tax policy doesn't just grow the overall U.S. economy; it raises wages for American workers and improves standards of living,"" the statement continued. ""Maintaining and improving pro-growth tax policy ensures that the U.S. remains globally competitive, retaining and attracting businesses, jobs, investment, and innovation here at home.""

SAP BrandVoice: Forging Ahead: How Cloud ERP Drives Growth For Mill Products Manufacturers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/09/17/forging-ahead-how-cloud-erp-drives-growth-for-mill-products-manufacturers/,2024-09-17T11:10:53Z,"By Jennifer Scholze, Team Lead - Energy and Natural Resources Marketing, SAP

From metals and building materials to paper products and packaging goods, there's no question that every sector of the mill products industry is growing. But the significance of that growth rate remains uncertain for midsize competitors without the right technology.

""Boosting competitiveness and growth comes with its share of risks,"" a recent Oxford Economics report reveals. ""Respondents ranked macroeconomic issues like inflation, unemployment, and the rising cost of materials as the top threat (39%). Also on the list of threats is the inability to find the right talent (33%) or retain the right talent (31%) - indicating that staffing issues are tough.""

So, how can midsize mill companies grow without risking their stability and profitability? Overcoming these obstacles lies in leveraging cloud-based solutions and artificial intelligence (AI).

A significant challenge for midsize mill products manufacturers is visibility into production processes. For many, their production floor is a ""black box"" - materials go in and finished products come out, but the journey in between is unclear.

This lack of visibility impacts the ability to meet customer demands in ways that address top business objectives, including:

For example, they often can't answer critical questions, such as ""Can we fulfill and deliver promised products efficiently and on time?"" and ""Which products and customers are profitable?""

Oxford Economics also reports that half of respondents struggle to ""scale systems to match organic business growth or lack visibility into supply chain and manufacturing capacity."" But more troublesome is the 40% that are ""unable to support new businesses, enter new geographies, or deploy new business models.""

As these findings clearly show, an outdated IT infrastructure stifles growth. Many companies are stuck using systems that are 15 to 20 years old, often relying on spreadsheets or legacy software that is difficult to upgrade.

For a deeper look into the value of cloud ERP for midsize mill companies, read the SAP-sponsored Oxford Economics report, ""Blueprint for Success: How Mill Products Manufacturers Can Lean into Technology to Outpace Competitors

These systems are time-consuming to maintain, highly risky from a security standpoint, and leave little room for innovation. Additionally, the manual nature of these processes leads to inefficiencies in departments like shipping and finance, where hours are spent preparing shipments or generating reports.

According to Oxford Economics, the best solution to this common challenge is ""having a single source of truth - a reality made possible with well-integrated data and driven by cloud ERP.""

With cloud ERP and one source of the truth across the company, companies can quickly adjust and pivot their strategies, operations, and processes based on new information or shifting priorities. With the addition of embedded AI and automation capabilities, they can quickly respond to customer demands and make informed decisions about production capabilities.

For example, a cloud-based ERP system can streamline the process of receiving and shipping orders to multiple locations, as well as automate batch goods shipping. Additionally, label generation and printing can be automated, saving time and reducing errors in the shipping process. These process improvements not only increase operational efficiency but also enhance the ability to scale - all without the need for manual intervention.

Beyond visibility and automation, midsize mill products manufacturers can drive revenue and margins with the integration of AI and industry best practices into cloud ERP. With Business AI, companies enhance various aspects of the customer experience, including:

In addition to improving operational efficiency and customer interactions, cloud ERP helps mitigate risk. By moving away from on-premise solutions, mill products manufacturers no longer need to worry about the costs and complexities of software upgrades and security vulnerabilities. Instead, cloud providers manage system updates and ensure data security, allowing companies to trust that their core systems will remain operational even during updates.

Adopting cloud-based ERP with embedded AI is the catalyst midsize mill products manufacturers have been demanding to fuel a meaningful growth trajectory. By overcoming the limitations of their legacy IT infrastructure, businesses can innovate, scale efficiently, and remain resilient in the face of industry challenges - achieving continuous growth without the disruptive risks of traditional approaches."
So many music festivals have been canceled this year. What's going on?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2024/09/17/g-s1-23026/music-festival-cancel-inflation-price-streaming,2024-09-17T10:38:59Z,"It may not be too much of an exaggeration to say that 2024 was the year the music festival died. A wave of festivals has been unplugging their microphones and telling pass holders, ""Sorry!""

Desert Daze, a psychedelic rock fest in Southern California; Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, a reggae fest in Northern California; Kickoff Jam, a country music festival in Florida; Blue Ridge Rock Festival in Virginia; Sudden Little Thrills, a multi-genre festival in Pittsburgh; Float Fest in Austin; the list of recent cancellations goes on and on.

And it's not just America. In Europe, festival after festival -- from Lollapalooza Paris to the Sideways Festival in Helsinki -- has announced cancellations for this year or forever. By one count, there were over 60 music festivals canceled in the UK this year alone. In Australia, so many festivals were canceled that one magazine there recently asked, ""Are the nation's music festivals extinct?""

Meanwhile, even some big name festivals that used to sell out in minutes struggled to sell tickets this year. Burning Man failed to sell out for the first time in over a decade. Coachella, which is the most-attended annual music festival in North America, saw a decline of around 15 percent in ticket sales this year compared to last.

Call it the festival recession. What's driving it? There are the predictable culprits: surging production costs, high ticket prices, and consumer demand dropping harder than an EDM beat. But the festival slump may also be driven by factors that are more thought-provoking: technological changes in music listenership and a generation of kids who may lack the same enthusiasm for festivals as generations past.

The Year The Music Fest Died

In the decade before the pandemic, music festivals saw something of a renaissance. ""New music festivals are popping up more quickly than you can count in the U.S.,"" wrote The Associated Press back in 2013. Events like Coachella were doing so well that they were adding more days to their lineups. This fest of fests during the 2010s was so incredible that some questioned whether there was a festival bubble.

The pandemic obviously hit festivals hard, ending the boom. But, when the crisis subsided, consumers were flush with cash and pent-up demand for social activities seemed to help many festivals make a roaring comeback.

While there were the rumblings of trouble last year, it was really this year when the music stopped for many festivals.

Before we get to the more interesting explanations for the festival slump, we have to name the most obvious culprit: rising costs in this era of inflation. Portapotties, security, equipment, energy, food, concessions, merch, insurance, artist pay -- expenses for producing these festivals have climbed faster than a drug-addled singer up the scaffolding of a soundstage.

Will Page is the former chief economist of Spotify and one of the rare economists who focuses on the music industry. He calls himself a ""rockonomist."" Page recently published an analysis of the music festival downturn in the UK.

Putting on a festival, Page says, involves investing an incredible amount upfront with only the hope that ticket sales and other revenue sources will allow investors to recoup costs. It's a big reason why music festivals are a notoriously risky business with low profit margins. In fact, many independent festivals are run by nonprofits that don't make a profit at all. It's easy to see why rising costs could cause more mayhem than a mosh pit.

During the boom years, many festivals jacked up their ticket prices. Since 2014, general admission prices for major music festivals have increased by 55%, according to an analysis conducted by FinanceBuzz. That far outpaced the overall rate of inflation during the same time period.

Page says that more recently, however, many festival promoters -- perhaps recognizing softening demand -- have been reluctant to raise prices enough to cover exploding costs. ""I would imagine that promoters are a little bit risk averse not to push price too far [because] we're coming outta the pandemic,"" Page says. ""They're like, 'Let's get them back into fields, jumping up and down to Mr. Brightside by The Killers.' But that hesitancy on price is then offset by this explosion in production costs, and that's where they've been caught in the crossfire."" Many festivals are clearly having trouble making the numbers work and are being forced to cancel.

Due to cost of living increases and higher interest rates, many of the usual festival goers are tightening their belts and refusing to fork over as much money for expensive festival tickets and all the accompanying costs of attending them. We're also seeing similar downturns in other leisure and hospitality sectors, including theme parks, air travel, hotel chains, and Airbnb.

This decline in spending on experiences has obviously created a problem for many festivals, but in this particular market there's an interesting wrinkle. The boom years may have led to festival oversaturation, with too many festivals competing for consumer dollars.

This has all, Page says, created a situation that he calls ""a race to the top."" Consumers are reducing the number of live music events they go to and choosing to only go to their top priorities, the crème de la crème. So they may go to something like Coachella or a Taylor Swift or Beyoncé concert, but they're choosing not to go to less sexy live events. In addition to many festivals facing financial problems, musicians like The Black Keys and Jennifer Lopez have struggled to sell concert tickets and canceled their tours.

Live music looks like it has become more of a winner-take-all market. The big dogs in the industry seem to be doing fine. Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster and is the largest live entertainment company in the world, says they're still seeing strong demand at their live music events. But they acknowledge that many festivals are experiencing financial troubles.

""The live entertainment market is highly competitive, and we're currently seeing many artists prioritize touring over festivals, with amphitheaters, arenas, and stadium shows performing at record levels,"" says a spokesperson for Live Nation. ""While some festivals face challenges with rising production, insurance, and talent costs, we've found that festivals -- both large and small -- that offer great locations, talent, and a clear identity are thriving.""

Streaming And The Anxious Generation

Page, the former chief economist of Spotify, hypothesizes that the rise of music streaming and algorithmic playlists may be reducing demand for certain kinds of music festivals, especially diverse, multi-genre ones.

Despite the fact that streaming services offer consumers unlimited access to virtually the entire library of recorded music, algorithms, he argues, are siphoning music listeners more and more into niche ""echo chambers,"" where the new stuff they listen to is similar to the stuff they already listen to.

Historically, radio stations and MTV and music magazines and blogs may have exposed music listeners to a wider, more diverse range of new music. With algorithms playing a more homogenizing force on musical tastes, Page argues, consumers may be less into big music festivals filled with a bunch of artists from different genres they may have never heard of.

""So if I look at a multi-genre festival poster and I see all these different bands of all these different styles, my gut reaction is, 'That's a playlist that's been created for somebody else,'"" Page says.

That said, many single-genre festivals seem to be struggling too.

The most compelling argument Page makes: a generational change may be affecting demand for music festivals. Teenagers and early twentysomethings have historically been the core age demographics for festival-going. But this stream of new ticket buyers may be more of a trickle than it was in the past.

During the festival boom between roughly 2010 and 2020, one leading explanation was that millennials, then mostly in their teens and twenties, preferred spending on experiences rather than on things. They liked going places. They liked socializing. They liked drinking booze and doing drugs. They liked hooking up.

Not to get all ""kids these days,"" but kids these days... Research finds that Gen Z drinks less alcohol. They do fewer drugs. They have less sex and fewer partners. And they're lonelier. In his best-selling book, the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has famously labeled them ""the anxious generation."" Haidt argues that Gen Z is spending too much time on social media and playing with their phones -- and it's making them less social and more isolated and depressed.

In a similar vein, Page argues social media and also the legacy of pandemic lockdowns and school closures a few years ago have made young people more socially atomized. And so, Gen Z, he suggests, may be less amped about going to music festivals -- an intensely social activity -- than previous generations.

Festivals Are For IRL Friends

Investigating why so many festivals are struggling, Page and his colleagues recently conducted a survey in the UK. They asked young people why they were not going to festivals. ""And one of the most popular responses we got from that audience was, 'I didn't think I had a friend I could go with,'"" Page says. Sad!

In Australia, where we have some data, the number of young adults attending festivals fell ""from 41% of all ticket buyers in 2018-19, to 27% in 2022-23,"" according to a report from the Australian Associated Press. Australians in their mid-to-late twenties are now the largest demographic of ticket buyers, not younger adolescents.

Meanwhile, many millennials, who drove the festival boom last decade, are now older and have young kids and family and career obligations. They are less likely to want to attend multi-day festivals, which often involve standing in the hot sun, immersing yourself in swarms of people partying hard, and sleeping in the dirt.

Interestingly, some of the storied, big-name festivals that arguably cater more to older generations seem to be doing fine. For example, the Newport Jazz Festival, which celebrated its 70th anniversary this year, easily sold out all three days.

Despite the slump, the reality is there will always be a market for rocking out at music festivals. The crucial question for promoters these days: how big will that market actually be? Many festivals are now having to, um, face the music and realize it's maybe not as big as it used to be."
"Joe Scarborough: Donald Trump needed a campaign reset. Instead, he made things even worse.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/donald-trump-kamala-harris-election-day-disrupter-rcna171325,2024-09-17T10:33:53Z,"Donald Trump has always been a disrupter. He's always put people off balance and put them on guard. However, when Joe Biden stepped out of the presidential race and Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in, for the first time in his adult life, this 78-year-old man had to face the fact that the disruption is now coming from the other side: the disruptors are the Democrats.

Trump never imagined he wouldn't be running against an aging Biden. He never imagined that he would be facing a woman almost 20 years younger than him -- a woman who was able to run circles around him on the debate stage.

There is not a serious person out there who would ever suggest that last week's debate was anything less than a disaster for Trump. You would have to be a deeply unserious person to suggest otherwise. People in his own campaign know he was beaten badly in that debate. People on Fox News have said it. People in The Wall Street Journal editorial page have said it -- over and over again. Trump himself knows it.

The debate was supposed to be a reset for the Trump campaign. He should have followed the advice of his staff and focused on the economy or inflation. Instead, he wandered off into the fields. Far from being the reset the campaign needed, the debate ended up making a bad situation even worse. That's why we're seeing Trump spin even more out of control by the day. He's spent the last week tripling down on lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

So now the question is, what is the next opportunity for a reset? We're fewer than 50 days out from Election Day and people are already starting to vote. Time is quickly running short for the Trump campaign."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 17, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-17-24/,2024-09-17T10:20:17Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are mixed compared to one week ago. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying paltry interest rates. That has changed, thanks to the Fed's campaign of interest rate hikes to combat inflation last year. But even though the Fed hasn't raised its rate since July 2023, consumer deposit yields remain high.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts generally pay much higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the trade-off is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.26% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's above last week's 0.26%.

To find the best savings account for your needs, you first must answer the question: What exactly are you looking for? And you must realize that different types of accounts have trade-offs.

If you want to open an account at a traditional bank with branches, that will likely rule out the best interest rates, which are typically available at online-only banks. Many traditional savings accounts at brick-and-mortar banks earn just 0.01% or 0.02% APY, while some online-only savings accounts earn more than 4.00% APY.

Don't settle on any option until you're certain you have a good grasp on the fees you'll be charged. Savings accounts can ding you with monthly service fees, excess withdrawal fees and returned item fees (if you deposit checks that bounce), among others. Those charges add up and can gnaw away at your savings.

As you shop around, check reviews and ratings of financial institutions and make sure you choose one that will protect your money with federal insurance -- from the FDIC or, in the case of credit unions, the NCUA.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Will Barrick Gold Stock Shine Like The Metal?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/17/will-barrick-gold-stock-shine-like-the-metal/,2024-09-17T10:01:53Z,"Barrick Gold stock (NYSE: GOLD) has gained about 14% year-to-date, currently trading at about $21 per share. This compares to the S&P 500 which remains up by about 18% over the same period. The underperformance comes even though gold prices have been surging this year, rising from levels of around $2,050 per ounce in early January to about $2,570 currently. Several factors have driven gold prices. U.S. inflation has been moderating, with the Consumer Price Index for August rising by just 2.5%, a three-year low, and this could pave the way for a rate cut by the Fed in the near term. The U.S. dollar has also weakened a bit of late and this has helped gold. Geopolitical uncertainties including the Israel-Gaza war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have also helped the yellow metal. So why hasn't Barrick - one of the largest gold producers in the world - had its stock track gold prices?

Barrick has faced significant operational challenges recently. For example, the company encountered production setbacks in the first half of the year, driven by a slower-than-expected ramp-up at the Pueblo Viejo mine, maintenance activities, and lower ore grades from some mines. Planned production was also reduced at Cortez and Phoenix. In Q2 2024, Barrick sold 948,000 ounces of gold, a 6% decline from 1,009,000 ounces in the same quarter last year. Investors view production expansion as critical, especially at times when gold prices and margins are trending higher, but Barrick hasn't really delivered during this upcycle, and this may be weighing on its stock.

The cost situation has been mixed as well. Barrick's all-in sustaining costs rose 11% year-over-year, reaching $1,498 per ounce in Q2. This increase is likely due to lower production, which impacts economies of scale, along with inflationary pressures on inputs like labor. Additionally, higher gold prices could be leading miners to become less disciplined about controlling costs. The faster rise in costs for Barrick may be driving investors toward more cost-efficient mining companies.

Overall, the performance of GOLD stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were -13% in 2021, -6% in 2022, and 8% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could GOLD face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Barrick's production is likely to pick up a bit going forward driven by the completion of major processing plant maintenance at Nevada Gold Mines, the upgrade of Goldstrike ore processing infrastructure, better performance from Turquoise Ridge, and a steady ramp-up at Pueblo Viejo. The company also remains bullish on the trajectory of precious metal prices as well, citing relatively tight supply and a move by central banks to diversify their reserves by holding gold in place of the U.S. Dollar. Separately, Barrick's move to scale up its copper business could drive an incremental upside for the stock, given its application in a host of futuristic industries including electric vehicles and the renewable energy sector. We have a $21 price estimate for Barrick Gold, which is roughly in line with the current market price. See our analysis of Barrick Gold valuation for more details. Also, see our analysis of Barrick Gold Revenues for more details on the company's key revenue streams and how they have been trending."

Fox Digital spoke to residents in Houston, Texas, Knoxville, TN., and Washington, D.C., about how they feel about current grocery prices as a result of inflation and if they feel better off now under the Biden-Harris administration or during the Trump administration.

Kenneth in Houston did not hold back when comparing the nation under Trump versus Biden-Harris; ""the country was just way better when Trump was in office.""

""The prices are at an all-time high right now, which is unacceptable,"" Kenneth said, adding that problem would go away if Trump returned to the White House.

Becky in Knoxville doesn't believe the rise in costs is because of the Biden administration.

""I think things were very grim four years ago, we were in a pandemic,"" she said when comparing America now versus four years ago.

When comparing how Trump versus Kamala Harris could handle prices, Becky added, ""I frankly don't know if either person could help bring the costs down.""

""Costs are high, particularly in the grocery stores. So I don't know, I really, I trust Kamala Harris to do her best to make an effort to bring the prices down,"" she said.

""I don't think the price of groceries is acceptable. It's a little bit outrageous,"" Mina said in Houston.

""I think prices are way too high,"" Elbert said in Washington, D.C.

""Underneath the Trump administration, everything was much lower,"" Edwin said in Knoxville.

However, despite noticing a difference in prices between the two administrations, Edwin is torn between Harris and Trump.

""Whether he can enact his policies (Trump), it's a hit or miss. So I'm kind of like torn between them both. You know, they both have good points,"" he said.

Tamara in D.C. said she doesn't believe she is better off now versus four years ago: ""I don't believe that the country overall is better off."" She trusts Trump more to tackle economic concerns such as high prices.

TECH CEO WHO WENT VIRAL FOR PRO-TRUMP EMAIL DEFENDS CALL TO ACTION OVER 'POLITICAL HATE'

Enoch in Houston said, ""The price of groceries as of right now is not acceptable, it is a bit high, but when Trump was in office I don't think it was as high. So I would say I trust Trump more.""

Kriston, a mom of three in Knoxville, said, ""I do not think it's acceptable... I think it's gone pretty crazy, and it's gone up tremendously.""

Overall, food prices have risen about 22.8% in the last four years, based on a FOX Business analysis. That figure is roughly in line with the rise in meat prices in that time span, which are up nearly 22.6% since 2020.

Shelter prices have increased nearly 23.4% since August 2020, with rents for primary residences up by a similar amount.

New vehicles are up 19.5%, while prices for used cars and trucks have risen over 17.9% since August 2020. Auto insurance prices have surged by nearly 52.4% since that time.

Other costs that have risen in the past four years also include energy, health care, education, and plane tickets.

During the ABC Presidential Debate, Harris said on the economy, ""We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children, and I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000 -- which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time -- so that those young families can afford to buy a crib, a car, buy clothes for their children.""

CNN ANCHOR WONDERS HOW HARRIS CAN INCREASE SUPPORT WITH TRUMP 'KILLING' HER ON THE ECONOMY

Trump slammed inflation under the Biden administration during the debate, and he said he had handed over an economy already recovering from the pandemic when Biden and Harris took office.

""We've had a terrible economy because of inflation, which is really known as a country buster, it breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before, probably the worst in our nation's history,"" he said. ""We were at 21%, but that's being generous because many things are 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago.""

""We handed them over a country where the economy and the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody's ever seen anything like it,"" he said.

How To Create A Budget For A Middle-Class Family,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/budgeting-tips-middle-class-family/,2024-09-17T09:11:44Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Building a middle-class budget starts with knowing what being ""middle class"" means in your life. Is it a fulfilling job? A flush bank account? Advanced degrees? Owning a home? A well-funded retirement account?

While a typical middle class family can look wildly different for different people, some basic desires define this group.

A Washington Post poll reveals most Americans generally agree on what it means to be middle class -- finances, education and stability. The catch? Only about a third feel secure enough to claim the title.

While nine in 10 of the Washington Post respondents say financial stability -- savings, health insurance and steady income -- is key to being considered middle class, fewer people thought milestones like owning a home or having a job with paid sick leave were must-haves. It turns out that being middle class isn't just about having cash; it's about feeling secure in the future.

Christina Lynn, a behavioral finance researcher and Certified Financial Planner at Mariner Wealth Advisors, says that today's middle class suffers the added pressure of keeping up with the ""mythical middle class"" often displayed on social media. This can lead to financial anxiety and even long-term money missteps.

""In the past 20 years, the definition of 'middle class' has shifted dramatically. Just compare our parents' weddings, homes and cars to today's Pinterest-inspired lifestyles -- everything has scaled up,"" Lynn says. ""While dual incomes and higher education have contributed to this, they haven't quite kept pace with the rising cost of living and lifestyle expectations. In many ways, the middle class is living 'higher on the hog,' but at a price.""

This lifestyle inflation might also be contributing to how much consumers are borrowing. Many homeowners are tapping into home equity and relying on credit cards to cover expenses.

Home equity lines of credit (HELOC) balances grew by $4 billion from the first to the second quarter of 2024, marking nine straight quarters of growth since early 2022. This brings the total to $380 billion, according to the New York Federal Reserve.

Credit card debt also jumped by $27 billion over the same period, hitting $1.14 trillion.

Lynn suggests people can balance short-term pleasures with long-term goals as long as they avoid debt when possible and practice good savings habits.

""Your retirement should come first -- think of it as putting on your own oxygen mask before assisting others. Secure your financial future before addressing other expenses, whether it's funding a child's education or managing mortgage and healthcare costs,"" she says.

Your budget is a blueprint based on your unique situation, including your household income and lifestyle, so it probably won't look like your friends' budgets -- even if you all consider yourselves middle class.

Experts agree that tracking what you're bringing in versus what's going out is key for gaining control of your money.

Whether you prefer using good ol' pen and paper, a spreadsheet or one of the best budgeting apps, try to keep track of everything you spend and earn over a month or two so you have a solid idea of where your money is going.

Many banks have built-in budgeting tools, so take advantage of those. Next, split your spending into fixed (rent, utilities) and variable (groceries, entertainment) categories.

Once you see where your money's going, you can decide if that's really where you want it to go. You might be surprised at how much you spend on streaming services or takeout and choose to put that money toward something more important.

A simple budget can be just as effective as a complex algorithm that takes Einstein to decipher, especially if you're consistent. The 50/30/20 rule is such a method.

The idea is to use 50% of your income for needs, 30% for wants (like dining out or travel) and 20% for savings and debt.

If you're typically paid in cash or prefer seeing the physical money being spent and saved, cash stuffing may be your kind of budgeting system.

It's basically the old-school ""envelope system"" with a trendy name. You set aside cash in envelopes for different expenses -- like groceries, bills, or fun money -- and only spend what's in each one. It's a simple way to manage your budget and avoid overspending. For those who prefer to keep things digital, many online budgeting tools offer this feature.

No matter what budgeting style you go with, make sure you prioritize the basics -- like saving for retirement and building an emergency fund.

Unless you plan on working forever, your future self is depending on you to save money now for retirement.

Start by figuring out how much you'll need in retirement.

Consider your current age, retirement age, household income, savings, and expected investment return rates before and during retirement.

Factor in the percentage of income you'll save, expected income increases, years you'll need retirement income, desired retirement income and expected inflation. Finally, adjust based on individual goals and circumstances.

A big no-no is cashing out retirement savings for short-term needs, Lynn says.

""If funding a child's college education means under-preparing for retirement, that's a short-sighted trade-off,"" she says. ""A troubling trend we're seeing is people cashing out their 401(k) when changing jobs to pay off credit cards or upgrade their lifestyle.""

Here's where budgets diverge. For households without children, you may want to skip ahead. If you have children and want to help pay for their higher education, you can use a tool like a 529 plan.

A 529 plan is like a special piggy bank for college. All 50 states and the District of Columbia offer at least one 529 plan -- and you can open a plan in any state, no matter where you live. You put money in, and it grows over time without paying taxes on the growth as long as you keep the money in the account and ultimately use it for qualifying education expenses.

When your child goes to college, you can use the money for things like tuition, books or housing. But the downside is that if you use the money for non-college things, you might have to pay a penalty.

To figure out how much to save each month, you can use a college savings calculator.

If you carry balances on your credit card every month, you're spending money you'll never see again on high interest rates.

For example, if you have a credit card balance of $5,000 with an average interest rate of 28%, you're spending an extra $116 per month that you could be putting toward one of your goals.

Besides paying off high-interest debt in one go, you can also apply for a balance transfer card with a 0% introductory rate. You should plan to repay the debt within the intro period; once the interest rate kicks in, you'll start paying interest on the remaining balance. Note: you typically need at least good credit to qualify for a balance transfer card.

If you're behind on credit card payments, contact your credit card company immediately. Lenders typically want to work with you rather than going through collections or even small claims court.

If you miss too many payments, your debt could be written off as a loss, tanking your credit scores. But even after that, you may still have room to negotiate.

You can also turn to reputable credit counseling agencies. These pros can help you create a personalized budget, offer free resources and guide you through a plan to manage your debt without making unrealistic promises.

Creating a budget is key to turning middle-class goals into reality. Whether it's buying a home, saving for kids' college or just taking that dream vacation, a budget helps you prioritize what matters. It gives you control over your money, making it easier to cut unnecessary expenses and build a safety net.

Plus, it's empowering -- seeing progress toward your goals keeps you motivated. With a clear plan, you're not just reacting to bills; you're actively shaping your financial future.

If you've never created a budget, it might initially seem restrictive. But the reality is you're freeing yourself from problems down the road, says Erika Rasure, chief financial wellness advisor of Beyond Finance.

""It creates a plan and empowers you to make saying 'yes' or 'no' easy. If a particular expense is not in the budget, it's off the table,"" she says. ""Remember, this takes about 60 to 90 days to become a habit, so don't give up. Practice makes progress. It's easy to let shame get in the way here. People often get upset when they inconsistently check their budget, so commitment is essential."""
"Harris wants to grow our broken government. With Elon Musk, Trump is thinking outside the box",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/harris-wants-grow-our-broken-government-elon-musk-trump-thinking-outside-box,2024-09-17T09:07:58Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris wants to hike taxes by trillions of dollars, which will without a doubt crush our sputtering economy.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a better idea: lower taxes and take a machete to government spending. The former president, speaking recently at the Economics Club in New York, promised that if he wins in November, he will create a government efficiency commission to root out ""fraud and improper payments"" and that Elon Musk has agreed to head up the effort. Asking the smartest man on the planet to streamline our bloated, inefficient and unaccountable federal government - slated to spend $7 trillion next year - is the kind of out-of-the-box idea that helped Trump win in 2016 and could sway voters again this November.

Two-thirds of Americans think they pay too much in taxes. If they knew how much of their tax money was wasted or outright stolen, they might revolt. In 2022, some $47 billion of Medicare payments were found to be ""improper,"" while Congress has determined that as much as half a trillion dollars of COVID relief money was likely stolen. Billions are misspent each year on community grants that end up in wealthy communities, maintaining thousands of empty buildings owned by Uncle Sam or funding duplicative and useless federal programs.

TRUMP VOWS TO CUT BUSINESS TAX RATE TO 15%, CREATE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY COMMISSION LED BY ELON MUSK

There are currently, for instance, 43 job training programs across 9 federal agencies that cost taxpayers almost $20 billion per year. One study conducted in 2022 by the Department of Labor concluded that the programs provided zero benefit to workers. Unfortunately, legislators win credit for starting up new programs; no one is applauded for shutting one down.

A watchdog group called Citizens Against Government Waste has identified 543 specific expenditures across the federal bureaucracy that could be reduced or eliminated to save taxpayers ""$402.3 billion in the first year and $4 trillion over five years."" There is, in short, plenty of low-hanging fruit.

Musk is all in, telling an audience recently, ""If Trump wins, we do have an opportunity to do kind of a once in a lifetime deregulation & reduction in the size of the government."" He added: ""America is going bankrupt extremely quickly. The interest payments on the national debt just exceeded the defense budget.""

Tesla's founder is right. Though the liberal media has largely ignored the mountainous debt piled up under the Biden-Harris administration and the resulting ratings downgrade of our Treasury bonds, the damage done by unprecedented reckless spending is undeniable. Higher prices for groceries, cars and electricity brought on by too much money flooding the economy have cost every American family dearly. The high interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to bring inflation down have made home ownership unaffordable for millions.

Vice Presidnt Harris is wrong: we don't need more tax revenues. The government's income, running at roughly 17% of GDP, is in line with historical norms. Our problem is with spending, which is running above 23% of GDP, higher than the historical average of 20%, and is unsustainable.

There is another dangerous aspect of out-of-control government spending; it creates enormous opportunity for theft, partisanship and outright waste.

When taxpayers hear that ""Democrat stalwart"" John Podesta, as the New York Times describes him, was handed $370 billion under the Inflation Reduction Act to fund green energy projects, they should be on high alert. The liberal media has jubilantly reported that much of the announced spending from the Biden Climate czar has gone to Republican-led districts, but really the handouts have largely landed in swing states like Arizona and North Carolina, which could decide this year's election. Nothing like starting up an EV battery plant in Georgia to curry favor with local voters.

Our government is arguably broken. Last December, the Pentagon, which accounts for roughly half the government's discretionary spending, failed its sixth annual audit in a row. The General Accountability Office (GAO) reported they could not accurately evaluate ""at least 46 percent of the DoD's total assets and at least 72 percent of the DoD's total budgetary resources.""

Earlier this year, the Pentagon's Inspector General reported that the U.S. had been unable to track more than $1 billion in weapons and military gear sent to Ukraine. Despite White House denials, many assume the high-tech matériel was stolen.

The federal government employs some 2, 250,000 civilians and about the same number of military personnel, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The vast majority of civilians are protected by civil service rules and regulations; in addition, some 750,000 workers belong to a union, the American Federation of Government Employees. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to fire anyone.

When the Veteran's Administration became embroiled in scandal for having covered up unconscionable wait times and treating our veterans poorly, the Trump administration had to push through a law (VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act) to permit those responsible to be axed, much to the annoyance of pro-union advocates.

The federal Merit Systems Protection Board is charged with adjudicating terminations of civil servants. Its mission is to ""promote an effective Federal workforce free of prohibited personnel practices."" In the last fiscal year, the agency, which has a budget of approximately $60 million, reviewed 4,572 cases. That is how many government workers were fired, out of millions.

Making the federal government more efficient and more effective is a Herculean task; many consider it impossible, but Elon Musk is keen to take it on. As David Malpass, former senior Treasury official in both the Reagan and Trump White Houses told me: ""Musk defied the skeptics with SpaceX and Starlink through small daily successes that are changing the whole trajectory of the space age. Cutting waste can do the same if it captures the public's admiration and triggers an upheaval in the big-government political establishment.""

Japanese 'Peso' Or 'Deutsche Mark?'The Yen Has Us Guessing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/09/17/japanese-peso-or-deutsche-markthe-yen-has-us-guessing/,2024-09-17T08:51:49Z,"Two months ago, some in Tokyo joked that we no longer carry yen in our wallets, but Japanese ""pesos"" or ""rupiah."" Now, with the yen up more than 12% since mid-July -- and perhaps headed for even bigger gains -- will we soon be joking about the Japanese ""deutsche mark?""

On any list of folks hating the Bank of Japan right now, executives at Alimentation Couche-Tard might deserve a place at the very top.

In the month since the Canadian retailer announced its buyout offer for Seven & i Holdings, the largest in Japanese history, the yen has staged a head-turning rally. That surge, compliments of a BOJ rate hike, is making Couche-Tard's $38.5 billion gambit more expensive by the day.

Yet the yen's 8.5% jump since the BOJ's July 31 rate hike is complicating the way forward for more than just executives at Couche-Tard's Quebec headquarters. Corporate CEOs eyeing their own deals in Japan and hedge funds alike are at a serious exchange rate crossroads.

Two months ago, we in Tokyo joked that we no longer carry yen in our wallets, but Japanese ""pesos"" or ""rupiah."" Now, with the yen up more than 12% since mid-July -- and perhaps headed for even bigger gains -- will we soon be joking about the Japanese ""deutsche mark?""

Kidding aside, investors and chieftains, both in Japan and abroad, are at a loss as to where the yen is heading next.

The conventional wisdom is that the yen goes higher. Over at BOJ headquarters, Governor Kazuo Ueda claims it's full-speed ahead for additional tightening moves. On July 31, Ueda's team raised benchmark rates to the highest since 2008 -- 0.25%. The betting, as of now, is that the BOJ might hit the brakes again at its September 19-20 policy meeting.

The BOJ's rationale, it seems, is that wages are finally posting some sizable gains, even rising faster than Japan's 2.8% inflation rate in July. On the other hand, though, strong headwinds are heading Japan's way, including a Chinese economy that can't seem to catch a break.

As economist Stefan Angrick at Moody's Analytics puts it, recent ""data confirm that Japan's economy is not yet out of the woods"" because ""the headwinds facing the economy are substantial.""

Exports are, in Angrick's view, are ""struggling and are unlikely to improve much before year's end. Household finances are stretched. Monthly cash earnings saw a big jump this summer, but this was driven largely by stronger bonus payments, so we look for more evidence that wage growth will stick.""

Yet ""despite the mixed data,"" Angrick adds, ""the Bank of Japan seems determined to tighten monetary policy. At best, further rate hikes will be an added drag on growth. At worst, they could precipitate a broader downturn.""

Herein lies the BOJ's Catch 22. For years now, the central bank has been angling to normalize an interest rate environment that's been at, or below, zero since 1999. Since 2001, Japan also has been toying with quantitative easing, adding bigger doses year after year.

It now falls to Ueda to implement the monetary equivalent of a 12-step program that weans Japan off the monetary sauce. It remains unclear, though, how far the BOJ can go without doing real damage to the patient. One risk: that the BOJ overplaying its hand on rate cuts might tip an underperforming economy into recession.

That is, after all, what happened in 2006 and 2007. Back then, the BOJ managed to get short-term rates as high as 0.25% and end QE. The recession that followed enraged the political establishment. By 2008, policymakers were working to restore QE and slash rates back to zero.

Then Governor Haruhiko Kuroda arrived at BOJ central in 2013 to supersize QE. Kuroda's team gorged aggressively on government bonds and stocks. Within three years, the Kuroda BOJ had swelled the BOJ's balance sheet to the point where it topped the size of Japan's entire $4.7 trillion economy.

Since April 2023, it's fallen to Ueda to find an exit. So far, he's cracked the door open a bit. Only time will tell if he can open it any wider in the months ahead. The question no one can answer is how ready Japan Inc. is for the BOJ to yank away the proverbial punchbowl.

No one knows. It's not like there's ever been a Group of Seven economy that's held rates at zero for a quarter century and needs to plot an escape. And to do so at a moment of great uncertainty in the global economy. The U.S. national debt, for example, has now topped $35 trillion. China's economy is losing altitude, while Europe is flatlining, growth-wise.

Japan, meanwhile, has the biggest debt burden among developed nations, a shrinking population and a political establishment that still worries the nation is suffering from deflationary forces.

Arguably, Japan has been the least risky of major economies in recent years. That's made it something of a safe haven. Add in the weak yen and it's not surprising that Couche-Tard would think it's high time to bid for one of Japan's most recognizable brands.

But sudden confusion about whether the yen is about to become overvalued (like the German deutsche mark of old) or back into undervalued territory is now anyone's bet. That's a huge wild card, given risks emanating from the ""yen-carry trade."" It could be very much in the global headlines as BOJ policymakers gather for their September 19-20 meeting.

Investors borrowing cheaply in yen and using the funds to bet on higher-yielding assets is perhaps the globe's most crowded trade. It's now in complete limbo. So is what we in Tokyo should be calling the bills in our wallets."

(Credit: Martin County Sheriff's Office)

Former President Trump will host a town hall event in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday, the first campaign event since the latest attempt on his life.

Trump will be at Flint's Dort Financial Center on Tuesday evening for a town hall-style event, where he is expected to take questions from the audience and focus remarks on the auto industry and inflation.

The event comes just two days after Trump survived a second assassination attempt, this time while playing golf at Trump National Golf Club in Florida on Sunday.

Trump's Flint town hall will be moderated by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is expected to take on a larger role in campaigning for the former president in the homestretch of the campaign.

The event comes as the campaigns are now within the last 50 days of the election, with both candidates scrambling to solidify support ahead of November. Michigan figures to play a key role for both Trump and his opponent, Vice President Harris, being one of the swing states most likely to turn the election in either candidate's favor.

According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Harris currently holds a slight lead over Trump in the state with an average of 48.3% support to Trump's 47.6%.

However, current polling in Michigan compares favorably for Trump compared to where he stood in 2016 and 2020, when Trump trailed Clinton in the state at this point in the 2016 election by an average of 5.2 points and trailed President Biden at this point in 2020 by 4.8 points.

Trump would go on to win Michigan in 2016 by less than one percentage point, while Biden topped Trump in Michigan in 2020 by less than three percentage points.

SAP BrandVoice: 5 Reasons Why Inflation And The Supply Chain Is Affecting People Everywhere,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/09/17/5-reasons-why-inflation-and-the-supply-chain-is-affecting-people-everywhere/,2024-09-17T04:02:21Z,"After decades of living in London, Los Angeles, New York, and Dallas, my wife and I decided to settle down in the Scottish countryside. The ""middle of nowhere"" is a happening place compared to where we live. On a busy day, we may see a couple of cars (one of which is normally lost tourists looking for where they film ""Outlander""), a tractor, and an ATV with a border collie hanging off the back.

The nearest town - which is five miles away - contains a pub, petrol station, convenience store, and a post office that closes for lunch, half-days on Wednesday, and, really, any other time they feel like it.

The world doesn't interfere here. And we like it that way... until recently.

While in the checkout line at a convenience store holding a chocolate bar and a litre of oat milk, my mind started to wander. The chocolate bar wrapper seemed the same size, but felt like it contained mostly air.

My house is surrounded by fields of oats and barley, but I'm sure the price of my oat milk is about 25% more than I used to pay.

On my way to the store, I paid nearly £100 to fill up the car with petrol. I've had an electric vehicle on order for nearly a year, but all that I've received is a slew of emails stating that ""Your delivery has been delayed"" again and again. Of course, due to the increase in the cost of electricity, when my new EV arrives, it may cost almost as much to run as my old diesel car.

We use wood pellets to power the boiler in our remote home because they're better for the environment and much cheaper than oil.

But our local pellet supplier recently informed us in a very informational email that, ""A huge amount of pellets sold in the UK come from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. This kept the prices so low that many UK producers folded. Now that these imported pellets are not available, it has created a shortage of wood pellets in the UK and Europe.""

With demand spiking across Europe for my local supplier's pellets, a tonne - which used to cost about £300 - will now cost over £600!

You may be thinking that an EV-driving, oat-milk-drinking, biomass-boiler-heating rural hippy doesn't deserve any sympathy - and I'm not asking for any. I know I'm fortunate when considering the overall global economy and employment factors.

The thing is that my tiny part of the world is still affected by the rest of the world.

And the ripple-effect of inflation is that it impacts not just global corporations, but also small businesses, families, and individuals all over the world - from rural Scotland to urban New York City. There are five key areas impacting inflation and supply chain issues:

Businesses of all sizes were affected by the supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, even small ones like my local pellet provider.

According to the Office of National Statistics, 20% of businesses with 10 or more employees reported they'd experienced global supply chain disruption in June '22.

This percentage has remained broadly stable since March 2022.

That line at my grocery store I was waiting in? Normally, there's never a line because there are enough people working to keep customers from getting backed up. But not anymore, thanks to the Great Resignation.

Accommodations, food service, construction and production industries continue to report the largest percentage of businesses experiencing worker shortages.

Since July 2021, job openings in the United States have reached an historic high, clocking in at over 10 million per month. Competition for employees is fierce, with nearly two job openings per unemployed American, resulting in significant labor shortages.

Insufficient labour (at manufacturing plants, warehouses, and transportation companies) combined with rising inflation have triggered a myriad of tangible effects on American daily life, including widespread delays in receiving products and services - just as I've experienced with wood pellets - and out-of-stock situations for items in stores and even online.

These trends have come fast and furious.

Before the pandemic, online shoppers encountered an out-of-stock item once every 200 pages. By early 2022, that number had jumped 235% to once every 59 pages.

Shipping speeds have taken a hit as well. Before the pandemic, Amazon Prime members were used to a one or two-day delivery standard. Now, with far fewer warehouse workers and delivery drivers, customers in some areas began reporting deliveries taking longer than usual - apparently because they were deemed ""nonessential.""

Employee shortages have hit grocery stores particularly hard. To deal with employee shortages, Harris Teeter, a South Atlantic supermarket chain, has shortened operating hours at nearly all of its 250+ stores.

And customers at nearly all grocery stores are reporting frustration with more frequent, post-pandemic lockdowns. Increasingly empty shelves have come with sharply higher food prices across the board, affecting fresh produce, packaged foods, all types of proteins, and even coffee.

Higher prices are driving down basket sizes, and thus demand for everyday food categories such as meat and cereal, as well as higher-priced ""luxury"" items.

Gas shortages and energy concerns run deep across the world, including the United States and Europe, and they've been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.

And it's not just impacting petrol prices.

Everyone is looking for low-cost ways to heat their homes through the winter, which is driving up demand for wood pellets and firewood - even in my area where sustainably managed forests are literally all around us.

The combination of massive inflation, uncertain economies, and supply and demand issues are making for a perfect storm of anxiety and fear as we face the winter months ahead.

As inflation has driven up the cost of living, people who want to work are demanding higher wages.

I suspect that one reason for the soaring price of wood pellets in my area is that there aren't enough people to hire to do the work needed to scale up inventories and meet growing demand.

Potential hires know their value in the current market and are demanding more pay - as are current workers who want more money to stay. This story is playing out in my little neck of the woods - and on a grand scale globally, leading to higher labor costs that drive up product costs for customers.

Of course, the central banks are struggling to balance supply side inflation with the risk of recession. And we'll all have to see how that plays out.

But for businesses trying to manufacture goods: ship them in a timely manner and sell them at prices customers with already-strained financial resources can afford."

The star performance of gold, which has risen by 59% over the last two years from $1628/oz in late 2022 to a record high of $2582/0z has also created a FOMO effect (fear of missing out).

A survey earlier this month of ETF activity by the World Gold Council, an industry lobby group, found that withdrawals from gold-backed ETFs had started to reverse in May with positive inflows continuing into August, the latest month measured.

North American investors are leading ETF investment, accounting for 17.2 tons of gold in August, comfortably ahead of Europe's 7.9 tons taking the total amount of gold in ETFs to 3181.7 tons, enough to represent the world's third largest hoard of gold, more than Italy and France but well short of the 8133.5 tons held by the U.S.

The return of ETFs as an important factor in driving the gold price higher was the subject of a research paper released on Monday by ANZ, an Australian bank, three days before the keenly awaited interest rate decision of the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve.

While the widely signalled rate cut has been worked into asset pricing over the past few months it's the size of the cut which will be most keenly watched with 0.25% seen as a certainty, but a ""jumbo"" cut of 0.5% possible.

ANZ said it expected a recovery in ""strategic investment"" in gold would push the price higher.

""A 100-basis point (1%) cut in rates could see 200-to-250 tons of EFT net inflows over the coming months,"" the bank said in a comment headed ""A golden ascent"".

""The return of strategic investment demand will likely drive the price trajectory upward, potentially reaching $2900/oz by the end of 2025.""

Other gold forecasters are more optimistic. Lichtenstein-based banker Ronald-Peter Stoeferle told the Beaver Creek Precious Metals Summit in Colorado last week that the price was on track to reached $4800/oz in 2030.

Falling interest rates, especially lower real rates after allowing for inflation, are expected to act like a magnet for small investors who have spent much of the past 12 months on the sidelines as central banks led the way.

""While market expectations can be volatile, falling interest rates in the coming quarters look certain,"" ANZ said.

""We expect 200 basis points (2%) in rate cuts in this monetary easing cycle, which will pave the way for lower real rates.

""The structural drivers for gold's price, lower yields and a weaker U.S. dollar, will be increasingly supportive after their inverse relationship weakened during the tightening cycle of 2022-23.

""Strong central bank purchases and resilient physical demand will be joined by healthy inflows into gold-back ETFs.

""We expect gold prices to move towards $2700/oz in the short term and reach a high of $2900/oz by the end of 2025."""
Opinion | Trump and Vance think anti-immigrant hate is good politics. They're mistaken.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-haitian-immigrants-springfield-rcna171292,2024-09-16T23:51:16Z,"Over the weekend, Ohio senator and vice presidential nominee JD Vance made a stunning and unintentional admission: He's a liar.

For more than a week, Vance, former President Donald Trump and many of their allies have spread falsehoods about the town of Springfield, Ohio, and its Haitian immigrant community. Most infamously, Trump last week repeated the now oft-debunked claim that Haitian migrants in the town are stealing and eating pet dogs and cats.

But on CNN, Vance gave away the GOP's game. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do."" He claimed that the ""American media"" ignored the ""problems in Springfield"" associated with the impact of Haitian migration on public services in the town until ""Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes."" Vance tried to explain away his verbal slip, but he couldn't avoid the truth: ""creating stories"" is another way to say ""making stuff up.""

The consequences for such lies are both obvious and frightening. A steady stream of bomb threats has forced Springfield officials to temporarily shutter government offices, hospitals, elementary and middle schools, and two local colleges. On Monday, a local festival celebrating ""diversity, arts and culture,"" was also canceled -- a fitting monument to Trump and Vance's racist attacks.

Most insidious is the effect on the local Haitian community, which is increasingly under siege. As Vance's rhetoric has made clear, his concern is not the Haitians' immigration status: They are in America legally. Rather, the issue is their skin color and background of those moving to Springfield. As the vice presidential nominee argued on X this weekend, the real question about Springfield is, ""Should we drop 20,000 people from a radically different culture in a small Ohio town in a matter of a few years?""

Never mind that, like so many immigrant communities before them, the Haitian community in Springfield has more than acclimated itself to their new homes. Their ""positive influences"" on the town have been noted by everyone from Springfield's Republican mayor and local business leaders to Ohio's Republican governor, who has decried the Trump/Vance-led attacks as ""garbage.""

But would Vance make such proclamations if the 20,000 people were, say, from Norway? Would he make the same argument about urban gentrification and thousands of white yuppies moving into a predominately Black or Hispanic community?

When Vance claims that ""what is happening in Springfield is coming to every town and city in this country if Kamala Harris' open border policies are allowed to continue,"" his intent is not difficult to discern. His incessant focus on ""illegal immigration"" and problems ""at the border"" is nothing more than a racist dog whistle to MAGA voters. And it's one that minority communities have seen play out in America for centuries.

It's also quite purposeful. As Marc Caputo reported Sunday for the Bulwark, ""Privately, Trump aides think it's a net plus,"" writes Caputo. ""The longer the discussion is about migrants, the less it is about tougher topics for them. 'We talk about abortion; we lose. We talk about immigration, we win,' said one Trump adviser.""

""But what about the blowback from spreading an incendiary story for which there is no evidence?"" Caputo asks. ""'We'll take the hit to prove the bigger point,'"" the adviser responds. NBC News reports that Trump is planning to visit Springfield ""soon,"" which surely will fan the flames even more.

Immigration is indeed an effective policy issue for Trump. In the most recent ABC/Ipsos poll, he polled 10 points better on it than Harris. But he also polls seven points better than his Democratic rival on the economy and inflation. Not only are those issues the top concerns for undecided voters, but they have the added benefit of not utilizing unabashedly racist sentiments. To side with Trump and Vance because of concerns over the economy is asking a heckuva lot less of voters than siding with them over naked immigrant bashing. The former doesn't require a cleansing shower after wading in the political sewer.

The last nine years of American politics have shown us that Trump and his minions only sing from one anti-immigrant hymnal. Since 2016, immigrant-bashing has been the issue that most consistently unites GOP candidates -- and it's one that has taken on an even darker hue this cycle, with routine talk of immigrant ""invasions"" into the U.S.

There is, however, less evidence that it's an effective political strategy. In 2018, Trump-supported candidates regularly used xenophobic attack lines in their campaigns. This was the election of ""migrant caravans"" and ""bad hombres."" It didn't work. Trump trotted out the usual dog whistles in 2020. So did Republican candidates in 2022. Neither led to political success. Maybe 2024 will be different, but the evidence is against xenophobic broadsides against immigrants as a route to political success.

In fact, the constant attacks on immigrants and the rising tensions in Springfield and around the country could be a net negative for Trump. The unending negativity that now defines the Trump campaign, the constant feeling of chaos and fatigue around the former president has a profound effect. The demagoguing over Springfield may energize MAGA world but, for the anti-Trump wing of the electorate, it's a reminder of everything loathsome about the former president. Unfortunately, for Trump and now Vance, shame has always been an emotion in short supply, so there's little reason to expect the racist, immigration bashing to stop. There's also not much reason to think it'll work."
"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back For Economy",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreyschulze/2024/09/16/two-steps-forward-one-step-back-for-economy/,2024-09-16T17:08:08Z,"U.S. equity markets ended August higher after largely erasing the S&P 500 Index's 8.5% selloff that began in late July and crested in early August. The turbulence was ignited as a growth scare emerged following a soft jobs report and fears of contagion emanating from an unwind of the Japanese yen carry trade. A rebound began following a favorable initial jobless claims release on August 8 that showed the labor market was likely not deteriorating as rapidly as had been feared, bolstering the prospects of a soft landing.

The second half of August saw a continuation of largely favorable data releases, including additional jobless claims reports that helped markets advance despite a few hiccups and an August jobs report that showed a bit of a bounce back in hiring. The action of the last few months could be broadly described as ""two steps forward, one step back"" for both financial markets and the economy. Jobless claims is the latest signal to show resilience, supporting the notion of a slowing but still healthy labor market.

In recent years, we have referred to initial jobless claims as our economic ""canary in the coal mine"" as it gives us a weekly real-time look into the health of the labor market that is not materially revised historically. Initial jobless claims measure the number of people filing for unemployment benefits in any given week, and the number of first-time filers (initial claims) provides insight into the number of layoffs occurring. An increasing number of layoffs bodes poorly for future consumer spending as labor income is the primary source of spending power for the typical American. Consumption can also suffer as a layoff cycle builds even among those who do not lose their jobs, which typically shows up as a dent to consumer confidence and general consumer retrenchment.

Jobless Claims Remain Under Control

All of this is part of the reason why initial claims are one of the heaviest-weighted indicators in our assessment of the economy. Specifically, we focus on the change in claims relative to recent trends to try and identify inflection points. Claims worsened last summer when they appeared to be breaking out to the upside, although the indicator never hit a danger zone. With the benefit of hindsight and additional data, seasonal noise seems to have been a major contributor to the summer 2023 deterioration in claims. Claims recovered (decreased) last fall and were showing healthy readings by the spring of 2024.

By May, claims began to rise again as suspected; however, the data was loosely following the 2023 pattern until early August when they surged just as the aforementioned growth scare was emerging. In retrospect, this bounce was likely the result of Hurricane Beryl, which led to an outsize pickup in filings for unemployment benefits in Texas, and in tandem with normal auto plant shutdowns in Michigan as factories retooled to produce next year's models. With the effects from Hurricane Beryl fading and auto plants now back online, claims are once again tracking below 2023 levels, a positive sign for the continuation of the economic expansion.

The signal from initial jobless claims is consistent with an array of labor data that shows normalization rather than cooling. Due to a soft nonfarm payroll reports in August of 142,000 and downward revisions to June and July job creation figures, the average over the last three months has been 116,000, which is below the 178,000 average seen in 2018-19, a period generally seen as consistent with the notion of maximum employment. Nevertheless, the U.S. economy continues to create jobs, albeit at a more tepid pace. While the employment picture has softened, ongoing hiring combined with cooling inflation -- which is showing up in the important area of commodity prices - has improved the prospects of a soft landing look in our view."
"As Fed Readies Potential Rate Cut, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Warns Of 'Stagflation'",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/16/as-fed-readies-potential-rate-cut-jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-warns-of-stagflation/,2024-09-16T16:38:17Z,"While the first interest rate adjustment is expected to take place at the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting this week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that the United States economy is not ""out of the woods"" yet.

""I would say the worst outcome is stagflation -- recession, higher inflation,"" Dimon said at a Council of Institutional Investors conference in Brooklyn on Tuesday. ""And by the way, I wouldn't take it off the table.""

Inflation in the U.S. appears to be cooling, offering a glimmer of hope for consumers and the Fed. Recent data shows that consumer prices have reached their lowest 12-month inflation rate since February 2021, signaling a significant retreat from its alarming peak -- 9.1% -- observed in June 2022 .

Additionally, wholesale price measures suggest that pipeline price increases are largely under control, which indicates that inflationary pressures in the supply chain are easing.

The focus now shifts to how forcefully the Fed should respond. If the central bank is too aggressive, and the U.S. commits to plans of higher deficits and increased infrastructure spending, Dimon predicts it will have an adverse effect on an already strained economy, resulting from the Fed's heightened interest rates.

""They're all inflationary, basically in the short run, the next couple of years,"" he stated. ""So, it's hard to look at [it] and say, 'Well, no, we're out of the woods.' I don't think so.""

Claudia Sahm, who previously worked as a Fed economist and now serves as the chief economist at New Century Advisors, suggests that initiating a half-percentage-point cut in interest rates could help prevent further deterioration in the job market. This approach might establish a minimum threshold to safeguard against potential employment declines, according to Sahm.

""The labor market [since] last July has gotten weaker,"" she said in a CNBC interview on Friday. ""So there's an aspect of just recalibrating. We got some more information. [Fed officials] need to kind of clean it up, do a 50-basis-point cut and then be ready to do more.""

Dimon's stagflation concerns likely stems from its potential to create a prolonged period of economic hardship that is difficult to resolve through conventional monetary and fiscal policies.

The term ""stagflation"" refers to an environment in which persistently high inflation coincides with an economic downturn and consistently elevated unemployment levels.

Economists consider stagflation -- last seen in the U.S. in the 1970s -- to be worse than a recession, as it can severely impact the stock market, 401(k) plans and other retirement savings.

In 2022, former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke also warned that the U.S. was on the path to stagflation.

""Even under the benign scenario, we should have a slowing economy,"" Bernanke told the New York Times. ""And inflation's still too high, but coming down. So, there should be a period in the next year or two where growth is low, unemployment is at least up a little bit and inflation is still high. So, you could call that stagflation.""

In a stagflationary environment, the economy stagnates while prices continue to rise, creating a difficult situation for consumers, businesses and investors alike.

It has the potential to hamper economic growth while eroding purchasing power. As prices increase, consumers' ability to buy goods and services diminishes, leading to reduced spending and economic activity. This, in turn, can further dampen the economy, creating a vicious cycle.

Companies could struggle with higher input costs and reduced consumer spending, which would lead to lower profits and declining stock price

In the job market, stagflation can be particularly harmful. High unemployment would persist due to the stagnant economy, yet workers would be facing rising living costs, making it increasingly difficult for them to make ends meet.

Businesses may struggle to expand or hire new employees due to increased costs and reduced consumer demand, further exacerbating unemployment issues.

Traditional tools used to combat economic downturns, such as lowering interest rates, may be less effective or even counterproductive in a stagflationary environment, as they could further fuel inflation.

The Fed will be meeting September 17 to September 18, and an announcement of at least a 25-basis-point cut to interest rates is anticipated Wednesday. Sahm, as well as Wall Street traders, project that a 50-basis-point cut is also on the table."
Marvel VFX Giant Reveals Damage Done By Hollywood Strikes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/09/16/marvel-vfx-giant-reveals-damage-done-by-hollywood-strikes/,2024-09-16T15:46:25Z,"The owner of Framestore, the special effects powerhouse behind the visuals in many Marvel movies, has revealed that it is still reeling from the strikes which gripped Hollywood for more than six months last year and caused its revenue to plummet by $46.7 million to $665.6 million.

Framestore has worked on more than ten movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe including all of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame and next year's Fantastic Four. It is in a prime position to get the work as it is the leading SFX agency in the United Kingdom where many Marvel movies are shot due to the lucrative government incentives on offer to studios.

The company was founded in London's Soho district in 1986 by then husband and wife team William Sargent and Sharon Reed, together with three friends. They cut their teeth working on the groundbreaking video for pop group A-ha's hit song Take On Me which featured hand-drawn characters interacting with real people.

Framestore then expanded into the lucrative market of creating corporate adverts as well as effects for movies where it made a name for itself bringing JK Rowling's creations to life in all of the Harry Potter movies. It went on to win three Oscars for Gravity, The Golden Compass and Blade Runner 2049 which put it on the radar of investors.

In 2016, 75% of Framestore was sold to Shanghai-listed entertainment operator Cultural Investment Holdings (CIH) valuing it at nearly $197 million. In true Hollywood style, the deal spawned a sequel which came in 2020 when London-based investment firm Aleph Capital and New York private equity player Crestview Partners bought Framestore through their Infinity Bidco vehicle and merged it with its American counterpart Method Studios and post-production specialists, Company 3.

In turn, Infinity Bidco is owned by the UK-based Infinity Topco which is the ultimate parent of all three effects firms. Its latest set of financial statements was filed recently and reveals that the drop in its revenue in the year-ending December 31, 2023 was ""largely driven by the writers and actors strikes halting or slowing production for the majority of the year, impacting the pipeline of new projects.""

The dark clouds began to gather in May last year when writers downed their tools in a bid to boost their pay and royalties from streaming shows. They were followed by actors two months later and although the curtain came down on the dispute in November, by then studios had delayed the release dates of many movies including this year's chart-topper Deadpool & Wolverine, which Framestore also worked on.

Around 71% of Infinity Topco's revenue comes from North America and this accounted for almost all of its decline in trade. However, the financial statements add that the company's operating loss narrowed by $29.8 million to $16.9 million thanks to ""tight cost control against a landscape of continuing rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.""

Its loss stands in stark contrast to the bottom line of the Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the in-house agency of Marvel's owner, Disney. As we recently reported, thanks to the introduction of remote working, ILM was able to cut its office costs and made record profits in 2023.

Infinity Topco's costs also fell last year as it cut $76.6 million of spending with the biggest savings made on staffing. Framestore itself employs 3,053 of the staff whilst the remainder work for Method and Company 3. The company only let 37 staff go, giving it a total of 6,329, though their pay plummeted by 8.6% to $468.4 million.

As we recently revealed in the London Evening Standard newspaper, despite tightening its belt, Infinity Topco still had to reduce the value of its investment in Infinity Bidco by $19.9 million to $177.4 million after the strikes cast a dark spell on the business.

The financial statements confirm that ""due to the challenges faced by the group arising from the writers' and actors' strike an impairment of $19,852,000 has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2023 against the investment held in Infinity Bidco Limited.""

The value was written down despite an improvement in the fortunes of Framestore's direct operating company Guidedraw, which retained its value. Its revenue rose 8.1% to $376.2 million in 2023 as the decline in business from North America was more than offset by an increase from British productions which were not part of the Hollywood strikes. Combined with careful cost control, this helped it to generate a $7.9 million operating profit, up from a $6.3 million loss in 2022.

Nevertheless, Infinity Topco still needed to boost its borrowings last year and took on $52.1 million more debt giving it a total of $194 million. The financial statements say that the company's ""management have been actively engaged in discussions with lenders and are confident of the group's ability to successfully refinance or renegotiate these obligations.

""However, at the date of approving these financial statements no agreement to refinance is in place and there can be no certainty that the facility will be renewed or that the level of facility will be sufficient to cover cash flow requirements."" Accordingly, this ""may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.""

The filings add that ""during the 2024 financial year, the group has performed well and is trading in line with budget"" though it still expects to be ""partially impacted by the downturn in trade following the strike."" Reflecting this, in July Framestore closed its Vancouver studio citing an ""industry-wide slowdown in content production."" It has seven other offices around the world but the closure shows that a happy ending could still be far, far away."
How Financial Literacy Benefits Ticket To Work Participants And All Employees,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianewiniarski/2024/09/16/how-financial-literacy-benefits-ticket-to-work-participants-and-all-employees/,2024-09-16T15:07:40Z,"Financial stress among U.S. workers continues to grow as inflation persists, driving fears of rising consumer goods prices and interest rates. In its annual Employee Financial Wellness Survey, PwC, a global professional services firm, reported that 57% of respondents said, ""finances are the top cause of stress in their lives."" And more than 50% are concerned about increasing expenses and the effects of inflation. This financial stress is also prevalent among participants of the Ticket to Work (TTW) Program, who are attempting to re-enter the workforce and achieve financial stability.

Economic uncertainty and financial stress are common among Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries returning to work through the Ticket to Work (TTW) Program. Financial stress can negatively impact sleep, mental health, self-esteem, physical health and personal relationships. While some TTW participants look forward to getting back to work following an extended absence, they are often apprehensive about wages, cost of living and day-to-day financial management.

Financial concerns can affect employees' motivation and productivity at work. PwC's research indicates that individuals worried about finances spend three or more working hours per week dealing with these issues.

A strong foundation in financial literacy, including a keen understanding of financial concepts and skills, allows employees to adhere to budgets and watch their savings grow. This can reduce financial anxieties and promote greater engagement in the workplace.

Six Financial Literacy Tips For Ticket Holders And Others

Recognizing the importance of financial well-being, individuals returning to work through the TTW Program can benefit from understanding and applying sound financial practices. The more knowledgeable you are about financial matters, the better equipped you will be to meet your financial goals, including managing day-to-day expenses, paying down debt and saving for retirement.

Here are six tips TTW participants can use to help understand key financial strategies and how to incorporate them into daily life. Social Security-authorized Employment Networks (EN) and state Vocational Rehabilitation agencies (VR) can provide support along the way.

How: Track your earnings and be aware of how wages affect your disability benefits. By doing so, you can take advantage of Social Security incentives like the Trial Work Period that allows you to earn more and protect your SSDI benefits. Employment Networks can help track and report your earnings to Social Security as required by the TTW Program.

How: Create and stick to a budget that prioritizes necessary expenses. This practice can help TTW participants achieve financial self-sufficiency - the ultimate goal of the program.

How: Aim to save three to six months of expenses. Regular savings can prepare you for unforeseen expenses and build financial stability.

How: Keep up with payments, avoid new debt, and consider debt consolidation with reputable companies. Your credit score and overall financial health will benefit when debt is under control.

How: Even if you're not ready to retire, set achievable financial goals to be prepared. A directory of available resources, programs and publications to help you plan is available through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

How: A good credit score is essential for significant purchases, favorable credit card interest rates and lease agreements. Pay your bills on time to avoid negative marks and check your credit score at least annually through credit monitoring services like Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.

Financial literacy is vital for all workers, especially those re-entering the workforce through Ticket to Work. The TTW Program encourages financial self-sufficiency. By understanding and applying simple, yet effective financial strategies daily, along with support from ENs and VRs, participants can move closer to achieving this goal."
Fed Once Again Expected To Make Jumbo Interest Rate Cuts At This Week's 'Weighty' Meeting,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/16/fed-once-again-expected-to-make-jumbo-interest-rate-cuts-at-this-weeks-weighty-meeting/,2024-09-16T14:46:12Z,"Market expectations tilted Monday to favor a larger interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve announces its hotly anticipated decision Wednesday, the latest shift for investors contending with unprecedented uncertainty about what the U.S. central bank will do next.

Since last July, the Fed-determined federal funds rate has sat at a target range of 5.25% to 5.5%, meaning traders are quibbling over whether the central bank will cut to a range of 5% to 5.25% or 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate only directly sets overnight lending costs between banks, but heavily influences borrowing costs across the U.S., including mortgages and business loans. Rates now sit at their highest level since 2001, with the Fed hiking beginning in 2022 to address sky high inflation. But inflation has since moderated, bolstering the case for rate cuts, with Wall Street's focus now on whether the stimulatory pivot from the Fed will be enough to keep the U.S. out of a recession, fears worsened by consecutive months of much worse than expected labor market growth.

Economists at leading U.S. banks are split on what they expect this week. The likes of JPMorgan's top U.S. economist Michael Feroli have told clients they anticipate the Fed to ""do the right thing"" and cut rates by 50 basis points, while Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. economist anticipates a 25 basis-point cut, explaining ""larger cuts have historically come in the context of an obvious crisis or at least a layoff spiral,"" which the U.S. is far from today.

What the Fed signals it will do beyond this week. The FedWatch Tool prices in a 4% to 4.25% range as the most likely destination at the end of 2024, indicating a total of 125 basis points of cuts at the Fed's three remaining meetings in 2024. Mericle expects the Federal Open Market Committee to update its statement to remove language expressing a lack of confidence in returning inflation to its 2% goal and to add language indicating its focus on keeping the labor market afloat."
How De La Calle Is Transforming Tepache Into A Modern Mexican Soda,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveknox/2024/09/16/how-de-la-calle-is-transforming-tepache-into-a-modern-mexican-soda/,2024-09-16T13:07:08Z,"The allure of Mexican traditions meets modern innovation in the vibrant world of tepache, a drink with ancient roots and a fresh, contemporary twist. I sat down with Alex Matthews, founder of De La Calle, to discuss his journey from curiosity to creation, bringing the authentic flavors of Mexico to the U.S. market. We delve into the challenges of introducing tepache to American consumers, the evolution of the brand, and the strategic decisions driving its future growth.

Dave Knox: What inspired you to launch De La Calle?

Alex Matthews: I've always been intrigued by Mexico. Coming from the UK, Mexico has always seemed exotic. After moving to California in 2000, the country's allure grew, leading to frequent trips -- initially as a tourist with my wife and later on more adventurous journeys, like dirt bike trips to Baja and Guadalajara. Over 10 to 12 years, I noticed tepache being sold by street vendors and in local markets across Mexico. I thought it was delicious, but it wasn't until a lunch conversation with a friend about fermented foods that the idea really took shape.

As someone with a background in food and beverage, I started thinking about celebrating different fermented drinks from around the world. Tepache, a traditional Mexican beverage, was on our list. While on a trip to Mexico City, I visited a local market, found a tepacheria, and was struck by how many locals were enjoying the drink as part of their daily routine. This got me thinking -- why isn't tepache more widely available, especially in the U.S.?

Digging deeper, I learned that tepache dates back over a thousand years, originating in pre-Aztec Mexico. Initially made with corn, the recipe evolved to include pineapple, fermented with local spices and sugar. The story behind tepache -- its history, health benefits, and regional variations -- fascinated me. I shared my thoughts with a friend who's an investor in the food and beverage space, and we decided to explore the potential of bringing tepache to the U.S. market.

In early 2020, the three of us raised a small amount of money and set up a pilot plant -- just a thousand square feet -- where we started fermenting our own tepache. Over the course of a year, we developed five different flavors, each inspired by the diverse regions of Mexico, and began thinking about how to introduce this historic drink to the U.S. market. That's how De La Calle began -- an idea sparked in late 2018 and brought to life in 2020.

Knox: When introducing tepache from Mexico to the U.S. market, what challenges did you face?

Matthews: From the start, we knew that ""tepache"" was an unfamiliar word for the U.S. market. It wasn't something you would find on shelves here. We also knew that our company name, ""De La Calle,"" which means ""in the street"" or ""of the street"" in Spanish, would require some education, as it's where you typically find tepache in Mexico -- literally in the streets.

Our initial challenge was twofold: How do you pronounce it, and how do we make it intriguing enough for people to pick up off the shelf? We initially felt that kombucha had paved the way for fermented beverages in the U.S. market. Kombucha, which was once a completely new concept, had gained a strong foothold, and you can now find it in almost every grocery store in America. We hoped that tepache, as another fermented beverage, could follow a similar path to popularity, even though it was a new idea.

Tepache is made with pineapple rind to kickstart fermentation, along with Mexican sugar and spices. The flavor is naturally appealing -- far less vinegary and intense than kombucha. It almost tastes like a Mexican soda. We were banking on the idea that its unique profile as a fermented Mexican beverage would intrigue consumers.

Our biggest initial challenge was educating consumers about what De La Calle and tepache are: a traditional Mexican drink with health benefits, but with a new word and concept for most Americans. This challenge has been our focus for the first three years of the company's life, and while there have been other challenges, this was certainly the most significant one at the start.

Knox: You recently mentioned a branding refresh. What led to that decision, and what changes are you making with this update?

Matthews: When we first launched De La Calle, the brand's growth was explosive -- over 100% year-over-year for the first few years. We quickly gained distribution across every state, with our products now in around 8,000 stores nationwide. Whole Foods played a big role in kickstarting this back in 2021, seeing an opportunity to introduce something new to their customers. That success led to other major retailers like Target, Walmart, H.E.B., Kroger, and Albertsons following suit.

Initially, the signs were extremely positive. But by year three, I began to reassess our positioning. One concern was that our association with kombucha could hold us back. Kombucha has plateaued and may even see a slight decline in the coming years. We needed to distance ourselves from being seen as ""just another kombucha.""

Another factor was the growing Latino population in the U.S., particularly Mexicans, who make up a significant portion of that demographic. Tepache is familiar to many within these communities, and the education barrier is much lower for Spanish-speaking consumers. However, we had been positioning ourselves as a premium product, similar to kombucha, which didn't align with how tepache could be perceived by this audience. We weren't effectively reaching the Latino customer base during our first three years.

The third realization came from examining the Mexican soda category. There's a high demand for Mexican sodas in the U.S., but there are only two major players -- Fanta, owned by a large corporation, and Jarritos, which has seen massive but somewhat quiet success since the 1980s. No one had really thought about how to modernize a Mexican soda. When we introduced tepache to the U.S., we modernized it -- canned it, carbonated it, lowered the sugar, increased vitamin C, and got it organically certified. But I thought, ""How can we modernize this further?""

We needed to position tepache as a modern Mexican soda, something healthier with functional benefits, yet still connected to its heritage. We also needed to lower our price point to be more in line with the better-for-you soda movement, appealing to both Latinos and other ethnic groups, while distancing ourselves from the kombucha comparison.

These three factors -- distancing from kombucha, reaching the Latino market, and modernizing Mexican soda -- led us, at the start of 2024, to firmly push for repositioning tepache as a modern Mexican soda.

Knox: When will this new branding fully hit the market?

Matthews: We're in the middle of the launch right now. We've updated our can art to emphasize ""modern Mexican soda"" and adjusted the copy on our packaging to reflect the new positioning. We've also lowered our price point nationwide.

However, changes at the retail level take time. It'll be another four to five months before you only see the new cans on shelves. Our marketing has already shifted to focus on the Mexican soda aspect, and we're working with retailers to update displays and in-store promotions to communicate this change.

Knox: As you focus on changing De La Calle's footprint and market presence, what other changes will you drive in the next six months to support the modern Mexican soda positioning?

Matthews: Changes in grocery and retail are gradual, often taking six to nine months to fully implement. While price points and can designs are being updated, it will take four to five months before the new Mexican soda positioning is fully visible on shelves. We still have existing inventory, both at the retail level and with our distributors, so the transition won't be immediate.

From a marketing perspective, we're now positioning ourselves clearly as a Mexican soda, which is a significant shift for us. This adjustment is an evolution for De La Calle, and since we're already a national brand with widespread retail presence, it's easier for us to make this change and benefit from it.

New consumers will be attracted by our lower price point, and existing customers will have a clearer understanding of what tepache is -- a Mexican soda. This clarity is crucial. Early success stories in the better-for-you soda category are encouraging for the market, and we see our unique positioning as complementary to those trends.

While some competitors focus on American nostalgia, we're leaning into our Mexican heritage, which is highly popular in the U.S. There's room for diversity on retail shelves, and major retailers like Target, Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons recognize the need to cater to the Latino demographic, which is projected to be 25% of the U.S. population by 2028. De La Calle speaks to that heritage, and we believe this will lead to sustained success in the U.S. market. These are some of the key initiatives we'll be driving over the next six to nine months.

Knox: You've mentioned a lower price point, which is notable given the recent inflationary period where nearly every brand has been raising prices. How are you planning to communicate this more approachable price point to consumers and leverage it to your advantage?

Matthews: There are some well-established methods for this, primarily through our retail trade programs, such as net tags and labels. However, retailers are becoming stricter about what can and cannot be done in-store. Our primary focus will be on building prominent displays. We need to stack our product on the floor with clear signage that highlights both the new price point and our positioning as a Mexican soda. These displays are crucial for us to effectively communicate our price in-store.

Additionally, we'll use social media and the digital media platforms that many retailers now offer, including in-store apps and their existing media channels. While these platforms can be expensive -- especially for a growing brand like ours -- we plan to take full advantage of them to reach our audience.

Knox: Beyond the rebrand, can consumers expect any new innovations or flavors from De La Calle?

Matthews: De La Calle was born out of HERE Studio, an agency I started in 2018 that works with consumer brands in the food, beverage, and hospitality space. We're constantly in touch with trends, and that helps us innovate.

We have a new flavor coming that we see as a gateway to tepache -- a familiar taste that bridges traditional Mexican sodas with tepache for different generations. We're also working on improving our formula to enhance flavor and make it more soda-like while keeping it low in sugar, organically certified, and craft fermented. We want that drinking occasion to feel more like a soda drinking occasion and you can expect some exciting innovations from us in the next six months to support that."
This Won't Change The Trade Deficit But It Will Raise Retail Prices,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2024/09/16/this-wont-change-the-trade-deficit-but-it-will-raise-retail-prices/,2024-09-16T12:47:50Z,"In 2002, the U.S. trade deficit with China was about $100 billion. In the next decade, it exploded and has been between $300 billion and $400 billion every year since (except for 2018 when it was over $400 billion).

But U.S. consumers want inexpensive goods, manufacturing labor in the U.S. is expensive and Chinese labor is cheap. For those three reasons, it will be unlikely that the the trade deficit will decline in any meaningful way in the foreseeable future no matter what the government does.

That a trade deficit is bad for the U.S. is accepted political wisdom but it's an arguable point. We send dollars abroad, they send us products, ultimately those dollars have to come back here to buy products and services or as investments.

What's so bad about that? It means we're buying products less expensively than we could if they were made here and the country is wealthy enough to buy more than we produce.

But politicians think it sounds bad and they want to be seen as doing something about it.

One way to potentially reduce trade deficits is with tariffs. That makes products less profitable for suppliers and more expensive for consumers, reducing demand. But tariffs are inflationary. More important, many products imported into the U.S. are so much cheaper than they would be if they were U.S.-made that there's often no chance the production will come back to the U.S. The cost of making it abroad is so much less that almost no tariff can make it worthwhile to bring production to the U.S.

The most that can happen is that products get sourced in different foreign countries, like moving from China to Vietnam or India, but that has no effect on the overall U.S. economy or the overall U.S. trade deficit.

If you've been buying products online, there's a good chance that you've benefited from what's known as the de minimis rule. That's where rules about tariffs are suspended when shipments from abroad into the U.S. are small, in this case, under $800.

In order to take advantage of the rule, companies have moved their direct-to-consumer shipping facilities out of the U.S. and into Mexico or Canada. Instead of sending huge, valuable shipments of products into the U.S. that are subject to tariffs, the big shipments are sent instead to third-party warehouses in Mexico or Canada. When consumers order the products they are packaged for individual shipment consumers and that's usually less than $800.

Using the de minimis rule, many shipments that would have been subject to tariffs are able to avoid it because they enter the U.S. as part of a small shipment.

Last week, the Biden administration proposed several new changes to tariff rules and one of those is the elimination of most de minimis qualifications, including on most clothing.

The likelihood that this will cause more products, especially apparel, to be manufactured in the U.S. is nearly zero, the cost differential is just too great.

It's not clear that the change will actually take place, right now it's just a proposal and it's subject to comment and change. But if it does happen, it will move some warehouse jobs to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and that's a good thing.

But someone will have to pay the tariff that was previously being avoided by the de minimis rule. That someone is most likely to be consumers and that means retail prices will go up.

The politics around trade deficits is dicey. But what shouldn't be dicey is the idea that raising tariffs to make consumers pay more is bad for the retail industry."
Forbes Daily: Murdoch Family Feud Will Decide Future Of Fox News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/09/16/forbes-daily-murdoch-family-feud-will-decide-future-of-fox-news/,2024-09-16T12:11:02Z,"The Murdoch family is headed to court this week over the future of billionaire Rupert Murdoch's media empire.

Murdoch's new succession plan would pass control of his businesses solely to Lachlan Murdoch, his eldest son and the chairman of News Corp -- the parent firm of the print empire that includes the Wall Street Journal and New York Post -- and executive chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation. But three of Murdoch's other children, who were set to have equal voting shares under the original plan, are fighting back.

According to one document obtained by the New York Times, Murdoch may be motivated by a desire to maintain the conservative leanings of his outlets like Fox News -- which some of his children do not share.

Former President Donald Trump is safe after shots were fired Sunday in what the FBI described as an ""attempted assassination"" at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The suspected shooter is now in custody, and was about 300 to 500 yards away from Trump when he was spotted and fired upon by the Secret Service.

Consumer sentiment improved this month but remains historically weak, according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. The lingering low sentiment coincides with elevated inflation during President Joe Biden's time in office, though economists say presidential actions have far less of an impact on the economy than public perception may suggest.

Adobe's stock fell 8% Friday after the company reported a lower forecast for its upcoming quarter than expected, bringing the software firm's shares down into the negative for the year. The firm actually beat estimates for earnings and revenue, but nearly $23 billion was erased from its market capitalization amid Friday's slide.

The S&P 500 closed out its best week of the year Friday, fresh off of its worst week of 2024, as the market walks a tightrope. Friday's rally was driven by hope that the Federal Reserve will take the market-friendly approach of an aggressive monetary policy shift when it meets this week.

Billionaire venture capitalist Walter Kortschak, who owns the land where Jurassic Park was filmed, made his estimated $1.6 billion fortune thanks to his tenure at growth equity firm Summit Partners and, later, personal early-stage investments that paid off big. In an interview with Forbes, he said the fear of missing out is the biggest risk investors face today, and cautioned against getting swept up in the mass hysteria around a sector.

A rally in shares of software giant Oracle briefly propelled its chairman Larry Ellison to the second spot on Forbes' ranking of the wealthiest people on the planet on Friday, with his net worth reaching as high as $208.4 billion. But Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos retook the No. 2 spot as the day went on, and Oracle stock's gains pared.

Disney and DirecTV reached a crucial deal Saturday, bringing back college football broadcasts for 11.3 million DirecTV customers who lost access to Disney networks like ABC and ESPN after the cable provider and Disney battled over a distribution agreement at the start of the month. The new distribution deal will also make Disney streaming services and ESPN's upcoming standalone streaming service available in select DirecTV packages.

Rather than focusing on value alone, Forbes' new 25 Best Places To Enjoy Your Retirement list is all about the best spots for pursuing new or lifelong passions in the greater leisure hours that are at the heart of retirement. The list features locations like Asheville, North Carolina; Eugene, Oregon; Flagstaff, Arizona; and even the Big Apple.

United Airlines will equip its planes with free in-flight Wi-Fi using SpaceX's Starlink internet service next year, becoming the latest airline to offer complimentary internet service. United said it will start testing Starlink in early 2025 before expanding to more flights later in the year.

TOPLINE Etsy, the $6 billion arts and crafts e-commerce platform, hosts thousands of spells promising everything from untold wealth to cures for chronic depression, despite a near decade-long ban on the sale of ""metaphysical services.""

Sellers on the platform offer spells like ""Extreme Millionaire Lotto Spell"" ($13.13), ""Best Death Spell"" ($60.87), ""14th Dimensional Master Energy"" ($365.01), ""Wonderful Holiday With Family Spell"" ($19.01"") and ""Child Athlete Spell"" ($11.95). There are also ""Social Media Fame Spells"" ($2.88) and, predictably, too many penis enhancement spells to bother counting.

Etsy does not break out witchcraft and wizardry in its quarterly financials. But interviews with people who claim to practice it and some rough math suggest the platform has facilitated millions of dollars in spell sales. Etsy's own public data shows that some of its most popular spell sellers have made hundreds of thousands of dollars on tens of thousands of sales.

To say that Etsy, a company with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, has historically struggled to moderate its website is an understatement. It has been caught hosting deepfake pornography of female celebrities, counterfeit and mass-produced goods and AI-generated tripe. Earlier this year, following a widely publicized ban on sales of sex toys, Forbes found a proliferation of them two weeks later.

Most spells marketed on Etsy feature a disclaimer noting they are offered for entertainment purposes only, which provide them legal protection in most states, Charles McCrary, a professor of religious studies at Eckerd College in Florida, told Forbes. But it's hard not to view such spells as deceptions -- especially when Etsy exempts them from the platform's mediation system.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Etsy, a company with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, and a company that has always been known for selling artisanal handicrafts, has been found to have facilitated the sale of millions of dollars worth of purported 'spells,'"" says Forbes senior writer Cyrus Farivar. ""These include magical offerings to enhance body parts, but also to seek wealth and power. One expert told Forbes that these are 'modern day snake oil,' and can be financially harmful to those that purchase these items.""

In response to growing concerns about the grueling work culture in investment banking, JPMorgan and Bank of America are implementing new measures to curb excessive working hours for junior bankers. The changes follow the death of a bank employee earlier this year:

80 hours: The number of working hours JPMorgan is capping most junior investment bankers at per week

1 to 4: A new BofA tool allows junior bankers to indicate their workload capacity on a scale of 1 to 4

95 hours: A 2021 survey of a group of Goldman Sachs analysts revealed they had been working over 95-hour workweeks

The average net worth of American households surpassed $1 million for the first time in 2022, according to Federal Reserve data. A few key habits can help you become -- and stay -- a millionaire, like living below your means, focusing on how your money can work for you, and not letting status be the driving force behind your purchases. Raising independent children can also help ensure they're not relying on you later in life.

Traditional Savings Account Rates Today

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying teensy interest rates. That has changed, thanks to the Fed's campaign of interest rate hikes to combat inflation last year. But even though the Fed hasn't raised its rate since July 2023, consumer deposit yields remain high.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you land a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. That's the same as a week ago. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today

High-yield savings accounts generally pay much higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can nail down an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.26% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's the same as last week's APY.

How Often Do Savings Account Interest Rates Change?

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

How High Can Savings Rates Go?

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Methodology

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation.

Why Boards Are Focused On Human Capital Governance And Risk,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbremen/2024/09/16/why-boards-are-focused-on-human-capital-governance-and-risk/,2024-09-16T11:16:26Z,"More and more, effective boards are prioritizing their role in the oversight and governance of human capital. Their focus includes developments in labor markets, skill shortages, succession planning, retention, employee wellbeing, and costs, as well as in new technologies such as AI and quantum computing, and geopolitical risks. They view these efforts to represent a material component of effective business judgment and aligned with company strategy and creating competitive advantage.

Following the global pandemic and the ""Great Resignation,"" tightening labor markets along with inflation and recession concerns, as well as remote work and technological disruption, effective boards today view addressing people issues as fundamental to strong stewardship - how companies create and preserve long-term value.

A survey of global board members conducted by WTW and Nasdaq found that board members view human capital as a high-priority topic. WTW's 2024 Global Directors and Officers Survey Report also found that boards and executives see employee health and safety as a top organizational risk. More than 90% of S&P 100 companies have broadened their compensation committee's charter to include broader human capital management. This may include succession planning, leadership development, broad-based compensation and benefits programs, and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Human capital governance is now also a core element of the enterprise risk management (ERM) framework in a growing number of organizations.

With thanks to a collaboration with Directors & Boards and WTW's Don Delves and Ken Kuk, effective boards take the following actions regarding human capital governance:

1. Lead holistic and strategic human capital discussions - Effective boards are broad in their discussions of human capital without getting bogged down by an overwhelming amount of data or narrow topics that have caught media attention. They review human capital updates and scorecards from management asking key questions around context - such as historical trend and market benchmarks. They ask about connections to business priorities and whether there are material data gaps and what would it take to close them. They ensure management receives tangible and actionable feedback from the board. They encourage executives to vet materials cross-functionally in the organization and the c-suite before board and committee meetings.

2. Create clear accountabilities of the board's and committees' roles in oversight and governance of human capital - Effective boards clarify the board's role versus management's role and what human capital issues are dealt with at the committee level versus with the full board. Committee and board charters reflect these accountabilities, with formulated processes for the board's and management's partnership. Effective charters include a meaningful level of detail covered at the committee level on a regular basis while focusing full board deliberations on the most strategic human capital matters as appropriate. They also define accountabilities across committees for overlapping areas with audit and risk committees - for example human capital disclosure, human impact on cyber risks and broader human capital risks.

3. Consider human capital metrics in the context of performance, productivity, and risk - Effective boards focus on outcome-based metrics that evaluate how people contribute to the business, with metrics and reporting that are simple and contextualized. Such metrics demonstrate clear connection to key business priorities and align with the risk profile and growth ambitions of the organization. Metrics reflect the areas with the greatest risk exposure and materiality; some human capital risks may be considered worth taking as long as they deliver commensurate upside opportunity and are aligned with the business's risk tolerance. Effective board-level human capital dashboards comprise data such as workforce demographics, turnover, leadership succession plans, employee engagement, and snapshots of compensation and benefits programs. Increasingly, boards focus on talent management and development, skill gaps, pay and career equity, and/or employee wellbeing (financial, physical, emotional, social).

4. Involve the right stakeholders at the right time - Effective boards create regular touch points with the CHRO and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to align how people risks fit into the overall enterprise risk management framework. Prior to each committee meeting where human capital updates are presented, the CHRO reviews materials with appropriate c-suite peers (e.g., CFO, CRO, COO, Group Presidents) and then the CEO and CHRO review them with the committee chair to confirm management's narrative and objectives of the discussion.

5. Make time for the CHRO to meet regularly with the board - Effective boards conduct one-on-one conversations with the CHRO allowing for candid discussion about the organization's people strategy. These conversations reinforce the partnership between the board and management in advancing the company's talent strategy. Board members recognize that such conversations can be important complements to attendance at formal meetings to ensure the right conversations are happening in the right forum at the right time.

6. Always remember that the board's role is governance and oversight, not management and execution - Effective board members understand the business judgment rule presumes that directors make good-faith judgment in material corporate decisions in the best interests of the stakeholders to whom they owe fiduciary duties. Such legal protection to directors stems from the core principle that separation of roles between management and the board is a core tenet of effective corporate governance."
"Mortgage Rates Today: September 16, 2024 -- Rates Move Down",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-09-16-24/,2024-09-16T11:03:56Z,"Currently, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.60%, compared to 6.74% a week ago, according to Curinos.

For borrowers who want to pay off their home faster, the average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage is 5.71%, down 0.19 percentage point from the previous week.

Homeowners who want to lock in a lower rate by refinancing should compare their existing mortgage rate with current market rates to make sure it's worth the cost to refinance.

Today's average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.60%, which is 0.14 percentage point lower than last week.

The interest plus lender fees, called the annual percentage rate (APR), on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.61%.

To get an idea about how much you might pay in interest, consider that the current 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage of 6.60% on a $100,000 loan will cost $638 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. The total amount you'll pay in interest during the loan's lifespan is $129,798.

Today's 15-year mortgage (fixed-rate) is 5.71%, down 0.19 percentage point from the previous week. The same time last week, the 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.90%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.74%. It was the same last week.

A 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage with today's interest rate of 5.71% will cost $828 per month in principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage (not including taxes and insurance). In this scenario, borrowers would pay approximately $49,117 in total interest.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.71%. Last week, the average rate was 6.87%.

If you lock in today's rate of 6.71% on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage, you will pay $646 per month in principal and interest per $100,000 in financing. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,846, and you'd pay around $994,400 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The first step on your homebuying journey should be to calculate affordability. You'll want to find out how much you can afford based on things like income, debt and savings.

Here are a few important factors that go into home affordability:

Home loan borrowers can qualify for better mortgage rates by having good or excellent credit, maintaining a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and pursuing loan programs that don't charge mortgage insurance premiums or similar ongoing charges that increase the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).

Comparing rates from different mortgage lenders is an excellent starting point. You may also compare conventional, first-time homebuyer and government-backed programs like FHA and VA loans, which have different rates and fees.

For the most part, several economic factors influence the trajectory of rates for new home loans. The recent Federal Reserve rate hikes don't directly cause mortgage rates to rise but have indirectly caused the interest rates for many long-term loans to increase. Rates are more likely to decrease when the Fed pauses or decreases its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.

Further, the inflation rate and the general state of the economy directly impact interest rates. High inflation and a strong economy typically signal higher rates. Cooling consumer demand or inflation may help rates decrease."

Millennials have spent the majority of their adult lives haunted by the specter that they're doing worse than their parents. If true, this would be a tragic result for the more than 72 million Americans born between 1981 and 1996.

Thankfully, it's not.

While Millennials have endured their fair share of economic turbulence and hardships, including graduating into the worst economy since the Great Depression, they have managed to endure, and even prosper, especially in recent times.

It's time to shed this misbegotten Millennial stereotype.

The idea that Millennials are doing well might be surprising to you if you were born in 1988.

These now 36-year-olds had the misfortune of entering the workforce in 2009, as the unemployment rate was flirting with 10%, the stock market had just bottomed out and the housing sector was still reeling from its bubble bursting.

A few years into their career, they were still struggling.

In 2013, median income was a little more than $68,000 (in 2023 dollars) for those households helmed by someone between 25 and 34, per the Census. That was about $10,000 less (accounting for inflation) than a similar family in 2000.

But as the economy began to recover through the latter part of the decade, so did their paychecks.

Those between the age of 25 and 34 earned an average of $84,600 in 2023, while those between 35 and 44 took in nearly $101,000; both figures far outstripped what earlier generations earned at similar ages, even adjusting for inflation.

In the aftermath of the Great Recession, Millennials made less than earlier generations at a similar age. However, as the economy has recovered, so too have millennial earnings, so much so that they even out earn their parents. It's worth remembering, too, that earlier generations struggled with recessions in the early 1990s and 2000s.

Things got off to a rocky start for Millennials thanks to an abysmal housing market that cratered at the end of the 2000s and took years to recover. For instance, the median home sales price peaked at $257,400 in the beginning of 2007 and then didn't reach that level again until six years later.

Given the slowly convalescing labor market, it's not surprising that Millennials fell behind. For instance, the median net worth of households led by someone under 35 was just $13,000 in 2013, per the Federal Reserve, compared to $22,000 in 2004. Millennials were poorer than earlier generations at a similar age.

With time, though, Millennials' balance sheets improved dramatically.

Take housing.

Data from the Atlanta Fed Home Ownership Affordability Monitor showed that thanks to low interest rates and a growing economy, home prices were basically affordable, if not especially so, for most of the time between 2010 and 2020.

Moreover, the stock market has been on a tear since 2009, only letting up for a brief period during 2022. The S&P 500, for instance, has delivered an average annualized return of 11.80% over the past 15 years, according to Morningstar, boosting 401(k) balances.

The result is that Millennials (both older and younger) have more assets than their parents at a similar age.

Millennials, who comprise the largest share of homebuyers, have a higher net worth than earlier generations at a similar age as home prices, and the stock market, soared for much of the past 15 years. Even after starting from behind, a 2024 report by the St. Louis Fed found that Millennial wealth was ""37% above expectations"" based on the experiences of previous generations.

Millennials have had to deal with college costs, and subsequent debt, in a way that their parents just didn't.

The average yearly all-in cost for all 4-year institutions in 1980 was a little more than $12,200 (in 2022-2023 dollars), per the National Center for Educational Statistics, compared to about $29,200 in 2010.

In fact, it was about 240% (in constant dollars) more expensive to graduate from a four-year college in 2013 ($120,400) as it was to do so 30 years earlier ($50,400).

And millennials have the debt to show for it.

The average cumulative debt in the 2011-2012 school year for undergraduate borrowers at four-year institutions was about $33,000 (in 2022 dollars), according to the College Board, while 60% of graduates took out loans to pay for their college.

While this debt is real, it's manageable for most millennials. Only 7% of those with a college degree said they're behind on their student loan payments in the 2024 Federal Reserve Report on Economic Well-Being.

No one wants to start off their career with a big IOU, but conventional wisdom says that you should only borrow as much as you expect to earn once you enter the workforce. The median salary for those between 15 and 24 in 2023, per the Census, was $48,680, much more than the typical amount borrowed.

While most millennials had to take on debt to finance their education, the cost to do so has been reasonable for most borrowers. This is especially true given the low interest rates at the time the debt was taken on, and the fact that those with a college degree earn more and have better employment prospects. Moreover, the federal government allowed federal student loan borrowers to pause payments interest-free for more than three years between 2020 and 2023, freeing up borrowers to save their payments or spend them elsewhere.

There are, of course, millennials who are struggling.

It's not difficult to imagine that our person born in 1988 struggled to find gainful, rewarding employment for years after. Perhaps they missed out on affordable real estate prices in the latter half of the 2010s because they hadn't yet had time to build up savings for a down payment.

Perhaps they had to go to graduate school, taking on yet more debt, and had only established themselves in their career when the pandemic struck and they were laid off.

They've been able to scrape by with the help of friends and family, as well as plush Covid-era benefits, their 401(k) is negligible because they've never been at a job long enough to meaningfully save.

This story, or at least parts of it, isn't uncommon.

But it's not the experience of the typical Millennial who has seen their wages and net worth spike as the economy fully recovered from the Great Recession.

The typical Millennial enjoys higher wages, and a bigger net worth, than their parents did at a similar age.

Like generations before, Millennials have struggled through tough times. But they're no longer behind, and are instead, prospering."
"'The Worst Outcome' -- JPMorgan CEO Issues Stark U.S. Dollar Fed Inflation Warning As The Bitcoin Price Suddenly Crashes Under $60,000",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/16/the-worst-outcome-jpmorgan-ceo-issues-stark-us-dollar-fed-inflation-warning-as-the-bitcoin-price-suddenly-crashes-under-60000/,2024-09-16T10:51:21Z,"Bitcoin has dived over the last 24 hours, with the price crashing under $60,000 per bitcoin as the market braces for an ""inevitable"" bitcoin price crash.

The bitcoin price has swung between highs of $65,000 and lows of almost $50,000 over the last month, with the world's largest asset manager BlackRock issuing a serious volatility warning.

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk stokes fears of a U.S. dollar ""total collapse,"" the chief executive of Wall Street giant JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, has warned the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar isn't ""out of the woods"" yet.

""I would say the worst outcome is stagflation -- recession, higher inflation ... I wouldn't take it off the table,"" Dimon said at a fall conference from the Council of Institutional Investors in, New York in comments reported by CNBC.

Stagflation is a name given by economists to an economy that's hit by both prices spiraling higher and low growth, and is generally believed to be a difficult economic situation to recover from.

According to Dimon, inflationary forces such as higher deficits that add to the spiraling U.S. debt of $35 trillion and increased infrastructure spending will pile pressure on the U.S. economy.

""They're all inflationary, basically in the short run, the next couple of years,"" Dimon said. ""So, it's hard to look at [it] and say, 'Well, no, we're out of the woods.' I don't think so.""

Dimon's inflation warning comes after Elon Musk shared a $36 trillion ""by the end of 2024"" warning over the spiraling interest payments on the huge U.S. national debt pile.

The bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last month as the market braces for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time in the post-pandemic era, with traders overwhelmingly betting on either a 25 basis point or 50 basis point interest rate cut.

The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates when officials gather for the two-day policy meeting on September 17, potentially signalling a new cycle of cheaper borrowing and fresh liquidity.

However, weaker than expected U.S. job data triggered a bitcoin price crash earlier this month, with the slowing jobs market fueling fears the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates and could have tipped the economy into recession.

""The first Fed rate cut still may not be the deepest, but the central bank is likely to signal a quick desire to head to a neutral policy setting, which therefore could include a 50 basis point rate cut before the year's end,"" analysts with venture capital company Tagus Capital wrote in emailed comments, adding previous Fed interest rate cuts have been bullish indicators for the bitcoin price and wider crypto market.

""Overall, this is likely to lead to a recovery in U.S. dollar liquidity and historically digital asset cycles closely follow such liquidity cycles."""
Why Did Roku Stock Rise 6% In A Day?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/16/why-did-roku-stock-soar-6/,2024-09-16T10:01:40Z,"Roku stock gained nearly 6% on Thursday and has climbed 11% over the past week. What's driving this upward momentum? One factor is an analyst upgrade by Wolfe Research, which raised its rating on Roku stock from Hold to Buy, anticipating stronger connected TV ad sales and improved monetization. Additionally, inflation in the U.S. has cooled, with the Consumer Price Index rising just 2.5% year-over-year in August. This marks the lowest increase in nearly three years. Easing inflation should pave the way for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve as early as next week, a development that could boost tech stocks such as Roku.

Roku's operational and financial performance has also improved a bit. Over Q2, Roku's revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $968 million while operating losses were reduced to $71 million. Key metrics such as streaming hours (up 20%) and total platform accounts (up 14%) also strengthened, while device sales jumped 39%, helping to increase Roku's installed base. The Roku Channel, the company's proprietary streaming offering, has also gained in terms of engagement, with streaming hours up nearly 75% year-over-year with the offering emerging as one of the most popular free, ad-supported streaming offerings in the U.S. This channel is expected to drive higher-margin advertising revenue in the long run. Despite these improving results, Roku stock remains down over 15% year-to-date, potentially creating an attractive opportunity for investors.

Despite the recent gains, Roku stock remains down considerably from levels of over $450 per share in 2021. Moreover, the decrease in ROKU stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, and 125% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ROKU face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Roku stock trades at just a little over 2.5x estimated 2024 revenue, which is well below the double-digit multiples the stock traded at in 2021. That said, Roku faces some challenges, too. Roku's streaming service distribution business, which facilitates the subscription process for streaming services and earns commissions for the same, is seeing some headwinds as more streaming services, including Netflix, focus on selling more affordable, ad-supported plans as customers look for better value in a mixed economic environment. Moreover, Roku has to increasingly compete for advertising-related revenue with big technology players including Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet in the video market. We value Roku stock at about $67, which is slightly below the current market price. See our analysis on Roku Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details on what's driving our price estimate for the stock."
Mortgage Rates 16 September 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-16-09-24/,2024-09-16T08:40:16Z,"If you require any personal advice, please seek such advice from an independently qualified financial advisor.

The Bank of England cut interest rates on 1 August from 5.25% to 5%, marking the first reduction in interest rates since March 2020. Bank Rate had remained at 5.25% since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when it stood at just 0.1%.

The next interest rate announcement by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will be on 19 September at noon.

The plateau in interest rate rises, and more recent fall, had been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

While the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation edged up in July to 2.2%, it had been at the Bank's of England's target of 2% for the two preceding months. The latest rise was largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Cooling inflation had already prompted lenders to lower mortgage costs but the August Bank Rate reduction triggered further cuts, with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 5%, for example. However, it remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.67%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.55% and 4.24% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 4.12%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 4.17% and 3.77% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.39%, with the best in this category priced at 5.24%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stand at 7.13% today, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Halifax's latest house price report (published 6 September) showed that average property values in August were 4.3% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.3% when compared to July. Halifax, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in August at £292,505 - up from £291,268 in July.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 14 August) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, reported a similar story. It found that average house prices for June were 2.7% higher compared to 12 months before, with a monthly rise of 0.5%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in June slightly lower than Halifax, at £288,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."

The price of gold today, as of 9:07am, was £1,960.44 per ounce. That's down 0.15% on yesterday's closing price of £1,963.32.

Compared to last week, the price of gold is up 3.07%, and it's up 2.38% from one month ago.

The 52-week gold price high is £1,965.06, while the 52-week gold price low is £1,838.91.

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation."
Profit From The Fed's Next Move?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/15/profit-from-the-feds-next-move/,2024-09-16T03:19:00Z,"We believe Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve's next move will not be pivotal. There is an opportunity to step back, see the bigger picture -- and potentially take advantage of that.

Specifically, the Fed's upcoming move from the two-day Sep 17th and 18th, 2024 meeting, could go one of three ways.

[1] Reduce rates by 25 bps, with a weak statement about future cuts

[2] Reduce rates by 25 bps, with a strong statement about more cuts to come

[3] Reduce rates by 50 bps

Option 1 is a less likely scenario right now. Option 2 and 3 will be cheered -- in spirit and action.

Markets won't respond well to Option 1

We'll see a moderate drop in S&P and other major indices, likely less than or around 5% levels, and hopefully not more than 10% levels -- and very unlikely a market crash. However, this can easily deepen in the near-term if additional weaker jobs reports show up, or companies report weak Q3 earnings in October -- especially if, in addition, inflation continues to show upward bias. In either case, we believe such downswings, if they happen, present a buying opportunity (how low can stocks and ETFs/indices go -- from SPY vs. AAPL, to pharma giant Merck, which stocks dropped most during past market crashes?). At the least, we believe investors will be better off not being too reactive.

Why is that?

Here's the thing. Irrespective of what the Fed does as part of their next move, there is little doubt about one thing: this is a data-driven Fed. If they make a smaller 25 bps cut to start, and unemployment data continues to show deterioration, they'll make bigger moves. This Fed has managed inflation, no, a monstrous 8%+ inflation, and restored price stability to 2-3% levels, without killing the job market. They did it extremely well. The Fed has ""0"" interest in messing with the success they've seen. Chair Powell knows well, now -- at this juncture -- the risk to job growth and unemployment is real, the risk has shifted -- it is no longer weighted towards a runaway-inflation, instead unemployment growth is the risk. He said as much in the last meeting.

Point is -- even if the first move is a 25 bps cut, if, and as more data comes in, the Fed will act with 50 bps cuts, and maybe larger cuts. The Fed will do whatever is needed to ensure a soft-landing.

The Fed's on your side. Period. If you agree, then isn't this, and more so if there is a drop in markets, the time to buy?

So now is the time for investors -- to invest in technology, infrastructure, better health outcomes -- better protection and preparation for the next Covid? Sure, invest in Nvidia, other AI stocks -- SMCI (what's a better AI stock SMCI or Nvidia?), invest in Lilly's weight loss drug's success, and DNA/CRISPR tech, Moderna, the new infrastructure projects, Google and Waymo's self-driving efforts, and GE, and everything in the middle? And if you don't like the rollercoaster, invest in the S&P 500, or, learn how the select 30 stocks that make up Trefis High Quality portfolio strategy has outperformed the S&P 500 -- consistently. HQ has seen >80% return since its Sep 2020 inception, Hint: it's simple, and right there in the HQ strategy's performance metrics -- not just size, but defensible revenue growth, and margins, but companies with strong balance sheets, and other quality criteria.

So, is anything to be feared at this time? While in the medium-to-long term things should do well, near-term volatility is likely to persist. Right now, we see this mostly due to the geopolitical unrest, the middle-eastern Gaza conflict, Ukraine/Russia war, and their potential for accompanying destruction. Why? Well, for one, wars are like that. They're an extreme of human expression -- creates more opportunity for results in the long tail. By definition, more volatility, less control, more uncertainty -- more risk. If that's how you see risk. Let's not forget, there is an upside as those conflicts wane and normalcy returns. Not just a psychological upside, but a real flow of goods and services as supply chains become less risky, shorter paths to trade, reliability, and trust develop.

Though it's good to be hopeful, the overhang from wars and conflict isn't going away, not anytime soon. On the flip-side, markets seem to have settled-in with these conflicts. And things can get better.

The other risk -- and always is -- is default on loans. All market crashes happen because someone can't pay back their loans (5 largest market crashes compared). For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while, Covid's work-from-home gift was a big curse for the Retail and Office real-estate parts (big variety in real-estate sector). In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real-estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates, and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break, though that hasn't happened -- and with Fed rates finally on the downtrend, it's less likely. Finally, there's consumer defaults -- credit card, auto loans -- especially credit card loans. That makes the financial sector -- banks like JPM, Citi, and BofA, with large credit card books, vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). Again, we see this risk only as a transient -- because we believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to create a soft-landing.

There is something else. With rates as high as they are -- the Fed has even more power. There is a lot of room to cut rates, and release more liquidity if things go south. They can do a 100 bps cut. Power to release more money if the economy needs a shot for some reason, for any reason.

We believe, on balance, though the short term is likely to be volatile - there is a higher chance of more favorable market conditions in the medium term, and that's good for investors.

We've developed Trefis strategies to take advantage of such opportunities, while carefully managing risk in developing our Trefis portfolio strategies."

You'll want to determine what kind of coping strategies work best for you. Here's what to consider.

Unfortunately, plenty of people are dealing with challenges. In fact, among 32,000 people across 28 countries, 88% say they fear job loss, 73% are worried about inflation, 73% are concerned about climate change, 75% worry about hackers, 73% are anxious about nuclear war and 61% fear an information war, according to Edelman's Trust Barometer Global Report.

In addition, 84% of all employees said they were stressed, and 98% of Gen Z respondents said they felt burned out, according to a survey by Cigna,

Stress has huge impacts on how you feel and how you function. Fully 27% of people said they were so stressed they had trouble functioning on most days, and 62% of Gen Z and Millennial women and 51% of Gen Z and Millennial men said they were completely overwhelmed by stress. All this is based on a survey of over 3,000 people by Stress in America.

In the face of anxieties, many recommend mindfulness. And mindfulness is when you're able to stay focused in the present and be fully in the moment -- with openness, curiosity and non-judgement. Mindfulness is trending today, and for good reason. When you're mindful, there are positive effects on your mental health overall, according to a new study published in the British Journal of Health Psychology.

Interestingly however, if you're going through chronic stress, especially in your work, mindfulness may work against you, based on a study featured in the journal of Stress & Health.

First, it can be tricky to stay present, adding to the demands you're placing on yourself. Second, mindfulness may keep you mired in your problems and exacerbate your experience of the stressful situation you're in the middle of.

On the other hand, hope is forward-looking and inherently future-focused -- so it may be a better strategy.

In the Stress & Health study, when people were more hopeful, they also reported greater feelings of happiness. This wasn't the case with those who were mindful. Hope was also correlated with greater levels of engagement and lower levels of distress or tension.

On a related note, optimism is also associated with an 11%-15% longer lifespan -- even controlling for age, education, alcohol, diet and exercise. This was based on a long-term study of over 70,000 by Boston University.

And optimism was also linked with better job performance and job satisfaction in research published in the Prabandhan Indian Journal of Management.

So how can you cultivate hope? There are five tactics that work best.

Gratitude helps you focus on what you have -- fostering a sense of satisfaction and abundance. Gratitude can help you nurture both hope and optimism, because it reminds you of what's working, what's going well and what you already possess. All of this provides a firm foundation for looking toward the future.

Pro tip: Gratitude tends to be most impactful when you make it a daily ritual. For example, when you get out of bed in the morning or go to bed at night, reflect on what you're grateful for.

In addition, gratitude has the biggest benefits when you focus on being grateful for relationships, challenges, opportunities to learn, experiences and the like. It tends to be less impactful when you're grateful for material possessions.

Another way to stay hopeful is to manage your expectations. If you plan that things will be perfect, you'll be perpetually disappointed and stressed about all you're not achieving. On the other hand, when your expectations are both positive and realistic, you'll experience greater satisfaction -- which will in turn keep you hopeful and motivated to keep going.

Also know that you'll have ebbs and flows in life. A stress-free, problem-free life isn't realistic. If you're not failing sometimes, you're probably not trying hard enough -- and if you're not happy every moment, it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Be realistic in knowing that stress is part of life, and you'll have ups as well as downs.

Another way to harvest hope is to think long term. First, reflect on what's most important to you and set goals for where you want to go. Keeping a longer time horizon in mind can help you get past the small impediments that you're likely to encounter.

The tough customer will be a memory in a couple years and the stressful team conflict you're going through probably won't be on your radar by this time next year.

You'll also stay more hopeful when you have confidence in your ability to grow, learn and improve. With a static mindset, if you have a setback, you may conclude that you're not smart enough or capable enough. But with a growth mindset, you know you can always get better -- working to improve your skills, your actions or your execution to achieve the ends you want.

Also remember that tough times help you build your resilience muscles. Post traumatic growth is a situation where you learn through trauma and have new focus on what's most important, who you can rely on and on your own expanded capabilities. While you wouldn't purposely choose difficult situations, you can use them to grow and improve.

An additional way to stay hopeful is to spend more time around people who are positive and optimistic themselves.

Of course, you appreciate your friends who are more critical or play devil's advocate, but choose to spend the majority of time around people who energize you and motivate you to think hard, look forward and dream big.

Mindfulness has a place in a healthy life, of course. But in situations of stress, consider cultivating hope, because it is a proven way to get through the lows on the way to great experiences."
Ohio Senate candidate rips 'depraved' politicians for Springfield migrant crisis: Citizens 'pay the price',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-senate-candidate-rips-depraved-politicians-for-springfield-migrant-crisis-citizens-pay-price,2024-09-15T19:17:45Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno is blasting ""depraved"" politicians for the migrant crisis in Springfield, Ohio, that he says shows elected Democrats have ""forgotten"" they ""work for the American people.""

""Let's start with we don't even know how many Haitian immigrants have been brought into Springfield, Ohio,"" businessman Bernie Moreno, running as a Republican against Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, told Fox News Digital.

""That's problem number one, and number two is why on earth are we bringing that number of people into a small community like Springfield, where they don't have the infrastructure, they don't have the health system, they don't have the educational system and to get to the place where they do it would cost tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars.""

Moreno continued, ""We have incredible priorities here in America. We have people in need, American citizens that need housing, American citizens that are struggling because of high inflation caused by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Why on earth are we taking precious resources from the American taxpayers and using it to benefit foreign nationals? That's the real question to Springfield that's not being answered.""

SPRINGFIELD RESIDENT SAYS ROADS ARE LIKE 'ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK' AFTER HAITIAN MIGRANTS OVERRUN RURAL TOWN

Springfield, Ohio, has garnered national headlines in recent weeks over an influx of tens of thousands of Haitian migrants into the town of 60,000, where residents say the infrastructure doesn't exist to care for them all and that crime has been an increasing issue.

""It's like living in a dystopian nightmare,"" Springfield resident Diana Daniels told ""Fox & Friends"" on Thursday. ""You hope you wake up and it's 2019 again, and then you realize it's 2024, and it's the same thing over and over again, day after day. It's hard sometimes to get up in the morning and hear residents that I've known for years struggle. This is a paycheck-to-paycheck... kind of town... working class. The citizens that depend on our social services like health care, the Rocking Horse [Community Health Center], going down to the Social Security office for benefits are waiting in line, and they're not getting the services they need.""

Moreno told Fox News Digital that Brown and Biden, who he called ""two 50-year career politicians,"" have ""forgotten they work for the American people.""

HAITIAN REFUGEES 'DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAWS,' FORMER LAWMAKER SAYS AMID FATAL WRECK, CULTURAL CLASHES

""Elections come down to whose side you're on and are you on the side of Haiti and Haitians and people suffering all over the world, which clearly we all empathize with, or are you on the side of Americans, American workers, American families, who are seeing their costs of health care go up dramatically, who are seeing their taxes go up, who are seeing their insurance prices go up, who are seeing their grocery bills go up, and what are you doing about that?""

Moreno added, ""You're certainly not helping by bringing 5% of the population of this poor country to America to clash two cultures together and land in a place like Springfield, Ohio, where the American citizens there are deprived of the very benefits that they're supposed to get.""

Moreno echoed Daniels' concerns and explained that residents who are ""entitled"" to use the resources they have paid into are ""standing in line behind Haitian immigrants.""

SPRINGFIELD PASTORS SPEAK OUT ON HAITIAN REFUGEE CHALLENGES: 'THE SUFFERING IS REAL'

""They shouldn't even be in this country in the first place,"" Moreno said. ""That's ultimately what is unfolding and why this story matters so much, because this is genuinely the story of America. Do we want leaders in elected office in Washington, D.C., like President Trump, like what I'll do, like JD Vance, who put America first? Or do you want political leaders that have been there forever? These career serial politicians put the interests of foreign nationals first. That's ultimately what this election comes down to.""

Moreno, who immigrated to the United States from Colombia as a child, told Fox News Digital that his fellow legal immigrants are ""sick and tired"" of this ""culture that rewards people for skipping the line"" and getting ""preferential treatment for whatever reason.""

""For example, temporary protected status, operative word 'temporary,' is supposed to be given to people who are here who have an emergency in their home country and need to stay for a few months,"" Moreno said.

""Instead, we're using that to make people stay here permanently. That skips the line from the millions of people who want to come to this country. Why are we giving preferential treatment to Haiti? There's suffering all over the world: India, Africa, my home country of Colombia. There's suffering everywhere. Why are we giving preferential treatment to certain countries and not others? And the answer is because you have special interest groups that pay off these politicians, that fund nonprofits, that pay huge salaries to the CEOs and it's all about money and the people who pay the price and the citizens of the people in Springfield, Ohio.""

Moreno also took issue with prominent Democrats and celebrities who he says have not taken the issue seriously.

""Then you have depraved politicians like Sherrod Brown that hang out with their Hollywood celebrity buddies like John Legend, who from his multimillion-dollar mansion in a bathrobe, by the way, talks about how the people in Springfield, Ohio, should be welcoming,"" Moreno said.

""Why doesn't he house them? Why don't these migrants go to Beverly Hills and live there 16 or 18 per two-bedroom or three-bedroom-home? And why don't his kids go to school with these migrants that don't speak a word of English, that their culture is very different than ours because, of course, they're the elites of this country that want the rest of us to have to live with the results of their ridiculous policies.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Sen. Brown and the White House but did not receive a response."
"JD Vance accuses CNN's Dana Bash of giving 'multiple choice answers' to Harris, Walz during contentious clash",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jd-vance-accuses-cnns-dana-bash-giving-multiple-choice-answers-harris-walz-during-contentious-clash,2024-09-15T17:19:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN's Dana Bash and JD Vance clashed on Sunday during a contentious interview as the GOP vice presidential candidate accused Bash of giving Gov. Tim Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris ""multiple choice answers"" during her interview with them in August, as well as letting the vice president ""coast.""

""Dana, would you like to ask me questions and then let me answer them or would you like to debate me on these topics?"" Vance asked, after repeatedly insisting his constituents in Springfield, Ohio, were the ones who told him migrants were ""eating the pets.""

The interview focused on the claim, which Donald Trump also honed in on during the ABC News debate on Tuesday. The former president claimed Haitian migrants were eating cats and dogs, though Ohio officials have said there were no credible reports of such behavior.

""I noticed that when you have Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, you gave them multiple choice answers to the questions that you asked, and you allow them to answer the questions. I'm happy to be here to talk about policy, but if you're going to interrupt me every single time that I open my mouth, then why am I even doing this?"" Vance continued.

SPRINGFIELD RESIDENT SAYS ROADS ARE LIKE 'ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK' AFTER HAITIAN MIGRANTS OVERRUN RURAL TOWN

""I think that if Kamala Harris and Tim Walz were making unsubstantiated claims that had racist undertones about people eating dogs and cats, I would, and they didn't answer the questions about that, then I would have similar interactions with them. As you know, I am very grateful that you come on the show, as I am for other Republicans. But this is something that you're hearing from constituents. I did a lot of reporting. I've talked to people in Ohio over the weekend, and they're really worried about these claims,"" Bash responded.

""The policies, yes, I am agreeing with you, that what I heard is that there is concern that these migrants, there's a lot of them and the integration isn't being done fast enough and well enough, and that's a totally legitimate conversation,"" she added.

Thousands of Haitians have arrived in Springfield since the COVID-19 pandemic, and residents have been pointing to an uptick in crime, mayhem and car crashes due to the massive influx of new residents. In a town of 58,000 people, about 20,000 Haitians have arrived, according to city officials.

Bash pressed Vance on their claim again and insisted the media did not start reporting on the impact the migrants have had on Springfield until he and Trump brought it up.

""The evidence is the firsthand account of my constituents who are telling me that this happened and, by the way, I've been trying to talk about the problems in Springfield for months and the American media ignored it. There was a congressional hearing just last week of Angel Moms who lost children because Kamala Harris let criminal migrants into this country who then murdered their children. The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I start talking about cat memes. If I have to, I mean, create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast,"" Vance said.

He further accused Bash of not pushing back on Harris for casting the deciding vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which he argued ""is why a lot of Americans can't afford food and housing.""

Bash pressed further on his comment about him creating stories, asking him again about the story's accuracy.

Vance shot back and argued the claim came from his constituents.

""I say that we're creating a story, meaning we're creating the American media focusing on it. I didn't create 20,000 illegal migrants coming into Springfield thanks to Kamala Harris' policies. Her policies did that, but yes, we created the actual focus that allowed the American media to talk about this story and the suffering caused by Kamala Harris' policies,"" Vance responded."
NFL's salary ceiling is made of banknotes  --  Patrick Mahomes and Brock Purdy will smash it,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-salary-ceiling-made-banknotes-patrick-mahomes-brock-purdy-set-smash,2024-09-15T17:08:41Z,"The NFL's salary ceiling isn't made of glass. It's made of paper -- more specifically, it's comprised of crisp, new, glorious banknotes, which also happen to emit a siren song that trills ""come and get me.""

It's being sung to Patrick Mahomes and Brock Purdy, dueling signal callers in the last Super Bowl. It's already made its cry to Kyler Murray, Jalen Hurts, Lamar Jackson, Justin Herbert, Trevor Lawrence, Joe Burrow and Jordan Love, all of whom have come to visit the ceiling and found it to be a flimsy old barrier.

NFL numerology is a wild business, one that loosely follows the laws of inflation, the quirks of psychology, the principles of marketing and the cruelties of hope, but more than anything is tied inextricably to the cutthroat nature of supply and demand.

The progression of the timeline following the status bestowed upon pro football's highest earner is the simplest way to keep up and understand it, and a milestone of some note was reached in the hours ahead of last Sunday's action, when the Dallas Cowboys locked in Dak Prescott at a nice, round $60 million per year, for four seasons.

[Tom Brady: How Dak Prescott's leadership saved the day in Cowboys' win over Browns]

Did we say milestone? Stepping stone would be more accurate. For no one who has been paying any kind of attention to this phenomenon heard Prescott's number and envisaged it as a roadblock to what follows. Like every other deal that's been done over the last few years, it now represents a juicy jumping point for grateful agents to catapult from in search of even higher figures.

Where next? Perhaps not quite ""to the moon,"" to borrow phraseology from that GameStop stock market circus, but definitely in some sort of stratospheric direction.

For now though, while there looks to be a temporary lull in the wealth-bestowing action, let's try to learn from the role Aaron Rodgers has played in the process.

When Rodgers became the NFL's best-paid player in history in April 2013, he began collecting an annual sum of $22 million, then seen as a whopper of a deal for a transformational player, entering his prime, already a Super Bowl winner and a league MVP, and a cut above everyone except Tom Brady.

It took three offseasons for that monetary mark to be broken, and even then only incrementally, Joe Flacco creeping it up to $22,133,000 with the Baltimore Ravens.

Jump ahead to March 2022, and Rodgers again set the market, this time becoming the first player in football history to top $50 million in yearly earnings. That amount, given out by the Green Bay Packers after Rodgers cruised past age 38, was enough to impress even an NFL audience long since jaded by stupendous amounts of reported loot.

Yet in far less time than it took Rodgers' $22 million mark to edge up to something fractionally higher, his $50 million line in the sand has been washed into insignificance. Yes, Prescott is now at $60 million, but meanwhile, the record was busted over and over again.

Eight deals in the $50 million-plus range got done, most of them featuring the list of names mentioned above. Even Love, Rodgers' former backup, whose drafting set off so much of the Rodgers angst before he eventually wound up on the Jets, spent a minute in a tie for record earner.

The importance of a QB has never been greater, though it sometimes gets lost that they also need to be in the right spot to shine. Week 1 was described by FS1's Colin Cowherd as ""reclamation day"" for derided QBs, highlighting the winning performances of Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Derek Carr and Geno Smith, all well down the positional pay scale.

""It proves how valuable snaps, experience, time on task is at a quarterback,"" Cowherd added, on ""The Herd."" ""It also proves how important the fit is. That's the best I've ever seen Derek Carr play."" Carr and the New Orleans Saints visit Prescott and the Cowboys on Sunday (1 p.m. ET on FOX and the FOX Sports app), with Brady calling the action in his second official appearance in the booth.

Having a serviceable QB is perceived as being absolutely vital to a healthy franchise, but bear in mind that six Super Bowls in a row have featured one on a pittance of a rookie contract, though those cheapskate deals have only realized one win in the big game -- Mahomes five years ago.

Mahomes since signed his ""forever"" contract that lasts through 2031 but has had it reworked, and also has an agreement in place to revisit it with Chiefs ownership following the 2026 campaign.

Elsewhere, what gets interesting now is that not only has a trend been set where each deal feels it has to be a bit better than the last -- otherwise you're admitting that someone else has a better QB than you -- but that blips and aberrations don't matter a jot.

The Cleveland Browns overpaid for Deshaun Watson, which now shapes as a giant mistake in multiple ways.

""The Browns are in such -- of their own doing -- a terrible spot,"" ""First Things First"" host Nick Wright told Cowherd. ""This is without question the worst transaction in NFL history.""

But it didnt serve as much of a cautionary tale, with the market exploding after Watson's fully-loaded, five-year, $230 million pact. You wouldn't describe Prescott's new contract as a mistake, but Dallas might have gotten a discount had it been done sooner, taking their usual route of waiting and stalling and then paying a lot.

The inflated figure, meaning that the NFL has a $60 million player quicker than it might have, won't factor in either. It is the new benchmark, a milestone, a stepping stone, call it what you will -- it is just where we're at.

[QB Stock Market Week 2: Is Baker Mayfield actually good?]

We are also at a stage where simple psychology and its nuances of numbers come into play. As figures get bigger, so do the jumps. Do you think Purdy's agent will be angling for $61 million to slide beyond Prescott? No chance -- why not start negotiating at 70 and hope to settle at 65, especially if Prescott still hasn't reached a Super Bowl by then, and even more so if Purdy gets to another one.

Truth be told, we are off and running towards $100 million. It took only six years for the high mark to double from Matt Ryan's $30 million in the summer of 2018 to Prescott's development. By that rationale, well, you get the idea.

Sometimes it's worth it. Inevitably, there are going to be deals done that turn into financial black holes, like Watson's, for instance.

As for Mahomes, if he continues down this route, you could pay the guy that $100 million, and he'd still be worth every penny. The way things are going, in a couple of summers, the Chiefs might."
"A Failure To ""Read The Room"" - How Boeing And The Machinists Fell Into The Strike",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerroldlundquist/2024/09/15/a-failure-to-read-the-roomhow-boeing-and-the-machinists-fell-into-the-strike/,2024-09-15T13:51:29Z,"The International Association of Machinists (IAM) on Friday overwhelmingly voted to reject the offer that had been accepted by their leadership and Boeing of a 25 percent pay raise and improvement in cost sharing on health care and retirement benefits. As outlined in the Forbes story ""Will A Union Strike Be the Next Boeing Challenge?"" on August 31, it is crucial that Boeing raise production rates to begin to pull out of the nosedive it has been in since January when a replacement plug blew out of a door frame on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737, nearly causing a fatal catastrophe.

The IAM had been asking for a 40 percent raise in pay tied to a contract last negotiated in 2008 and extended twice. During that intervening period, the commercial aircraft industry went through a ""super cycle"" where cheap money and growing demand for air travel caused aircraft orders to balloon for both Boeing and Airbus, the two largest manufacturers. Not only did the workers feel they missed out on the good times, but the party ended abruptly with the pandemic in early 2020, causing air travel to not recover for several years. Adding insult to injury, Boeing conducted a series of share buybacks during this period which rewarded investors and management, but not the frontline workers.

Against this backdrop, a new CEO arrived at Boeing a month ago (after a lengthy search) who understood the criticality of keeping the lines moving. In any union negotiation there are not two, but three parties at play - the company, the union and the union leadership. The company speaks with one voice, as it is typically a hierarchical organization, and CEO's are also not typically elected by their subordinates. However, in a union, they are - and there's the rub.

The union voted by a nearly unanimous tally - 96 percent - to strike, indicating a serious failure to understand the vehemence with which the union workers expected a fulfillment of their demands. Understandably, union leadership ran from behind the ranks to get back in front of the parade. Jon Holden, the President of the IAM District representing the majority of the striking workers, stated belatedly, ""We'll push this company farther than they ever thought they'd go.""

Boeing clearly relied on what the IAM leadership was saying a week ago to be sufficient, but now both parties are back at the table trying to achieve an agreement. It is the worst of both worlds because neither side can really afford a work stoppage, and anger can run ahead of rationality. However, having seen the unanimity of the vote, Boeing has little choice but to settle near what the union ask is, and union management will be hoping they can be reelected on the tails of that fulfillment.

A broader question is how did so many industries get into this dilemma? Hollywood endured a lengthy writers and actors strike which shut down production for over a year. Earlier this year, auto OEM's granted huge concessions to labor in an attempt to catch up wages that had flatlined for over a decade during a period of high inflation.

The answer is that these are industries where control is nested in a handful of entities. In commercial aircraft manufacturing, it is a duopoly with two regional players. In Hollywood, it is a collection of studios, and in automotive, a few OEM's. Furthermore, the industries are supported by large, distributed networks of suppliers - parts manufacturers and laborers in the aerospace and automotive industries, and talent in Hollywood. None of these networks can ""greenlight"" a project, so power flows to the top.

And automotive has taken that power to the limit, squeezing fractions of a penny for components from their supply chain. Many fear that aerospace is heading quickly in the same direction. It is striking to consider that the union demands will only bring wages for those assembling aircraft to an average of $20 an hour - something on par with delivery drivers or baristas in labor constrained locations. Boeing has struggled with quality which it attributes in part to the turnover and lack of training. It is clear that things have to improve.

Boeing's debt was downgraded to near ""junk"" status by Wells Fargo last week and Moody's is reviewing their rating. For a company with $46 Billion in net debt, such moves are very costly. The cost of a strike to Boeing is estimated to be between $1 and $3 Billon depending on its length. And striking workers are currently without a paycheck for at least two weeks when strike pay would start only at approximately one third of their full time pay.

The Boeing 737 was originally designed in the 1960's long before the computer aided manufacturing, automation and robotics of the present age, and is therefore highly labor intensive. Given Boeing's financial state and blessed with nine years of production backlog - which is key to survival - it is not hard to forecast the outcome of the stalemate."
Fed Rate Cut This Week: How Deep?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/15/fed-rate-cut-this-week-how-deep/,2024-09-15T11:08:10Z,"After a rough previous week for the stocks and the Magnificent 7, a positive update from NVIDIA regarding their next-generation artificial intelligence chip provides some positive mojo. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), were sharply higher on the week and are about 9% below their early July highs. Year-to-date, the Magnificent 7 dominated all others and helped drive the S&P 500 returns well above the gains from the smaller capitalization stocks.

This week will be dominated by the decision from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, September 18. While a rate cut is a virtual certainty, the magnitude of the cut and its possible impact are still uncertain.

Futures pricing assumes a cut to short-term interest rates of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the September meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut.

The U.S. economy remains resilient, bolstering the argument for a smaller or no cut. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is 2.5%.

On the other side of the coin, the job market has softened. While the unemployment rate remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Despite the report being released with a significant lag, the U.S. job openings (JOLTS) data can help gauge the tightness or softness of the labor market. Job openings have fallen precipitously and have reached levels more consistent with a normalized market. One caution in interpreting this data is that it is hard to know how many open positions are phantom jobs with no real opportunity for employment. Still, one should assume that the actual number of openings is lower than the headline.

Last week, the August consumer inflation (CPI) report reflected a 2.5% year-over-year growth rate, which was as expected and below July's 2.9%. The annualized growth rate of the last three months moved slightly higher but showed a benign short-term inflation trend at 1.2%.

The core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, was as expected at 3.2% year-over-year and unchanged from the previous month. Primarily driven by housing costs, the month-over-month core reading was higher than expected, and the annualized growth rate of the last three months rose to 2.4%. This unanticipated firming in core and producer prices (PPI) last week could remind the Fed that inflation pressures remain, making a 25 basis point cut this week's most likely course of action.

The real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate illustrates that the Fed's monetary policy is very restrictive. Though the Fed has not changed short-term interest rates since July 2023, monetary policy has become more stringent as the inflation rate falls. Looking back on the Fed's last successful soft landing of the economy in 1995, the real Fed Funds rate was similar to current levels before rate cuts began.

One could argue that the lower interest rate sensitivity of the economy following the ultra-low yields in the wake of COVID and the elevated real Fed Funds rate level should favor a 50 (0.50%) basis point cut to increase the odds of a positive outcome.

While in seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended up in recession, stocks have usually been higher in the twelve months after the cuts started, as discussed in depth last week.

Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction.

Based on market expectations and current economic data, the base case should be a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other. Still, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing, especially given the lessons of history. If a recession does occur, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets since earnings estimates and current valuation point to a low probability of recession being priced in currently. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should add some stability to portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. With bond yields back to offering a reasonable return over expected inflation, history would indicate that high-quality bonds should provide some cushion in an economic downturn.

At the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, investors should expect a 25 basis point cut to short-term interest rates. The Fed's economic projections and Chair Powell's comments will be scrutinized for clues as to the future path of cuts. A half percentage point cut remains well within the range of possibilities due to solid arguments in favor. Still, the relative resilience of the economy and the recent core inflation data make it less likely. Given the atypical economic cycle associated with COVID and the Fed easing this tight monetary policy in advance of economic weakness, the odds of avoiding a recession should be above what history might indicate."
Hot Industries For Starting A Business In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/09/15/hot-industries-for-starting-a-business-in-2024/,2024-09-15T10:05:55Z,"Starting a business is one of the most rewarding ways to build wealth and create long-term financial security, especially for those looking to transition out of traditional careers. However, choosing the right industry is key to ensuring your business thrives. Today, certain industries are not only in demand but are also primed for growth.

With more people working from home and dealing with the stresses of modern life, health and wellness have become top priorities. The demand for personalized, accessible wellness solutions is only increasing, presenting significant opportunities for business owners who can meet these needs.

Sustainability is more than a buzzword; it's a movement. As consumers and businesses alike become more environmentally conscious, green tech and sustainable products are experiencing huge demand.

56 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/56-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-09-15T04:03:54Z,"Fox News host Jesse Watters asks how Vice President Kamala Harris is different from President Biden as he accuses her of bombing her first solo interview since becoming Democrats' 2024 candidate on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' (Courtesy: ABC News)

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone exactly eight weeks as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Under pressure to sit down for a substantive interview after weeks of stonewalling, Harris finally ended her interview drought last month in Georgia when she was joined by running mate Tim Walz for a pre-taped piece with CNN's Dana Bash that was a far cry from a traditional press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August on Friday in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris sat for two taped radio interviews last week, and she gave her first solo television interview as the Democratic nominee on Friday in Philadelphia.

As for when she'll actually do a formal press conference, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

Trump has sought to highlight the contrast in media availability between the two, sitting for several lengthy interviews in recent weeks, in addition to his three news conferences.

In her interview on Friday in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

In her first solo sit-down TV interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris seemed to filibuster to avoid direct answers. One example came when the interviewer, Brian Taff of the Philadelphia ABC affiliate, asked for her ""specific"" plans to bring down prices for Americans.

""Well, I'll start with this. I grew up a middle-class kid,"" Harris responded. ""My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard. She was able to finally save up enough money to buy our first house when I was a teenager.

""I grew up in a community of hard-working people, you know, construction workers and nurses and teachers. And I try to explain to some people who may not have had the same experience. You know, a lot of people will relate to this.""

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

Critics have slammed Harris on social media, saying she gave confusing answers to a number of questions.

""Kamala Harris did her first local sit down interview after prepping for 53 days and it was a nightmare[.] She couldn't even name 1-2 things she would do to bring down inflation,"" Karoline Leavitt, Donald Trump's press secretary wrote in post on X following the interview.

California state Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones told Fox News Digital if Harris was to be elected president, the entire nation would suffer.

""Kamala Harris has spent decades in public office, with a track record defined by rising costs and inflation. During her tenure in California, prices soared, and the affordability crisis has only worsened since she became Vice President,"" Jones said. ""Talk is cheap, and while she promises to lower costs, her actions have repeatedly resulted in the opposite.

""Californians struggled under her leadership, and now the entire nation is bearing the brunt. America simply can't afford a Harris presidency.""

Conservative podcaster Benny Johnson also added that Harris's answers made no sense.

""Kamala Harris: ""My focus is very much about what we need to do over the next 10-20 years to catch up to the 21st century around, again, capacity, but also challenges."" What does this even mean?"" Johnson wrote in a post. on X.

Harris' answer resembled the response she gave during the ABC News presidential debate against former President Trump on Tuesday, when she was asked by moderator David Muir whether Americans are economically ""better off than they were four years ago.""

""So I was raised as a middle-class kid,"" Harris told Muir. ""And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.""

DREW BARRYMORE CALLS HER VIRAL 'MOMALA' HARRIS INTERVIEW THE 'SCARIEST CONVERSATION I'VE DONE'

Although Harris drew praise from the pundits for her debate performance, her sometimes unresponsive answers there foreshadowed Friday's sit-down, particularly on economic matters. In the debate, Harris went on to tout the same proposals without answering whether Americans are better off now than they were four years ago.

""Kamala Harris was very clearly and directly asked: Are the American people better off now than they were 4 years ago? She could not say yes because the answer is no -- the American people are worse off today because of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's policies,"" former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard posted on X following Tuesday night's debate.

TRUMP-VANCE TICKET HAS DONE COMBINED 49 INTERVIEWS SINCE LAST MONTH COMPARED TO ONLY 10 FOR HARRIS-WALZ

Harris and running mate Tim Walz have only done 10 nonscripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far, while Republican presidential nominee Trump and vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 49 interviews.

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump took questions at a news conference on Friday in California, his third extended presser in recent weeks.

USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page said she believes Americans deserve to hear both candidates answer tough questions.

""I think part of the job description of being president is answering questions, not because reporters have a right to ask them, but because Americans have a right to hear them,"" Page told Fox News Digital.

Gold Stocks And REITs Are Hot: These Price Charts Show How Much,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2024/09/14/gold-stocks-and-reits-are-hot-these-price-charts-show-how-much/,2024-09-14T18:08:40Z,"Whether it's interest rate cuts and inflationary worries or investor concerns about formerly hot tech stocks, money is moving into gold stocks and REITs. The price charts for both sectors show this clearly and, at some point, actual price movement is more relevant than whatever the reasons are said to be.

Take a look at the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) daily price chart:

The exchange traded fund that holds 60 stocks including relatively large positions in the big cap miners such as Newmont Corp and Agnico Eagle as well smaller positions in less well-known names like New Gold and Centerra Gold.

The fund hit a new high this week after breaking out above the August high, a sign of how eager investors are to own the precious metal equities. This gold miners ETF is since mid-Summer outperforming the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund.

Here's the weekly price chart for the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF:

The price is just now touching the previous resistance level of just above $40 from April 2022. Note that the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week moving average in July 2024 (it's red circled).

The monthly chart for the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF is here:

That red-dotted line at the $43 level may be the next target now that the fund has a weekly closing price above the 2022 high. The red dotted line near the top indicates the level of the 2011 high, just under $60. The crossover of the 50-month moving average above the 200-month moving average in early 2024 is red circled.

REITS are having a good run as well. Here's the daily price chart for the Real Estate Seclect Sector SPDR Fund:

From the mid-April low to the present is a gain of more than 30% in five months, making this another fund now outperforming the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. The 50-day moving average appears to have crossed above the 200-day moving average in late 2023, an early signal of the coming strength.

The weekly price chart for fund is here:

The red circle indicates the spot at which the 50-week moving average seems about to cross above the 200-week moving average. The next level of resistance is the April 2022 high of $47 and then there's the resistance above that from late 2021 at just under $48, where the red-dotted line appears up at the top of this chart.

Here's the real estate fund's monthly price chart:

The almost relentless uptrend from 2010 was interrupted briefly only in early 2020 and again from mid-2022 to early 2024. The fund has not spent too much time below the 50-month moving average and the 200-month moving average is steadily upward.

How Disney's Theme Parks Cast A Dark Spell On Its Fortunes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/09/14/how-disneys-theme-parks-cast-a-dark-spell-on-its-fortunes/,2024-09-14T15:36:26Z,"Almost exactly one year ago, Disney's chief executive Bob Iger and Josh D'Amaro, chairman of its theme park division, made a blockbuster announcement. They revealed that over the next decade Disney's investment in its Parks, Experiences and Products segment would nearly double to roughly $60 billion. It seemed sure to give a sparkle to the media giant's declining stock price.

Over the course of the previous two and a half years, Disney had lost a staggering 59.4% of its value partly due to the disastrous timing of heavy investment in its Disney+ streaming platform.

Disney+ initially seemed like a godsend. It launched in late 2019 only a matter of months before consumers all over the world had to lock down in their homes and work remotely due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. They were soon craving new television content and Disney+ hit that spot.

Subscriber numbers surged, hitting 60 million after eight months and 100 million after 16 months. It was more than Disney initially forecast to have within five years and stockholders couldn't get enough of it.

Disney's stock price soared in line with this and hit an all-time high of $201.91 in March 2021. In a bid to capitalize on the interest from investors, and dethrone Netflix as the most popular streaming platform, Disney commissioned costly content which would be shown exclusively on Disney+. Bob Chapek, Disney's boss at the time, signed off this spending splurge even though Disney+ hadn't covered its startup costs and had yet to turn a profit.

Disney's strong back catalogue alone would have been enough to tempt many subscribers to sign up and, as we reported, if it had only put this on its platform it wouldn't have incurred any significant additional costs. Instead, it spent billions on exclusive streaming content causing its Direct To Consumer (DTC) segment to generate billions of Dollars in operating losses. They hit a record $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 when subscriber numbers peaked at 164.2 million. Then came a disturbance in the force.

Just when much of the new content began to hit screens, lockdowns began to be lifted as the Covid-19 vaccine was rolled out around the world. It led to workers returning to the office giving them less time to watch streaming shows. Disney+ subscriber numbers suddenly started to decline before Disney had managed to overtake Netflix. It left Disney counting the cost with the total operating losses of its DTC division currently standing at $11.4 billion since its platform was launched.

The red ink gave investors the jitters and Disney's stock began to steadily decline in value. By the time that the record DTC losses were announced on November 8, 2022, Disney's share price had fallen 50.5% off its peak to close at $99.90 and Chapek paid the ultimate price. Just 12 days after the announcement he was unceremoniously dumped by Disney and his predecessor Iger replaced him on a contract which runs until the end of 2026. He hasn't had a magic touch.

Iger started by making sweeping management changes and slashing streaming spending as part of a $7.5 billion cost-cutting plan. Despite this, Disney's stock price hasn't returned to its glory days. Over the two years since Iger returned to the helm, it has largely stayed under $100 and the highest price it has hit is $122.82 which is 39.2% off its March 2021 record when Chapek was in charge. Iger brought streaming costs under control so the dwindling stock price suggested that this was far from the company's only problem.

The last thing that appeared to be the cause was Disney's Experiences division. Its performance appeared to be a fairytale compared to Disney's DTC division. When lockdown ended, consumers had tremendous pent-up demand to travel and were flush with furlough cash so they could pay a premium in order to visit theme parks. Disney took advantage of this and increased ticket prices whilst scrapping previously free frills at its flagship Walt Disney World theme park complex in Orlando, Florida. Free buses from the airport to its on-site hotels came to an end along with contactless room keys which came in the form of wristbands.

However, perhaps the most transformative change across all of Disney's theme parks has been scrapping the queue-cutting passes which were previously a complimentary privilege with each entrance ticket. They now come at a cost and, according to a recent data leak, reported by the Wall Street Journal, they generated more than $724 million in pre-tax revenue between October 2021 and June 2024 at Walt Disney World alone.

The price rises combined with the cost cuts was a magic formula as it increased both revenue and profit which compensated for the colossal streaming losses. In turn, Disney's Experiences division accounted for just over a third of its $88.9 billion revenue and more than two thirds of its $12.9 billion operating income in the year to September 30, 2023. By then, Disney's stock was still well under $100 so Iger and D'Amaro got out their magic wands in a bid to boost its price.

On September 19 last year they announced the $60 billion investment in Disney's Experiences division with great fanfare. ""We have an ambitious growth story that is supported by a proven track record and a bold vision for the future of our parks business,"" boasted D'Amaro. It failed to enchant investors.

On the same day that Disney announced the investment, Disney's stock crashed by 2.35% to close at $81.94. It didn't stop there and just 15 days later it fell again, closing at $79.32, its lowest price in almost a decade. This wasn't an isolated occurrence.

At the time, Disney was locked in a battle with Florida governor Ron DeSantis which began the previous year when it opposed the introduction of a new law in the state which bans early grade classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity. In retaliation, DeSantis seized control of the special taxing district which allowed the Mouse to self-govern Walt Disney World.

This triggered claims and counterclaims from Disney, at a state and federal level, but after two years of wrangling it finally agreed to put its differences with DeSantis aside.

On June 5 this year, the DeSantis-controlled district gave initial approval to a proposed $17 billion 15-year development plan for Walt Disney World, opening the door to the construction of a potential fifth theme park there. It wasn't music to investors ears and Disney's stock price plummeted 1.46% to close at $101.50 on the day that approval was given. The development plan needed a final vote from the district to take effect and it got this on June 12 leading to Disney's share price dropping 0.4% to $100.80.

Disney teased the first fruits of this expansion last month ahead of its biennial D23 convention. Its August 7 presentation for investors teased that ""upcoming attractions and experiences"" would be showcased at D23 but this didn't stop its stock price slumping 2.3% to $85.96 by the end of the day.

Four days later, Disney announced new attractions for all its theme parks around the world including new lands in Orlando themed to its villains, Indiana Jones and the computer animated movie Cars. When Disney's shares opened the following morning on August 12, they fell 0.4% on the previous price to $85.86.

Indeed, the investor antipathy ran so deep that when Disney announced in its second quarter earnings release on May 7 this year that the entertainment division of Disney+ had made its first profit, even that didn't boost its stock price which fell by 1.7% to close at $105.39. Ditto for Disney's announcement on July 24 that Inside Out 2 had become the highest-grossing animated movie of all time with total takings of $1.7 billion according to Box Office Mojo. Instead of being a dream ticket for investors, Disney's stock price dropped 0.47% during the day to close at $89.80.

With its DTC business finally turning a profit and record-breakers being released in theaters, the performance of Disney's Experiences division came under the spotlight. It soon became clear what was actually casting a dark spell on the company's stock price.

The first indication of this came during Disney's second quarter 2024 earnings call when chief financial officer Hugh Johnston warned of a softening in theme park attendance due to ""a global moderation from peak post‐Covid travel"". In short, the furlough money has long since been spent and the travelers who wanted to visit parks have now done so. That's just the start as the cost of the tickets has become so high that it is putting off new visitors.

A recent report by CNBC revealed that, according to Wolfe Research, the price of a one-day ticket to Walt Disney World has risen by 56% to $154 over the past decade, outpacing the US national inflation rate by 24 percentage points. It has had an impact as CNBC added that a 2023 survey by price-comparison website LendingTree found that 60% of people who have never been to a Disney park said that cost was the main reason.

Worryingly, the survey also concluded that the average amount of debt that Americans get to visit Disney parks comes to $1,690 and 41% of them regretted taking it out. Disney has been contacted for comment on CNBC's report and any response will be inserted in an update.

Prices of food favorites at Disney World have risen even more than the tickets according to a recent report by financial advice website Financebuzz which found that they have gone up by 61% on average over the past decade.

It has led to furious fans slamming Disney on social media. In March, longtime Disney fan Jake Williams and his partner did just that when they explained that Disney World charged them $886 for one day at the Magic Kingdom as well as a night at the mid-tier Port Orleans hotel and meals in average restaurants.

Given these high prices it is little wonder Johnston said in May that ""relative to the post‐Covid highs, things are tending to normalize."" After crunching the numbers, Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets added that Disney's domestic park business ""will be pressured for the rest of 2024"" and it was no exaggeration.

Not so long ago Disney's executives liked to boast that its Experiences division had delivered record profit and revenue for multiple quarters but now those days are gone. Its latest results show that in the third quarter to June 29, the company generated $4.3 billion of operating profit on $23.2 billion of revenue, which was up 4% on the same period the previous year. It was a respectable result but a deeper dive into the data revealed a worrying trend for Disney's Experiences division.

Higher guest spending at Disney's domestic parks and cruise lines, as well as increased spending per room, drove up Experiences revenue by 2% to $8.4 billion. However, it is a sharp decline on the 13% increase in the revenue of the equivalent segment over the same period in 2023 compared to the previous year. Worse still, the operating profit of Disney's Experiences division declined by 3% to $2.2 billion in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. It was driven by costs climbing at Disney's domestic parks and as well as a lack of attendance growth. It is set to stay in this rut for some time.

Disney's third quarter earnings statement revealed that ""the demand moderation we saw in our domestic businesses in Q3 could impact the next few quarters. While we are actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing our cost base, we expect Q4 Experiences segment operating income to decline by mid single digits versus the prior year.""

During the results announcement, Johnston gave insight into the reasons for the decline at Disney's domestic parks as he explained that ""the lower-income consumer is feeling a little bit of stress. The high-income consumer is traveling internationally a bit more. I think you're just going to see more of a continuation of those trends in terms of the top line."" He added that ""we saw attendance flat in the quarter"" with a ""flattish revenue number"" forecast for the fourth quarter and a slowdown expected for ""a few quarters.""

This malaise and the disenchantment from fans is a black mark on D'Amaro's resumé. Famous for his sparkling toothy grin, he is a regular visitor to the parks and often stops for selfies with guests and staff, who are known as cast members due to the role they play in a themed environment. D'Amaro has 154,000 followers on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve. Opening new parks and attractions adds to his accolades but the question investors may wonder is whether they are necessary.

Investing $60 billion in Experiences when its outlook is so uncertain seems like a tremendous gamble. The fattest margins in theme parks are to be found on the high-priced food, beverage and merchandise. The higher the attendance, the higher the spending on them so, as we have reported, the real magic formula is getting more guests through the turnstiles without spending vast sums on building new attractions from scratch.

Updating attractions (known as 'plussing' in the trade) rather than building new ones is much more cost-effective. However, waiving the fees for queue-cutting would be an even cheaper way to start. Although it would remove a lucrative revenue stream it would also boost visitor numbers and thereby merchandise, food and beverage sales. In turn, this would increase profits, though not as much as the queue-cutting passes do as they come with no costs. However, if their price puts off too many guests from visiting the parks then the overall level of profit may not be as high as it could be.

""It is a very very tricky balancing act between raising prices and balancing a good strong healthy robust demand,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Media Analyst Geetha Ranganathan in May.

Disney has everything to play for. If it doesn't find a way of cutting costs, its share price may remain depressed until Iger is finally replaced. He recently said he is ""obsessed"" with finding a successor and the shortlist reportedly includes D'Amaro. As he is the architect of the theme park pricing model which is alienating fans it remains to be seen whether investors would see him as Disney's prince charming. It may need to clean house for stockholders to end up happily ever after."
Tax Breaks: The Falling  Interest Rates And Creeping Tax Brackets Edition,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/09/14/tax-breaks-the-falling--interest-rates-and-creeping-tax-brackets-edition/,2024-09-14T14:06:43Z,"This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter. You can sign-up to get Tax Breaks in your inbox here.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showing an increase of 0.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis, the same increase as in July. Over the last 12 months, the index increased 2.5% before seasonal adjustment.

In plain talk, that means that the cost of goods is increasing, but only slightly -- inflation is finally easing. Inflation has been falling steadily since peaking at 9.1% two years ago in response to the pandemic.

What does that mean for consumers? Likely a rate cut from the Fed, meaning interest rates could be coming down. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell signaled late last month that a rate cut would be coming at the September meeting slated to begin on September 17. Expectations are high for at least two rate cuts before the end of the year, but there's some chatter that it could make it up to three -- with more on the horizon in the new year.

Lower inflation means lower interest rates, typically leading to lower borrowing costs -- your credit card and mortgage payments could be lower. We're already seeing some movement -- the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at its lowest since April 2023.

Still, the earlier boost in CPI, even though it's slight, will be felt at tax time. Those higher numbers push out deduction limitations and will result in upward adjustments to tax brackets and increases to other key thresholds. Bloomberg Tax and Accounting predicts that inflation-adjusted amounts in the tax code will increase by 2.8% from the 2024 numbers. This is about half the increase taxpayers saw in 2024, a significant drop from the 7.1% increase in 2023. You can get a first look here.

Remember, these are not the tax rates and other numbers for 2024 (you'll find the official 2024 tax rates here).

What also had tongues wagging this week? The presidential debate. Taxes weren't a huge talking point compared to other topics. According to CBS News, which measured how often candidates used certain words, Harris referenced tax ten times compared to Trump's three. On the other hand, Trump talked about tariffs eight times, while Harris didn't mention tariffs at all, instead referring to them as a ""sales tax."" Harris also referenced ""small business"" or businesses seven times, a phrase Trump didn't mention in either debate.

While taxes weren't front and center at the debate, that doesn't mean candidates aren't talking about tax policy. Some pundits worry that taxes have become too much of a carrot for taxpayers, with candidates ""hyper-targeting tax subsidies to narrowly favored activities or occupations"" (Howard Gleckman's turn of phrase might be more poetic, but a more simple term would be pandering). A comparison suggests that while Trump and Harris increasingly use this tool, Trump has been far more aggressive.

The tension between using the tax code to raise revenue versus rewarding specific activities or benefitting specially defined groups is hardly new. But, Gleckman writes, this year's collection of proposed credits and deductions would be more tailored than a bespoke suit. And they'd make the tax code less fair and less efficient. One example? The highly critiqued ""no tax on tips"" proposal promoted by both Trump and Harris.

Now, there's a new suggestion. At a rally in Arizona, former President Donald Trump unveiled a new policy proposal: eliminating income tax on overtime pay. The most glaring issue with eliminating taxes on overtime pay, suggests Andrew Leahey, is the inherent disadvantage it creates for regular wage earners. Those who log a standard 40-hour week would continue to pay taxes on their income, while their colleagues who can work overtime would enjoy tax-free earnings with their extra hours of pay.

It turns out that chasing tax dodgers isn't just an American pursuit -- French tax authorities are doubling down on high-profile tax fraud investigations these days. In March, a French court convicted a billionaire art dealer of tax fraud in a sprawling case that alleged Guy Wildenstein, head of the famed Wildenstein art family, avoided paying millions of euros in inheritance taxes through a network of trusts.

(If that name sounds familiar, Guy's brother, Alec, was formerly married to New York City socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein, known as ""Catwoman"" in the 1990s media because of her extensive plastic surgery.)

In late 2023, French actress Isabelle Adjani was fined €250,000 and handed a suspended prison sentence after a court found that she falsely declared her residency in Portugal for two years. Adjani has maintained her innocence.

French lawmakers want more investigations, but domestic laws haven't always supported this goal. A new law may change that. France's Finance Act 2024 creates a new criminal offense targeting individuals and entities that provide instruments to facilitate tax fraud. The penalties are steep -- offenders can face jail time and hundreds of thousands or even millions of euros in fines, and firms can be ordered to suspend or close their operations.

U.S. taxpayers with international ties can also be subject to steep penalties imposed by the IRS -- those for failing to file foreign-related information returns -- even if no tax understatement is involved -- can be especially severe. For instance, failing to timely file Form 5471 (for ownership in a foreign corporation) or Form 8865 (for ownership in a foreign partnership) can result in a $10,000 penalty per return. This penalty increases by an additional $10,000 per month if the failure continues after IRS notification. In some cases, penalties can be based on a percentage of the transaction or asset, such as the 25% penalty on the value of a foreign gift or bequest when a taxpayer fails to file Form 3520 reporting it.

Just last year, a California man filed suit (☆) against the federal government, alleging that the ""intentional disregard"" of statutes and regulations resulted in significant financial harm, including the seizure of his assets. Marcus Mihalcheon claimed he timely filed Form 3520, but the IRS deemed it late. For his alleged transgression, the IRS assessed a civil penalty against Mihalcheon in the amount of $7,200,000.

Even if you never leave the country, U.S. persons who make outbound investments in foreign corporations often have thorny federal reporting obligations. For example, taxpayers may need to file Form 926, Return of a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation -- the penalties for failing to do so can be severe.

Hopefully, all of the talk about complications facing international taxpayers didn't scare you too much-but if you want to stick closer to home, you have options. Forbes' new list of 25 Best Places To Enjoy Your Retirement is out. The enjoyment list, by definition, is all about the best spots for pursuing new or lifelong passions in the greater leisure hours that are at the heart of retirement. The six interest areas Forbes considered were arts/culture, fine dining, lifelong learning, outdoor activities on water, outdoor activities on land, and in a category by itself, golf. (Notably, there's no separate category for tax geeks-sorry-but taxes are included in the discussions on affordability.)

One way to avoid trouble no matter where you land? Consult with a good tax professional -- just don't necessarily do it this weekend. With a tax deadline looming on Monday, many preparers are buried under depreciation schedules and expense spreadsheets, so be patient (and send doughnuts).

You used to be able to claim an exemption for yourself (if another person could not claim you), your spouse, and each of your dependents. Remember that your spouse is never considered your dependent.

The deduction for personal exemptions is suspended -- technically still on the book but reduced to $0 -- for tax years 2018 through 2025 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If Congress doesn't take additional action, you'll see it again in 2026.

(For reference, for the tax year 2017 -- the last year the exemption was available -- the personal exemption was $4,050 per person, subject to income phaseouts.)

I own a small business where I help people as a Virtual Assistant. My client wants me to set up a personal bank account for them to put my ""allowance"" for expenses pertaining to their business, like memberships and such! How do I go about this without it going on my taxes (since it is not income)?

I have seen many instances where income was attributed to a taxpayer for money that didn't belong to them. Keeping client funds and your own funds separate is super important -- it's mandatory for some professionals (like lawyers), but it is also a good idea for other professionals for legal and tax reasons.

Lawyers have specific trust accounts that allow them to deposit money into an account for the benefit of their clients. Lenders, sellers, real estate professionals, and other businesses can create escrow accounts to hold money. This is typically done on a short-term basis and is governed by contract. If your profession or bank doesn't allow that sort of arrangement, consider opening a separate business account that your client can transfer money into as needed (or, if more than one client, use sub-accounts) and keep scrupulous records. (☆)

While the account itself won't be reported to the IRS or other tax authority (unless it's generating interest or other income), at audit, it will be your burden to prove that these transfers weren't payment.

The European Union's top court has issued a final ruling in an ongoing legal battle over tax benefits, finding that Apple must pay billions in back taxes. (☆)

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) confirmed a 2016 European Commission finding that companies belonging to the Apple Group received tax advantages that were ""unlawful and incompatible with the internal market, and from which the Apple Group as a whole had benefited. According to Commission estimates at the time, Ireland had given illegal tax benefits worth €13 billion to Apple.

The case stretches back more than a decade. In 2013, an initial inquiry was launched into whether Apple had engaged in sweetheart deals with Ireland to lower its tax bills. A formal investigation was initiated by the European Commission in 2014.

The Commission eventually found that tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple ""substantially and artificially"" lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991. According to the Commission, and long suggested by critics of Apple's tax structures, almost all sales profits recorded by the two companies were attributed to ""head offices,"" which existed only on paper. The result? Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of 1% in 2003 and just 0.005% in 2014.

The IRS has issued proposed regulations to provide guidance on the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). CAMT imposes a 15% minimum tax on large corporations' adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and generally applies to corporations with an average annual AFSI exceeding $1 billion. The proposed regulations provide definitions and general rules for determining and identifying AFSI and include rules regarding various statutory and regulatory adjustments in determining AFSI; determining if a corporation is subject to the CAMT, including rules for members of a foreign parented multinational group (FPMG) and the determination of the CAMT foreign tax credit.

In a joint effort to support the next generation of accountants, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) and the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) have proposed an initiative aimed at helping Certified Public Accountant (CPA) candidates meet initial licensure requirements.

Trump's own version of reality continues to confound political actors and observers,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5111649/trump-fact-check-reality,2024-09-14T09:05:09Z,"Eight years ago this month, Donald Trump announced that he had personally laid to rest the controversy about President Obama's country of origin. He gave himself credit for clearing up any questions that may have arisen because of something, he claimed, Hillary Clinton had said years earlier.

Those familiar with the facts were stunned. They knew the so-called birther conspiracy had been hatched by various Obama opponents to suggest he was ineligible to be president because he had been born not in the U.S. but in Kenya or some other country. It had been kept alive and promoted for years by a variety of Obama critics, including, most prominently, Donald Trump.

It could even be said that Trump had facilitated his transition from TV reality show star (The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice) to bona fide political candidate by exploiting the birther myth.

What Trump was actually announcing in September 2016 was a decision to stop talking about a non-issue he himself had helped sustain for years. But in finally renouncing one falsehood, he insisted on substituting another -- casting himself as a hero of the tale.

Nearly a decade after Trump began running for president we should all be accustomed to his reliance on falsehoods.

But back in 2016, the birther flip-flop seemed to deserve special recognition. It was not just blatant, it was preposterous.

Or so we thought. Surely it would diminish the man even in the eyes of his admirers. And it may have done so, in some cases. But it did not alter his trajectory. He stunned the world a few weeks later by winning the Electoral College vote for president.

It was said in the early Trump years that the media took him literally but not seriously. It's hard to deny that many of us took him too literally and not seriously enough. At the same time, many of Trump's ""base"" voters were said to take Trump seriously but not literally. That worked for him, and those attitudes surely persist in 2024 much as they did in his first two campaigns.

Ten years ago, the media were accustomed to politicians who could be shamed or at least embarrassed over errors of fact and even minor exposures of ignorance. Trump seemed then, and still seems now, quite impervious to either.

Still, the most egregious trait of Trump's campaign was his willingness to state highly consequential claims that were entirely at odds with reality, standing by them when challenged and sailing on -- dismissive or seemingly oblivious to all criticism.

Far from being disqualifying, this feature of the Trump persona presents itself as part and parcel of his appeal.

This week, after a debate with Vice President Harris that he apparently did not take entirely seriously, Trump said he would not debate her again. He said there was no need for a ""third debate"" because he had clearly won the first two. He was including the June 27 debate he had with President Biden, who had been the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time.

Perhaps that was not surprising, as Trump kept Biden in his sights throughout his debate with Harris this week -- name checking Biden repeatedly without naming Harris once.

But what was surprising was Trump's claim to having won both debates. Few would question he won the June 27 meeting with Biden, who seemed so diminished as to be hard to recognize.

But quite the opposite impression prevailed after Trump's match with Harris, who had swept to the Democratic nomination without opposition after Biden's July 18 decision to withdraw.

The first CNN polls after Tuesday's debate showed nearly two-thirds of those who watched thought Harris did better than Trump (even if they were not planning to vote for her). A sizable fraction of Republicans were not willing to say Trump had won the faceoff.

Yet here was Trump, on the afternoon after the debate, telling reporters he was not interested in a rematch with Harris because he had ""won the debate according to every poll -- every single poll, I think.""

In fact, the only polls where Trump won were online polls of self-selected website samples rather than the randomized scientific samples actual pollsters use. One poll Trump cited had him winning 98% to 2%, according to Trump.

Meanwhile, actual polling organizations such as Reuters and YouGov had done their soundings and found Harris the winner in the eyes of a clear majority -- though not as large a majority as CNN's poll. Trump came out on top for just 31% of the respondents in YouGov and 24% in Reuters.

This willingness or compulsion to present claims that are utterly counterfactual has set Trump apart from conventional candidates. It continues to pose a problem for the media and the political community alike -- including conservative media such as Fox News and a sizable portion of the Republican Party itself.

Trump's claims are often expressed in hyperbolic superlatives. Trump insists he had ""the best economy"" and Biden had ""the worst inflation"" ever -- two statements that are easily disproven. The nation's economic growth was stronger for longer under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, just to name two relatively recent presidents. Inflation was far higher and more sustained in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

But Trump has never been troubled by making such outlandish statements. Moreover, he is rarely satisfied with telling his crowds that yellow is green. It has to be the greenest green there has ever been. It is not sufficient to say up is down, it must be down farther than down has ever been.

The escalating statement of the stupendous is also a specialty. Take, for example, his casual references to the number of immigrants present in the United States illegally. On Tuesday night he started referring to millions, mentioned 21 million, then said it was surely far more than the official government estimate of 11 million. Then he again said it was more like 21 million before adding he thought the figure was ""a lot higher than"" that.

And all this without a shred of actual evidence or even a hint at the source of these wildly disparate numbers.

In the June 27 debate against Biden, the incumbent's stumbles overshadowed Trump's own missteps. But Trump still had his share of howlers. At one point he said illegal immigrants had taken ""110%"" of all the jobs created during the Biden presidency.

That would mean they had taken more jobs than were created, strongly suggesting Trump was not paying much attention to what he was saying. Indeed, as a general rule when he starts spouting statistics, he seems far more interested in what shock they may cause than whether they add up.

There may have been a time this kind of behavior could be dismissed as ordinary political rhetoric, which most Americans expect will contain exaggerations and oversimplifications. It is clear from the polls that whatever Americans think of Trump's relationship to fact, something approaching half of them still plan to vote for him.

Fact-checking has been around for more than a generation, giving newspapers and magazines a chance to offer something different and escape the ""he said, she said"" pattern. In the later decades of the 20th century, most newspapers and big broadcasters were steeped in the values of ""middle of the road"" reporting as media owners sought ever-larger and more diverse audiences.

Stories were considered balanced when different sides were presented with equal weight and respect. Deciding which side was right or more accurate or more worthy was left to the news consumer or voter.

That was never entirely satisfactory, either to the consumer-voter or to the journalists themselves. More and more news outlets turned to ""fact-checks"" or ""fact-checking,"" an effort to find and follow the facts on crime, unemployment, trade, health care, immigration and any other issues that drove the debate.

For some journalists this became a full-time assignment. The Washington Post has used veteran reporter Glenn Kessler as its official guru of fact for many years. The Poynter Institute in Florida, related to the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) pioneered Politifact several election cycles ago.

NPR and PBS have been fact-checking debates and other key moments in national campaigns for decades, online and on air. This week, the fact-checking operation in both shops had its hands full.

So when ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis made a few factual corrections during the debate about a particular claim or statement, they were carrying on a custom that has been increasingly common in broadcast journalism.

As they did not see a need to correct as much in what Harris said, their efforts struck many Trump supporters as unnecessary, unfair and evidence of Democratic bias. Trump himself said the debate had been ""3 against 1.""

The anchors' defense was that Harris said nothing to compare with Trump's assertions about states allowing abortion after birth or Haitian immigrants eating people's pets in Ohio.

That's a judgment call, of course, and just the kind that mainstream journalists were once trained to avoid. That they now feel compelled to make those calls has a lot to do with how Trump himself has changed the rules. But it should not be surprising that changes the media have made prompt protest from those who feel abused -- particularly Trump himself.

This entails also the sea change over the use of the three-letter word we were trained as journalists to avoid: lie. We might say a politician was misstating facts or making inaccurate claims. But we could never make the leap of imputing motive. Maybe the pol was just mistaken and sincerely believed his opponent was guilty of this or that accusation. We could say he was wrong, but calling someone a liar was a big deal.

Trump has led to a change in that policy in much of the industry. Even in 2016, some TV anchors were using the word, at least on late-night TV. It has since become quite common for mainstream news organizations to refer to lies and lying.

With his latest portrayal of what happened in the Harris debate in front of 67 million TV viewers this week, Trump once again has thrown down the gauntlet to challenge the fact-checkers and the commentators alike.

Now, even the practice of fact-checking has become controversial, with Trump acolytes questioning what constitutes a fact. We have reached a point where the idea of fact-checking is regarded as polarizing.

And the more we talk about how polarized things have become, the more polarized they get."
55 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/55-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-09-14T04:05:15Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris said she had 'a number of things' in mind for day one priorities should she take the Oval Office but didn't divulge much in the way of specifics.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 55 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Under pressure to sit down for a substantive interview after weeks of stonewalling, Harris finally ended her interview drought last month when she was joined by running mate Tim Walz for a pre-taped piece with CNN's Dana Bash last Thursday in Georgia that was a far cry from a traditional press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August on Friday in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris sat for two taped radio interviews last week, and she gave her first solo television interview as the Democratic nominee on Friday in Philadelphia.

As to when she'll actually do a formal press conference, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

Trump has sought to highlight the contrast in media availability between the two, sitting for several lengthy interviews in recent weeks, in addition to his three news conferences.

Harris received mixed reviews for her showing with Bash, where she took the majority of the questions but nevertheless had Walz there for support.

In her interview on Friday in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

Inflation Subdued; A Slowing Economy: Will Fed Lower -25 Or -50?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/13/inflation-subdued-a-slowing-economy-will-fed-lower25-or50/,2024-09-14T03:40:05Z,"Equity markets were up smartly for the week ended September 13 with three of the four major averages up between 4% and 6% (see table). Only the Dow Jones lagged (+2.60%), mainly for wont of a high concentration of tech names. Normally, that 2.60% rise would make investors ecstatic.

As usual, tech led the way. Nvidia (NVDA), closing at $119.08, advanced nearly 16% for the week, and has made up nearly all of September's falloff. It is now within striking distance of its August 23 peak closing price ($129.37). The rest of the Magnificent 7 advanced between 4% and 10%, except for Apple (AAPL) which is still suffering from disappointing investors at its recently held quarterly meeting.

On the fixed income side, yields continued to soften with the 10-Year Treasury yield now at 3.66%

The latest Consumer Price Index came out on Wednesday (September 11) for August, and it showed that inflation continued on its downward path. The overall index rose just +0.2% for the month and 2.5% from a year ago, the lowest that annual number has been since all the way back to February of 2021 - that's 3.5 years ago!

The ""core"" rate of inflation which excludes food and energy, and the index followed closely by Federal Reserve policymakers - that rose 0.3% in August and 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. And that 3.2% number was tied for the lowest level since April of 2021.

To show the progress on inflation, looking only at the last three months and annualizing those numbers puts the headline number at +1.1%, and the core at 2.1%. In our weekly blogs, we have discussed the computational issue that is part and parcel of the construction of the consumer price index. The issue there is that the shelter component (mostly rents) which has a large 36% weighting in the index, is lagged. That means the data is not current, and, in fact, the rent data used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct the index, is 9-12 months old. An up-to-date rent index, like the Apartment List Index, shows that, on a national basis, rents have actually fallen -0.7% over the year ending in August.

So, if we exclude those old rents from the Consumer Price Index, that index behaved quite well: 0.0% in August, 0.0% in July, and -0.2% in both June and May. And remember, current rents are falling, so if they were included, we would actually be seeing deflation.

For some reason or other, and despite the fact that the last 3-month trend is what is most likely to continue in the near future, markets like to look at year-over-year comparisons. So, looked at from this perspective (year-over-year), if we exclude rents, the Consumer Price Index was flat (0.0%) for the two months July and August and rose just +1.1% from a year earlier. In July, that number was +1.7%. So, you can see just how rapidly inflation is subsiding. Virtually all the rise in the CPI ln August was due to the rise in insurance premiums and to shelter costs. The insurance premiums are a one-time catch-up phenomenon, and the rise in the shelter component is from the lagged data used by BLS as discussed earlier. (Shelter costs, as noted, are actually falling.) The prices of goods, on net, are flat to down.

Meanwhile, the Fed is about to make its first mini-move to lower historically restrictive interest rates. Because I think the Fed is ""late to the party"" or ""behind the curve"" in easing monetary policy (let's not forget that there is a long lag between when the Fed implements monetary policy changes and the impact of those changes on the economy), I expect that the disinflation we have seen so far (i.e., slower price increases) will actually become deflation (i.e. actual lower prices) by year's end. We've already begun to see this in prices at the gas pump.

To reiterate: the inflation genie has been put back into the bottle as inflation is now effectively at the Fed's 2% goal. Meanwhile, the Fed is about to take its first baby step, a 25 or perhaps 50 basis point rate reduction, toward easing its historically restrictive monetary policy. In our view, the Fed is ""behind the curve,"" and that is why we believe that a bout of deflation, i.e., falling prices, lies ahead.

The two charts above show just how deflationary August really was. The price of gas declined about -8% during the month, while the prices of online groceries were down nearly -4%.

Meanwhile, consumers have begun to tighten their purse strings. In the Q2 earnings reports of major retailers, CEO commentary was unanimous in reporting that consumers had begun to pull back. While they continued to spend on essentials/necessities, they reduced outlays on discretionary items, now looking for bargains.

The Fed's Beige Book assesses current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions based on information gathered directly from businesses. Here is a sample of comments from the August Book, published on Wednesday, September 4.

Continuing with the plight of the consumer, in the housing industry, mortgage purchase applications have fallen to 30-year lows despite the fall in mortgage rates from 7.9% last October to 6.3% in August (a 160-basis point decline). Given Fed Chair Powell's announcement at the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium that the Fed would begin to lower rates in September, perhaps potential homebuyers, or those trading up or down, are waiting for mortgage rates to fall even further.

In past blogs we've discussed the rising trend in credit card and auto loan delinquencies. Along this line of thought, the NY Fed does a survey of consumer attitudes and expectations. Two concerning trends have emerged as shown in the following chart: 1) the rise in consumer expectations that they will become delinquent on a debt payment in the next three months; and 2) the upward trend in the probability of losing a job.

Going back to last week's jobs report, the sister to the Establishment Survey Payroll Report, the Household Survey reported that -438K full-time jobs were lost in August, but they were replaced by +527K part-time jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts full-time and part-time jobs as the same (i.e., each equal to one job). In our view, a more realistic approach is to count a part-time job as equal to one-half of a full-time position. Using this approach, the +527K part-time jobs become the equivalent of +263K full-time. So, the loss of -438K full-time jobs was only partially offset by the +263K jobs attributable as full-time. That's a net loss of -175K full-time jobs. So, it isn't a wonder to us why the Fed's Beige Book carried so many negatives on consumer spending, why auto and credit card delinquencies are on the rise, and why consumer worries about losing a job and missing a debt payment are on upward trends. On a side note, PwC announced layoffs of 1,800 employees, the first job cuts for that company since '09. (Wait a minute! Wasn't '09 part of the Great Recession?)

The rest of the world, too, is slowing down. This past week, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its reference rate by -25 basis points to 3.50% (note that the Fed, at 5.25%, is way behind the curve) in response to economic softness in Euroland, especially in Germany, where Industrial Production fell a whopping -2.4% in July, and their Manufacturing PMI fell to 42.4 (below 50 means contraction). We also note that Volkswagen (VW) announced layoffs, breaking a three-decade security pact with its German employees.

And then there is China which remains deeply in Recession. Property values have melted. Consumers had been using home equity appreciation to finance consumption, but that source has now dried up. As a result, the government has moved interest rates lower in an effort to spur economic growth. But there, like here, there is a long lag between a policy action and its impact on the economy.

The CPI and PPI reports were in line with market expectations and were the last inflation reports before the Fed's imminent meeting (September 17-18). At the August Jackson Hole conclave, Chairman Powell indicated that the Fed would be loosening policy restraints, code for lowering the Fed Funds Rate. Since then, the financial community has debated how large the first rate cut will be, i.e., -25 or -50 basis points. Our view is that the rate cut will be -25 basis points. The reason: a -50 basis point cut would spook financial markets, giving them concern that the Fed sees something more sinister than a ""soft-landing.""

Financial markets continue to march higher, mostly in anticipation of the beginning of a Fed easing cycle and the prospect of an economic ""soft-landing."" A -25 basis point reduction in the Fed Funds Rate is what is currently expected, and markets will likely continue to rise unless the language of the Fed statement and/or Chairman Powell's post-meeting press conference paint a different picture (unlikely). A -50 basis point reduction would send a message to the financial markets that the Fed sees the economy slowing too fast, and that would cause a drawdown in those markets.

The inflation data was benign with some emerging deflationary characteristics, like rapidly falling gasoline and grocery prices. And the Fed's own Beige Book was nothing more than a compendium of emerging softness in consumption. Such softness can be seen in the fall of mortgage purchase applications to 30-year lows despite falling mortgage rates. In addition, there is growing consumer concern over job security and their ability to service their existing debts.

Further, despite the hyped jobs headline (+142K), deeper analysis shows that full-time jobs are evaporating, being replaced by part-time ones. While the BLS counts full-time and part-time jobs as equal, a more reasonable approach, counting part-time as half a full-time job, leads to the conclusion that the job market has weakened considerably.

Economic growth in the rest of the world has slowed. Germany looks Recessionary. The European Central Bank just lowered their reference rate by -25 basis points to 3.50%. China's economy remains in a downturn.

At its imminent September meeting, the Fed is expected to lower rates by -25 basis points. If they lowered by -50-basis points, that would send a message to financial markets that the Fed sees the economy slowing too fast. Because the Fed knows this would play havoc with the equity market, it is quite unlikely to occur."
Harris dodges question on lowering prices by describing 'middle-class' roots: Neighbors 'proud of their lawn',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-dodges-question-lowering-prices-describing-middle-class-roots-neighbors-proud-lawn,2024-09-14T01:43:24Z,"Fox News host Jesse Watters asks how Vice President Kamala Harris is different from President Biden as he accuses her of bombing her first solo interview since becoming Democrats' 2024 candidate on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' (Courtesy: ABC News)

Vice President Kamala Harris was criticized Friday for a lengthy response about her ""middle-class"" upbringing that spoke about people's pride in their lawns but did little to address a question about her economic policies.

In her first solo sit-down TV interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris was asked by Philadelphia's 6 ABC anchor Brian Taff about what ""specific"" plans she has to bring down prices for Americans.

""Well, I'll start with this. I grew up a middle-class kid,"" Harris responded. ""My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard. She was able to finally save up enough money to buy our first house when I was a teenager.

""I grew up in a community of hard-working people, you know, construction workers and nurses and teachers. And I try to explain to some people who may not have had the same experience. You know, a lot of people will relate to this.""

TRUMP APPEARS TO LEAVE DOOR OPEN FOR SECOND DEBATE WITH HARRIS: 'MAYBE IF I GOT IN THE RIGHT MOOD'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she continued. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

After talking more about her mother, Harris touted her proposals to give start-up businesses a ""$50,000 tax deduction"" and new home buyers a ""$25,000 down payment assistance.""

""These are some examples of what I mean when I talk about an opportunity economy, and a lot of it has to do with just the community I was raised in and the people that I admire who work hard, you know, and deserve to have, you know, their dreams fulfilled because they're prepared to work for it,"" Harris added, without specifically answering Taff's question about lowering prices.

VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN

Critics on social media slammed the response.

""This is not a parody. This is actual real life... the real @KamalaHarris. And she's a complete joke,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung reacted.

""It takes some species of talent to filibuster for 90 straight seconds while saying nothing [at] all of value,"" National Review senior writer Noah Rothman posted.

""She repeated this canned rehearsed line twice in the debate,"" Versus Media podcast host Stephen L. Miller pointed out.

""Ah, yes, I often find myself thinking who has a nice lawn when discussing plans to deal with inflation. We're doomed if Kamala wins,"" Outkick's David Hookstead wrote.

Harris' dodge resembles the response she gave at the ABC News debate when she was asked by moderator David Muir whether Americans are economically ""better off than they were four years ago.""

""So I was raised as a middle-class kid,"" Harris told Muir. ""And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.""

She went on to tout the same proposals without answering whether Americans are better off now than they were four years ago."

Some 67 million people tuned in to watch Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump face off in their first and maybe only debate of this election season on Tuesday.

Inflation dropped to a three-year low in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices, however, climbed 2.5 percent in the last year.

On Wednesday, state and local officials across the country warned that issues with the U.S. postal service could result in disenfranchised voters this election. In an open letter, two election worker associations accused the postmaster general of not being sufficiently prepared for November.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization says medical teams wrapped up the emergency polio vaccination campaign launched after the discovery of the Gaza's first-known case of the illness in more than two decades.

This week, an Israeli airstrike on a U.N. school complex sheltering 1,200 displaced Palestinians killed six U.N. staffers at a refugee camp in Central Gaza. At least 18 Palestinians were killed in the attack.

The Department of Justice exposed Russian ties to right wing social media influencers. U.S. prosecutors say the Kremlin media company RT funneled nearly $10 million to a platform for content creators. The company, Tenet Media, worked with popular online personalities like Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, and Dave Rubin."

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for around a half hour to a packed crowd at the McHale Athletic Center of Wilkes University in Pennsylvania on Friday, where she was interrupted at least twice by pro-Palestinian protesters.

""You're supporting a war criminal,"" one protester shouted about two-thirds of the way into her speech.

A second appeared shortly after the first was ushered out, and shouted for several minutes until he also was removed, crying out ""Free Palestine"" as he was led past the press cordon.

In response, Harris said, ""I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking,"" before moving on with the rest of her address over the interjector's din.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS?'

Harris had been introduced by Mary Grace, a local nurse who said she was a longtime Republican who could not support former President Trump.

After thanking Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Wilkes-Barre Democratic mayor George Brown, all of whom preceded her remarks, she began the crux of her remarks by referencing the ABC News debate from earlier in the week.

""I take it many people here watched it,"" she said, as the reference drew applause.

""You'll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom. And keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page.""

Harris claimed Trump will give billionaires and large corporations ""massive"" tax cuts while also taking a scalpel to entitlements.

She also said the Republican wants to impose a ""Trump sales tax,"" which some observers claim to be a reference to the former president's foreign tariff plans.

Harris also spoke about national division, saying ""we are not going back"" to past years, and instead called for a ""new way forward.""

""We need a President of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us,"" she said.

""People are exhausted with that stuff.""

She also called herself the ""underdog"" in the race, predicting it will be tight in the crucial Commonwealth in which she spoke.

""So Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom?"" Harris asked

Making the trek north on I-81 from Harrisburg, Shapiro - who many believed was the proverbial runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Harris' running mate consideration - offered a booming endorsement shortly before the candidate came onstage.

""We have proved ... that we can 'get sh -- done'!"" Shapiro shouted, referencing his gubernatorial administration's edgy slogan of sorts.

""[We've invested] a historic amount in our public schools... when those kids go to and from schools, they deserve to live in safe communities,"" he added.

""We want everyone to know that you are valued here, whether you choose to be a lawyer or a laborer, we want you to know you belong here [in Pennsylvania].""

""Where you come from, who you love, and who you pray to - you belong and I got your back,"" Shapiro went on, adding Harris' campaign offers a similar vision.

""She and I have both been prosecutors,"" said Shapiro, who served as the separately-elected attorney general during the governorship of predecessor Tom Wolf.

""Kamala Harris has always been for the people... She stood up for our union sisters and brothers.

This time borrowing a line instead from Harris, Shapiro added of Trump's tenure in the White House, ""we are not going back to that.""

""When you go back and look at his record, it was ... less jobs and a whole lot less freedom when Donald Trump was in charge,"" he said, invoking the abortion issue and claiming women lost ""basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.""

Shapiro went on to point to Philadelphia, just 100 miles on the other end of the Northeast Extension from where he spoke, saying that Americans ""declared our independence from a king [there, once] and we are not going back.""

In response to Harris visiting the Commonwealth, PA Trump Team spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital that Pennsylvanians are fed up with the rising costs of groceries, gas, and utilities thanks to the Harris-Biden administration's disastrous inflationary, anti-energy agenda.""

""The choice between another four years of retirees scraping by off ramen under Kamala or a return to the peace, prosperity, and stability of the Trump administration couldn't be easier for Pennsylvanians.""

At the debate in Philadelphia, Harris made reference to the approximate 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania. Outside Port Richmond and the Philadelphia area, the counties in and around where Harris rallied Friday have a sizeable such population.

In Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County, about one-sixth of the population is Polish American, and cities like Nanticoke, Hazleton and Shamokin - in nearby Northumberland County - also host sizable communities.

In that regard, when asked, Desai said Trump is an ""especially easy choice"" for Pennsylvania's Polish-Americans, noting his ""blossoming friendship"" with Polish President Andrzej Duda and his work with Warsaw to build a stronger alliance, including within their shared NATO status.

At the debate, Harris appeared to draw a connection between the Polish-American electorate and her criticisms of how Trump would end the war in Ukraine - which borders Poland:

""Why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,"" Harris said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin."

They have a sort of... champagne problem. Or, ""golden handcuffs"" as it's called.

These homeowners may find they are ""locked in"" to their current home. In order to move to a new home, they have to take out a new mortgage at a much higher rate. It is one of the many problems plaguing the housing market right now.

Stocks raced Friday toward their best week of the year, a bounce which came immediately after major indexes posted their worst weeks of 2024 as the market walks on a tightrope between record highs and sharp losses tied to recession fears.

The ""directionless volatility"" comes as Wall Street oscillates between selloffs spurred by macroeconomic concerns, like the major stock losses after the two most recent jobs reports, and gains from more encouraging economic tidbits and artificial intelligence optimism, like this week's 15% rally for cloud computing company Oracle. ""What the Fed should do next week is clear: Recalibrate the policy rate 50bp lower to adjust for the shifting balance of risks,"" JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote in a Friday note to clients, making the case for the Fed to turn dovish. Essentially, bullish equity investors are looking for a scenario in which economic data shows consistently strong output, lighter inflation and a solid labor market, corporate earnings continue to grow strongly and the Fed rapidly lowers rates to make stock valuations more compelling as debt financing gets cheaper. The variable stock prices are a reflection of the shifting odds bulls' wish list will get fully checked off.

Perhaps no trading session was more indicative of the current market regime than Wednesday's. A morning release of the latest consumer price index which revealed one inflation measure was slightly higher than expected in August sent stocks down considerably as 50 basis-point cut bets evaporated, with the S&P falling as much as 1.6% by midday. Yet the index ended Wednesday up 1.1%, a rarely seen intraday swing mostly inspired by comments from the chief executive of AI darling Nvidia rather than material earnings or economic developments. Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni described the bout as a ""stock market hissy fit"" in a note to clients."

Former President Trump told reporters in California on Friday that Vice President Kamala Harris gave ""one of the dumbest answers"" at this week's presidential debate when she was asked at the beginning to speak about the impact of inflation.

""The first question she was given at the debate. Gave one of the dumbest answers. They were asking about pricing and would you be better off today or four years ago?"" Trump said in Rancho Palos Verdes during a visit to Harris' home state.

""Prices have gone up at numbers that nobody's ever seen before, and just the concept of being better off, she didn't, she didn't give the answer. She talked about when she grew up. Nobody knew what the hell she was talking about,"" Trump said.

As for his performance, Trump said ""I thought the debate was great"" and that ""I thought I did very well, but I was fighting three people.

KAMALA HARRIS PRESSED BY SOME ALLIES TO DO MORE INTERVIEWS

""I was fighting, the crazy left radical lunatics at ABC. I think, considered the worst by me, considered the worst broadcaster out there,"" Trump declared.

Trump also said, ""I'm here today in California with a very simple message for the American people -- we cannot allow Comrade Kamala Harris and the Communist left to do to America what they did to California.

""The state of California is a mess with people leaving and nothing's going to stop them. They going to other states. Some are going to other countries. But what they've done, Gavin Newsom and Kamala and I want to say Kamala moreso -- she destroyed San Francisco and she destroyed the state,"" Trump added.

""When you look at the kind of destruction that's taking place, it's all man-made or woman-made destruction too. It's things that should have never happened,"" Trump said. ""But we're not going to let that happen with four more years of her in the White House.""

He also called Harris, during her time as the San Francisco District attorney, the ""godmother of sanctuary cities"" who was ""right out there at the forefront and also the movement of defunding the police, she was there right at the beginning.

"Riot Fest's Mike Petryshyn On Community, Culture Ahead Of 2024 Festival",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimryan1/2024/09/13/riot-fests-mike-petryshyn-on-community-culture-ahead-of-2024-festival/,2024-09-13T18:21:31Z,"Following the quarantine of early pandemic, live music remains in a state of turmoil.

While traditional live performance made a brisk return beginning in the summer of 2021, a shortsighted industry strategy predicated almost solely upon steadily soaring ticket prices to fill the 2020 shortfall quickly began to irritate fans who correctly sensed a cash grab.

Three years later, the 2024 summer concert season has become one largely defined by canceled and restructured tours, downsized venues and light ticket sales even for established acts, with prices and inflation contributing to the inevitable burst of the concert ticket bubble.

All of which begs the question: what's the role of the music festival in America amidst an unsteady marketplace?

""I mean, this happens. This is not the first time. With Riot Fest, we're gonna be at the 20th one next year. We've seen shifts in the market. And it usually comes from an oversaturation,"" observed Riot Fest co-founder Mike Petryshyn during a recent phone conversation.

""How I look at it is, when the industry closed during COVID, it created this pretty dramatic shift - that we're still in right now. Because everybody was so jacked about going back [to concerts],"" he said. ""It's an extension of that. And then when you see these national and global tours under one promoter, they're dictating a market - almost forcing a market - because there's no competition per se - and exaggerated prices. And then you add this inflationary part,"" said Petryshyn. ""Look how much groceries cost. Basic commodities, right? People are getting nickel and dimed to death. All the while, you have the businesses charging crazy amounts for a single ticket. And when you have this demand of everybody wanting to go - but then inflationary pressures - yeah, it's a bubble that's gonna burst. Because there's not the money from the consumer. Because now, with anything that's tertiary in their lives - like entertainment - people are just more cautious. So, how do you get around that while being independent? Well, it's by being different from everybody else.""

Few American festivals possess the almost impossible backstory that Riot Fest does.

Dreamt up primarily as a celebration of punk rock music, Riot Fest launched in Chicago in 2005 featuring artists like the Dead Kennedys and Bouncing Souls over two evenings in front of 3,500 fans each night indoors at Congress Theater.

Now it's calling card, Riot Fest presented its first unthinkable band reunion in 2006, reforming vaunted Chicago punks Naked Raygun (with acts like The Replacements and Misfits following since).

In 2012, Riot Fest moved outdoors for the first time. And since 2015, the festival has been staged each day in front of about 50,000 concertgoers, a remarkable story of continual independent growth in a summer festival realm generally dominated by corporate entities.

""We're not a mega fest. Right? We are from here! I wasn't born in Chicago but I know Chicago. And Riot would not be around if it wasn't for this city,"" explained Petryshyn, noting the uniqueness of a Chicago concert scene shaped by the presence of a number of independent promoters two decades ago.

""When I moved to Chicago in December '02, I wasn't in the music business or anything. I had never even thought of doing anything like this,"" he said. ""But you look at how the music scene was structured when I moved to Chicago. You had Jam Productions - completely independent. You had [1,100 seat club] Metro, a cultural asset. So many independent promoters. All of these little ones. That's what I walked into. And Live Nation was there of course. But they didn't control any market,"" Petryshyn continued. ""You look at it now, there's just not many indies left. Had it not been like that when Riot Fest started in 2005? I don't think it would've worked in any other city. It just wouldn't have. Because there was a flexibility here. It was very much a free market. And we were able to kind of navigate that. And have growth.""

Over the course of nearly two decades, Riot Fest has continued to evolve, embracing sounds like hip-hop, ska, rock and metal in addition to punk, showcasing artists who embody the punk rock ethos regardless of genre.

This year's festival will feature rap legends and Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Public Enemy, performing Friday, September 20, 2024, one of only a handful of U.S. dates the group has staged since 2016. Metal icons Slayer will reunite Sunday, September 22 for their first performance since 2019, with artists ranging anywhere from St. Vincent to a reunited Sublime taking the stage alongside headliners like Fall Out Boy, Beck and Pavement throughout the weekend.

Over nearly 20 years, Riot Fest has formed an unparalleled bond with its audience, with the independent hand of a fan steering bookings.

""It just organically happened,"" said Petryshyn. ""For us, it's really about the fans, the artists, the community and the culture of it,"" he said. ""It's about the people that do come - the 50,000ish a day. And they want to be there. And they really want to absorb it. Because it only happens once a year. For many, it's kind of like a holiday. People fly in from all over the world. And, yeah, of course it's about the music. But it's also the feeling that they get there that's really hard to quantify,"" said Petryshyn. ""We curate our festivals. We wouldn't be doing this if we didn't love the music,"" he continued, noting the diversity of the Riot Fest lineup in an era where most festival bills look nearly identical. ""The people who are there are there because they want to. It's not a look to be cool or some kind of in the moment, 15 minutes of fame thing. This is a part of who they are. And that can't be disrespected.""

Continuing to stage Riot Fest independently allows organizers to listen to their fanbase while handling an array of festival necessities in house (which, in turn, helps keep ticket prices down).

But with that level of independence can come the occasional hurdle.

Chicago has become a festival hotbed, hosting events like Lollapalooza, Sueños, Pitchfork, Riot Fest, North Coast, Arc and more.

Riot Fest has historically operated without the long term partnership offered by the city of Chicago to larger festivals like Lollapalooza (of whom a controlling interest was obtained by national promotion behemoth Live Nation in 2014 upon the sale of promoter C3 Presents, who began presenting Lollapalooza as a Chicago-based destination festival in 2005).

That lack of a long term deal left Riot Fest forced to cut through red tape in dealings with the Chicago Park District each year, leaving the festival on the receiving end of a frustrating, seemingly perpetually delayed permit approval process.

This year's permit approval was delayed again until June, just three months out from a festival attempting to market and publicize itself without the most basic requirement: a properly permitted location.

As a result, Riot Fest announced a move to a suburban stadium, taking it outside the city of Chicago for the first time.

But last month, in a shocking move, Petryshyn reversed course after a meeting with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, returning Riot Fest to Chicago's Douglass Park, its home in the city's historically underserved North Lawndale neighborhood since 2015.

The Chicago Tribune reports that Riot Fest is responsible for depositing $14 million in Chicago Park District coffers since the move to Douglass Park, with the newspaper's editorial board having dubbed the suburban move a preventable loss to Chicago's west side.

""So, when we announced [the move to the suburbs], we got a call from the mayor's office like, 'Hey, uh, do you want to talk about this?' And I didn't want to. The decision was made. It's too late. After some convincing that we should, we took the meeting. And literally a day or two later I was in the mayor's office,"" explained Petryshyn of meeting with Johnson.

""I had a goal. Which was to describe how I view community and culture,"" he said. ""I went in being quieter. But he let me talk. It was maybe 20 minutes of me just kind of talking. And it had nothing to do with what happened,"" explained the festival co-founder. ""So, we connected. And I did not expect that. I mean, listen, this was the first time we've gotten a call from anybody. This was the first time with any administration or anything,"" he said. ""There was a 0% chance we'd be back if that didn't happen. I know we belong in Chicago - this is our home. But it felt right to move. There was no, 'Oh, we're gonna leverage this...' We never had a conversation with anybody! And it's not like we haven't tried. He was definitely the first one. And he cares. I know he does.""

While Petryshyn remains confident in establishing a long term partnership with the city, Riot Fest's 2024 permit was finally approved by the city of Chicago earlier this week - less than a week and a half before the festival's scheduled start.

Equally as important as listening to fans is hearing from the surrounding community. In North Lawndale, 43% of households live below the poverty level. And while there has been some push back from residents who cheered the temporary suburban move, Riot Fest has forged a unique identity in the neighborhood, continually investing in its longtime home.

""It's pivotal. That's the short answer. It's important. It's a moral thing,"" said Petryshyn of Riot Fest community involvement which has featured job fairs, the inclusion of local vendors, a local talent contest and more as part of their ""Beyond the Fest"" initiative. ""But we've never been front facing with that in anything we do. Because I always thought it was a terrible look to pat yourself on the back for something that should just be imperative in a way. Not to say everything is altruistic - there's a benefit to it, right? But you also want to leave a resonance within the community,"" he explained. ""But, more importantly, it's opportunity. Opportunity is the big one. And it doesn't happen overnight. It's an organic goal. Making sure that we have youth involvement, cultural involvement, and making sure that we talk to residents. We've had hundreds of meetings. I don't even need to have a ticker on that. Even some of the opposition - we're not really opposition too much anymore. Because we're all working together. We have the same goals.""

The American festival model is one frequently criticized as boring and stale. Lineups look virtually the same across the country with little local flare.

But as an independent festival, Riot Fest has thrived and grown due to its desire to continually evolve, staging new offerings while creating the immersive fan experience that has become elusive elsewhere.

This year, for the first time, Riot Fest will stage a new installation dubbed RiotLand, one hearkening back to the children's books of yore in its guise as a ""choose your own adventure"" exhibit.

An interactive map is coming soon but this year at Riot Fest, fans can look forward to RiotLand celebrations of historic Chicago venues like Metro and Fireside Bowl as well as the debut of the Riot Fest Historical Society, a tongue-in-cheek collaboration with the Punk Rock Museum (one co-founded by vocalist and bassist Fat Mike of L.A. punks NOFX, who will perform each of the three nights this year at Riot Fest before calling it a day next month).

RiotLand will also celebrate the work of director Kevin Smith, whose 1994 directorial debut Clerks remains one of the most significant independent films ever made.

""So the idea of RiotLand, even though it didn't really have a name, the tenets of it started in 2014,"" explained Petryshyn. ""And when any of that stuff was mentioned throughout the years - about extending ourselves into more of a kind of immersive culture - that's really what RiotLand is. And we're doing it this year. It won't be to the full scale of what we were going to do [in the suburbs]. But, yeah, we made sure it happened. Because it's kind of the future of what we're going to be doing,"" said the festival co-founder.

""On the music venue end, you've got Metro: cultural asset and directly related to what Riot Fest is and the people there. There's a commonality of sorts,"" said Petryshyn. ""But then you have Kevin Smith. We're [building] a Quik Stop at Riot Fest. And how is Clerks not related to what we do? Of course it is. Independent movie that came out of nowhere and changed culture,"" he continued. ""We're also doing the Riot Fest Historical Society. That's a big one for us. This is also gonna have some of our history in there - a lot of self-deprecating stuff,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Because we're good at that - and funny about what we do because we're all weird over here. But that's the stuff that our crowd loves. It's a culture thing. And it's a binding.""

While planning this year's festival essentially required coordinating it with two venues in mind, upping an already high level of difficulty, Petryshyn remains confident in the possibility of forging a long term partnership with the city of Chicago as Riot Fest returns to Douglass Park next weekend.

""He planted a seed without knowing. It's what we always wanted,"" said Petryshyn of his meeting with Johnson. ""It's gonna be awesome. The lineup is great. I'm so excited. Back to the beginning of our conversation: there's no lineup like ours. I'm very proud of that,"" he said. ""As I talk about cultural assets, you'll never really hear me call Riot Fest a cultural asset. It's too self-reflective. But to hear people consider it a cultural asset, including the mayor's office, that means the world to me,"" said Petryshyn, reflecting following a long pause. ""I guess along the way, we built something here that's important and we're part of the fabric that has meaning here. And that is worth a life's work I think."""
Opinion | What Harris can learn from the latest polling on Trump-leaning rural voters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-polls-rural-voters-rcna170961,2024-09-13T18:17:06Z,"Simply telling rural voters about what Democrats have done or will do for them won't be enough.

Kamala Harris knows what every Democrat knows: Their party isn't popular in rural America, and that's a political problem. Just as President Joe Biden tried to change that -- both in the 2020 election and in the White House -- Harris is attempting to convince rural voters that she has something to offer them. But it isn't working -- at least not yet.

On Thursday, Politico published a two-page agenda that is part of the Harris campaign's efforts to address the needs of rural communities. The document mostly pledges to continue and expand programs already in place under the Biden administration, and it emphasizes the admiration and affection Harris and her running mate have for rural people. ""Vice President Harris and Governor Walz know that rural America is the foundation of our country,"" reads the first sentence. Try to imagine Donald Trump saying something as complimentary about the cities where support for him is as thin as it is for Democrats in rural areas.

The Harris campaign's interest in rural voters is unsurprising, given that they punch above their weight at the ballot box: The structures of the Electoral College and the Senate give small rural states disproportionate influence in the presidential vote. Republican gerrymanders leveraged the GOP margins among rural voters to control state legislatures.

It wasn't all that long ago that Democrats did better with rural voters -- not winning, but keeping the margins at least somewhat close. In 2008, Barack Obama got 43% of the rural votes, and did especially well in rural areas of battleground states his campaign would blanket with staff members and volunteers.

But in subsequent years, rural voters -- more specifically, rural whites -- moved right. According to the Pew Research Center's data, Donald Trump won the rural vote by 59% to 34% in 2016; among only rural whites, his victory was 62% to 30%. Four years later, he did even better, winning the overall rural vote by 65% to 34% and the rural white vote by 71% to 28%.

Democrats in turn spent less and less time appealing for their votes. That turned out to be bad not just for Democrats but also for rural people themselves. ""We pretty much own rural and small-town America,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in 2022, and the GOP took that to mean that it didn't need to actually deliver practical improvements in the lives of the people who kept voting for it. After all, Trump succeeded with these voters not because he had brought prosperity to rural Americans, whose deep and profound problems in economic opportunity, health care access and infrastructure hadn't noticeably improved. Instead, Republicans told rural voters not to expect anything real from their government, as though all they should ask of candidates is a steady diet of anger and resentment -- which Trump was happy to give them.

The usual advice from rural activists to Democrats is appealingly straightforward: Show up, listen, treat us with respect, demonstrate that you want to help our communities thrive. Biden did just that: His 2020 campaign put out a lengthy plan for rural development, and he talked about rural Americans with the empathy and respect Democrats are always told has been missing. ""You know, it really does go to the issue of dignity, how you treat people,"" he said. ""I think they just feel forgotten."" The kind words and white papers didn't work: Biden lost rural voters by an even bigger margin than Hillary Clinton did four years before.

But once he took office, he kept trying. The major legislation Biden signed, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law, set aside billions of dollars for rural communities. The recent announcement of $7.3 billion in grants for clean energy projects in rural areas is just one example. The Biden White House earmarked billions to bring broadband internet access to rural areas, increase health care access in those areas and create the Rural Partners Network to coordinate government programs and aid in such communities. Biden and administration officials regularly travel around the country to promote these efforts and extol rural Americans' importance.

In practical terms, those efforts have been a mixed bag. Some have injected new life into rural places. Others have had troubling rollouts, with rural broadband a particularly maddening challenge. But in one way, the picture is unambiguous: Politically, the administration's rural efforts have been a bust. In a new Pew poll of nearly 10,000 Americans, Trump is beating Harris by 66% to 32% among all rural voters and 71% to 28% among rural whites. In other words, Trump is doing almost exactly as well as he did four years ago.

Harris hasn't been a candidate for very long, so maybe things will change. There are still weeks to go, and the vice president is making a concerted effort to reach out to rural voters. She picked Tim Walz, a native of rural Nebraska, as her running mate. After their convention, the two went on a bus tour of southern Georgia, stopping in rural areas that seldom see presidential candidates. The campaign recently hired Matt Hildreth of the progressive Rural Organizing group to lead its outreach efforts to rural voters (Trump has no rural outreach director).

Clearly, Harris is serious about improving her party's recent showing in rural areas. Perhaps these attempts will show results. And there's no longer much question that Democratic administrations are better for rural America than Republican ones, because Democrats are the only ones even trying to help. If Harris becomes president, she's sure to do the same.

But recent history shows that simply telling rural voters about what Democrats have done or will do for them won't be enough. Nor is showing ""respect"" sufficient to change people's minds. Democrats also have to convince people that Republicans are the ones who really disrespect them, by taking their votes for granted and doing nothing to improve their lives. Democrats need to launch an unapologetic attack on Republicans in rural areas for betraying their constituents' trust. If they don't, these voters will remain decidedly pro-GOP, and Democrats' efforts will continue to go unrewarded."
Trump's Crypto Gamble Threatens Bitcoin Policy Progress,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2024/09/13/trumps-crypto-gamble-threatens-bitcoin-policy-progress/,2024-09-13T18:04:56Z,"Donald Trump earned substantial goodwill from bitcoin advocates when he appeared at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. His presence there signaled to many that he might be coming around to the importance of bitcoin, especially as the conversation around sound money continues to evolve in political and economic circles. His recent alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been outspoken about bitcoin's critical role in the future of the U.S. economy, further bolstered the belief that Trump was beginning to understand bitcoin's unique potential. Yet, with the announcement of his family's new decentralized finance (DeFi) project, World Liberty Financial, this positive momentum is at risk of slowing down or even stopping entirely.

The project, which ties Trump's name to a crypto initiative rather than bitcoin, threatens to confuse and alienate his supporters -- both bitcoiners and his conservative base. Worse yet, this misguided foray into the world of DeFi could reinforce dangerous misconceptions, leading his most ardent backers to miss out on the opportunity that bitcoin presents as a hedge against inflation and a pathway to long-term, generational wealth.

The first and most critical point to understand here is that bitcoin is not crypto. This is a distinction that has become increasingly clear to those who study the space, yet it's one that many still fail to grasp. Bitcoin stands alone as a decentralized, deflationary, and censorship-resistant store of value. It is not reliant on centralized governance, nor does it need constant tinkering with its monetary policy to maintain its integrity. Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins and its decentralized infrastructure make it sound money, fundamentally different from the speculative and often risky projects seen throughout the broader cryptocurrency space, especially in the world of DeFi.

DeFi platforms like World Liberty Financial are fueled by a completely different set of values and starting assumptions. These projects, which tend to be short lived and risky, have a track record of coding errors, hacks, and governance failures. The fact that Dough Finance, the precursor to World Liberty Financial, was hacked for almost $2 million in July further illustrates the risks inherent to this sector. Unlike bitcoin, which has proven its security and resilience over the past 15 years, DeFi projects often stumble, leaving investors exposed to catastrophic losses.

Bitcoin is not just another asset; it represents a separation of money from state -- a principle that aligns deeply with conservative values of individual liberty, limited government, and economic sovereignty.

When Trump spoke at the Bitcoin conference, many in the bitcoin community began to view him as a potential ally in their fight for financial opportunity. His growing partnership with RFK Jr., who has spoken intelligently about the value of bitcoin as a tool for protecting civil liberties and preserving economic freedom, gave further hope that Trump was beginning to recognize bitcoin's potential to reshape the U.S. economy for the better.

By associating himself with World Liberty Financial, Trump is inadvertently lumping bitcoin together with speculative DeFi tokens in the minds of his followers, despite the fact that the two couldn't be more different in terms of risk, philosophy, and long-term viability.

Worse yet, Trump's decision will confuse his MAGA and conservative base, many of whom are just beginning to entertain the idea that Bitcoin could be a viable alternative to gold. Gold has long been the default ""sound money"" for conservatives, valued for its scarcity and historical role as a store of value. Convincing these traditionalists to see bitcoin as the future of sound money has been a slow but steady process. Trump's association with World Liberty Financial risks setting back this progress by muddying the waters -- associating the gold-like properties of Bitcoin with the speculative frenzy of crypto projects.

Trump may see a short-term financial gain from this venture, as hype-driven investors pour into this project. But the long-term negative consequences could be substantial. Not only will Trump risk losing the support of bitcoiners, but he will also erode trust among his conservative base, especially those who are beginning to understand bitcoin's potential.

If World Liberty Financial fails, as many DeFi projects do, Trump's base may mistakenly credit this failure to inherent risks with all digital assets - risks that bitcoin itself does not have. If conservatives turn away from bitcoin, they will miss out on the profound benefits it offers: sound money that is deflationary, unconfiscatable, and a hedge against the eventuality of a currency crisis in the U.S. This would be a massive lost opportunity to leverage bitcoin as a tool for preservation of American values through a turbulent time.

This isn't necessarily the end of the road for Trump or his movement. He has made missteps in the past and managed to recover. It's worth noting that many strong advocates for bitcoin, including Michael Saylor, once dismissed its potential. Saylor famously tweeted that bitcoin would go the way of online gambling, only to later become one of its most vocal proponents. Similarly, Elon Musk has recently stumbled by endorsing Dogecoin, a project with no use case and no future, despite previously being bullish on bitcoin.

Trump, like others, may come around to see the difference between bitcoin and the speculative world of DeFi. The concern, however, is that Trump's influence is so vast that his endorsement of a project like World Liberty Financial could cause many of his supporters to be misled on a massive scale. This could delay the inevitable adoption of Bitcoin and harm the very values that both Trump and Bitcoin advocates support -- financial sovereignty, sound money, and the separation of money from state.

In aligning himself with World Liberty Financial, Trump risks undermining not only his credibility with bitcoiners but also the long-term financial well-being of his supporters. Bitcoin is not crypto, and any attempt to conflate the two only serves to mislead those who are just beginning to understand the profound opportunity bitcoin offers. Trump's venture into DeFi is a step in the wrong direction, one that could cause lasting damage to both the MAGA movement and the broader push for sound money. The hope among conservative bitcoiners now is that Trump will see the error of this path and, like others before him, come to fully understand that bitcoin -- not crypto -- is the future of finance."
Markets Crave A 50 Basis Point Cut From The Federal Reserve,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/09/13/markets-crave-a-50-basis-point-cut-from-the-federal-reserve/,2024-09-13T17:24:52Z,"Next week the Federal Reserve will very likely cut interest rates, for the first time since the COVID related rate cutting cycle. Recall of course that at the end of this speedy sets of cuts, most of the leading central banks had declared inflation to be 'transitory'. The Fed cut will come on the back of a series of rate cuts from 'elder' central banks - the Bank of England, Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank, as well as the European Central Bank from whom we had another rate cut last week.

The anticipated move by the Federal Reserve is instructive in several respects. Market based interest rates are lower than Fed rates and many investors expect (or rather crave) the Fed to make a 50 basis point cut, as opposed to a 'standard' one of 25 basis points. At the weekend, the lead headline in the Financial Times read 'Investors raise bets on bumper half-point Fed rate cut'.

This is yet another sign of monetary addiction - the result of the conditioning of investors to financial liquidity. In mid-August, following a dip in the stock market, I wrote that the idea of the 'Fed put' - the notion that the Fed would react to a fall in asset prices by cutting rates - is very much alive in markets.

The market dip led several seasoned and apparently credible investors to call for an emergency cut in rates. However, the Fed has only ever taken such dramatic action in the thick of deep crises (LTCM/Russian economic collapse, the dot.com collapse, 9/11, the global financial crisis and the COVID crisis). Similarly, it has not begun a rate cutting cycle with a 50 basis point cut, outside of financial crises. There is no financial crisis today (though plenty of mounting financial risks such as very high debt levels), but a crisis of expectations.

That crisis of expectations is at play as investors position for the Fed meeting next week. In my experience, the Fed is, in normal economic conditions, a cautious and slow-moving beast, and it would be untypical for them to begin a rate cutting phase with an outsized rate cut. To do so would suggest that they are in a hurry to correct a mistake of their own making.

To the extent that investor behaviour demands a 50-basis point cut, this recalls the quip from Paul Samuelson, the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, that the market has predicted nine out of the last five recessions.

Set against this apparent concern by investors (do they fear a recession or desire lower rates?) is a debate around a relatively new economic rule of thumb called the Sahm Rule, named after research by economist Claudia Sahm at the Federal Reserve. Her rule states that when the medium-term unemployment rate rises an impending recession is signalled (the three month average of unemployment needs to rise by 50 basis points). It is a surprisingly simple rule that appears to have prefigured eleven US downturns going back to 1953. Sahm's aim in establishing a reliable rule was that stimulus checks can be sent out at the outset of recessions (as opposed to waiting for GDP data to indicate a recession).

I am tempted to trump the Sahm Rule with two observations.

The first is Goodhart's Law, named after Bank of England and LSE economist Charles Goodhart which states that 'when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure', or more colloquially that fame kills a good model.

More seriously, most of the last ten business cycles were conventional ones, whereas this business cycle bears the scars of reversing demographics, the lingering effects of COVID fiscal policy and labour market distortions (work from home) not to mention the contortions of strategic industrial policy (i.e. the CHIP's Act, Inflation Reduction Act) and the political ramifications of high inflation and immigration. It is anything but a typical business cycle, and very hard to read.

Somewhat unusually at this stage in the cycle government finances are weak (from France to the US) whilst the large corporates of the Western world are in a generally healthy financial state. Of the major economies, China poses the greatest risk to the downside in the near-term.

With different components of the US economy moving in different directions, my expectation is for a slowdown than a deeper recession (this may eventually come at the end of 2025 if inflation rises again). Equally, I expect the Fed to make a series of rate cuts rather than deep cutting cycle. If that view is correct, the interest rates market will be very volatile, as investors periodically over react to data points and price in 'booms' and busts'.

Expect a market tantrum next week with investors complaining that the Fed is behind the curve. Samuelson would tell us that the curve has got it wrong."
'Respect our warriors': House GOP veteran proposes key benefit to aid deployed service members,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/respect-warriors-house-gop-veteran-proposes-key-benefit-aid-deployed-service-members,2024-09-13T17:17:25Z,"EXCLUSIVE: An Army veteran and House Foreign Affairs member on Thursday introduced a bill to eliminate taxes for all U.S. service members deployed overseas.

Rep. Warren Davidson's, R-Ohio, bill, the BRAVE Act, would amend the IRS code to expand that exemption to include not just designated combat zones, but all non-permanently deployed service members operating abroad. Currently, those deployed to combat zones do not pay taxes on their salary.

""When our soldiers deploy for combat, they don't pay taxes. When they deploy around the world to promote peace and deter war, they pay taxes. The Brave Act makes it clear: reward both of these deployments -- respect our warriors,"" Davidson said.

Combat zones where service members' pay is tax-exempt are decided on an ad hoc basis by executive order. Currently, roughly a dozen countries and regions qualify as such, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Somali and the Sinai.

US, IRAQI OFFICIALS NEARING PLAN TO REMOVE US TROOPS AS SOON AS NEXT YEAR

However, U.S. service members are deployed to roughly 175 countries. Service members deployed to places like Chad or the Indo-Pacific pay full taxes.

""The 'Brave Act' ensures that those serving in foreign deployments receive the full tax relief they deserve, maintaining fairness for all service members,"" Davidson continued.

U.S. forces have struggled with recruitment numbers for years, in part due to concerns that service member pay does not keep pace with inflation or with the private sector.

AIR FORCE F-35S MAKE HISTORIC LANDING ON HIGHWAY IN FINDLAND

The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act included a 4.5% increase for all service members and a 15% boost for junior enlisted troops. That bill must now be negotiated with the Senate before final passage.

7 Key Benefits For Parents To Consider When Choosing A New Employer,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecarter/2024/09/13/7-key-benefits-for-parents-to-consider-when-choosing-a-new-employer/,2024-09-13T17:10:45Z,"Last month, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory on the mental health and well-being of parents, highlighting the urgent need to better support parents, caregivers, and families to foster healthier, thriving communities.

Over the past decade, parents have reported significantly higher stress levels than other adults, with 33% of parents experiencing high stress in the past month compared to 20% of non-parents. Prolonged stress can harm the mental health of parents and caregivers, ultimately affecting their children.

In honor of National Working Parents Day on September 16, it's more important than ever for employers to recognize the unique stressors that working parents face and offer benefits that support their well-being. A well-rounded benefits package can play a pivotal role in alleviating stress and improving the health of employees and their families.

Experts from Segal Benz, a leading employee benefits and HR consulting firm, and Sadie Funk, National Director of Best Place for Working Parents, share critical insights on key benefits to look for when job hunting.

Parents are more likely to experience high stress, making mental health support a top priority. Seek employers that offer access to counseling services, mental health hotlines, and EAPs tailored to parents and caregivers. These programs often provide therapy, mental health resources for children, and coaching to help parents manage work-life balance. Also, look for employers offering mental health days and wellness programs focused on mindfulness, stress reduction, and self-care.

""Look for benefits that are designed especially for children or advertised to provide resources to all ages. EAPs often include children's access to therapy. Some companies and insurers provide access to digital resources -- educational materials and even virtual therapy -- that specialize in treating kids."" -- Sarah Gunderson, Senior Consultant at Segal Benz

Parental leave, including extended maternity, paternity, and paid family leave, can alleviate stress by allowing parents time to bond with their children and adjust to caregiving roles. Companies that offer these benefits help parents return to work more focused and less stressed, benefiting both the family and the employer.

""Parental leave is a must-have benefits program element to attract talent to the organization. The ideal parental leave benefit provides baby bonding leave to all parents, helpful resources to mothers, continuous and intermittent paid leave options, and comfortable transitions back into the workforce."" -- Chris Goldsmith, Vice President, Health Consultant at Segal Benz

Flexible work arrangements, such as remote work, flexible hours, and job-sharing, can greatly reduce parental stress by helping parents manage their responsibilities and improve their work-life balance. Employers that offer these options are more likely to retain working parents who might otherwise face challenges staying in the workforce. Employees should proactively approach flexibility by demonstrating how these options align with the company's business needs. Presenting a well-thought-out plan showing how you can maintain productivity and performance will help build trust with your potential employer and create a clear path to success for you and the organization.

""For employees, having open dialogue with your manager is a first step to advocate for more flexibility. You may find that there's more flexibility available than assumed."" -- Jennifer Benz, Senior Vice President at Segal Benz

The cost and availability of quality childcare are major stressors for working parents. Look for employers that offer on-site childcare, subsidies, or partnerships with local providers, ensuring reliable support for parents.

""Many parents find childcare cost-prohibitive, as there is a rising need for daycares and preschools, but a shortage of providers. Some organizations provide stipends to help offset the cost of day care, or even provide workspaces with adjacent or in-house childcare facilities. Backup childcare is also a popular benefit so parents have options when their usual care cannot be accessed."" -- Caroline Leggio, Organizational Effectiveness Consultant at Segal Benz

Financial stress adds to the challenges faced by working parents, particularly those caring for children with special needs or health issues. Working parents must thoroughly assess their employer's healthcare benefits to ensure they meet their family's unique needs. This includes evaluating coverage for pediatric, dental, vision, and mental health services, as well as understanding associated costs like premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Conversely, employers should also support parents through financial wellness programs that offer planning guidance, savings assistance, and help to manage healthcare costs. These resources empower parents to make informed decisions and alleviate financial stress.

""Many workers experienced a lot of economic uncertainty through the pandemic and then high stress due to the impact of inflation on just about everything, including food and childcare. Participating in retirement plans, like 401(k) plans, and having access to financial wellness resources, like financial planning or unbiased financial advice, definitely helps boost how people feel about their finances."" -- Megan Yost, Senior Vice President, Engagement Strategist at Segal Benz

Access to coaching, workshops, and support groups can help parents manage stress and mental health challenges. A supportive workplace community fosters connections among parents, reducing isolation and creating a space to share solutions.

""Leaning on other parents through employee resource groups or internal networks can help you learn what's working for others and what is possible within your company policies."" -- Jennifer Benz, Senior Vice President at Segal Benz

Comprehensive health insurance is essential for working parents. When evaluating a benefits package, prioritize your family's current and future needs to find the support that best enhances your work-life success. Review coverage for pediatric, dental, vision, and mental health services, and consider costs like premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Assess the plan's flexibility, wellness programs, and long-term suitability to ensure it aligns with your family's healthcare needs and financial situation. Comparing plans, understanding employer contributions, and exploring additional benefits will help you choose the best option for your family.

""We know that 80% of employees would choose additional benefits over a pay raise and 88% of participants ranked better health, dental and vision insurance as the top benefits priority for employees, making health benefits a critical decision for job seekers, especially when these decisions could impact their child's health."" - Sadie Funk, National Director of Best Place for Working Parents

""Many employers offer so much more than health insurance and retirement benefits, including benefits geared toward people starting families and working parents with children of all ages. This can include adoption or surrogacy reimbursements, backup child and elder care benefits, and access to college planning programs."" -- Megan Yost, Senior Vice President, Engagement Strategist at Segal Benz

Best Place for Working Parents also offers a list of the top 10 research-based, family-friendly policies, which include company-paid health coverage, parental leave, nursing benefits, childcare support, and flexibility. They also create an Annual National Trends Report to compare company benefits by industry, size, and region.

Employers that support working parents help create a healthier, more engaged workforce, which benefits everyone. Advocating for comprehensive benefits is not just about fairness -- it's a smart strategy that can improve retention, attract talent, and foster a more inclusive workplace. As you job hunt, look for employers that genuinely value and support parents, creating a culture that nurtures its people and ensures long-term success for both employees and the company."
Mastercard Outpaces Visa In Growth With Low Volatility Risk,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/09/13/mastercard-outpaces-visa-in-growth-with-low-volatility-risk/,2024-09-13T16:17:58Z,"Risks include rising operating expenses, growing fintech competition, direct payment channels bypassing traditional cards and increasing cybersecurity threats that could impact profitability.

Mastercard Inc. (MA, Financial) is currently the most attractive payment services investment if one is looking for stability, high growth, a robust moat and relatively low risk. I estimate that it is fairly valued when compared to Visa (V, Financial) and PayPal (PYPL, Financial) on future fundamental growth rates and current valuation multiples.

In addition, I consider the company's emerging market position to be strong and, despite growing consolidation from regional payment providers in Asia posing a competitive threat, I am confident in management's strategy, brand cultivation and maintenance to continue to lead as one of the dominant payment companies in the world for the foreseeable future.

Operational analysis

I am incredibly bullish on Mastercard as a long-term investment for its low volatility. This is supported by its diversified revenue streams and moat in payment solutions, which are only surpassed by Visa.

A significant driver of Mastercard's growth is its cross-border transactions at the moment, which are rising due to heightened international travel and e-commerce. In the second quarter, cross-border volumes grew by 17%, highlighting the importance of this segment. This is one of the core reasons why the company is currently expected to deliver stronger future growth than Visa because it is more strategically positioned with a focus on expansion in emerging markets right now. Mastercard's strategic investments in regions like Asia, the Middle East and Africa are a reason to be bullish, but Visa still holds a larger global market share despite being operational in fewer countries.

Mastercard is not only facing competition from Visa, but also from smaller credit and online payment providers, including American Express (AXP, Financial), Discover (DFS, Financial), PayPal, Stripe and others. American Express is particularly noteworthy because it targets high-income consumers and businesses, so I think Mastercard will be able to particularly benefit from focusing on emerging markets and affordable payment solutions; this is how I think management can structure Mastercard for continued higher growth rates than both Visa and American Express moving forward.

The threat from PayPal and Stripe is more nuanced, but it does deserve attention, especially as novel payment solutions like cryptocurrency become more widespread and Web3 technologies begin to transform online payment solutions. Stripe has notably experienced an incredible CAGR of 69.50% in revenue since 2017. The company specializes in facilitating online payments for internet businesses, making it a key competitor to Visa in the digital economy.

In addition, we are seeing major payment networks in Asia, like UnionPay, JCB and RuPay, consolidate market share in local markets and also begin to expand internationally. UnionPay is the largest card issuer in the world by number of cards, with over 9 billion cards in circulation. While China is its core market, it is now accepted in 183 countries and regions. JCB, originally from Japan, is now accepted in over 190 countries and regions. Finally, RuPay, which is India's domestic card network, has rapidly grown its market share in India, surpassing Visa in terms of the number of transactions in the country. RuPay is accepted in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

The international markets are definitely competitive, but Mastercard has a strong position because it closely leads alongside Visa in brand recognition and trust, as well as in technological innovation. I consider reputation to be one of the hardest elements to develop in business and the strongest factor in long-term success once it has been cultivated. Mastercard's global brand provides it with power in emerging markets that may be unfamiliar with the less-renowned players.

On the note of technological advancement, Mastercard has recently realigned its organizational structure to include a dedicated data and AI group. This is going to support the company in enhancing operational security, as well as improve the customer experience. In addition, management has decided to invest in technologies like contactless payments, tokenization and biometric authentication to enhance security and convenience for consumers. This is far ahead of other smaller payment companies, so I believe management can continue to consolidate its moat by aggressively investing in seamless payment technology to drive customer acquisition and retention.

Financial analysis

Currently, I consider Mastercard to be fairly valued, as although its price-earnings ratio without non-recurring items and its price-sales ratio is higher than that of Visa and PayPal, its future growth rates in earnings per share and sales support this. I believe the market has been efficient here with both Visa and Mastercard, with PayPal the obvious outlier, as its earnings growth is anticipated to be very strong moving forward, but it is clearly undervalued on both ratios.

That being said, I much prefer Mastercard as an investment because sentiment surrounding the stock is much stronger than for PayPal. This is made evident by comparing the price growth history of the companies.

Historically, both Mastercard and Visa offer much more stability than PayPal, and I believe this is the big attraction of both companies as investments. We can also see that over the past decade, Mastercard has outperformed Visa in price growth. I believe this is a trend that will continue, particularly for the reasons outlined in my operational analysis above.

PayPal is currently viewed as a turnaround play, and a new management team is working diligently to reinvigorate the company for better future returns following the current undervaluation. However, this is not an ideal or low-risk place to invest, in my opinion. Instead, Mastercard offers diversification, moat, revenue and earnings stability, and global dependency to sustain strong investor sentiment through natural cycles of macroeconomic conditions. It also offers the competitive price growth that one may be looking for from the value returns of PayPal, but without the value trap risk.

One area of weakness for Mastercard at the moment is its gross margin, which is currently 76.42%, down from its 10-year median of 78.18%. In the second quarter, the company's operating expenses increased by 12%, which could be a result of inflationary pressures around the world. Furthermore, the company has seen an increase in payment network rebates and incentives, which grew by 14% in the second quarter, reducing net revenue and affecting the gross margin. Mastercard is providing these incentives to maintain and grow its customer base, but these current pressures are still a strain. Despite the negative impact on its gross margin, the company has managed to maintain a net margin of 46.45%, which is significantly up from its 10-year median of 40.65%. This shows strong operational efficiency and profitability strategies, which is arguably a reason to be bullish.

Risk analysis

There is currently a growing risk for Mastercard in the emergence of direct payment channels. Retailers like Target (TGT, Financial) have introduced their own payment methods, such as its Circle Card, to directly debit customer bank accounts. I believe there is a significant threat here that merchants who are advanced technologically and focused on profitability incentives will bypass Mastercard and Visa's card solutions to provide a more lucrative shopping process. This is because by using direct payment channels, merchants can save on interchange fees, which typically range from 1% to 3% of the transaction value.

I am also currently observing the rise of innovative fintech companies, like Revolut, Block (SQ, Financial) and cryptocurrency exchanges, which are integrating digital wallets, peer-to-peer payment platforms and buy now, pay later services. In response to this threat, Visa is combatting fintech companies with its Visa Everywhere initiative, which is creating an ecosystem to embed new fintech solutions into its platform. This is crucial for Mastercard's management to focus on, too, as the company needs to consolidate its position in the evolving digital payments market, and network integration is arguably the most critical strategy for it to continue to secure its moat. Mastercard has its Start Path program to support early-stage fintech startups by offering them access to Mastercard's capabilities and introducing them to funding.

Lastly, the cyberthreat landscape is evolving, and as fields like quantum computing and artificial intelligence become more pronounced, so will the tactics of cybercriminals. Cybercriminals are using AI to create sophisticated impersonations of customers and executives, so Mastercard needs to be particularly well-secured against fraud in the future. This ties in with the growing capability for automated attacks, for example, using AI to carry out Bank Identification Number attacks, which is a process where criminals use automated software to test various credit card numbers simultaneously. In addition, quantum computing poses a future threat to current encryption standards, as it could potentially break RSA cryptography, making digital transactions insecure. This is why management is preparing for quantum-resistant cryptography. However, the whole evolving field and Mastercard's need to keep up with advanced threats is costly. In tandem with other digital payment providers, it could inhibit earnings growth related to security costs for extended periods.

Conclusion

I consider Mastercard to be a low-risk, high-growth investment. It offers low volatility, which is similar to that of Visa, but it is currently anticipated to beat Visa in future growth rates based on the Wall Street consensus. It has also managed to beat Visa in price growth over the past decade.

I am particularly bullish on Mastercard for its position in emerging markets, which I expect to be a core growth driver for it moving forward. Despite novel threats in fintech, the company is positioning itself well to capitalize on partnerships with new companies and management is taking a proactive approach to secure its moat from the evolving digital threat landscape. Based on its high growth rates and valuation multiples compared to peers, I consider Mastercard fairly valued and, as a result, rate it a buy amid continued low-volatility growth that I expect over the next five to 10 years.

Best 5 Stocks For Beginners With Little Money,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/stocks-for-beginners-with-little-money/,2024-09-13T15:37:21Z,"Investing in the stock market can be an excellent way to grow your wealth over time, but it can seem daunting for beginners with limited funds. The stock market is a platform where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. It offers opportunities for individuals to become partial owners of successful businesses and benefit from their growth.

For beginners, investing in stocks is essential for several reasons. It can help beat inflation, provide a means to save for long-term goals, and offer the potential for higher returns compared to traditional savings accounts. However, with thousands of stocks, starting with those that offer stability and growth potential and align with your financial goals is crucial.

Read on for the types of stocks suitable for beginners and the factors to consider when choosing stocks. You'll also find five stocks that could be good starting points for novice investors with limited capital.

Blue-chip stocks represent shares of large, well-established companies with a history of stable performance. These companies are typically household names and leaders in their respective industries. Blue-chip stocks can be an excellent choice for beginners due to their reliability and lower volatility than smaller, less established companies.

Investing in blue-chip stocks offers beginners the opportunity to own a piece of companies with proven track records. While they may not provide the explosive growth potential of some smaller companies, they often offer steady growth and, in many cases, regular dividend payments. This combination of stability and potential income makes blue-chip stocks attractive for those just starting their investment journey.

Dividend stocks are shares of companies that distribute a portion of their earnings to shareholders regularly, typically quarterly. These stocks can be particularly appealing to beginners as they provide a steady income stream and potential capital appreciation.

For investors starting with limited funds, dividend stocks offer a way to see tangible returns on their investment relatively quickly. This can be encouraging and help reinforce good investing habits. Moreover, many dividend-paying companies are well-established and financially stable, which can provide a sense of security for new investors. Reinvesting these dividends can also accelerate portfolio growth through compound interest.

Growth stocks represent companies expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market. These are often found in innovative or rapidly expanding industries. While they can be more volatile than blue chip or dividend stocks, they offer the potential for significant capital appreciation.

Growth stocks can be an exciting addition to a portfolio for beginners with higher risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. They provide exposure to cutting-edge industries and the potential for substantial returns. However, new investors must understand that growth stocks may pay little dividends, as these companies often reinvest profits to fuel further growth. Balancing growth stocks with more stable investments can help beginners build a well-rounded portfolio.

Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are not individual stocks but rather collections of stocks that track a specific market index or sector. These investment vehicles offer beginners an easy way to achieve instant diversification, which is crucial for managing risk.

Index funds and ETFs can be desirable for those starting with little money. They allow investors to gain exposure to a broad range of stocks with a single purchase, often at a lower cost than buying individual stocks. This approach simplifies the investment process, reduces the need for extensive research on individual companies, and provides a level of diversification that would be difficult to achieve when starting with limited capital. Many ETFs also have low minimum investment requirements, making them accessible to beginners.

When evaluating stocks for beginners with limited funds, several key factors were considered:

Apple is a global technology company that designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. It's known for its iconic products like the iPhone, iPad, Mac and services like Apple Music and Apple TV+.

Apple is an excellent choice for beginners due to its strong brand recognition, financial stability and consistent performance. The company has a diverse product lineup and a growing services segment, which provides multiple revenue streams. Apple's loyal customer base and ecosystem of products contribute to its competitive advantage.

For beginners, Apple offers a combination of growth potential and stability. While its dividend yield is relatively low, the company has a history of increasing dividends and conducting share buybacks, which can benefit shareholders. The stock's liquidity makes it easy to buy and sell, and its inclusion in many index funds means beginners can gain exposure to Apple even through diversified investment vehicles.

Microsoft is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers. It's best known for products like Windows operating systems, the Office suite and Azure cloud services.

Microsoft is an attractive option for beginner investors due to its strong market position, diversified revenue streams and growth potential in cloud computing. The company's transition to a subscription-based model for many of its products provides steady, recurring revenue.

Microsoft offers a blend of stability and growth for those new to investing. Its consistent dividend payments, though modest, add to the stock's appeal. The company's involvement in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and mixed reality presents opportunities for future growth. Microsoft's large market cap and inclusion in significant indexes also make it a relatively stable investment, suitable for those starting with limited funds.

The Coca-Cola Company is a multinational beverage corporation known for manufacturing, retailing and marketing nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups. Its flagship product, Coca-Cola, is one of the world's most recognized brands.

Coca-Cola is an excellent choice for beginner investors looking for stability and income. As a blue-chip stock with a history dating back to 1886, Coca-Cola offers the reliability of an established, global brand. The company's strong market position and diversified product portfolio provide a buffer against economic fluctuations.

Coca-Cola's attractive dividend yield is a significant draw for beginners with limited funds. The company has increased its dividend for 59 consecutive years, making it a ""Dividend King."" This consistent income can be especially encouraging for new investors. While Coca-Cola may not offer the rapid growth of some tech stocks, its stability and income potential make it a solid foundation for a beginner's portfolio.

Procter & Gamble is a multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. The company offers a wide range of personal health and consumer health products across numerous categories, including beauty, grooming and home care.

Procter & Gamble is ideal for beginners due to its stability, brand recognition and consistent dividend payments. The company's diverse portfolio of everyday consumer products provides resilience during economic downturns, as demand for these items tends to remain relatively stable.

For new investors with limited funds, P&G's steady growth and reliable dividend make it an attractive option. The company has increased its dividend for 65 consecutive years, earning it the status of a ""Dividend King."" This consistent income can help beginners see tangible returns on their investment. Additionally, P&G's strong market position and ongoing innovation in product development offer potential for long-term growth, making it a solid choice for those starting their investment journey.

While not a stock, specifically, this ETF deserves mention because it could be the best option for creating a diversified portfolio with limited money .The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, which consists of 500 of the largest U.S. companies. This ETF provides exposure to a broad range of stocks across various sectors.

While not a stock itself, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is an excellent choice for beginners with limited funds who want broad market exposure. This ETF offers instant diversification across 500 of the largest U.S. companies, reducing the risk of investing in individual stocks.

For new investors, VOO provides several benefits. Its low expense ratio means more of the investor's money works for them. The ETF's diversification helps mitigate the impact of poor performance from any single company. Additionally, VOO pays dividends, providing a source of passive income. This ETF allows beginners to invest in stocks mentioned earlier (like Apple and Microsoft) and hundreds of others, making it an excellent foundation for a long-term investment strategy. You can invest as little as $1, thanks to Vanguard's fractional share program.

As a beginner investor, knowing the common pitfalls hindering your investment success is crucial. Understanding and avoiding these mistakes can set you up for a more successful investing journey. Let's explore some of the most common investing mistakes and how to avoid them.

One of the beginners' most significant mistakes is letting emotions drive their investment decisions. Fear and greed can lead to impulsive actions, such as panic selling during market downturns or buying into hyped-up stocks without proper research. Emotional investing often results in buying high and selling low, the opposite of a successful investment strategy.

Develop a solid investment plan based on your financial goals and risk tolerance to avoid emotional investing. Stick to this plan even when markets become volatile. Investing is a long-term game, and short-term market fluctuations are normal. By maintaining a level head and focusing on your long-term objectives, you can avoid rash decisions that could harm your portfolio.

Another common mistake is investing without proper research. While buying stocks based on tips from friends, family or social media influencers is tempting, this approach can lead to poor investment choices. Each investor's financial situation and goals are unique, and what works for one person may not be suitable for another.

To avoid this mistake, research before investing in any stock or fund. Understand the company's business model, financial health, competitive position, and growth prospects. For ETFs, look at the fund's holdings, expense ratio and historical performance. While it's okay to consider recommendations from others, use these as starting points for your research rather than as definitive investment advice.

Many beginner investors need to pay more attention to the impact of fees on their investment returns. While a difference of 0.5% or 1% in fees might seem small, it can significantly erode your returns over time due to the power of compound interest. This is particularly important when investing with limited funds, as high fees can affect your potential gains.

To avoid this mistake, always be aware of the fees associated with your investments. This includes brokerage fees, mutual funds, ETFs expense ratios and account maintenance fees. Look for low-cost investment options, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF mentioned earlier, which has a meager expense ratio. Remember, minimizing fees is one of the few aspects of investing you can control, so it's worth paying attention to.

For those new to investing, continuous learning is critical to building confidence and making informed decisions. Fortunately, numerous resources are available to help beginners expand their knowledge of investing and personal finance.

Financial news websites such as Forbes, CNBC, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal offer up-to-date information on market trends, company news and economic indicators. These sites often have sections dedicated to personal finance and investing basics, which can be particularly useful for beginners.

Books are another excellent resource for in-depth knowledge. Classics like The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham and A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel provide timeless wisdom on investing principles. For more beginner-friendly reads, consider The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins or The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C. Bogle.

Podcasts have become increasingly popular for learning about investing on the go. Shows like Money For the Rest of Us, Motley Fool Money and InvestED offer insights into various aspects of investing and personal finance. These can be great for beginners to familiarize themselves with investing terminology and concepts.

Online courses and webinars, often offered by reputable financial institutions or educational platforms like Coursera and edX, can provide structured learning experiences. Many of these are free or low-cost, making them accessible to those starting with limited funds.

Lastly, consider the value of financial advisors. While their services may come with a cost, a good advisor can provide personalized guidance and help you develop a comprehensive investment strategy tailored to your specific needs and goals.

Investing in stocks can be an excellent way for beginners to build wealth, even with limited funds. New investors can confidently begin their journey by focusing on stable, well-established companies like Apple, Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble or opting for broad market exposure through an ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500. Avoid pitfalls like emotional investing, lack of research, and ignoring fees. Continuously educate yourself using various resources, and don't hesitate to seek professional advice when needed. With patience, discipline, and a long-term perspective, even those starting with little money can work towards achieving their financial goals through stock market investing."
"China Market Update: $2.1 Billion Net Flows To Alibaba In First Week Of Connect, Week In Review",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendanahern/2024/09/13/china-market-update-21-billion-net-flows-to-alibaba-in-first-week-of-connect-week-in-review/,2024-09-13T14:59:07Z,"China's August inflation, released Monday, was softer than expected both in terms of producer and consumer prices.

Asian equities were largely higher on light volumes, except for Japan, China, and India, as the US dollar weakened against regional currencies.

The Chinese government did something no Western politician dares, which is delay seniors' entitlements by raising the retirement age to 63 from 60 for male workers, 58 from 55 for white collar female workers, and 55 from 50 for blue collar female workers. The full implementation will take 15 years as, beginning in January, the retirement age will be pushed out one month every four months.

The US House of Representatives and White House passed a whole host of China related bills, moving to eliminate the duty free de minimis exemption on imports under $800 and banning Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and drones. Hong Kong stocks did not react, as these measures still need to pass in the Senate.

Hong Kong posted small gains despite next week's mid-autumn festival, which means Hong Kong will be closed on Wednesday and China's stock market will be closed on Monday and Tuesday. The holidays also mean Southbound Stock Connect is closed until Thursday, which likely explains the profit taking in Alibaba, which fell -0.54%.

Regardless of the market's closure next week, Mainland investors bought another HKD 1.32 billion ($168 million) worth of the stock, which brings the week's total net buy to $2.1 billion. The company also announced they bought 468,500 US ADRs yesterday which would be 4.3% of the ADR's total volume. Over the last three weeks the company has bought 0.394% of shares outstanding. Thanks, management!

Hong Kong had a decent day as all sectors were positive. The most heavily traded stocks by volume following Alibaba were Tencent, which gained +0.59% after buying 2.67 million shares today, Meituan, which gained +0.57%, Akeso, which gained +9.5%, and CNOOC, which gained +1.76%. Mainland China had a strange day that was fitting for Friday the 13 as broad indices struggled (again) on light volumes as Treasury bonds rallied (again). What made it strange was that mega cap banks and energy and materials companies such as Zijin Mining, which gained +3.38%, CYPDC, which gained +1.58% and Foxconn +2.18% held up, though CATL fell -3.09%, BYD fell -0.79%, liquor stocks Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye Yibin fell -2.32% and -3.67%, respectively. Mid and small caps underperformed large caps. The National Team ETFs had below average volumes

There is a big China economic data release coming this weekend!

I caught up with my commodity trend-following friends at Mt Lucas. They are short many commodities which is likely driven by the US and global economy slowing. Everyone seems to forget that's why the Fed is cutting, i.e. a recession is coming. Think that's positive for US stocks or the US dollar? Me neither! Think foreign investors will stick around as their US stocks start losing money due to FX depreciation? Think the yen carry trade unwind is over? Me neither. We shall see and time will tell. Check out Mt. Lucas' blog as lots of good, non-consensus views, in my opinion.

The IMF released a piece yesterday titled ""Trade Balances in China and the US Are Largely Driven by Domestic Macro Forces"". The piece takes a data driven perspective on the common US politician rhetoric that Chinese government subsidies are leading to overcapacity and flooding the world with cheap goods. The IMF is being kind when it calls such a view ""incomplete"" as, yes, the Chinese government does provide subsidies to ""priority sectors such as software, automobiles, transportation, semiconductor and more recently green technology"" though there are no signs of overcapacity. China exports lots of goods that don't receive subsidies while even EV exports only accounted for only 1% of Chinese goods. The real issue is China's weak domestic consumption combined with United States' ""persistent decline in US domestic savings"" i.e. too much spending. It is a worthwhile read as it takes an analytical approach to an issue. The reality is the US factory utilization (77%) is higher than China's (74.9%).

The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +0.75% and +0.13%, respectively, on volume that declined -3.05% from yesterday, which is 86% of the 1-year average. 339 stocks advanced while 144 stocks fell. Main Board short turnover fell -13.45% from yesterday, which is 62% of the 1-year average, as 12% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers' ETF hedging). Value and large caps outperformed growth and small caps. All sectors were positive, including healthcare, which gained +2.45%, materials, which gained +2.44%, and industrials, which gained +1.67%. The top-performing subsectors were pharmaceuticals, biotech, materials, and consumer durables. Meanwhile, food & beverage, semiconductors, and consumer services were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light as Mainland investors bought a net $30 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large/moderate net buy. Meanwhile, Meituan was a moderate net sell, and the Hong Kong Tracker ETF and Hang Seng Tech ETFs were small net sells.

Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -0.48%, -1.08%, and -0.58%, respectively, on volume that increased +1.78% from yesterday, which is 67% of the 1-year average. 980 stocks advanced while 3,947 stocks declined. The value factor and large caps fell less than growth and small caps. The top-performing sectors were Utilities, which gained +1.13%, Real Estate, which gained +0.69%, and Technology, which gained +0.53%. Meanwhile, Consumer Staples fell -1.53%, Industrials fell -0.64%, and Health Care fell -0.33%. The top-performing subsectors were precious metals, telecom, and insurance. Meanwhile, liquor, fine chemicals, and electric power grid were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were light. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index had a strong night versus the US dollar. Copper and steel gained.

Consumer Sentiment Rose This Month To 4-Month High -- Here's How It's Evolved Under Trump And Biden,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/13/consumer-sentiment-rose-this-month-to-4-month-high-heres-how-its-evolved-under-trump-and-biden/,2024-09-13T14:09:40Z,"Consumer sentiment improved last month but remains historically weak, according to the University of Michigan's widely tracked monthly survey released Friday morning, one of the last major indicators of Americans' lukewarm feelings on the economy and their finances ahead of November's presidential election.

Crucially, the lingering low sentiment coincides with elevated inflation during President Joe Biden's presidency: The Michigan sentiment index was 79 when Biden took office in 2021, and sits lower than it ever was under Donald Trump (71.8 in April 2020). Sentiment decreased by a greater margin than under Biden, as the Michigan metric declined from 98.5 to 79 from Jan. 2017 to Jan. 2021. But the steadily low confidence expressed in the poll over the last 3.5 years supports reports suggesting Americans believe their wallets would be fatter under Trump than they'd be under the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. A CNBC survey last month released last month found 40% of voters thought they'd be better off financially under Trump compared to 21% for Harris.

Presidential actions have far less of an impact on the economy than public perception may suggest, according to economists. That's because it's far from the presidential seal of approval that could instantly solve global inflation originally tied to COVID-19 outbreaks among supply chain workers or take responsibility for stock market gains from artificial intelligence breakthroughs. The economy is by far the top voter issue this fall. Inflation has moderated significantly from the 41-year high it touched in 2022, hitting its lowest level last month since early 2021, and the stock market sits near its highest level on record, with the S&P 500 delivering a historically robust 15% annualized return over the last five years, but decreased spending power and dwindling savings rates have contributed to the malaise."
"JD Vance flubs economic basics, adding to his list of troubles",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-economy-immigration-republican-basics-election-2024-rcna171001,2024-09-13T13:50:20Z,"JD Vance was already suffering through a humiliating week. Then he started flubbing the basics of economic and immigration policy on national television.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance was struggling long before last week, but an eight-day stretch helped capture why the Ohio senator wasn't a great choice for the GOP's national ticket.

On Wednesday, Sept. 4, delivered a ridiculous and widely mocked answer what can be done to address the cost of child care. A day later, he lamented that deadly mass shootings in schools are a ""fact of life"" -- a comment that sparked fierce and immediate pushback.

On Monday, Vance threw his support behind a ridiculous and racist conspiracy theory about immigrants abducting and eating pets, and on Tuesday, he endorsed a brazenly illegal response to Donald Trump's 2020 election defeat. That evening, the former president distanced himself from Vance's rhetoric about abortion policy during a nationally televised debate.

Two days later, the senator sat down with CNBC hosts to discuss the economy, and he managed to top off a brutal eight-day stretch with an interview in which he didn't appear to have any idea what he was talking about.

After badly flubbing the basics on the inflationary effects of tariffs, Vance tried to argue that immigration is bad for the economy:

So, a few things.

First, the ""25 million illegal aliens"" figure is ridiculously wrong. Given Vance's apparent interest in immigration policy, it's weird to see him struggle with such a basic detail.

Second, the vice president is not chiefly responsible for federal immigration laws -- though she did endorse a bipartisan solution that Vance's running mate killed, despite the legislation's merits, because he was afraid helping the country might hurt his 2024 candidacy.

Third, while it's true that housing costs in Springfield, Ohio, have gone up, it's because the local economy is improving -- despite Trump's insane claims that the community has been destroyed by pet-eating immigrants.

Fourth, the idea that Springfield has suffered economically as a result of immigration is the exact opposite of what has actually happened in reality. As Vance really ought to know -- he ostensibly represents Ohio -- we're talking about a community on the rise, not decline.

But perhaps most notable of all was the hapless senator's insistence that if immigration benefited the economy, the United States ""would be the most prosperous country in the world.""

Whether Vance understands this or not, the United States is already the most prosperous country in the world. In fact, we're the most prosperous country by a wide margin.

To be sure, such confusion is expected from Trump, who's relationship with reality has long been fractured, but Vance is supposed to be the more knowledgeable one. It leads to an unavoidable question:

Is the Republican senator really this confused about issues he claims to care about, or is the vice presidential hopeful assuming that voters are foolish enough to believe demonstrable nonsense?"
SAP BrandVoice: 3 Ways Retailers Can Build Supply Chain Resilience For The Holiday Shopping Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/09/13/3-ways-retailers-can-build-supply-chain-resilience-for-the-holiday-shopping-season/,2024-09-13T11:44:01Z,"By Amanda Spencer, Global Industry Marketing Lead, Retail and Fashion, SAP

The holidays are just around the corner, but a record-breaking Black Friday, similar to years past, may be little more than a ghost of Christmas past. Times are tough for a lot of consumers these days. Sky-high credit card debts, shrinking personal savings, rising costs due to inflation, and widespread layoffs mean a significant slowdown in holiday spending is expected. Experts predict a fiercely competitive season as retail brands battle for every dollar.

Retailers are gearing up for the fight. Forward-thinking brands are deep into their preparations for this most-critical time of the year, aware that a robust supply chain gives them the best chance of meeting consumer demands. A strong supply chain can also improve efficiency and customer satisfaction, two qualities that will likely be non-negotiables for holiday shoppers.

An IDC study found that retailers are prioritizing supply chain resilience by taking several steps to reduce supply chain risks, including:

Boosting supply chain visibility is crucial as it allows vendors to monitor products from origin to destination, providing real-time data on inventory levels, order statuses, and goods movement. According to an IDC survey, improving visibility is the top priority for many supply chain leaders.

Increased transparency is key to quickly identifying and mitigating potential disruptions, so that supply chains remain adaptable and responsive. Additionally, it helps track compliance with regulations and standards, further strengthening the overall resilience of the supply chain.

For best results improving supply chain visibility, retailers should focus on these areas:

Another key component to supply chain resilience is diversifying suppliers. Retailers should source multiple suppliers and products for their manufacturing, logistics, and transportation needs to avoid the risks associated with sole sourcing.

In IDC's study, 34% of supply chain leaders cited supply chain partner constraints as a top challenge.

A broader range of suppliers helps protect companies from supply chain interruptions, like delays and shortages. Here are some ways to diversify:

With AI's steadily growing capabilities, it makes sense for retailers to harness its powers to automate processes and improve supply chain resiliency.

For example, AI can crunch the data to predict future buying trends to align stock and spot inefficiencies. AI systems also can improve demand forecasting by examining sales and market data to produce accurate demand predictions.

Many retailers also are exploring ways generative AI can streamline supply chain management. According to IDC, companies are using the technology to:

For a lot of retailers, building supply chain resilience is easier said than done. Technology integration challenges, data utilization issues, and cost issues often hinder efforts to bolster supply chains. Strategic partners and smart investments in the right technology are key to navigating and overcoming these obstacles to building a more robust, adaptable supply chain.

Swiss retailer COOP worked with SAP to transform its supply chain capabilities. SAP Predictive Replenishment now optimizes COOP's order proposals and makes sure inventory levels are keeping up with demand. SAP Order and Delivery Scheduling determines COOP's optimal order cycles and implements them automatically.

COOP's investment in digital transformation is already helping to reduce costs, boost operational efficiency, and elevate customer satisfaction for their distribution centers.

Another company, Mexican retail giant El Puerto de Liverpool, unified customer, inventory and shopping data to deliver omnichannel services to customers and inventory verification to store associates.

""It is clear that having a robust and resilient supply chain is not just a competitive advantage, but a necessity,"" says Geraldo Munoz Martin, the company's chief technology and information officer."
"Mortgage Rates Today: September 13, 2024 -- Rates Move Down",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-09-13-24/,2024-09-13T11:41:31Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.64% with an APR of 6.66%, according to Curinos. The 15-year fixed mortgage has an average rate of 5.76% with an APR of 5.79%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.74% with an APR of 6.77%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) fell to 6.64% from 6.65% yesterday. One week ago, the 30-year fixed was 6.76%.

On a 30-year fixed mortgage, the APR is 6.66%, the same as it was last week. APR, or annual percentage rate, includes a loan's interest rate and a loan's finance charges. It's the all-in cost of your loan.

According to the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator, homebuyers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of 100,000 will pay $642 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included) at today's interest rate of 6.64%. You'd pay about $130,941 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today's 15-year mortgage (fixed-rate) is 5.76%, down 0.18 percentage point from the previous week. The same time last week, the 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.94%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.79%. It was the same last week.

A 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage with today's interest rate of 5.76% will cost $831 per month in principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage (not including taxes and insurance). In this scenario, borrowers would pay approximately $49,522 in total interest.

On a 30-year jumbo, the average interest rate is 6.74%, lower than it was at this time last week. The average rate was 6.86% at this time last week.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.74% will pay $648 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,859 and you'd pay around $999,420 in total interest over the life of the loan.

To get an estimate of your mortgage costs, using a mortgage calculator can help.

Simply input the following information:

Home loan borrowers can qualify for better mortgage rates by having good or excellent credit, maintaining a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and pursuing loan programs that don't charge mortgage insurance premiums or similar ongoing charges that increase the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).

Comparing rates from different mortgage lenders is an excellent starting point. You may also compare conventional, first-time homebuyer and government-backed programs like FHA and VA loans, which have different rates and fees.

For the most part, several economic factors influence the trajectory of rates for new home loans. The recent Federal Reserve rate hikes don't directly cause mortgage rates to rise but have indirectly caused the interest rates for many long-term loans to increase. Rates are more likely to decrease when the Fed pauses or decreases its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.

Further, the inflation rate and the general state of the economy directly impact interest rates. High inflation and a strong economy typically signal higher rates. Cooling consumer demand or inflation may help rates decrease."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 13, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-13-24/,2024-09-13T11:41:21Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are mixed compared to one week ago. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are notorious for paying teensy interest rates. That has changed, thanks to the Fed's campaign of interest rate hikes to combat inflation last year. But even though the Fed hasn't raised its rate since July 2023, consumer deposit yields remain high.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you land a basic savings account with a rate in that general area, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can nail down an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.26% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's above last week's 0.26%.

If you're shopping around for a traditional savings account, high-yield savings account or MMA, you'll want to remember a few key points.

A great interest rate is important, but it's not the only factor that matters when selecting an account to hold your savings. Another major consideration is whether the account has a minimum deposit -- and whether you can meet that requirement.

You'll also want to be alert for fees. Savings accounts can come with monthly maintenance fees, excess transaction fees (if you ignore limits on withdrawals) and other annoying charges that can erode your returns.

And before you sign up for an account, explore a financial institution's reputation and safety. You should trust your bank or credit union and feel like you're in good hands. Read the reviews, see what other consumers have to say about customer service and learn about how the financial institution responds to consumer questions.

Search for an account that's insured by the FDIC or, in the case of credit unions, the NCUA. Those federal agencies provide up to $250,000 in insurance per depositor and per bank for each account ownership category.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Luxury Market Confidence Erodes As Demand Weakens In The U.S. And China,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/09/13/luxury-market-confidence-erodes-as-demand-weakens-in-the-us-and-china/,2024-09-13T11:26:59Z,"Pam Danziger reports on retail, focused on the luxury consumer market.

The global luxury goods market got off to a poor start in 2024 and as the year has progressed, more dark clouds are gathering.

After advancing 4% at current exchange rates in 2023, the personal luxury goods market dropped between 1% to 3% in the first quarter 2024, according to Bain -Altagamma's Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study, Spring 2024.

""We are in a moment of great macroeconomic uncertainty at a global level,"" report co-author Federica Levato warned, as she referenced the uncertain economic outlook in the U.S. and China, wars in Europe and the Middle East and overall rising geopolitical tensions.

""Personal luxury brands are finding themselves in a moment of crisis, driven by macroeconomic pressures, waning consumer demand and dichotomous strategies,"" Bain advised.

While Bain continues to predict the luxury goods market could pull off a slight uptick over 2023, that is looking less and less likely.

Weakened Investment Outlook

HSBC Global Research just dialed down its annual forecast for the eight brands it covers from previous 5.5% growth to 2.8%. Those brands include Burberry, Hermès, Kering, LVMH, Richemont, Swatch, Moncler and Prada.

Looking wider, HSBC advised 2024 could turn out among one of the six worst years in the luxury market over the past two decades with the absolute worst being 2020 off nearly 20% and 2009 down 8%.

Citing lower growth in China and a weakened American outlook, HSBC said, ""Our new forecasts factor in the weak macro environment and negative sector news flow received during the summer.""

Calling it a ""cruel summer,"" HSBC advised that the third quarter 2024 could be the ""weakest quarter on a two-year stack basis."" In 2023, the third quarter declined 3%, according to Bain, so the outlook is for things to get worse before they get better.

Barclays also revised downward its luxury market outlook due to weakness in China, the world's second largest global luxury market. Its analysts recently visited there to get a closer look and found the high-growth phase of the Chinese economy has ended.

""The sentiment on the ground was much more cautious than six months ago, as there is now a clear view that the Chinese weakness is structural,"" analysts Wendy Liu and Carole Madjo told Marketwatch, as they predicted it may take three to four years for the market there to improve.

China In The Cross Hairs

Investment firm TD Cowen just completed a survey among 2,000 Chinese consumers in three top-tier markets to take consumers' pulse on their financial outlook, spending preferences and expectations across a wide swath of consumer categories, including luxury.

""While spending intentions are fairly stable, luxury goods are among the categories consumers intend to spend less on,"" Cowen advised. And another worrisome finding is that one-fourth of the Chinese consumers surveyed said they find Western brands ""less appealing"" over the last 12 months.

""It is more challenging to underwrite China based on cash flows and growth given the policy, macro and competitive headwinds,"" Cowen reported.

Across the board, luxury is fairly low on the list of categories where spending will increase. Some 17% expect to spend more on luxury compared with 64% who will pick up spending on travel and 59% on groceries, followed by 37% on beauty and personal care products, 37% on dining out and 36% on clothing and accessories.

High-income consumers (~$140 household income) are more likely than the general population to plan to up spending on luxury goods (27%), but they are leaning more into increased spending on clothing and accessories (37%) and beauty/personal care (38%).

However, upper-middle-income consumers (~$70k household income) - the so-called aspirational Chinese consumers - put luxury goods way down on their list of spending priorities. Only 13% of upper-middle consumers plan to spend more on luxury goods.

And among those minority of Chinese consumer who expect to reduce spending this year over last year, luxury goods are named by 46% on their list for budget cuts.

Overall, about 30% of the Chinese survey respondents (n=600) plan to spend on a luxury item over the next six months, which is a fairly strong showing across a general population survey. But then what people say they will do in a survey doesn't always match what they actually do.

""We are cautiously optimistic about the China luxury market,"" Cowen concludes.

Last year the Chinese luxury goods market grew about 4%, according to Bain. While Cowen made no predictions about luxury growth this year, Bain sees ""sluggish GDP growth, pressured middle class and weak consumer confidence"" challenging the prospects for the rest of 2024 in China.

Affluent American's Tip To Less, Not More Luxury Spending

Stateside, the prospects for luxury spending is weakening too, according to the Affluent Consumer Research Company's (ACRC) luxury tracking survey conducted in September among 250 affluent American consumers (average household income about $300k and net worth of $2.3 million, excluding primary home value). Note: I am affiliated with the ACRC.

Prospects for luxury spending has worsened since June's survey among a comparable sample of 400 affluents. In the September survey, some 17% said they made no luxury goods or services purchases over the past 12 months. This compares to 9% in June who reported no luxury purchases in the past year.

As for prospects for luxury spending over the next 12 months, significantly more (28%) plan to spend less, including 10% who plan to spend a lot less, while only 16% expect to spend more. And 16% plan no luxury purchases whatsoever.

""Affluent consumers display strong confidence in their ability to manage wealth, though they are cautious about economic conditions,"" observed ACRC's founder Chandler Mount and lead researcher.

""Many are balancing this by prioritizing saving and investment over luxury spending, including a trend towards financial prudence amid uncertainty,"" he continued.

Uncertainty in their personal financial prospects is reflected in worries about paying higher taxes on personal income (46%), new taxes on wealth (45%) and greater volatility in global markets due to geopolitical uncertainty (45%).

Looking more broadly, affluent Americans are also highly concerned about the potential for escalating global conflict and war (52%), political unrest leading to civil unrest (51%) and data privacy/cyber security threats (45%).

""Affluent consumers are navigating an economic landscape defined by uncertainty, balancing their spending between indulgence in luxury experiences and a shift toward financial prudence,"" Mount explained and noted the economic pressures from inflation and income concerns are prompting more selective purchases.

""The market is expected to remain stable but conservative,"" he continued. ""While there is no drastic decline in luxury spending anticipated, growth will likely be modest as consumers prioritize value and longevity over sheer luxury.""

Uncertainty Is Bad For Business

In the world's two largest luxury markets - China and the U.S. - uncertainty is the order of the day. Cowen just cut targets for eight of the companies it covers due to questions about Chinese demand for Western-based goods and the rising level of competition there. Stocks impacted include Lululemon, Nike, Adidas, Amer Sports, Sketchers, Ralph Lauren, PVH, and Puma.

Luxury brands also face an increasingly challenging market in the U.S. Inflation has largely sidelined the so-called aspirational consumers and high-income affluents are being far more selective when it comes to luxury purchases. And with the election just a few weeks away, consumers are going to face more distractions that keep them from indulging in high-ticket purchases.

""Overall, the affluent luxury market is in a state of balance between indulgence and restraint, as consumers adjust to a more uncertain economic environment,"" Mount said and that sentiment seems to be spreading across the globe."
'Shock And Awe' -- China Could Be About To Trigger A $1.4 Trillion Bitcoin And Crypto Price Earthquake,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/13/shock-and-awe-china-could-be-about-to-trigger-a-14-trillion-bitcoin-and-crypto-price-earthquake/,2024-09-13T11:17:28Z,"Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher this year, helped by fears the U.S. dollar is on ""the verge of a total collapse,"" setting up the bitcoin price for ""a critical tipping point.""

The bitcoin price has almost doubled over the last 12 months, climbing as Russia gears up for a bitcoin and crypto flip.

Now, as former U.S. president Donald Trump teases a mystery crypto project that could rival bitcoin, economists are calling for China to unleash $1.4 trillion worth of ""shock and awe"" stimulus that could kick start the economy and trigger a ""glorious"" bitcoin price boom.

""There is a phenomenon here where there's been a lack of confidence, this very high household savings rate for example. People do not want to spend, Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, told the Financial Times, calling a near $1 trillion stimulus package the ""baseline.""

""Shock and awe is sometimes the right approach,"" Neumann said. ""There's a risk that we've been so incremental over the past 18 months that every announcement doesn't rebuild that confidence that we need.""

The latest economic data out of China shows consumer inflation has remained stagnant, with the its consumer price index (CPI) climbing just 0.6% in August from a year earlier, falling short of the 0.8% rise expected by a Wall Street Journal poll of economists and fueling fears of a deflationary spiral.

Through the second quarter of 2024, China's GDP grew 4.7% from a year ago though in real terms, its nominal GDP, which doesn't factor in inflation, only grew 4%, suggesting broad-based price pressures are weighing on the economy.

""The longer that deflation stays, the bigger the ask in terms of reflation,"" Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, told the FT, adding China's ""bull case"" would be $1.4 trillion worth of stimulus over two years.

Last month, Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of bitcoin and crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went on to set up the Maelstrom investment fund, wrote in a blog post that he expects China to next year ""finally unleash its long-awaited bazooka fiscal stimulus,"" predicting the China-America ""crypto bull market shall be glorious.""

Meanwhile, bitcoin and crypto entrepreneurs and investors focused on China have said they expect China to roll back its bitcoin ban.

In June, crypto investor Brock Pierce predicted it's only a matter of time before China reopens its digital doors to crypto, while Justin Sun, the founder of tron blockchain, called a recent legal ruling in China ""very important.""

""Is China going to open up [to crypto]? ... I'd say it's inevitable,"" Pierce, a former child actor who cofounded the USDT dollar-pegged stablecoin issuer Tether in Hong Kong a decade ago, told the South China Morning Post. ""The question is not so much if, it's a matter of when.""

In May, attendees of a Hong Kong bitcoin conference sparked speculation the much-hyped Hong Kong spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could eventually be opened up to mainland China investors.

China's 2021 bitcoin ban that made the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies including ethereum and XRP illegal, triggered a sudden bitcoin price crash at the time."
First Solar Stock Jumps 15%. Here's Why.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/13/first-solar-stock-jumps-15-heres-why/,2024-09-13T11:07:54Z,"First Solar stock rallied by nearly 15% during Wednesday's trading, pushing its year-to-date gains to around 40%, in contrast to sector peer Enphase Energy , which remains down about 15% year-to-date. The surge comes on the heels of the recent presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, where Harris appeared to have the upper hand. Her strong debate performance has boosted investor sentiment, as a potential Democratic victory is seen as favorable for the clean energy sector. Should Republicans - who typically prioritize a market-driven approach over government subsidies for renewables - take control of the White House and Congress, legislation such as the green energy-friendly Inflation Reduction Act could face changes. This makes the continuation of President Joe Biden's clean energy policies particularly important for U.S.-based solar manufacturers like First Solar.

There have been multiple regulatory initiatives by the Biden administration, focused on the clean energy sector. For instance, First Solar is benefiting from the Section 45X tax credit under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, given that it has been doing an increasing mix of its manufacturing in the U.S. The company is likely to realize $1.0 billion to $1.05 billion of Section 45X tax credits under the act this year, adding directly to its operating profits. A meaningful part of First Solar's strong financial performance can be attributed to the Inflation Reduction Act in recent quarters. The Biden Administration also recently raised tariffs on solar cells imported from China from 25% to 50%. This should prevent dumping by the Chinese, given that there is a massive capacity glut in China, with the country's solar panel production capacity estimated to stand at more than 2x global solar demand in 2023.

The increase in FSLR stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -12% in 2021, 72% in 2022, and 15% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FSLR face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Overall, we think that there are multiple long-term positives for the solar sector at large and First Solar in particular. Things are getting better on the macro front. Inflation has cooled off considerably falling to just about 2.5% for August and this should prompt the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. This will bode well for renewable energy stocks, by making financing of large-scale projects more affordable. First Solar will also remain one of the big beneficiaries of the U.S. efforts to encourage domestic renewables production given its vertically integrated manufacturing. That said, there are risks as well. We remain neutral on First Solar stock, with a $243 price estimate, which is roughly in line with the current market price. See our analysis of First Solar Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details.

While First Solar stock could fare well in the coming years, it is helpful to see how First Solar's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
3 Concepts Investors Must Know About Bitcoin's 4-Year Cycles,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ansellindner/2024/09/13/3-concepts-investors-must-know-about-bitcoins-4-year-cycles/,2024-09-13T10:40:27Z,"Bitcoin's four-year cycle is a crucial concept for investors looking to understand its market dynamics. Driven by a unique process called ""the halving,"" these cycles create periods of both growth and volatility.

Here are the top three things to know:

Bitcoin's halving is unlike any event in traditional finance and plays a vital role in shaping its price. Roughly every four years, the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half. This effectively reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into the market, leading to a supply shock. Combined with Bitcoin's capped supply of 21 million coins, this predictable supply reduction can significantly affect price dynamics.

Prior to the halving, the supply and demand are in relative equilibrium. Demand coming from settlement (approximately $40 billion per day currently) and accumulation are in balance with the existing supply stock and new issuance of Bitcoin each block. However, when the halving occurs, this equilibrium is disrupted, spurring renewed speculative interest and driving new cycles of price discovery.

A halving event tied to a set date but instead a block height or block number. With each block aiming to be mined every 10 minutes, the halving occurs every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years. Currently, block times average about nine minutes and 42 seconds due to fluctuations in the network's computational power, meaning the interval between halvings is slightly shorter than four years.

The supply shock triggered by the halving has a significant impact on Bitcoin's price behavior. While the halving itself is a well-known event, priced-in to a degree prior to occurring, the full price effects typically unfold in stages. It is impossible to price in unknown factors like investors' personal reactions to significant price levels, decisions by large pools of capital that can significantly move price, or market fears, especially the 'fear of missing out.'

Bitcoin's halving-induced supply shocks set the stage for a boom-and-bust cycle that has been a recurring pattern in its history. This cycle is largely driven by how supply scarcity interacts with speculative demand, leading to sharp price increases (the boom), followed by overvaluation and eventual correction (the bust), before settling into a new equilibrium.

The halving is a one-sided force that almost universally leads to upward pressure on price. It is difficult to imagine a scenario where a reduction in supply -- while demand remains steady or increases -- is interpreted negatively by the market. Existing sources of demand, such as Bitcoin's use in settlements and accumulation by both retail and institutional investors, remain unaffected. At the same time, the halving logically leads to more demand from marginal sources as investors anticipate future scarcity and speculate on higher prices.

As this supply-side pressure builds, the early stages of a boom are marked by steady price appreciation, gaining momentum as more market participants take notice. Retail investors, driven by the FOMO, further accelerate the price increases. With each new price high, Bitcoin draws more attention, leading to institutional involvement and additional buying pressure. At this stage, Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty or inflation can also boost its appeal, attracting even more demand.

Like all markets, Bitcoin's bull markets eventually reach a peak. In the later stages of the boom, early investors begin to take profits, and the pool of new buyers shrinks as they become fully invested. Prices can spike rapidly during this phase, driven by speculative mania and short-term exuberance.

This euphoria typically culminates in a blow-off top before the market begins to correct. As the top forms, marginal buyers disappear, and those who bought at or near the top often panic sell, accelerating the downturn. The initial drop can be swift and severe, as the market adjusts from overvaluation.

Historically, Bitcoin's bear markets have retraced in each cycle to a higher floor, leading to successively higher lows, showing the progressively higher market equilibrium. This is due to the dramatic returns achieved during the bull market phase. While market tops are typically overvalued, bottoms are often undervalued, and a new equilibrium forms after prices stabilize and speculative excesses are flushed out.

The market eventually seeks a new equilibrium where price more accurately reflects underlying supply-demand fundamentals. This bust phase can last anywhere from several months to a few years, as the market digests the speculative froth. Once this excess is cleared, the bitcoin market begins laying the groundwork for the next cycle. As supply-demand dynamics stabilize, new investors gradually return, setting the stage for the next halving to repeat the process.

Time preference refers to how much an individual values present consumption versus future rewards. A high time preference favors immediate gains, while a low time preference prioritizes long-term benefits and patience. In Bitcoin investing, having a low time preference is crucial due to the cyclical nature of its price movements, driven by halving events. Short-term volatility can be misleading, making it essential to focus on Bitcoin's long-term potential.

Investing with a low time preference is especially important in Bitcoin's case, where price movements are inherently cyclical due to the halving events. For this reason, focusing too much on short-term price fluctuations can be misleading and stressful for investors. Instead, a low time preference encourages individuals to focus on the larger picture -- Bitcoin's properties and historical trends within a deteriorating macroeconomic environment.

This approach is why many experienced investors favor strategies like ""dollar-cost averaging,"" where purchases spread out over time, regardless of the price. Rather than trying to time the market, these investors commit to holding bitcoin for several years, often five or more. By maintaining a low time preference, they are better positioned to ride out the volatility.

Bitcoin is the only asset with a strictly fixed supply. This property alone dictates that in the long-run, as fiat currencies lose value over time, bitcoin's value will rise in nominal terms and be more stable than other assets in real terms. Investors with patience -- those who focus on wealth preservation rather than quick profits -- are more likely to reap the rewards of this hard money asset.

By committing to a multi-year time horizon, investors can avoid the pitfalls of market timing and benefit from Bitcoin's cyclical growth."
Will Alaska Air Stock Rebound To $70?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/13/will-alaska-air-stock-rebound-to-70/,2024-09-13T09:02:44Z,"Alaska Air stock (NYSE: ALK) currently trades around $40 per share, roughly 45% below its pre-inflation shock highs of around $74 seen in April 2021. ALK has fared slightly better than its peer - Southwest Airlines stock (NYSE: LUV) - down 52% over this period. Most U.S. airline stocks have been weighed down as they cut their outlook for 2024 early this year amid higher costs and pricing woes. Alaska Air also lowered its 2024 earnings per share outlook to $3.50 to $4.50 in Q2, versus its prior guidance of $3.25 to $5.25. Alaska Air saw its stock trading at around $40 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it's still trading around those levels. This compares with 45% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period.

Notably, ALK has had a poor run, with the stock losing value in each of the last three years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ALK face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery?

Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $74 implies that ALK stock will have to gain around 87% from here, and we don't think that will materialize anytime soon. We estimate Alaska Air's Valuation to be $48 per share, reflecting around 20% upside from its current levels of $40. Our forecast is based on 12x expected adjusted earnings of $4.01 per share in 2024.

Our detailed analysis of Alaska Air's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how ALK stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

ALK stock declined marginally from nearly $5.24 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to $4.91 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It bounced after the 2008 crisis to levels of around $7.75 in early 2010, rising over 55% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

Alaska Air's Fundamentals Over Recent Years

Alaska Air's revenue rose from $6.2 billion in 2021 to $10.5 billion now in the last twelve months. Airlines at large have seen a strong rebound in air travel demand after the pandemic. Alaska has seen its capacity expand, while its occupancy and yield have trended lower lately. Although the company saw its sales rise, its operating margin contracted from 10.9% to 7.3% over the same period. Higher revenues and margin contraction resulted in reported earnings falling to $1.76 per share over the last twelve months, versus $3.77 per share in 2021.

The airlines in the U.S. at large have had a tough start to 2024. Looking at the previous quarter, Alaska Air reported revenue of $2.9 billion, 2% higher than the prior-year quarter's figure. Alaska reported a 6% rise in available seat miles, while the load factor was down 290 bps, and yield remained flat. Fuel costs per gallon increased by 3% y-o-y. This weighed on the pre-tax consolidated margin, which stood at 15.8% in Q2'24 vs. 18.3% in the prior-year quarter. The earnings contracted to $2.55 on a per-share and adjusted basis, compared to $3.00 per share in Q2'23.

Does Alaska Air Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

Alaska Air's total debt remained around $4 billion since 2021, while its cash decreased from $3.1 billion in 2021 to $2.5 billion now. The company also garnered $1.1 billion in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Given that Alaska Air's market capitalization is only $5 billion, a debt level of $4 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of 80%. On the other hand, the company does have a good cash cushion, implying that it's in a comfortable position to service its near-term obligations.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe Alaska Air stock has the potential for gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, the pressure on the company's balance sheet, and the impact of rising costs on the company's profitability lately, remains a significant risk factor to realizing these gains.

Meanwhile, 66% of the survey's respondents said that over the last decade the American Dream has become either ""much less"" or ""somewhat less"" attainable.

Angela McArdle, president of the national Libertarian Party, told Fox News Digital she was not surprised by the results of the survey. McArdle suggested the country was ""in very scary territory"" when it comes to upward economic mobility, something she said is ""a big part"" of the American Dream.

AMERICAN VALUES: 'IT'S DYING': PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS WORRY ABOUT FUTURE OF AMERICAN DREAM

In July, McArdle wrote an editorial in Newsweek arguing that an increasing number of Americans, particularly those who are younger, are feeling shut out of the American Dream as a result of declining purchasing power and an erosion of individual liberties.

The Rainey Center survey similarly found that the younger you are, the more pessimistic people are likely to be about the American Dream. It also found that individual liberties and financial stability ranked among the two most important aspects of the American Dream for respondents.

""I think we're in very scary territory, especially if Kamala Harris is elected,"" McArdle said, referring to upward economic mobility and the American Dream. McArdle expressed better faith in Trump to revive a more optimistic view of the American Dream.

""Donald Trump, you know, while he's been very friendly to libertarians, which I greatly appreciate now, he's not a libertarian. He doesn't bat 1,000, he's not going to get it 100% of the time, but I think, aside from every little libertarian nuance, I think he does understand the American Dream.""

TRUMP OUTLINES ECONOMIC POLICIES AT AN EVENT FOR THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF NEW YORK

McArdle also echoed her argument from July that said an erosion of individual liberties, such as the enforcement of property rights, could be tied to national pessimism about the American Dream. McArdle added that Harris ""doesn't care about us having property ownership.""

""As you grow and become an adult, you want to be able to save up and make a big purchase, whether that's a home for a lot of people, or it's your first car. And when you have a potential president who's not going to enforce rule of law against property crime, it really takes the excitement out of making a major purchase like that.""

""I think a lot of people, especially in urban areas, are very nervous to open a small business if the police don't protect your property,"" McArdle added. ""If, instead, they're weaponized to come for you over thought crimes, political speech, things of that nature, what's left of the American dream at that point?""

Harris has praised efforts that stripped funding from law enforcement, and during the George Floyd riots of 2020 she referred to the protesters who caused billions of dollars in property damage and frequently assaulted police as ""essential."" During the riots she supported a bail fund movement that was working to get many of the violent rioters released from jail.

""That is, I think, real destruction of the American Dream,"" McArdle said, in reference to Harris' failure to protect property rights.

AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY, KAMALA HARRIS LOOKED OUT FOR SAN FRANCISCO'S CRIMINALS

Rainey Center President Sarah Hunt told Fox News Digital that the next administration ""must make restoring economic prosperity and equal opportunity"" a priority if they hope to restore faith in the American Dream.

""Americans are losing hope, and to most, the concept of the American Dream taught to us at an early age by our parents and grandparents truly feels unattainable,"" Hunt said. ""Young Americans are forgoing the idea of becoming homeowners because of crippling mortgage rates, runaway spending and detrimental inflation. The bottom line: Americans feel like they can no longer afford the American Dream. But there is still hope in reversing course.""

KAMALA HARRIS BLAMED FOR CRIME FAILURES IN CALIFORNIA

Hunt and McArdle both pointed to deregulation as a major factor that could help improve the national pessimism around the ""American Dream.""

CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS POUR COLD WATER ON HARRIS' NEW SMALL-BUSINESS TAX PROPOSAL

""I think many Americans are in jobs where they don't believe they are fulfilling their potential, or they don't maybe believe that they can find education or provide an education for their children that will help them fulfill their potential,"" Hunt said. ""But, you know, a fundamental part of that is having a government that has sensible policies. And, you know, deregulating some of these burdens and regulations that limit our ability to build things or make it harder to start business would go a long way for giving people more opportunity.""

Meanwhile, McArdle said that while she appreciates Harris paying ""lip service"" to small businesses, she doesn't think Harris ""realizes or has any regard or cares what the regulatory framework is really like.""

""She talks about lowering taxes for small businesses. Well, that's fantastic, that's a great start, but the barrier to job creation is regulation,"" McArdle said."
"GREG GUTFELD: Dems can push a vibe all night, but they can't make you forget how traumatizing this is",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-dems-can-push-vibe-all-night-cant-make-you-forget-how-traumatizing,2024-09-13T04:03:59Z,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel discuss some undecided voters' skepticism about voting for Vice President Kamala Harris after the ABC News Presidential Debate on 'Gutfeld!' (Courtesy: ABC News)

So, reviews of the debate are pouring in and liberal cat ladies everywhere rejoiced. True, the debate got five stars from the makers of Fancy Feast and two paws up, says Purina. The media, of course, says Kamala won, but why wouldn't they? They're so far up her a-- they can see out of her mouth. It's like parents watching their grown child hit a home run in T-ball. Look, honey, she made contact and didn't crap her pants. This just months after wanting her off the ticket. Those were the days. Remember Joe said he'd be a transitional candidate? He didn't know he'd be transitioning from president to fertilizer. But now they're so grateful.

TOP FIVE CLASHES OF THE HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'I'M TALKING NOW'

After all, she didn't pull a Biden. With a low bar like that, all she had to do was avoid shouting Allahu Akbar or claim that Maroon Five is an underrated band. Compared to Joe, it's considered a win that she didn't show up in the back of a hearse. Plus, the strategy of baiting Trump with hoaxes paid off. It allowed her to keep from saying anything about her past, present or future. And it ticked Trump off. It helped that she had help, of course.

There's no way she would have so confidently rattled off those hoaxes if she didn't know that she had cover. It's like the drunk girl at the bar picking fights that she expects her boyfriend to settle. Except here the boyfriend was the moderators. Luckily, this is one relationship where she doesn't have to worry about a pregnant nanny. Now, veteran GOP strategists are saying Harris won. But remember, these are the same geniuses who brought you the charisma black hole of Mitt Romney, who is so boring his dog asked to be tied to the roof. That's an old story. But how about voters? Remember them?

You know, the people who actually decide the outcome of elections, or at least the ones where Dems aren't counting the votes? Well, CNN, CBS and Fox all spoke to undecided voters post-debate, and we saw a common theme emerge, much like a nude Steve Doocy from my birthday cake. They expressed serious reservations on her economic answers and some found themselves leaning more toward Trump than Harris at the end.

Voter 1: He spoke fast. She just basically repeated everything that Biden has said in the past.

VOTERS REACT TO TRUMP SAYING HE 'TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' OVER LEFT RHETORIC

Voter 2: She didn't talk about her policy changes from 2020 to 2024. Deflected on immigration and didn't take responsibility or Biden's responsibility for letting people in illegally.

Voter 3: He was able to go to his track record, and I feel that Kamala just deflected the entire time.

Voter 4: While there was some focus on policy, I don't think that we really got to the meat of the issues.

Voter 5: My life was better when Trump was in office, and now with Kamala's administration, things haven't been so fantastic, and she is saying she can fix the problems that her administration has caused. But I just don't know if I can afford to take that risk.

All of that despite this sense that Harris had won among the political and media class. The New York Times even admits as much. And when the Times says ""voters weren't so sure,"" it means we're s------- our pants like Biden after judging a chili cook off. Hell, even Reuters interviewed undecided voters after the debate and out of the ten sampled, six said they were leaning toward Trump, saying Kamala was too vague, a big ball of nothing.

They're worried about affording gas and groceries, and she said nothing to allay those fears. And you'd think she'd be good at allaying, at least according to Willie Brown.

The fact is, voters remember she's VP the whole time inflation skyrocketed. They don't like her, and they can't even afford the eggs they want to throw at her. Keep in mind, this data is coming from Reuters, and they lean more to the left than Dana Perino after half a daiquiri. But do you see the common thread? These voters notice something the media wishes they hadn't. Kamala didn't say anything, which was the goal all along. Nobody learned a thing about her except that she's younger than Joe and could stay up past nine at night. The only two qualifications you need to become the nominee.

But that's how the Dems want it and ABC News is more than happy to help. But even the voters who dislike Trump said they trust him more on the economy. So Dems can push a vibe all night, but they can't make you forget how traumatizing a trip to the grocery store is now versus four years ago - and that was before detergent was behind more plexiglass than a prison visitation room.

People in the media can trick themselves into believing a fantasy. After all, the easiest person to fool is yourself, especially if you're already a fool. But they can't fool you.

They can't make you pretend your bills aren't going up like Hunter's pulse after an eight-ball. They can't deny your bank account is shrinking faster than Jesse Watters at a nude beach. And they can't make you ignore the fact that the candidate they want you to vote for presided over this mess. Well, maybe undecided voters are smarter than the hacks who keep lying to them. So, who is she? Still remains the question. Too bad all the pundits in the world can't help her answer that."
Disney Workers Demand $30 Million In Pay Negotiations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/09/12/disney-workers-demand-30-million-in-pay-negotiations/,2024-09-12T21:47:44Z,"Workers at Disneyland Paris have upped the ante in their annual pay discussions with management by demanding a package of benefits which would cost the theme park operator in excess of $30 million.

The talks began earlier this month and threaten to cast a dark spell on the fortunes of the theme park complex which made a $193.3 million (€175 million) operating profit on record revenue of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion) last year as we revealed in The Guardian.

It comes at just the wrong time for Disney's Experiences division, which includes its theme parks and cruise lines. Disney's executives like to boast that it has delivered record profit and revenue for multiple quarters but those days are gone.

In May, Disney's stock began a steep decline after its chief financial officer Hugh Johnston warned of a softening in theme park attendance due to ""a global moderation from peak post‐Covid travel"". It set the scene for a dramatic fall from grace.

Last month Disney announced that in the third quarter to 29 June, Experiences revenue rose by 2% to $9.3 billion ($8.4 billion) thanks to higher guest spending at its domestic parks and cruise lines, as well as increased spending per-room. However, it is a sharp decline on the 13% increase in the revenue of the equivalent segment over the same period in 2023 compared to the previous year.

Worse still, the operating profit of Disney's Experiences division declined by 3% to $2.4 billion ($2.2 billion) in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.

The worst could be yet to come as Disney's earnings statement revealed that ""the demand moderation we saw in our domestic businesses in Q3 could impact the next few quarters. While we are actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing our cost base, we expect Q4 Experiences segment operating income to decline by mid single digits versus the prior year.""

Johnston added that ""we saw attendance flat in the quarter"" with a ""flattish revenue number"" forecast for the fourth quarter and a slowdown expected for ""a few quarters."" Disneyland Paris represented almost half of the revenue of Disney's international parks last year and 17.5% of its operating profit so it is far from insignificant.

The decline in the division's overall operating profit was driven by costs climbing at Disney's domestic parks so the last thing Disney needs is to have to pay workers more in Paris. However, it may have little choice about that.

Last week the Disneyland Paris branch of the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) became the first union to put its cards on the table in the pay discussion. Writing in Blooloop, the world's leading themed entertainment industry outlet, we revealed that the CFDT has demanded a 6% pay rise, up from 5.5% last year. It is far ahead of the 3.5% average which accountancy giant Deloitte forecasts across all areas of French industry for 2024.

On the eve of the second round of talks, which took place today, the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions (UNSA), a French confederation of trade unions, issued its demands. They cover everything from increased pay for working on Sundays to longer compassionate leave and measures to level out the gender pay gap.

However, the star attraction for workers is the proposal for a ""bonus of 1,200 Euros net for each employee."" It is 20% more than the CFDT asked for and a staggering 71.4% increase on the bonus paid last year to staff at Disneyland Paris. The latest filings for the resort's operating company, Euro Disney Associés (EDA), show that it employs 17,702 staff bringing the total cost of the bonus alone to $23.4 million (€21.2 million) but it doesn't stop there.

The UNSA has done away with demanding a percentage-based pay rise by instead asking for a ""general increase of 200 Euros net for all employees."" That would cost EDA a further $3.9 million (€3.5 million) giving a total of $27.3 million from these two perks alone. Then comes the cost of all the other benefits that the UNSA is asking for, chief of which is reimbursing 100% of employees' public transport costs. That's in addition to doubling private transport mileage expenses and creating a green mobility bonus.

As we revealed in July, the staff in Paris are the only employees of any Disney resort who receive a share of its profits, putting them amongst the world's most well-paid theme park workers. However, there is good reason why they need more money.

The political system in France has been in deadlock since snap elections took place in early July, with no party able to form a clear majority in the country's National Assembly. Testimony to this, it took French president Emmanual Macron two months to find a new Prime Minister who appealed to enough politicians to get elected.

The instability dented consumer confidence in France and contributed to the country's rate of inflation failing to fall as much as analysts expected last month. It reversed from 2.3% in July to 1.9% in August but didn't drop across the board. According to France's national statistics bureau, prices in the service sector rose from 2.6% to 3.1% in August, especially in accommodation and transport.

It has been felt at a grassroots level with 75% of 1,200 hospitality professionals in France revealing in a recent survey that tourist spending has fallen this year.

According to another survey, only 38% of the 1,000 tourism professionals interviewed said they were satisfied with their July financial results, compared with more than 80% between 2019 and 2022. About 70% of the respondents recorded a drop in sales with French newspaper Le Monde reporting that, out of all of the reasons for this, ""the most important was the rise in prices.""

In June France's central bank forecast that inflation would hit 2.5% over the next year which is more than double the rate in 2019. However, it is still a marked decline on the past two years.

Inflation surged throughout 2022 hitting a peak of 6.3% in February last year. By then, the cost of electricity in France had risen almost four-fold since Russia invaded Ukraine whilst flour, butter and eggs were about 50% more expensive.

Disneyland Paris made sure it didn't lose out. It waved its magic wand in 2022 and increased one day, two-park ticket prices by 8.4% to $142.51 (€129) with annual passes rising the following year.

As we revealed in The Times, the ticket price hikes, combined with the opening of a new land themed to the hit Avengers movies, led to EDA's revenue rising nearly three-fold to $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion) in 2022. It outstripped a 57.8% increase in costs leaving the company with a $51.9 million (€47 million) operating profit, its highest in a decade. It didn't escape the attention of the staff.

""We see the figures, the profits they have made, the wealth that has been communicated by the Walt Disney Company,"" said Disneyland Paris worker Ahmed Masrour in an interview last summer with French news magazine L'Obs. ""The visitors sometimes chat with us and say to us: 'You're right, we don't understand why the ticket price has increased, why the prices of all the products at Disneyland have increased, starting with car parking, while you employees, your salary does not follow suit.'""

Ironically, the employees are known as cast members due to the roles they play in a themed environment but the atmosphere was anything but a fairytale at Disneyland Paris last summer. Cast members demanded a monthly wage rise of $221.48 (€200) as well as an increase to the bonus to long-serving staff and higher pay for working on Sundays. Management dug its heels in leading to a series of increasingly tense strikes through the two parks at Disneyland Paris. It shattered the fairytale atmosphere in the run up to last year's pay negotiations. This had a magic touch as the cast members ended up with a bumper package of benefits thanks to the UNSA's tireless work.

Although there have been no strikes this year and inflation is sharply down on 2023, the UNSA is far from complacent. In a statement it claimed that its members are facing ""work overload, insufficient salaries, lack of recognition and degraded working conditions. These legitimate concerns can no longer be ignored and it is time to get concrete answers from management."" Disneyland Paris declined to comment as it said it is legally unable to do so at this stage of the negotiations.

The process is a world away from the one open to employees at Disneyland in California. Earlier this year Disney offered them an average increase of less than a dollar per year which was only improved after they threatened to strike. Their new deal gives them at least $24 per hour but, unlike in France, it is locked in for three years so it will be some time before they can demand more.

Workers at Walt Disney World in Orlando are even worse off as their latest pay rise only gave them $18 per hour, let alone a share in the profits of the parks.

However, a happy ending could still be far, far away for the workers at Disneyland Paris. Following today's talks, the UNSA said that ""we remain unsatisfied, the management still has very traditional, and insufficient, vision."" It added ""we are wondering about the real intention of negotiating. Or is the process already decided and tied up? What is the point of engaging in a pseudo-negotiation?""

The outcome is far from certain as there is no pressure of strikes or soaring inflation like last year. The workers are heading into the unknown and although there is only one day of talks left, they still have everything to play for."
"Trump says 'there will be no third debate,' claiming victory against Harris in Tuesday's showdown",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-there-no-third-debate-claiming-victory-against-harris-tuesdays-showdown,2024-09-12T20:24:19Z,"Former President Donald Trump discusses his performance at the ABC News Presidential Debate and reflects on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks after 23 years.

Former President Trump said he will not participate in a third debate this election cycle, claiming victory after Tuesday's showdown against Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Harris campaign on Tuesday after the debate said they would be interested in having another. But Trump was lukewarm to the idea, and on Thursday afternoon, he rejected the proposal completely.

""When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, 'I WANT A REMATCH,'"" Trump posted on his Truth Social account. ""Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats' Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate.""

TRUMP SPARS WITH HARRIS, MODERATORS DURING HEATED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN'

Trump said Harris and President ""Crooked Joe"" Biden have ""destroyed our country, with millions of criminals and mentally deranged people pouring into the USA, totally unchecked and unvetted, and with Inflation bankrupting our Middle Class.""

""Everyone knows this, and all of the other problems caused by Kamala and Joe -- it was discussed in great detail during the First Debate with Joe, and the Second Debate with Comrade Harris,"" Trump said.

Trump participated in a town hall on Sept. 4 on Fox News, after Fox News invited the former president and Harris to debate.

MORNING GLORY: THE WORST DEBATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES

""She was a no-show at the Fox Debate, and refused to do NBC & CBS,"" Trump continued. ""Kamala should focus on what she should have done during the last almost four year period.""

He added: ""THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!""

Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump in June instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House - and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term.

Facing increased pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden, in a blockbuster announcement on July 21, ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Harris. She faced no opposition and quickly sewed up the nomination.

Trump and Harris faced off in a heated debate Tuesday night, sparring about abortion, immigration, Israel, the economy and a range of other issues -- but Trump also battled the ABC News moderators, who were quick to challenge and ""fact check"" the 45th president, while leaving Harris' distortions untouched.

Shortly after it concluded, Trump told Fox News Digital that he thought it was his ""best debate ever, especially because it was three on one."" A CNN flash poll afterward found a majority of watchers thought Harris won the debate. The majority of a Fox News Digital focus group also gave Harris the victory, although the Democrat took criticism for continuing to sound evasive on major issues.

On the heels of Tuesday's ABC debate, FOX News Media executives sent a letter to the Harris and Trump campaigns offering to host another debate, with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum as moderators.

How The Fed Rate Cut Could Make Bitcoin Volatile,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2024/09/12/how-the-fed-rate-cut-could-make-bitcoin-volatile/,2024-09-12T19:53:12Z,"(Full disclosure: I'm helping build Coinbits.app, a bitcoin banking platform.)

The bitcoin market is bracing for a volatile month as the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut looms large.

After a sharp price decline from $65,000 in late August to roughly $59,000 at the start of September, bitcoin is poised for further turbulence. The outcome of the Federal Reserve's next meeting, expected to result in a rate cut, will likely dictate the near-term trajectory of bitcoin's exchange rate with the dollar, but it's the potential for deeper economic instability that has the market on edge.

Most market participants expect a 25 basis point (bps) cut, but speculation persists that the Fed could opt for a more aggressive 50 bps reduction, a move that would likely trigger heightened volatility.

As the global economy falters under the weight of central bank mismanagement and the resultant distortion of the market, people who use bitcoin as a hedge against monetary debasement may have their conviction tested.

The anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate cut has heightened market uncertainty. Historically, rate cuts have been viewed as bullish for bitcoin, as monetary easing typically weakens the U.S. dollar and boosts demand for assets. However, this rate cut may prove to be a double-edged sword.

After embarking on an aggressive tightening cycle in 2022 to curb inflation, the Fed is now being forced to pivot as economic conditions weaken. This is to be expected in a financial system addicted to easy money and unable to sustain growth without continuous injection of liquidity.

For bitcoin, which has historically benefited from monetary easing, the Fed's decision may have counterintuitive results. Bitcoin thrives as an alternative to fiat currencies, particularly in times of currency debasement. However, the potential for a more aggressive 50 bps cut introduces a factor for which market participants may not yet be fully accounting: heightened concerns about an impending economic slowdown or a recession. If the Fed signals deeper concerns about the economy, market participants may retreat from assets that they perceive as risky, including bitcoin, despite the fact that its value as a decentralized monetary network remains unchanged.

The concern over a 50 bps cut stems from the broader macroeconomic backdrop. The Fed's previous rate hikes, delivered with urgency in 2022, were intended to curb inflation, but they also exposed underlying weaknesses in the economy -- weaknesses now surfacing in the form of a slowing labor market.

Last Friday's jobs report was another chapter in a long, sad story of the labor market in the U.S. that has been underperforming for years. Until now, this trend has been hidden by egregiously inflated jobs reports that have been repeatedly revised down after the news cycle has moved on. The most recent report did actually contain signs of a weakening labor market at the time of its release - showing that the jobs market is, in fact, so weak that its weakness cannot be hidden any longer.

Central banks around the world are also grappling with weakening economies, with both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan facing challenges that could impact global liquidity flows. China, meanwhile, is pumping liquidity into its slowing economy in a desperate bid to stave off recession.

On top of this, the contentious presidential election season in the U.S. has given rise to the prospect of economic policies that are overtly hostile to investment and growth. If the proponents of such policies gain political momentum, expect even more volatility in bitcoin's exchange rate with the dollar.

Bitcoin's correlation with global economic conditions suffers from multiple personality disorder, making moves in the price impossible to predict. In some cases, such as the initial invasion of Ukraine, bitcoin behaves as a risk-off asset. In others, such as the onset of COVID, it behaves as a risk-on asset. What does remain clear is that central banks' attempts to paper over deep fissures in the rules-based order with liquidity injections ultimately serve to highlight the long-term benefits of bitcoin. Over time, bitcoin's monetary properties will win out.

As September progresses, bitcoin investors are bracing for a potentially bumpy ride. With the Fed's upcoming rate cut decision looming large, the outlook for bitcoin remains uncertain. A 25 bps cut may be priced in, limiting its short-term impact, but a 50 bps cut could signal deeper economic concerns, triggering a wave of volatility.

However, there is still room for surprises. If the Fed manages to strike the right balance between addressing economic risks and maintaining market confidence, bitcoin could emerge from this turbulent period in a stronger position. However, if recession fears continue to grow, bitcoin's price could see further declines, leaving investors to navigate an increasingly unpredictable market."
Here's Why Pennsylvania Might Be The Most Important Prize In The 2024 Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/12/heres-why-pennsylvania-might-be-the-most-important-prize-in-the-2024-election/,2024-09-12T19:47:24Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in five of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than three points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states to win the White House.

Harris Expands Lead Over Trump In First Post-Debate Polls,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/12/harris-expands-lead-over-trump-in-first-post-debate-polls/,2024-09-12T19:44:05Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by five points in the first two major national polls taken following Tuesday's debate -- in which pundits widely considered Harris the winner.

2.7. That's how many points Harris was leading Trump by in polls on the day of the debate, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average. Her polling surge appeared to be tapering off, with Trump notching one of his first leads by a major pollster since early August with a New York Times/Siena survey taken Sept. 3-6 that found him up by one point, 48% to 47%.

Tuesday's debate -- the first and only scheduled showdown between Trump and Harris and the first time the two met in person -- was widely considered the most consequential night of the 2024 election. It was particularly high stakes for Harris, as voters are less familiar with her from a personal and policy perspective considering her late entrance into the race. While she didn't float any new policy proposals during the debate, she and Trump traded their usual barbs over the economy, the troubled U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the border and abortion. The debate came a little over two months after President Joe Biden's disastrous debate with Trump that effectively ended his presidential campaign, paving Harris' path to securing the Democratic nomination.

ABC moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir faced criticism from Trump allies for fact-checking Trump in multiple instances, but never Harris. News outlets that fact-checked the candidates' answers found that Trump made far more baseless or factually wrong statements -- such as inflation being the worst it's ever been -- than Harris, though Harris did stretch the truth in a few cases, including by saying she made her position on fracking clear in 2020, and wasn't corrected by moderators.

Deal Overview

On July 27, 2023, TC Energy's board of directors announced that it has decided to pursue a tax-free separation of the Liquids Pipelines business into South Bow Corporation (spin-off entity). Accordingly, on September 09, 2024, TC Energy announced the distribution record date and timelines for the transaction. Post-separation TC Energy will continue to focus on Natural Gas Pipeline infrastructure, Power and Energy business driven by nuclear and hydro energy storage, while South Bow Corporation will focus on Liquid Pipeline business.

The spinoff has obtained necessary tax rulings in Canada and the US, along with shareholder and court approvals. As per management, if the remaining conditions are met or waived, the arrangement will take effect on October 1, 2024. The record date for the spin-off is September 25, 2024 and the spin-off ratio is set to be 0.2:1. This implies each TC Energy shareholder will receive 0.2 shares of South Bow common stock for every one share of TC Energy's common stock.

TC Energy Common Shares are expected to trade in the 'due bill' markets on both the TSX and NYSE and the common shares of both the companies are expected to commence when-issued trading on TSX from September 25, 2024, until the close of business on October 1, 2024. There will not be when-issued trading for both the stocks on the NYSE. TC Energy will trade under ""TRP.W"" ticker and South Bow under ""SOBO"" during the when issued period.

Deal Rationale

TC Energy is a leading Canadian Energy infrastructure company with a presence in three core businesses: Natural Gas Pipelines, Liquids Pipelines and Power and Energy Solutions. Regionwide, its operations are divided into Canadian Natural Gas Pipeline, U.S. Natural Gas Pipeline, Mexico Natural Gas Pipeline, Liquids Pipeline and Power and Energy Solution. It mainly generates, stores, and delivers energy to people across North America. For the past two years, the management has been conducting a strategic review of their business and focusing on allocating capital to their business according to their growth prospects. Following the strategic review, the management decided to retain its Natural Gas Pipeline, Storage and Power business while it will be spinning off its Liquid Pipelines and Storage business.

TC Energy (consolidated) is a highly levered company with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.1x as of December 2023. The management has targeted reducing its debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 4.75x by 2024E. It has been taking various measures to deleverage itself and has sold 40.0% of its holdings in British Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf system in July 2024 for $3.9 billion. These proceeds are being used to decrease the debt and lower the company's leverage by 0.4x. Furthermore, the anticipated proceeds from the spin-off of the Liquid Pipeline business (~C$ 8.0 billion) will also be employed to repay the parent company's debt. After the spin-off, the company will retain control of its Natural Gas Pipeline network spanning ~93,600 kilometers from western Canada to the US north-east and Gulf coast, addressing more than 25.0% of North America's energy demands. Furthermore, the pipelines managed by TC Energy are responsible for delivering ~30.0% of the gas destined for export from US LNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. Additionally, TC Energy will be the provider for Canada's inaugural LNG terminal, scheduled for completion in 2025E. Additionally, boasting a three-decade track record, the Power section commands a generating capacity of approximately 4,600 MW. Notably, 70.0% of this capacity relies on nuclear energy, categorized as a carbon-free source, contributing significantly to environmental well-being.

The business has solid growth prospects with 96.0% of its adjusted EBITDA linked to regulated and securely contracted assets. For the next five years, the Natural Gas and Power Business is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 7.0%, with an EBITDA reaching $11.2 billion by 2026E. Hence, post spin-off, the remaining business is anticipated to have a strong growth potential and an environmentally sustainable business model compelling investors who want to invest in low-carbon companies. On the other hand, the liquid pipeline business is a relatively low-growth business. It is anticipated to grow at merely 2.0-3.0% CAGR for the next five years, with comparable EBITDA reaching $1.5 billion by 2026E. Currently, the segment has 4,900 kilometers of liquid pipeline network supplying low-cost crude to key demand markets. The management is committed to setting an impactful ESG target, but the liquid pipelines are prone to leakages and spillages, causing environmental hazards. In December 2022, the Keystone pipeline, owned by TC Energy, encountered a substantial oil spill, discharging more than 14,000 barrels of crude oil into a creek in Kansas in the U.S. This occurrence has sparked apprehensions regarding the security of the pipeline infrastructure and forced the company to reduce rates on the system.

Additionally, the Keystone XL project, which could have carried bitumen from the Northern Alberta oil sands to refineries on the US gulf coast, witnessed political attention in pursuing climate change issues. In our view, the cancellation of the proposed Keystone XL project in 2021 due to U.S. President Joe Biden revoking an essential permit could be one of the reasons behind the Liquid Pipeline business separation. Furthermore, in recent years, pipeline construction in the U.S. has encountered significant environmental resistance, driven by activists aiming to hinder the expansion of infrastructure that perpetuates dependence on fossil fuels. Therefore, the decision to separate the liquid pipeline business to concentrate on environmentally sustainable and low-carbon ventures appears favorable to the management. This move caters to investors who prefer not to invest in both businesses collectively.

This move caters to investors who prefer not to invest in both businesses collectively.

Sustainable business model set for long-term growth Over the past ten years, TC Energy has delivered around a 3.0% revenue CAGR meeting ~30.0% of North American natural oil gas demand. The company operates on a low-risk business model, with 97.0% of its natural gas and power business being rate-regulated (peer average ~57.0%) with long-term contracts. This helps not only mitigate the volatility in commodity prices but also assures long-term revenue visibility. Moreover, TC Energy engages in both constructing new projects and divesting less profitable ones to optimize cash flow. Expansion of sales is achieved through bringing additional projects online and adjusting contract prices upwards. This makes its business model less risky compared to midstream peers and sustainable in the long run.

Canada Gas Pipeline EBITDA to grow at mid-single-digit

In 2023, TC Energy's Canada Natural Gas Pipelines segment, accounting for 29% of total EBITDA, saw low-double-digit growth driven by increased throughput on the Nova Gas Transmission Line (NGTL) following recent project completions. Looking ahead, strong volumes and ongoing projects are expected to drive EBITDA growth in 2024, with mid-single-digit annual gains projected through 2026, supported by $4.3 billion in capital investments in NGTL. This segment remains the most shielded from volatility, benefiting from regulated tolls that provide stable cash flow and safeguard rates against inflation.

Mexico Natural Gas Pipeline offers higher risk and return

Mexico operations of TC Energy has high execution risk however it offers attractive returns due to solid EBITDA growth. The completion of the lateral section of Villa de Reyes and the expected launch of the south section in the 2H24 could significantly increase TC Energy's EBITDA from its Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines by a low double-digit percentage in 2025. Moreover, the Southeast Gateway project, which is anticipated to start in 2025, is likely to add C$800.0 million annually to EBITDA. In addition, TC Energy's strategic partnership with CFE, Mexico's state-owned utility, would strengthens its presence in the country and resolve previous arbitration issues that had hindered operations.

Opportunities for growth in the US gas market through LNG exports

TC Energy's US natural Gas and Pipeline business's EBITDA is anticipated to grow in the mid-single digit until 2026 due to various projects and expansion strategies to capitalize on coal to gas transition, increasing US gas to Mexico and the rise in LNG exports globally. These initiatives and expansions in projects such as GTN is anticipated to drive robust volume growth going forward.

Consistent dividend payer despite lack of FCF

The company is committed to consistently paying dividends and has an impressive track record of increasing dividends. TC Energy has also maintained a conservative Funds from Operations (FFO) payout ratio of 51.0% and an estimated dividend yield of around 6.0% bodes well for income seeking investors and also provides defensive options amidst any macroeconomic uncertainties.

Strategic actions in place to lower the high leverage

TC Energy's net debt to EBITDA ratio is slightly above 5.0x, which is significantly higher than the midstream C-Corp peer group's median leverage of 4.0x. However, leverage has improved since last year, primarily due to asset divestments totalling C$5.3 billion. Management is committed to further reducing leverage, aiming for a target of 4.75x by the end of 2024. To achieve this, they plan additional asset divestments of C$3.0 billion in 2024, along with new operations, and capex optimization. The deleveraging would also be aided by proceeds from ~$7.9 billion South Bow debt issuance, which will be used to repay TC Energy deb. Future leverage reduction is expected through incremental EBITDA from new operations, maintaining a capex limit of C$6.0-7.0 billion, and cost-saving initiatives.

Post spin-off synergies to drive EBITDA growth

Given the slower growth in the liquids segment, TC Energy's EBITDA gains are likely to accelerate in the coming years after the spin-off of South Bow. Following the spin-off TC Energy is expected to increase its EBITDA by 5.0% to 7.0%. This growth will be driven by ongoing investments and strong performance in its Canadian, US, and Mexican natural gas units..

South Bow (Spin-Off Entity)

Wide network of pipelines connecting vast oil reserves

South Bow boasts an extensive liquid pipeline network spanning 4,900 km (3,045 miles), including the Keystone Pipeline System, which directly connects the vast oil reserves of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) to major refining markets in the US Midwest and Gulf Coast. With a capacity of approximately 14.0 million barrels per day (bbl/d), this network is crucial in the energy landscape. Additionally, its Alberta assets, such as the Grand Rapids and White Spruce facilities, provide further market diversification, serving global markets via Canada's West Coast. The outlook for North American oil production remains strong, reinforcing its role as a key energy sector component for the foreseeable future. Projections suggest a steady growth trajectory for WCSB crude oil supply, expected to increase by 500,000 bbl/d by the end of the decade. Furthermore, refining utilization in TC Energy's key markets is anticipated to remain robust until 2050, ensuring a stable and reliable demand for pipeline services.

Gradual expansion supported by robust commercial contracts

The Keystone Pipeline, which transports heavy Canadian oil to the US Gulf Coast, derives about 88.0% of its EBITDA from long-term contracts, ensuring cash flow predictability. Nearly 96.0% of these contracts are with investment-grade counterparties. Additionally, the company has a favourable average contract value of 8-years on the Keystone system which is above the peer average and longest amongst the peers. Additionally, the segment has a strong demand across the Keystone system and has received approval for re-contracting at market driven rates which is advantageous. However eventual expansion of Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) pipeline could potentially strain the Keystone Pipeline's spot barrels.

Balancing sustainable EBITDA growth but high leverage will be a concern

The liquids business is expected to achieve steady annual EBITDA growth of 2.0% to 3.0%. While this growth rate is slower compared to other segments within TC Energy, it remains consistent and is primarily driven by organic factors. However, post-separation, South Bow's balance sheet will be highly levered, with the company projected to hold $7.9 billion in debt against an EBITDA of around $1.5-$1.6 billion, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 5.0x, which is significantly higher than the peer average. Although the company plans to accelerate its deleveraging efforts within three years post-spin, aiming to reduce the leverage ratio by about 0.25x to 0.50x, short-term challenges following the separation could hinder achieving these targets.

TC Energy's sustainable business model is well-positioned for sustainable long-term growth backed by its strong market footing, low-risk rate-regulated and long-term contracted model. Additionally, the company's solid track record of growing dividend payouts and an impressive dividend yield of around 6.0% bodes well for income seeking investors. However, the company's higher leverage (even higher than the peer median) remains an overhang. That said, the company is taking strategic actions such as divestitures, cost savings, capex optimization and upcoming commercialization of news assets to reduce the leverage and so far, it has met with reasonable success in bringing down the leverage in recent times. We compare TC Energy with other listed companies engaged in natural gas, power and oil business such as Enbridge Inc, Enterprise Product, OneOk Inc, Suncor Energy, Williams Cos Inc, Kinder Morgan, Imperial Oil, Targa Resources, Pembina Pipeline, Antero Midstream, Keyera Corp, Enlink Midstream, Equitrans Midstream, Plains GP Holdings, Mattr Corp. Our ascribed EV/Adj. EBITDA on FY25E Adjusted EBITDA is at a slight premium compared to peers considering the strong market footing, growth prospects and a healthy dividend yield. We apply EV/Adj. EBITDA multiple of 10.2x to arrive at a fair value estimate of C$66.30 per share. Considering the USD:CAD rate of 1.36, we arrive at a target price of $48.75 per share, suggesting a 6.3% upside from the last closing price. We maintain our HOLD rating on TC Energy.

South Bow Inc. (Spin-Off Entity)

South Bow has a wide network of liquids pipeline covering an area of 4,900 kms notably through its Keystone Pipeline System which derives about 88.0% of its EBITDA from long-term contracts, providing the company with wide organic growth opportunities and ensuring cash flow predictability. However, the pace of growth is slow compared to other segments of TC Energy with an additional concern around high leverage post spin (~5.0x) which weighs on its valuations. We compare South Bow with other publicly listed companies operating in the natural gas, power, and oil sectors, including Enbridge Inc, Enterprise Product, OneOk Inc, Suncor Energy, Williams Cos Inc, Kinder Morgan, Imperial Oil, Targa Resources, Pembina Pipeline, Antero Midstream, Keyera Corp, Enlink Midstream, Equitrans Midstream, Plains GP Holdings, and Mattr Corp. Our valuation multiples are at discount compared to peers considering higher leverage after separation and tepid EBITDA growth over the next couple of years. We ascribe an EV/EBITDA of 6.5x on FY25E adj. comparable EBITDA of C$1.5 billion to arrive at a fair value objective of C$14.9 per South Bow share. Considering the USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.36, we arrive at a fair value of $10.90 per South Bow share.

TC Energy (Stub)

We deduct South Bow's equity value of C$3.1 billion from the TP Energy consolidated implied equity value of C$69.2 billion to arrive at a stub value of C$66.2 billion. Our fair value estimate for stub comes out to C$63.40 per share. Considering the USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.36, our fair value of TP Energy (Stub) is $46.60 per share.

Comer unveils wide-ranging hearing on Biden-Harris 'legacy of incompetence',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/comer-unveils-wide-ranging-hearing-biden-harris-legacy-incompetence,2024-09-12T17:09:10Z,"FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is planning a hearing next week broadly targeting Biden-Harris administration policies and their effect on Americans, Fox News Digital has learned.

Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is scheduling the hearing - titled, ""A Legacy of Incompetence: Consequences of the Biden-Harris Administration's Policy Failures"" - for Thursday, Sept. 19, at 10 a.m. ET.

Comer accused President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of causing ""skyrocketing inflation, the worst border crisis in American history, high energy prices, chaos around the world, and rampant waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement at federal agencies,"" in a statement to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

IN THE TRUMP-HARRIS FACEOFF THERE WAS A CLEAR WINNER BUT DON'T BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS OVER

""Simply put, everything President Biden and Vice President Harris touches fails,"" Comer said.

""Next week's hearing will examine the Biden-Harris Administration's failed record and what can be done to reverse the damage this Administration has caused.""

It comes as House Republicans ramp up their scrutiny of Harris in the weeks since she became the Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee, replacing Biden after he dropped out of the race.

HARRIS TELLS TRUMP HE'S 'NOT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN' DURING DEBATE

Republicans have also seized on Harris' own past efforts to position herself as integral to the White House's most critical decisions. Former President Trump and his GOP allies argue that a Harris administration would be an extension of Biden and his progressive policies.

The House has also held multiple hearings on Harris' handling of the border crisis in particular, and her role as the Biden administration's ""border czar"" in charge of tackling the root causes of mass migration from Central and South America.

Comer has also led efforts to scrutinize the ties that Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has with China.

Next week's House Oversight Committee hearing will include testimony from Federal Communications Commission (FCC) member Brendan Carr, Center for Immigration Studies Executive Director Mark Krikorian, Meaghan Mobbs of the Independent Women's Forum, and former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official Mandy Gunasekera."
Good And Bad News For Those Whose Part D Drug Costs Skyrocketed Recently,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianeomdahl/2024/09/12/good-and-bad-news-for-those-whose-part-d-drug-costs-skyrocketed-recently/,2024-09-12T16:26:08Z,"It's that time of year when many of those who have Part D prescription drug coverage experience sticker shock. Here is a sample of what's happening with my clients.

Yes, unfortunately, these costs are likely correct and no, you probably didn't pick the wrong plan.

The simple explanation is both these clients hit the Coverage Gap.

In 2006, when Part D prescription drug coverage began, there were four payment stages with different costs.

Deductible: The standard deductible started out at $250, was $535 this year, and will be $590 in 2025. This is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before the plan starts paying. A plan can choose to charge no deductible or any amount up to the set level. Generally, only Tier 1 and Tier 2 drugs are subject to this deductible but each plan determines that.

Initial Coverage: By design, a beneficiary pays 25% of the cost of medications in this stage. Most plans choose to charge a copayment (a fixed amount such as $3 or $10). Once the amount that the individual and plan have spent reaches a set threshold, $5,300 in 2024 (approximately $1,300 out of pocket), the next stage begins.

The Coverage Gap: This is commonly known as the donut hole. By design, the drug plan member is responsible for most or all of the costs in this stage. In the early days of Medicare drug plans, those who landed here had to pay 100% of the cost for every drug. Then, the Affordable Care Act provided discounts, starting at 50%. Every year since, discounts gradually increased until the donut hole closed completely in 2020. Contrary to popular opinion, that does not make drugs free; it simply means everyone pays a straight 25% of the cost of medications, likely increasing the cost sharing for expensive medications and dropping it for cheaper ones.

Once the total of the individual's out-of-pocket costs and brand-name discounts reach $8,000, it's on to the last payment stage.

Catastrophic Coverage: Through 2023, drug plan members hitting this stage paid 5% of the cost of medications. However, the Inflation Reduction Act eliminated the coinsurance. So those who cross this threshold will not pay another cent for the remainder of the year, saving about $3,100 in out-of-pocket costs.

For all of those who are experiencing this sticker shock, remember these points.

First, the bad news: All of those in shock, whether they have a stand-alone Part D drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with drug coverage, will be stuck paying the higher drug costs.

With a piece of good news for some: If drug costs reach the Catastrophic Coverage threshold, then they will not pay any additional costs for their medications.

More good news in 2025 for some: After 18 rather costly years for many, this is the last hurrah for the donut hole. The IRA has eliminated it and, in its place, introduced the $2,000 cap on Part D drug costs. Once out-of-pocket costs hit $2,000, there will be no additional cost for medications.

And bad news for just about anyone with Part D coverage: The good news sounds really good for those who are reeling from price increases now but don't start celebrating yet. The $2,000 cap will have repercussions because of the impact on Part D drug plans.

Once hitting the cap, medications miraculously do not become free; rather, the responsible party for payment changes; the portion that drug plans must pay will increase dramatically. That probably means there will be some changes to help these plans absorb those costs. Many pundits are predicting increased plan premiums, increases in cost sharing (copayments and coinsurance), more restrictions (prior authorization and step therapy) on costly medications, and even dropping drugs from the plan's formulary or the list of covered drugs.

The Medicare Open Enrollment begins next month, October 15. Remember to open your Annual Notice of Changes, pay attention to what's happening with your drug plan, and review your options. If not, you're likely to face more bad news in 2025."
"How Far Does A $100,000 Salary Really Go In 2024?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/09/12/how-far-does-a-100000-salary-really-go-in-2024/,2024-09-12T16:09:44Z,"Sarah Mitchell is a marketing director in McAllen, Texas. On her generous $100,000 annual salary, one might be inclined to suppose that she lives luxuriously and can afford more than mere day-to-day necessities.

But Mitchell has discovered, like so many other high-earning professionals, that the glamour and appeal of a $100,000 salary is not what it used to be. Once considered the golden benchmark of career and job success, high-earners are realizing that the salary comes with a high price tag to pay -- especially in popular U.S. cities and states such as Los Angeles, California, or in New York City.

""A typical monthly budget, allocated to necessities like mortgage, utilities, groceries, healthcare, and personal expenses, leaves little room for significant savings or luxury expenditures,"" says Mitchell, relating her experience.

""The primary drawback of this salary scale is its decreasing purchasing power. $100,000 is no longer sufficient to guarantee a comfortable lifestyle without financial strain,"" she says. ""Based on my analysis and current living expenses, one would need a salary north of $215,000 to maintain the same standard of living that a $100,000 salary could have previously afforded.""

(This interview and others related below are edited for length and clarity.)

The high-paying jobs board for roles that pay more than $100,000 a year, Ladders, explains:

""As inflation rocketed, salary goal posts moved. The once gold standard $100,000 salary shifted. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, to match the buying power of a $100,000 job one generation ago in 1994, you'd need to earn more than $215,000 today.""

Although inflation was feverishly high last year and reached a tipping point at which it cooled in June 2024, consumers are still left to handle the aftermath and some prices have remained too high to be covered by a regular ""high"" salary.

What would have been more than enough to cover monthly expenses in addition to putting aside money for a rainy day, savings, investments, and retirement, as well as luxury or one-time purchases, is now just enough to get by and survive.

Jeff Mains, founder and CEO of Champion Leadership Group -- also based in Texas like Mitchell, commented, ""If you'd told me a decade ago that $100,000 wouldn't feel like enough, I probably wouldn't have believed it. But in today's economy, that figure feels closer to $50,000 than a six-figure sum. For me, the real problem isn't just inflation; it's how lifestyle inflation has crept into our everyday expenses.

""In Texas, where I'm based, housing prices have shot up, property taxes are no joke, and even essentials like groceries are taking bigger bites out of the budget. My typical monthly budget runs well over $7,000 when you factor in mortgage, utilities, insurance, and basic family needs, and that doesn't leave much room for the unexpected.""

It turns out that there are several factors that impact how much one is able to really earn after making $100,000. These factors include:

Bennett Heyn, Ohio-born marketing business analyst at Adobe, makes close to $110,000 a year. He worked his way up the ladder from being an intern, and initially thought that such a salary as he makes currently would be his dream salary -- in his own words, it would be ""insane"" to make that much money.

However, living in California made him realize that half of his salary was just fleeting away. ""After California taxes & deductions like 401k and insurance, I actually only earned $50k,"" Heyn says. ""$50,000 is not enough to live in the Bay Area because I have to pay $2,800 in rent and about $100-200 in groceries per week, $200-300 for going out to eat per week, parking tickets, and other expenses.""

But Heyn has discovered a solution: side hustles.

""I have taken on a bunch of side hustles to make enough income where I can freely go out to dinner and travel,"" Heyn says.

His current financial ambition? To be in a position with his side hustle career that he is able to make $200,000 or more. The business analyst from Ohio is already well on his way towards achieving his goal, having made nearly $100,000 from his side hustles in real estate investing and SEO services alone.

Mitchell, the marketing director quoted earlier in this story, boosts her income through engaging in side hustles such as freelance marketing consulting and delivering digital marketing workshops, which she says also enhances her professional skills.

Here are some steps you can take so that you too, can supplement and boost the income from your job with a work-from-home side hustle:

Pretty soon, you'll find that you won't need to worry about being limited by your $100,000 a year salary. Although the ever-changing goalpost for salaries can be discouraging, it's a relief to know that your hands are not tied. Through following the above steps, you can achieve ultimate financial independence and freedom."
Fed Expected To Start Interest Rate Cuts Incrementally On September 18,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/09/12/fed-expected-to-start-interest-rate-cuts-incrementally-on-september-18/,2024-09-12T16:09:24Z,"Markets expect the Federal Open Market Committee to most likely cut interest rates by 0.25% to 5% to 5.25% on September 18. That's according to the CME FedWatch Tool which tracks the implicit forecasts of fixed income markets.

Previously a larger rate cut was a strong possibility, but the chance of that has receded to around 10% currently after recent jobs and inflation data. Forecasting site Kalshi gives a 99% chance of a rate cut at the September meeting. FOMC policymakers have also clearly signaled that lower interest rates should be expected in the near future.

Headline Consumer Price Index inflation was reported at 2.5% for the 12 months to August. Core inflation, which removes food and energy price changes, is running slightly higher at a 3.2% annual rate. Personal Consumption Expenditure inflation, a metric is the FOMC typically prefers is running at a 2.5% annual rate to July 2024, and 2.6% excluding food and energy. Those figures will be updated for August on September 27.

To the extent inflation is running over 2% currently within the CPI that's mainly due to shelter costs, this category is rising at a 5.2% annual rate as of August and carries a high weight within the CPI series because shelter is a large part of most household budgets.

Inflation is now much less of a concern than in recent years, but is still not at the FOMC's 2% annual target. This is perhaps prompting a more measured approach to potential interest rate cuts. The FOMC want to eliminate the risk of inflation returning, even though that risk is generally considered to be declining and relatively close to target. If inflation were at 2% today, then the FOMC might be more aggressive in bringing rates lower, since the primary reason for hiking rates since 2021 was to fight elevated inflation.

On the other side of the FOMC's dual mandate, August's Employment Situation Report was somewhat reassuring, at least relative to some fears of weakening data.

Unemployment ticked down to 4.2% and non-farm payrolls grew 142,000. Nonetheless, unemployment has risen gradually for much of 2024, but August's jobs offered a degree of reassurance that the jobs market is not deteriorating as fast as some forecasts feared it might.

If the jobs market were to weaken further or faster, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates more aggressively. That said, there are two sides to this analysis. On the one hand, unemployment is edging up gradually from very low levels. As such this return to a more normal unemployment rate may not be a concern. However, historically it hasn't take much of a step-up in unemployment to trigger a recession. Indicators such as the Sahm Rule, which looks for a 0.5% rise in a normalized unemployment within a 12-month window to call a recession, suggest that we could be at risk of a recession from the absolute rise in unemployment in 2024 relative to 2023 already.

Nonetheless, with inflation not completely at the FOMC's target and the jobs market cooling but suggesting a less severe decline so far, the FOMC may avoid larger interest rate cuts, at least for the September meeting.

However, fixed income markets assess that a larger interest rate cut of perhaps 0.5% is quite possible when the FOMC meets in November or December. That could be because markets project further rises in unemployment.

There are three more Employment Situation Reports to come in 2024. These are on October 4, November 1 and December 6. If these show further deterioration in the jobs market, and especially if inflation moves even closer to 2% over the same period, then the FOMC may lean towards more aggressive rate cuts."
Mortgage Rates Fall To 6.2% -- Lowest Borrowing Costs Since Early 2023,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/12/mortgage-rates-fall-to-62-lowest-borrowing-costs-since-early-2023/,2024-09-12T16:09:08Z,"Mortgage rates tumbled this week to the lowest level since early last year, according to data released Thursday, as some Americans begin to enjoy the early fruits of an upcoming pivot from the Federal Reserve, though prospective homeowners still face significantly higher borrowing costs than they faced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the relief, it's still far pricier to take out a mortgage than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the housing market; the 30-year fixed rate was never above 6% from 2009 to 2021 and wasn't above 4% from May 2019 to March 2022.

Mortgage rates are closely correlated to movements in yields for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, which in turn are heavily influenced by the market's anticipation of the medium-term direction of the federal funds rate. Yields for 10-year Treasury notes touched their lowest level since June 2023 this week, hovering between 3.6% and 3.7%, a far cry from the 5% threshold it hovered at last fall, when mortgage rates peaked. Mortgage rates skyrocketed in recent years as the Fed raised rates from 0% to 0.25% to 5.25% to 5.5% to combat inflation, while steadily declining inflation throughout 2024 has been the driver of lighter policy expectations. Traders betting on the direction of the federal funds rate price in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5% as the most likely scenario by year's end and 2.75% to 3% as the most likely range by the end of 2025, according to CME Group data, indicating there may be further relief on deck for mortgage seekers."
How To Prepare Your Dividend Portfolio For A Recession,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/09/12/how-to-prepare-your-dividend-portfolio-for-a-recession/,2024-09-12T15:38:59Z,"One year ago, I wrote to you that it was time to buy bonds again. The ""index huggers"" who only know SPY thought we were nuts for talking fixed income.

The popular narrative at the time (which aged like boxed wine) was that interest rates would rocket to the moon in order to contain inflation. Or help the government fund its ballooning deficit. Or some line of reasoning.

When rates rise, bond prices fall. Hence, the prevailing vanilla sentiment was that bonds were for bums.

We original thinkers disagreed. We reasoned -- correctly -- that rates fall when recession fears grow. Period. 'Nuff said.

Our high fixed-income priest from DoubleLine, Jeffrey Gundlach, was equally sanguine in the heat of the moment. The ""Bond God"" advised investors not to worry about then-rising rates and instead to ""Buy a T-Bill and chill.""

The T-Bills worked out fine but our contrarian twist on Gundlach's formula worked out even better. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped from 5% a year ago to 3.7%. And bond portfolios have boomed.

Our favorite vehicle to ride this move higher? We looked past T-Bills for select closed-end funds (CEFs) -- like the one run by Gundlach and his main man Jeffrey Sherman instead!

This ""maraschino cherry"" fund DoubleLine Yield Opportunities (DLY) (pronounced ""dilly"" by the Jeffreys at DoubleLine) yielded 9.5% when we discussed it last September. This mega payout was our baseline return -- a nice starting point! -- and nearly double the chill T-bill yields.

DLY also sold at a 4% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Which meant the Jeffreys' hand-picked bonds were selling for 96 cents on the dollar. That was quite the deal.

The fund's top holding features 8.41%-paying bonds from Freddie Mac. Did you get a phone call about this issuance? Me neither. The Jeffreys likely got the first ring and bought everything they wanted.

The yields from Freddie maps to DLY's current 8.4% yield perfectly. Vanilla investors (and mainstream money managers) realized they were late to our DLY & Co. party. They have since crashed it hard, closing DLY's discount window.

DLY has delivered 24% total returns -- including dividends -- since we discussed last September.

But Brett! I can hear you asking. Aren't we worried about a recession given the gloomy jobs data and hence the creditworthiness of DLY's portfolio?

First, I'm not worried about Freddie's paper. As a pseudo-government agency, these 8.4% yields are not only elite but also secure. And generally speaking I trust the Jeffreys to evaluate credit.

Second, I'm not so sure we are staring down a hard landing. For fiscal 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $1.9 trillion deficit on $4.9 trillion in tax receipts. And yes, this is the CBO that paints its projections with rose-colored ink.

So, we have nearly $5 trillion in revenues and almost $7 trillion in expenditures. A 40% overshoot.

Where is the money coming from? The US Treasury is (ahem) finessing debt issuance to guide long-term interest rates lower than they otherwise would be. This ""Quiet QE"" is similar in flavor to the yield-curve control that Japan has implemented for many years.

The result is monetary inflation. And if the economy keeps rolling, which it may very well do thanks to an extra $2 trillion, a soft or even no landing scenario is possible.

Don't trust me? Then keep it simple and buy US Treasuries. iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) and SPDR Portfolio Long-Term Treasury ETF (SPTL) pay 3.8% and 3.7% respectively. The purest play on a hard landing is plain ol' US Treasuries with long durations.

Boring? Of course. We love boring when it comes to fixed income. Remember there are only two drivers that determine any bond's price direction:

Credit risk is not a concern with Treasuries. If Uncle Sam gets into a bind, he'll just print more money!

Which leaves duration risk for them, but opportunity for us. It's why these boring funds have double-digit upside if we see a serious recession. In 2008, TLT returned 28% including dividends while the S&P dropped 38%!

TLT has enjoyed 8.7% returns since we chatted about it last August.

While the economic outlook is uncertain, one sure thing is that bonds are back and they will see heavy trading with short-term swings between fear and greed. This is bullish for ""pick-and-shovel"" play MarketAxess (MKTX).

MarketAxess makes fixed-income trading tools. Bonds have traditionally changed hands via phone deals. Old school. MarketAxess brought bond trading into the twenty-first century.

Today, the company handles one out of every five bond trades. This is a ""big bad"" bond business. The company continues to execute, launching a new platform last year called Adaptive Auto-X, which boosted its market share nearly 5% in just a year.

When we last discussed MarketAxess in March, I made the case that the stock had 31% near-term upside. The stock has already enjoyed a 19% pop. More gains are likely as action in the bond market grows."
"Undecided voters not swayed by last debate, 'still on the fence' about the election: report",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/undecided-voters-not-swayed-last-debate-still-fence-about-election-report,2024-09-12T14:10:43Z,"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz gives his take on the ABC News Presidential Debate on 'Special Report.' (Courtesy: ABC News)

The New York Times spoke with undecided voters about their reactions after Tuesday's presidential debate, where a majority of them expressed being unswayed by the performances of both candidates.

The Times interviewed voters in five states and asked them whether the debate changed their views on the presidential race.

Shavanaka Kelly, who lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin told the Times that her three daughters laughed at former President Trump claiming migrants were stealing and eating pets in Ohio.

""It was kind of like, 'can you take him serious?'"" Kelly said. However, Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, did not move the needle either.

""She didn't, kind of, separate herself,"" Kelly said, adding that she was ""still on the fence.""

One couple in Pennsylvania, were hoping to be convinced by either candidate by the end of the debate but were disappointed.

TRUMP SAYS PROJECT 2025 'GOES WAY TOO FAR' WITH ABORTION RESTRICTIONS

""It was all disappointing,"" Sharon Reed, a retired teacher who lives in central Pennsylvania.

""Mr. Trump's tariffs and Ms. Harris's aid to young families and small businesses -- would help a couple like them, living on a fixed income that has not kept pace with inflation,"" the Times wrote.

However, after the debate, Sharon and her husband, Bob, both 77 years old, wondered how costly the candidates' policies would be. They said that neither candidate delivered enough details on their immigration or foreign policy.

""In interviews with undecided voters, many of whom The Times has interviewed regularly over the last several months, they acknowledged that Ms. Harris seemed more presidential than Mr. Trump,"" the Times wrote.

A sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Samira Ali, was left ""unsure"" about whom to vote for and that Harris still had to ""impress"" her.

Another voter, Gerald Mayes, 40, felt ""confused.""

""Nothing is clear to me, and I am really trying to follow it ... I want to know how all of this impacts my family financially,"" Mayes, based in Las Vegas, said.

""Trump had the more commanding presentation,"" Jason Henderson from Arizona, said. ""There was nothing done by Harris that made me think she's better. In any way.""

JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK

However, two voters did end up convinced by the candidates' performance.

North Carolina resident Kristen Morris said she, ""became intrigued when Ms. Harris entered the race.""

After the debate, Morris, 60, planned to vote for the vice president.

""My expectations have been met,"" Morris said.

The Times added, ""Others who have been unimpressed with their choices also found the debate clarifying -- but in their doubts about Ms. Harris.""

One voter, based in Milwaukee, ""felt nudged unexpectedly toward Trump.""

""Trump's pitch was a little more convincing than hers,"" Keilah Miller said. ""I guess I'm leaning more on his facts than her vision.""

""When Trump was in office -- not going to lie -- I was living way better,"" Miller, 34, added. ""I've never been so down as in the past four years. It's been so hard for me."""
Leveraging Behavioral Data For Exceptional Holiday Retail CX,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2024/09/12/leveraging-behavioral-data-for-exceptional-holiday-retail-cx/,2024-09-12T14:08:22Z,"Although inflation has shown signs of cooling in recent months, financially constrained consumers and a shortened 2024 holiday shopping season is projected to pose challenges for retailers. In addition to economic uncertainty, Thanksgiving will fall on the latest date it can occur this year, and retail sales are projected to slow during the week of the Presidential Election in November. These factors are raising the stakes for retailers to maximize sales and the customer experience (CX) leading up to the holidays.

Despite these Dickensian sounding factors, the outlook for retailers going into this year's holiday season is not all ""bah humbug."" According to Shopify, e-commerce sales worldwide are predicted to reach more than $6.3 trillion by the end of 2024, which marks an 9% increase over 2023 when sales topped $5.8 trillion. And, thankfully, the latest consumer trends provide retailers with a sneak peek of what to expect as well as the different factors that will allow them to capitalize on the 2024 season.

What Retailers Can Expect for the 2024 Holiday Season

According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey of approximately 7,500 consumers in the United States aged 18 and older, 52% of respondents said they plan to spend the same amount or less for holiday gifts in 2024 as they spent last year.

Among all respondents who plan to spend less, 27% will only buy gifts that are on sale and 26% plan to do more comparison shopping.

Beyond their plans for holiday shopping, consumers in the U.S. appear to be somewhat bearish amidst the economic uncertainty that has lingered in the post-pandemic era. Nearly half (45%) of those surveyed by Prosper Insights & Analytics said the economy has them spending less overall as well as taking steps to reduce household spending, including shopping for items on sale (37%), using coupons (26%), and comparative shopping online (23%).

To understand more about the mindset of online retail consumers, I recently caught up with Scott Voigt, CEO and co-founder of Fullstory, a company that helps retailers analyze and take action on their behavioral data. The survey findings, according to Voigt, reveal interesting trends that retailers can leverage in tandem with behavioral data as they strategize and prepare for the most important sales period of the year.

""As most consumers plan to spend the same or less on gifts this year, retailers can no longer rely on past performance as a reliable indicator of future results,"" Voigt said. ""It's crucial for retailers to have tools that interpret customer behavior in real-time, enabling them to promote products tailored to individual preferences and quickly identify and resolve any friction points in the online shopping experience.""

Understanding Common Online Frustration Points

Fullstory's 2024 Behavioral Data Insights report, which garnered data from 2,700 North American and European organizations across several industries, including retail, uncovered additional insights into 11.2B web sessions and 2.7B mobile sessions, providing deep insights into the aches, pains, and unseen tensions of online consumers.

According to the report, two common frustration points are 'dead clicks,' which occur when a user clicks an element such as a ""buy now"" button and nothing happens and 'rage clicks,' which occur when a user repeatedly clicks on an element out of pure annoyance. For every 1,000 sessions, the cross-industry average of dead clicks is 438 and rage clicks is 121.

The retail industry is above average in avoiding these negative interactions. However, there is still work to be done as far as the mobile experience goes. Within those sessions, frustration signals jump dramatically, with rage clicks rising from 34 to 56, and dead clicks almost doubling from 155 to 324. Despite this, mobile users are less likely to leave after an error occurs.

Despite mobile e-commerce accounting for 60% of all online shopping last year, building a great mobile experience continues to prove challenging for retailers and is a clear area to shore up ahead of the busy holiday season.

How AI and Behavioral Data Can Give Retailers an Edge

It's no secret that AI's role in enhancing CX during holiday shopping and beyond cannot be understated when coupled with behavioral data. Together, AI and behavioral data can enable a more personalized, responsive approach to customer engagement.

""AI models trained on comprehensive behavioral data have evolved to the point that they can now interpret the most subtle of visitor activity to understand intent in real time,"" Voigt said. ""This has unlocked a new sophistication in dynamic interventions to both reduce abandonment and increase ticket size through cross-sell opportunities.""

According to Voigt, these tools can also enable several other personalization use cases. By identifying and analyzing specific customer segments, retailers can better understand unique behaviors and preferences and tailor their marketing and online content accordingly. For instance, retailers can segment customers who are shopping for deals and create targeted campaigns that resonate with this group. This approach can increase engagement rates, as customers feel more valued and understood.

Against a backdrop of tightened consumer spending, retailers that want to stand out during the holiday season can empower their organizations to make better, more informed decisions by injecting AI and behavioral data into their analytics stack to transform every online visit into actionable insights. With hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, retailers can delight loyal customers as they check things off their gift list and gain new ones by providing the most seamless online shopping experience possible."
Should You Pick F5 Stock At $200?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/12/should-you-pick-f5-stock-at-200/,2024-09-12T14:08:13Z,"F5 stock (NASDAQ: FFIV) currently trades around $200 per share, roughly 20% below its pre-inflation shock highs of around $250 seen in December 2021. F5 has fared slightly better than its peer - VeriSign stock - down nearly 30% over this period. F5 has seen its services sales rise lately, while its systems sales have been trending lower, weighing on the company's overall performance.

F5 saw its stock trading at around $153 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and has recovered 30% from that level. This compares with 45% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period. Much of the rebound in FFIV stock was seen from late July this year, after the company reported an upbeat quarter, with margin expansion and the fourth quarter outlook better than the street estimates.

Notably, the changes in FFIV stock over the recent years have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FFIV face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a strong jump? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $250 implies that FFIV stock will have to gain around 23% from here, and we don't think it will materialize anytime soon. We estimate F5's valuation to be about $195 per share, close to its current market price of $200. At its current levels, FFIV stock is trading at 4.2x revenues, marginally above the 4.1x average P/S ratio seen over the last five years.

Our detailed analysis of F5's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how FFIV stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

FFIV stock declined from $38 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to around $20 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying FFIV stock lost over 45% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $53 in early 2010, rising 165% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

FFIV Fundamentals Over Recent Years

F5's revenue has risen at a 6.2% average annual growth rate from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020 (fiscal ends in September) to $2.8 billion in 2023, led by services and product revenue growth due to increasing demand and entry into new markets. F5's operating margin also expanded from 17% in 2020 to 19% in 2023. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the company's reported earnings rising from $5.01 to $6.55 over this period.

Does F5 Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

F5's total debt declined from $773 million in 2020 to $261 million now, while its total cash decreased from around $1.2 billion to $0.9 billion over the same period. The company generated $736 million in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. The company has a low debt and a good cash balance, so it appears to be in a comfortable financial position.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe F5 stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, weak consumer sentiment, and falling systems sales remain the key risk factors to realizing these gains. We think investors willing to pick FFIV will be better off waiting for a dip.

While FFIV stock looks like it is fully priced, it is helpful to see how F5's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
"JD Vance responds to Taylor Swift, flunks test of self-awareness",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-responds-taylor-swift-flunks-test-self-awareness-rcna170779,2024-09-12T13:17:36Z,"JD Vance dismissed Taylor Swift as ""a billionaire celebrity who is fundamentally disconnected"" from Americans' interests. Did he think this through?

It wasn't long after Vice President Kamala Harris dominated Donald Trump in their debate when the Democratic nominee received some additional good news: Pop star Taylor Swift issued a written statement endorsing her 2024 candidacy.

Predictably, much of the right did not respond to the news well. Assorted far-right media personalities threw online tantrums; conspiratorial billionaire Elon Musk published a creepy message to the social media platform he bought; and Trump whined on Fox News, predicting that the entertainer will ""probably pay a price for it ... in the marketplace.""

Swift, it's worth noting for context, also endorsed Joe Biden's candidacy four years ago -- and as my MSNBC colleague Hayley Miller noted, ""she's arguably more popular today than ever before.""

But it was the reaction from Republican vice presidential hopeful JD Vance that stood out as especially amazing. This was the message the Ohio senator pushed on Fox News, just hours after the former president's related rant:

He added that the celebrity hasn't been ""hurt"" by ""grocery prices.""

For now, let's not dwell on the fact that grocery price inflation has already cooled significantly in recent months. Let's instead consider the latest in a series of examples of Team Trump flunking tests of self-awareness.

Americans are unlikely to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans? Unless Trump is planning to drop out of the 2024 race, Vance's running mate happens to be a billionaire celebrity who is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans.

In fact, it was of particular interest that the GOP senator referenced Swift and grocery prices, given that Trump has repeatedly made public comments suggesting he has no idea how grocery stores even work -- including suggestions that he thinks consumers need to show identification to buy boxes of cereal.

Vance, in other words, probably ought to come up with a different line of attack against Swift.

As for the entertainer's impact, the General Services Administration confirmed with NBC News that, as of midday Wednesday, more than 337,00 people visited a custom URL that Swift posted on Instagram. The custom URL directs people to vote.gov, a website that helps people to register to vote."

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) canceled plans for a vote on a new government spending bill, 19 days before the existing bill expires, which would trigger a shutdown. The stopgap bill that Johnson was backing tacked on a measure that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote, but multiple Republicans expressed plans to vote against the legislation for various reasons.

Following Tuesday night's debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, it remains unclear whether the two candidates will have a rematch. On Wednesday, Trump questioned why he should participate in another debate, claiming that Harris ""was beaten badly"" and that he's ""not inclined"" to do another debate. Fox has already offered to host a second debate in October, while NBC has proposed a matchup for later this month.

MORE: About 58 million people watched Harris and Trump debate on television Tuesday night, multiple outlets reported, citing early figures from Nielsen. That's about a 12% increase in viewership from the June debate between Trump and his then-opponent President Joe Biden.

After the International Olympic Committee stripped her of an individual bronze medal, gymnast Jordan Chiles experienced internet criticism and racist comments. In her first interview since then, Chiles said at the Forbes Power Women's Summit that she felt betrayed by the sport: ""At this rate, it's not really about the medal, it's about my peace and my justice,"" the 23-year-old said. ""It's about my skin color.""

Singer Justin Timberlake will appear in court in New York on Friday to enter a plea and resolve his drunk driving charge from June. He is expected to plead guilty to a lesser offense than driving while intoxicated, the Associated Press reported, and will likely pay a fine between $300 and $500, according to Deadline.

One day after he was ordered to pay a $100 million default payment in a separate sexual assault case, producer and business mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was hit with a new lawsuit. Dawn Richard, a former member of girl group Danity Kane, is the latest in a long line of women to accuse Combs of abuse, claiming in a lawsuit filed in New York that she was subjected to violent acts, death threats, financial abuse, sexual assault and more.

In an olive branch to activist investor Elliott Investment Management, Southwest Airlines announced that it will revamp its board of directors and longtime chairman Gary Kelly will retire in 2025. Elliott, which is owned by billionaire hedge fund magnate Paul Singer, has in recent months amassed 10% of Southwest's common stock and waged a public campaign for the airline to make significant changes, even putting forward a preferred slate of candidates for the board.

Earlier this week, the European Union's top court ruled that Apple must pay billions in back taxes after engaging in sweetheart deals with Ireland to lower its tax bills. The case stretches back more than a decade, but the European Commission eventually found that tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple ""substantially and artificially"" lowered the tax paid by Apple to Ireland since 1991. Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of 1% in 2003 and just 0.005% in 2014.

TOPLINE Jenny Abramson was a Stanford sophomore in 1997 when her mother, Patty, launched the Women's Growth Capital Fund. Back then, the daughter recalls, she was surrounded by ""a million amazing women"" at school and didn't really understand why female founders might need their own dedicated venture capital firm.

Twenty-seven years later, Jenny Abramson not only gets it, but has just raised another $250 million for Rethink Impact, cementing its status as the largest VC firm dedicated to funding female CEOs. It's the third and largest fund that Abramson and her fellow managing partner, Heidi Patel, have raised since 2017, and nearly doubles their assets under management.

It's not just the size and participants in this round -- which closed today and is being reported first by Forbes -- that stand out. The successful round comes at a time when venture fundraising is on track for its worst year in a decade, according to Pitchbook, and when efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion are under attack in both the courts and corporate America.

While the median time for venture firms to close new funds has, in recent quarters, stretched to 15 months, Abramson and Patel raised their Fund III in just one summer. Among the limited partners: Melinda French Gates' investing firm, Pivotal Ventures, and a slew of institutional investors. ""Getting to this size meant that we really had to cross the chasm into institutional LPs, and that's what we did,'' says Patel. ""We've got more than 10 university endowments, and foundations; we have limited partners from large financial institutions like UBS and Cambridge Associates.""

WHY IT MATTERS Along with making money for their investors, Abramson and Patel are aiming to turn the tide on funding for female founders and CEOs. ""I definitely think we will see parity in our lifetime,"" Abramson says optimistically. ""I think that we finally have a moment where the data exists that shows that female companies grow faster, have higher valuation increases and exit faster -- after all, time is money.""

Author Post: The Recent Surge in Drug Costs and What Can Be Done About It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2024/09/12/the-recent-surge-in-drug-costs-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/,2024-09-12T12:05:34Z,"Healthcare costs are continuing to grow significantly faster than the rate of inflation, up an estimated 6-7% this year and another 8-9% next year, according to two recent surveys - one by the Business Group on Health (which surveyed 125 large U.S. employers that provide health benefits to about 17 million employees) and the other by AON (which surveyed more than 950 U.S. employers providing health benefits to about 7 million employees).

Next year's expected rate of increase would be roughly four times the projected rate of inflation, and it would bring employers' total annual cost of healthcare per employee to more than $16,000, not including the portion employees pay through payroll deductions, co-pays, and co-insurance.

Some of the current and projected increases in healthcare costs are driven by increased demand for outpatient care, tests, and other medical services, partially due to a residual rebound from care that was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, unprecedented growth in pharmacy costs is the real driver of increased healthcare costs. Pharmacy costs as a percentage of all employer health benefit costs have risen six points over the last two years alone, from 21% to 27%.

There are two key drivers of the outsize growth in pharmacy costs: one you have heard a lot about and another that has not received as much attention. In the former category, demand for GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss drugs - including Ozempic, Wegovy, Monjauro, and Zepbound - which cost about $1,000 per month continues to surge and shows no sign of abating. In the latter category, so-called ""specialty drugs"" that provide breakthrough treatments for relatively rare medical conditions are used by less than 2% of the population but account for roughly 51% of all drug benefit costs.

I have covered the pros and cons of GLP-1s in a previous blog [GLP-1 Agonists: Silver Bullet or Arrow in the Anti-Obesity Quiver], so I won't repeat myself here, except to underscore that this category of drugs (and others that are closely related to it) are having an immense clinical and financial impact. Both Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan have estimated that GLP-1s will be a $100 billion category by the end of the decade, and this may be conservative.

The financial impact of GLP-1s on their manufacturers has been stunning. Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, now has a market capitalization of more than $600 billion (as of August 2024), which is greater than the GDP of its home country of Denmark. Eli Lilly's Monjauro and Zepbound now account for almost 40% of the company's 2024 projected sales of $46 billion.

As impressive as the financial impact of GLP-1s on their manufacturers has been, the clinical and financial impact of GLP-1s on patients and third-party payers has been even more profound. Patients with diabetes have flocked to Ozempic and Monjauro due to their proven clinical efficacy as well as their well-publicized secondary impact on weight loss, and millions of other patients opted for Wegovy and Zepbound once they gained FDA approval for weight loss (Wegovy is also approved for treatment of cardiovascular disease).

And this is only the beginning, as about 142 million Americans - more than half of the adult population - meet the FDA's prescription criteria for these drugs, according to the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.

This surging demand is in spite of the fact that GLP-1s don't work for everyone and have some clinical drawbacks (including muscle loss), and more impressively despite their very high costs. Since most patients cannot afford the roughly $1,000 per month price tag, many third-party payers have agreed to cover their cost for diabetic patients, and more are electing to cover their cost for obese individuals (though Medicare is still withholding coverage for the weight loss drugs).

In fact, demand for GLP-1s has been so strong that it has outstripped the manufacturers' ability to meet it. This resulted in the FDA designating many of these drugs as in shortage, which has in effect created a rapidly growing new product category for the roughly 7,500 ""compounding"" pharmacies in the U.S., some of which are creating drugs that are theoretically similar to GLP-1s. They do this by mixing semaglutide and other FDA-approved ingredients in attempts to mimic what it took Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, and other major pharmaceutical companies many years and billions of dollars to develop, test, and secure FDA approval for permission to market.

Some of the organizations that market GLP-1 look-alikes - including Hims & Hers Health, Inc. - are public companies that can provide some assurance that their less expensive compounded versions are at least produced by FDA certified and regularly inspected pharmacies.

However, the compounded versions themselves are not FDA approved as being safe and effective, are not similar in the same precise way that FDA-approved generic and biosimilar drugs are to the off-patent branded drugs they are designed to replace at lower cost, and the compounded versions have not undergone any testing that compares their efficacy to that of their branded reference drugs.

In addition, not all compounding pharmacies are regulated in the same way and must adhere to the same standards. Compounding pharmacies play a valuable role in our healthcare system by giving physicians the ability to make small adjustments to an FDA-approved drug that makes it more effective for a particular patient - for example, by varying the dosage, adding flavor (for a child), changing the form (from a pill to a liquid), or removing allergens).

However, this doesn't necessarily qualify these pharmacies to respond safely and effectively to major GLP-1 supply shortages, and adverse safety and efficacy issues have been reported, so make sure you understand the qualifications of the pharmacies and pharmacists if you decide to go the compounding route.

As expensive as GLP-1s are, their cost pales compared to the cost of many specialty drugs. These biotech drugs offer extraordinary breakthrough treatments for severe medical conditions including HIV, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and therapies for rare genetic conditions. However, they come with very high price tags. According to RxBenefits, some of the most expensive specialty drugs include:

Used to treat urea cycle disorders (UCDs), a genetic condition that can cause ammonia to build up in the body. Ravicti is an oral liquid taken three times a day and costs nearly $700,000 annually.

A one-time gene therapy for hemophilia B that costs $3.5 million. After infusion, 94% of patients in a trial no longer needed routine prophylaxis therapy.

A one-time gene therapy for early-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a hereditary condition, that costs $4.25 million.

These drugs are particularly expensive for multiple reasons, including the fact that they are difficult and costly to manufacture. They also frequently require a prescription by a specialist, special handling, intravenous administration, and a high degree of patient management to ensure compliance and safety. In addition, these drugs usually face less competition because of the small patient populations available to use them.

Specialty drug costs in the U.S. were about $68 billion in 2023 and are expected to grow to about $1.5 trillion by 2033, and specialty drugs are expected to represent up to two-thirds of newly launched drugs over the next five years. In 1990, there were 10 specialty drugs on the market. Today specialty pharmacies (another category of pharmacies that is different from compounding and community pharmacies) manage over 500 drugs in 40 therapeutic categories.

The scientific advances and companies that have brought us GLP-1s and specialty drugs are to be celebrated, as they have meaningfully improved the treatment of widespread and life-threatening diseases like diabetes (~32% of the population) and obesity (~40% of the population) and have offered new hope for those who have crippling rare diseases.

However, particularly given the fact that many more of these expensive new drugs are in the pipeline, it is difficult to imagine how individuals, third-party payers, and ultimately, we as a nation are going to afford them without breaking the proverbial bank.

While it is theoretically possible that some of these drugs will sufficiently reduce overall healthcare costs in the long run to justify the cost of covering them, this has yet to be proven and would likely require employees / members to stick with their insurance carriers for much longer periods of time than is currently the norm.

While it is hard to dispute the fact that free markets have enabled pharmaceutical breakthroughs in many ways, it also seems clear that changes will have to be made in the current system. Enabling Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies, which has recently begun with a limited set of drugs, will lower costs but take a long time to have a meaningful impact under the current law (which also capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries).

Increased competition among manufacturers will also lower prices, as evidenced by Eli Lilly's recent decision to significantly reduce the cost of Zepbound for cash-paying patients who are willing to self-administer single-dose vials using a needle and syringe rather than the injector pen that most patients prefer.

Other key strategies for reducing drug costs in the U.S. without upending the system that has consistently produced breakthrough therapies and one of the largest categories of U.S. exports include the following:"

"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 12, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-12-24/,2024-09-12T11:34:44Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are mixed compared to one week ago. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can park some cash? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying paltry interest rates. That has changed, thanks to the Fed's campaign of interest rate hikes to combat inflation last year. But even though the Fed hasn't raised its rate since July 2023, consumer deposit yields remain high.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you score a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts generally pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to meet strict conditions laid down by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.26% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's above last week's 0.26%.

To find the best savings account for your needs, you first must answer the question: What exactly are you looking for? And you must realize that different types of accounts have trade-offs.

If you want to open an account at a traditional bank with branches, that will likely rule out the best interest rates, which are typically available at online-only banks. Many traditional savings accounts at brick-and-mortar banks earn just 0.01% or 0.02% APY, while some online-only savings accounts earn more than 4.00% APY.

Don't settle on any option until you're certain you have a good grasp on the fees you'll be charged. Savings accounts can ding you with monthly service fees, excess withdrawal fees and returned item fees (if you deposit checks that bounce), among others. Those charges add up and can gnaw away at your savings.

As you shop around, check reviews and ratings of financial institutions and make sure you choose one that will protect your money with federal insurance -- from the FDIC or, in the case of credit unions, the NCUA.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Mortgage Rates Today: September 12, 2024 -- Rates Move Down",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-09-12-24/,2024-09-12T11:34:33Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.65%, according to Curinos. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.78%, while the average rate on a 30-year jumbo mortgage is 6.73%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) decreased to 6.65% from 6.66% yesterday. This time last week, the 30-year fixed was 6.87%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.67%. This time last week, it was 6.67%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At an interest rate of 6.65%, a 30-year fixed mortgage would cost $642 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included) per $100,000, according to the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator. The total interest paid over the life of the loan will be around $131,107.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 5.78%, lower than it was yesterday. Last week, it was 6.00%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.81%. It was 5.81% this time last week.

With an interest rate of 5.78%, you would pay $832 per month in principal and interest for every $100,000 borrowed. Over the life of the loan, you would pay $49,734 in total interest.

The average interest rate on the 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.73%. Last week, the average rate was 6.92%.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.73% will pay $647 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,855 and you'd pay roughly $997,627 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Get to know your budget before you look for a house. This will give you an idea of the type of house you can afford. A good place to start is by using a mortgage calculator to get a rough estimate.

Simply input the following information:

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term."
