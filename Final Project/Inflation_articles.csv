Alive on paper but dead in reality--why fewer people may be reaching advanced age,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5133252/alive-on-paper-but-dead-in-reality-why-fewer-people-may-be-reaching-advanced-age,2024-10-08T18:22:03Z,"In some areas of the world, people may not be living quite as long as researchers once thought, according to new research.

There are places in the world that are vaunted for having an outsized number of long-lived individuals. A lot of attention has been paid to puzzling out how all these people have reached such an advanced age.

A new pre-print study that has yet to be formally peer reviewed proposed these places may have surfaced, at least in part, as a result of clerical error or fraud.

Here's the crux of the problem: to tell how old someone is, people rely on documents. ""There's no way to validate a human age against a physical measure,"" says Saul Justin Newman, a research fellow at Oxford University.

""If you go into a hospital without paperwork, there's no machine in there that says, 'Oh, bing!' and knows your age,"" he says. ""So if you get consistently wrong errors in your paperwork, they're undetectable.""

When Newman examined U.N. data from 236 states and nations, he found errors connected to centenarians -- people ages 100 and above -- all over the world. Certain countries had more detailed accounting than others.

""The best predictor of where 100-year-olds are within Okinawa [Japan] is places that have had their cities bombed by the Americans, burning the birth records,"" he says. ""So the more bombing you have, the more 100 year-olds you have.""

There are other examples. ""Forty-two percent of centenarians in Costa Rica turned out to be lying in the census,"" Newman says. ""At least 72 percent of the centenarians in Greece disappeared when they did an audit.""

On paper, some of these folks were alive. ""But dead in reality,"" Newman says. ""You know, I had a lady reach 103 in a freezer.""

Some of these errors may not actually be errors. Newman says to picture yourself jobless and broke.

""And then your father dies or your mother dies at the age of 95,"" he says ""Their pension check turns up the week after they're dead. All you have to do for that pension check to keep turning up in perpetuity is not register the death. Very easy thing to get away with.""

Newman says this is the reality that he's surfaced. The places on the planet that seem to have residents reaching super advanced age are rife with pension fraud, which obscures how old they were whenever they did pass away.

Not knowing how long people actually live has all sorts of ramifications. ""We're all the time using these old age data to estimate how many old people we're going to have to take care of,"" Newman says, ""and project how many hospitals we need in the future.""

""It really is an important study because it pushes the field to scrutinize the data more rigorously,"" says Raya Kheirbek, who wasn't involved in the research. She's chief of geriatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. ""But the conclusions may overstate the extent of errors.""

While this work doesn't necessarily contradict thinking on longevity, she's concerned it could add complexity to an already nuanced field and that it may cast doubt on what she says is legitimate research, including a set of U.S. studies showing what people who do reach 100 have in common -- that they age more slowly, as do their kids.

""This robust data does not depend on birth certificates from areas of unreliable records,"" she says, ""highlighting the significant role of genetic and environmental factors in longevity."" Kherirbek says these factors might include exercise, social engagement, mental resilience, and diet -- ""moderation in all areas.""

Kheirbek says there are other explanations for age inflation, like the inevitable loss of documents. Take Spain, for instance.

""During the civil war,"" she says, ""many birth records were kept in government agencies and churches and they were all destroyed. So that is a complicating factor in age verifications.""

Newman agrees. He says these errors, and bad record keeping arise for all sorts of reasons, from war to fraud to bureaucracy.

He uses this analogy: ""Imagine you had the Hubble space telescope,"" he says, ""and a percent of the stars turn out to be dust on the lens.""

Newman says his hope is simply to wipe down that lens."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
"Three states show how abortion, schools and taxes are at stake in legislature races",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5124638/state-legislature-supermajority-kansas-arizona-minnesota-elections,2024-10-05T09:04:20Z,"Elections for state legislatures don't get the attention that races for president or Congress do but they often have a big impact on our lives. Congress is divided and gridlocked. In contrast, nearly all state legislatures have both chambers run by one party or another. That makes it easy to pass laws.

And they've been passing a lot. More than 20 states have imposed new limits on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion in 2022. In education, state lawmakers create voucher programs and determine public school funding. Gun laws, taxes, criminal sentences, access to Medicaid and food stamps are just a few other issues decided by state legislatures.

Redistricting and polarization have increased the political tilt of many legislatures -- even where the state might be more balanced overall.

This year, several legislatures could see power shift if just a few seats flip in the election -- maybe just a matter of hundreds of votes in some districts. Here are three states, Kansas, Minnesota and Arizona, that illustrate the stakes around the country.

TOPEKA, Kansas -- Kansas is one of several states where the Legislature sometimes tilts more conservative than the state's voters overall. While it votes Republican for president, it has elected a Democrat for governor twice in a row and voted with 59% to protect abortion rights.

But Republicans hold 29 of the 40 seats in the Senate and 85 of the 125 seats in the House. That gives them the two-thirds ""supermajority"" to pass bills and override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

They've overridden Kelly's vetoes 15 times in the last two years. They used the override to pass a bill requiring doctors to question patients seeking abortions about their reasons. They overrode vetoes to pass laws banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports and to limit access to food stamps.

Democrats say they can break the supermajority in this year's elections -- they'd only need to flip two or three seats in either chamber. It would give Kelly a stronger veto in her last two years in office -- and Democrats more leverage over what the majority passes.

""My hope is that with the governor being able to veto and being able to sustain those vetoes, it puts us more at the table for compromise,"" says Democrat Dinah Sykes, the Senate minority leader.

National Democratic party organizations say that goal is within reach. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is highlighting 10 legislative races in Kansas and helping with campaign logistics.

Kansas Republicans, meanwhile, have scorned that contribution as outside interference. And they defend the supermajority.

Republican House Majority Leader Chris Croft says it's a necessary counterbalance to the governor's veto pen.

""[The] supermajority in this case, while it sounds like it's this huge number, in fact, what it does is just gives us a seat at the table,"" Croft told NPR.

Even with their heavy majority, Republican's priorities aren't always veto-proof. Last session, Kelly successfully vetoed three major tax-cut proposals, including one that fell a single vote shy of an override. The fight forced the Legislature into a special session.

""You can't get everything you want in this business. This business has a little bit of give and take and that's the beauty of the process,"" Croft says. ""It's also the frustrating part.""

Supermajorities, like the one held by Kansas Republicans, have become common. Across the country as of their recent legislative sessions, one party or another held a veto-proof majority in 29 states. Republicans had 20 of those, Democrats nine.

Patrick Miller, a political scientist at Kent State University, says supermajorities have spread in part because of polarization and legislators gerrymandering their own districts.

""One of those consequences of supermajority, is a lot more ideological politics and policy,"" he says.

While the U.S. Congress is often locked in stalemate, Miller says state legislatures that are dominated by one party are able to step into the vacuum to pass laws shaping day-to-day life.

""If you care about education, if you care about health care regulation in your state, if you care about abortion, transgender rights, LGBT rights, if you care about whether your roads have potholes ... you need to be looking at your state legislature,"" he says.

TONKA BAY, Minn. -- On a sunny Tuesday morning, Republican state Senate candidate Kathleen Fowke walks door-to-door near Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis. The tree-lined roads by the water are quiet but when she knocks on a door she's reminded that this is hotly contested territory.

""You're in my YouTube all the time,"" says the man inside -- a reminder of the ads targeting voters here.

The contest to win this legislative district could be the state's most expensive ever -- and key to winning the Senate.

For two years, Democrats have controlled the Legislature and the governor's office under Gov. Tim Walz -- now the Democratic nominee for vice president. They've passed more spending for affordable housing and public schools, and guaranteed protections for patients who seek or provide abortion or gender-affirming care.

Now Republicans see a chance to curb the progressive trend. They're just a few seats behind in the state House. The Senate is tied 33-33 and this vacant seat by the lake could be the tiebreaker that ends the Democrats' so-called ""trifecta"" of House, Senate and governorship.

The GOP wants to slow state spending and focus on the economy overall. Fowke, a real estate agent, says that, while voters don't always know about the work the Legislature does, what she does hear about from them is money.

""It's basically affordability, and they can't afford, you know, just to go to the grocery store anymore,"" Fowke says. ""Taxes are high. Inflation is high. They need to find a way to help lower the costs of everything all around them.""

Republicans promise to cut taxes, tighten up on spending and curb fraud and abuse in state programs. ""With one-party, Democrat control, it was easy just to push through partisan policy and partisan priorities,"" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth says.

Democrats say they address people's cost of living with laws requiring companies to offer paid time off for illness, family leave and safe time and new money for free school lunches.

""They trust the Democrats are going to do more for their economic well being, whereas what they hear from Republicans is, 'Oh, we have to give more tax cuts to corporations,'"" says Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The national Democratic Party is helping fund the state party's effort.

Their candidate facing Fowke is civil engineer Ann Johnson Stewart. She's knocking on doors, too, telling people she stands for maintaining legal protections for abortion in the state. ""One of the reasons I'm running is to make sure we can continue on that track,"" she says.

She hopes Democrats will work now on carbon-free energy sources, local infrastructure, expanding mental health care and reducing gun violence.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says candidates face an uphill battle getting voters to pay attention to state issues.

""There's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" Karch says. And many voters don't focus on state issues.

""I think politics in Minnesota specifically may have been more distinctive a generation ago than they are today,"" he says. ""State and local politicians are increasingly being asked to comment on issues that we might think of as national.""

Fowke and Johnson Stewart say they hope to keep the conversations focused on what's going on in their district. But they know that's a big ask in a presidential election year.

PHOENIX -- In Arizona, the party that wins the Legislature could determine where tens of thousands of children go to school or how well their schools are funded. At issue is the state's sweeping vouchers program that gives families tax dollars for use in private schools or for homeschooling.

For Chelsea Ellison, a homeschool parent, the program has helped turn things around for a daughter who struggled in public elementary school.

""It took us a little bit of last year to get her where she should have been, in general, and now she's thriving,"" Ellison says. ""She loves school.""

But parents and teachers sticking with public schools say they've paid the price.

""I notice that the amount of resources available to the teachers, directly, it just is not there, any kind of funding for improvements at the school is not there,"" says Miriam Hoban, whose child attends a public school in Scottsdale. She says teachers or parents are forced to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like pencils and markers.

Arizona's program, called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, is a national model for what advocates call school choice. In 2022, the Republican Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey took a small program offering vouchers for kids with disabilities or in underperforming schools and made it available for any child.

Enrollment in the program leaped from 12,000 students to 78,000 students and growing. Students got a median of $7,409 per year. That added up to a total of about $718 million from the state budget, which was $93 million more than projected, according to the Arizona Department of Education.

Republicans control the Legislature with just a two-seat advantage in both the House and Senate. The narrow margin was in the national spotlight this year as lawmakers just barely repealed an 1864 law that banned abortion.

If Democrats win control, they pledge to scale back the voucher program and they can rely on backing from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, elected after the program was expanded. ""The previous Legislature passed a massive expansion of school vouchers that lacks accountability and will likely bankrupt this state,"" she said after taking office last year.

Critics point to stories about voucher money going for private lessons in luxury cars and ski resort passes, supposedly part of a child's education. And they say much of the money goes to families that were able to pay for private schools on their own with kids already out of the public schools.

But as the program has grown and gained support among some swing voters, it could be tougher for Democrats in competitive districts to campaign against it. They'll have to temper their ambitions, says Arizona pollster Paul Bentz.

""I don't expect that they could mount a full-fledged repeal,"" Bentz says. ""I think that would be challenging for some of the swing areas for Democrats. But I certainly think at a minimum, there would be regulation on it, and probably some definite changes to the program.""

Ellison, the voucher mom, says her family did try to make it work in public schools before opting to teach at home with voucher support.

""There was larger class sizes, more budget cuts,"" Ellison says of their old public school. ""We had no STEM teacher, we had no music teacher, we had no art teacher.""

Public school supporters say the vouchers drain the money for just those kinds of needs."
The U.S. saw stunningly strong growth in jobs last month. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140039/labor-market-jobs-economy-interest-rates,2024-10-04T17:19:53Z,"U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September -- more than forecasters had expected. Gains for July and August were also revised upward. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images hide caption

As far as economic data goes, it was a bit of a stunner.

Economists had expected U.S. employers to have added about 150,000 jobs in September. Instead, they created more than a quarter-million jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department.

Here are five things to know about Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report.

In total, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs in September. Restaurants, retailers and construction companies all added jobs at a healthy pace.

In addition, employment gains for July and August were revised upwards by a total of 72,000 jobs. That means that, on average, employers have added 186,000 jobs in each of the last three months.

While that's a slowdown from the first three months of the year, when employers added an average of 267,000 jobs a month, it's still a solid pace.

A separate report earlier this week also showed the number of job openings increased slightly in August to 8 million.

But not all industries are enjoying a boom. Manufacturing has been in a slump for most of the last two years. Factories cut 7,000 jobs in September, although factory employment is still higher than it was just before the pandemic, by 137,000 jobs. Most of September's job cuts were in the auto industry.

A survey of factory managers released this week by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturers are still struggling with high interest rates and uncertainty about the upcoming presidential election.

By contrast, another ISM survey shows continued growth in the much-larger services side of the economy -- things like restaurants and car repair.

In order to keep adding jobs, employers need workers. Fortunately, the U.S. labor force continues to grow.

Friday's report shows 150,000 people joined or re-joined the workforce last month. Much of this growth is driven by immigration. The foreign-born workforce has grown rapidly over the last year, adding 1.4 million workers, while the native-born workforce shrank by nearly 600,000 workers.

Were it not for immigrant workers, job growth might well have stalled. The decline of the native-born workforce is primarily the result of baby boomers retiring. By contrast, the share of people in their prime working years (25 to 54) is near an all-time high.

Average wages in September were up 4% from a year ago. That's likely more than enough to outpace rising prices, giving workers a real boost in their purchasing power.

Inflation data for September won't be released until next week, but in recent months, prices have been climbing at a modest pace -- 2.5% for the 12 months ending in August. In fact, wage gains have exceeded price hikes for fifteen months and September's increase probably extended that trend.

The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates last month with an aggressive half-a-percentage-point move, signaling a turning point in its years-long battle against inflation.

But Fed chairman Jerome Powell says he and his colleagues may move more cautiously in the future, cutting rates by a quarter point at a time.

""This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry,"" Powell said Monday.

Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report is likely to reinforce that patient approach. According to CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the next Fed meeting rose to nearly 95% after the jobs report was released, from 68% the day before.

Fed policymakers will get one more monthly jobs report before their next scheduled meeting in early November."

Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2022 with the help of a mini red wave in the blue state of New York.

Democrats lost five seats in suburban districts, mostly around New York City, as many in the party were caught off guard. This year top Democrats across the state have joined forces to try to win those seats back, potentially netting the four seats they need to win back control of the chamber.

The GOP formula in 2022 was a barrage of ads and attacks on Democrats on crime, immigration and border security. The targeted messaging energized the Republican base and depressed Democratic turnout.

Party leaders responded this year with an effort modeled on more traditional battleground states will help turn things around for them this cycle with both resources and a stepped up ground game.

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told NPR she realized the need for the coordinated effort when she asked what candidates were doing in the week heading into the 2022 midterms and got a puzzling answer.

""There were [check] no big rallies. There was no organized canvassing, there was no coordination at all amongst local candidates and House candidates,"" Gillibrand said.

Kathy Hochul, then the Democratic candidate for governor, was being attacked by her GOP opponent Lee Zeldin about rising crime rates and border security. Gillibrand says tens of millions of dollars in negative ads had a big impact on Democratic voters in suburban districts around New York City.

""We had the worst voter turnout in 10 years,"" Gillibrand said. Hochul won, but the wave of House losses caused Gillibrand to reach out to Democrats in Wisconsin -- a perennial battleground state -- to come up with a 2024 strategy.

""So the day after the election I said to my chief of staff: 'We have to do something differently. Let's create the first-ever coordinated campaign for New York.'""

Now, Hochul says the coordinated campaign is allowing Democrats to connect with voters in a way that hasn't been done before.

""We're making unprecedented investments, rebuilding Party infrastructure, and turning out voters to elect Democrats and flip the House majority in November,"" she said in a statement to NPR.

Gillibrand, Hochul, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and state party leaders have opened 40 offices in seven House districts and hired 100 full-time staffers. Republicans have just five similar ""battle station"" offices.

Democrats linked state and local party operations. That effort has allowed them to make over 2 million contacts with voters between knocking on doors and phone calls, according to a spokeswoman for Hochul.

The strategy focuses on a more sophisticated get-out-the-vote effort, but it also includes going on offense on the issues that hurt the party the most two years ago -- crime and immigration.

Gillibrand points to her first ad as an example. She says it lists ""what I've done personally to make New York safer"" -- and touts her work on addressing fentanyl and illegal guns. Her third ad focuses on reproductive rights.

The move to lean in on crime and border issues follows the blueprint Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi used in February, to win a special election of a seat previously held by GOP Rep. George Santos. Suozzi emphasized a bipartisan immigration reform overhaul proposal, and effectively flipped the script on an issue that has traditionally put Democratic candidates on defense. Party strategists say his message is a good model in other districts in the state.

But Republicans say they still have the upper hand when it comes to the issues that got them elected in the first place.

Long Island Republican Nick LaLota is one of the five House freshmen elected in 2022. LaLota says his party will likely be outspent this cycle but says voters trust the GOP on the core issues.

""Suburban New Yorkers want two big things: a secure border and public safety and a better economy and less inflation. While they have a lot of money in campaign dollars and a lot of field offices and volunteers, their deficit is on policy solutions to those two big areas.""

New York isn't a presidential battleground but LaLota says GOP nominee Donald Trump knows New York is crucial in the battle for the House. He had a rally last month. He told NPR Trump knows his campaign needs to keep House Republican seats in suburban New York.

""His presence there demonstrates that he wants a governing Republican majority to give him the policy he needs from Congress when he returns to the White House.""

Marc Molinaro is another freshman GOP lawmaker whose district stretches from the Hudson Valley to the Finger Lakes. He says House Republicans are a check on an otherwise blue state.

""The people I represent want a balanced approach to government. They know that single-party rule in New York has led to the highest taxes of any people in the country, crime and an open border, Molinaro said.

But ultimately, taxes may prove the decisive issue in these New York contests. Trump's 2017 tax bill capped a popular state and local tax break called SALT, effectively levying an increase on many New York homeowners. Republicans were pleased that Trump stressed at his New York rally that he'll revive it.

""I will cut taxes for families, small businesses and workers including restoring the SALT deduction,"" Trump vowed at his Uniondale rally.

LaLota said that public pledge helps make the case to other GOP lawmakers as they craft a possible tax bill when many of the Trump tax provisions expire in 2025. ""Way to put this on the table -- this is what suburban constituents in blue states want,"" LaLota said.

Molinaro says the GOP has to follow through on that promise.

""If we really mean to provide meaningful tax relief to middle-class families, that's got to include reestablishing the SALT deduction.""

Jeffries vows Democrats will bring back the tax break, and calls out Republicans having it both ways on the tax break.

""They were the arsonists who burned down the state and local tax deduction and they have no credibility in trying to pretend right now they will be the firefighters.""

Democrats argue that Trump will be a factor in the race, and that the GOP lawmakers' decision to stand with Trump at his recent rally and vote in mostly lockstep on legislation championed by hardline House Republicans will hurt them with independents and Democrats in New York.

But several GOP strategists familiar with the campaigns in these districts stress that these incumbents have worked to create their own brands, and some have made a point to call out some extreme GOP colleagues in the House.

Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, another Long Island GOP lawmaker Democrats are targeting, faces a challenge with his own personal issues taking front and center in recent weeks. The New York Times reported that he put his mistress and the daughter of fiancee on his office payroll, something not allowed by House ethics rules, and a possible campaign finance violation. D'Esposito argues he didn't do anything improper and that the story was a political attack.

Republicans hope to link their Democratic challengers to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was recently indicted on bribery and fraud charges. Lawmakers say his high profile case helps the GOP make their case against electing more Democrats to the House, but challengers in many of these House districts have called on Adams to resign.

Gillibrand waves off Adams as a factor in November House races. She says Democrats this year learned their lesson about engaging voters earlier on liabilities -- like crime -- and this new campaign focuses on the message and mechanics to get their supporters out to vote.

""Last cycle people felt depressed. This is about what we've accomplished, what we're actually doing to address their number one concern."""
How Venezuela imploded (update) : Planet Money,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/1202966830/venezuela-hyperinflation-maduro-gonzalez,2024-10-02T22:34:48Z,"People queue to buy basic food and household items outside a supermarket in Caracas, on September 28, 2016. Venezuela is in a highly tense political crisis, with the South American oil-exporting nation slammed by low crude prices, inflation, food shortages and violence.

Back in 2016, things were pretty bad in Venezuela. Grocery stores didn't have enough food. Hospitals didn't have basic supplies, like gauze. Child mortality was spiking. Businesses were shuttering. It's one of the epic economic collapses of our time. And it was totally avoidable.

Venezuela used to be a relatively rich country. It has just about all the economic advantages a country could ask for: Beautiful beaches and mountains ready for tourism, fertile land good for farming, an educated population, and oil, lots and lots of oil.

But during the boom years, the Venezuelan government made some choices that add up to an economic time bomb.

Today on the show, we have an economic horror story about a country that made all the wrong decisions with its oil money. It's a window into the fundamental way that money works and how when you try to control it, you can lose everything.

Then, an update on Venezuela today. How it went from a downward spiral, to a tentative economic stabilization... amidst political upheaval.

This disabled woman built a career.

She's a woman with spinal muscular atrophy -- also, a software engineer and a vice president at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase hide caption

Tabi Haly defies expectations. She's a woman with a progressive muscular illness; she can't move her body and she needs round-the-clock care from aides. She wasn't expected to go to college, or to get a job -- much less become a vice president at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.

Even staying alive and healthy defied expectations. ""People with spinal muscular atrophy like myself, living to my age already is a huge win,"" says Haly, who is 40.

Haly's success as a software engineer in New York City was made possible by a government program called Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. It gives Haly access to crucial medical coverage.

But now that same program is threatening to bring her success crashing down.

In July, Haly got a letter that shocked her. The Social Security Administration, the agency that runs the federal benefits program, wrote that she was not eligible for SSI, even though she'd relied upon SSI for almost 19 years.

By losing SSI, she would also lose Medicaid, her health insurance. Medicaid provides medical care -- from round-the-clock personal care aides to an expensive medicine -- that keeps her healthy and allows her to build a career.

""It's like my foundation's falling apart,"" says Haly. She appealed the decision to end her SSI. But she worries that without it, the career she's achieved will end. Even with a high-paying job, she says she can't pay for 24-hour aides and other high-cost medical care on her own.

She faces a big fall -- from a successful career to needing full-time care from family or, more likely she fears, moving into a nursing home.

SSI exists to provide a minimum income, and often health insurance, to people with significant disabilities. But an NPR investigation found that SSI often fails people with disabilities because its rules are long out of date and overly complex.

As a result, recipients like Haly run into decisions that seem bureaucratic and inconsistent but that threaten their ability to stay out of poverty, live independently and keep access to medical care.

Debora Wagner at Cornell University's Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability says Haly's frustration is not uncommon and shows the need to modernize SSI. ""My question is 'Who benefits in this situation? What's the benefit for us as a society of making it impossible for people with disabilities to work?'""

Haly is a software engineer and a team leader on development and coding projects for JPMorgan Chase & Co..

On an early morning this summer at her apartment in Manhattan, Haly, in her motorized wheelchair, prepared to lead back-to-back meetings on a new software project. Her personal care aide, Palone Ruddock, spent about 10 minutes getting Haly positioned in front of her computer.

Haly can't move her body. She needs an aide to help her move her arms and legs.

But with Haly's fingers placed on a large trackpad, she can control the computer and run her meeting.

Some of her work colleagues on the call know she's disabled. None, she says, have any idea of how disabled she is. Nor did any of the outside consultants this day at a second meeting, where she presented the coding project.

Haly needs assistance from personal care aides 24 hours a day. ""That's who gets me into my wheelchair,"" she says. ""They're my hands and feet.""

Those aides move her body several times an hour so she doesn't get painful bedsores. They suction the secretions out of her weakened lungs to keep her healthy.

Haly says those aides, seven days a week, cost about $300,000 a year.

Only Medicaid, the state and federal insurance for people with limited income that Haly gets through SSI, will pay for them.

Her company's health insurance wouldn't. The insurance that people get through their jobs doesn't cover long-term, in-home aides. Nor does Medicare, the government insurance for older people and some younger people with disabilities.

As a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, Haly makes a good salary. But even with a six-figure paycheck, she says she can't afford the health care that she needs.

In addition to the aides, Haly ticks off a list of her other medical expenses. Medicaid pays for a new, breakthrough medication for spinal muscular atrophy. She says that medicine alone, which she must keep cooled in the refrigerator, costs about $350,000 a year.

If she went on her employer's health insurance, a company spokesperson says it might pay for some or all of the medicine.

But there are other big expenses an employer's health insurance won't pay at all, like Haly's customized power wheelchair. At $35,000, it's as expensive as a small car.

In addition, Medicaid pays for wheelchair repairs and tens of thousands of dollars a year in physical, occupational and speech therapy.

""I would have to be a multimillionaire to pay for all this stuff myself,"" Haly says.

Ari Ne'eman, an assistant professor at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard who researches disability income programs, says: ""If you lose access to SSI, you lose access to the Medicaid services that keep you alive and thriving in the community. It's a question of life and death.""

SSI was created in 1972 to provide monthly benefit checks for millions of impoverished disabled and elderly Americans. In 2024, the monthly benefit is capped at $943 for one person and $1,415 for a couple. In addition, most who are eligible for SSI then qualify for health insurance through state Medicaid programs.

Today, SSI is a key benefit to 7.5 million people.

But SSI was created before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protected people with disabilities from discrimination in public places and at work. It was created before the 1975 law -- the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act -- that, for the first time, gave a right to a public school education for children with disabilities. Before then, some 1 million children with disabilities, the last group to get the right to schooling guaranteed, were excluded from many schools.

As the experiences and expectations for disabled Americans changed, SSI failed to keep up.

SSI was started with the assumption that recipients couldn't or wouldn't work in jobs where they could support themselves.

As a result, its out-of-date rules discourage work. Today, fewer than 10% of people on SSI do work, although many say they'd like to work and many would like to make enough to get off SSI.

Very few, like Haly, manage to build a career.

The rules make it hard to take even a part-time job. One rule says you can own only $2,000 in assets -- like bank savings or property. That limit hasn't changed since 1989.

For a couple, the asset limit is $3,000, creating a ""marriage penalty"" that forces many on SSI to avoid marriage or to try to hide it when they marry.

As a result of the cap on accruing assets, Haly, for example, is unable to contribute part of her salary or take her employer's match in the company 401(k) plan. Those retirement plans, which are now used by 70 million Americans, didn't exist when SSI and the asset limit were first created.

Over the years, Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service have set up programs where people on SSI can shield part of their income from the asset limit. But these programs -- ABLE accounts, Ticket to Work, PASS accounts -- are often complicated to set up and limited in their scope. The result: Only a tiny fraction of people on SSI use them.

In recent months, the Social Security Administration has simplified some rules about counting income, like excluding the government assistance someone on SSI receives for food and rent. But Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley noted to NPR that only Congress can make the most significant reform to SSI.

There's a fix to the asset limit that's been proposed, but stalled, on Capitol Hill. The SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act would raise the asset limit to $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a couple, in line with what the thresholds would be if they had kept up with inflation.

The bill has bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress and has been endorsed by business leaders, including Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. But the bill wouldn't address other outdated SSI rules.

One rule says that someone on SSI can't earn more than $65 a month. After that, a recipient loses $1 of benefits for every $2 they earn -- in effect, a tax of 50%.

""That's a higher tax rate than anyone faces on their federal income tax,"" says Ne'eman of Harvard. ""But when it comes to the most impoverished disabled Americans, that is the level of taxation functionally that people are facing when they try and enter the workforce.""

That $65 limit is the same as it was first set in 1972.

When Microsoft in 2020 decided to raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid employees to $25 an hour, the company was surprised to find that disabled workers -- largely ones with intellectual disabilities working in the cafeteria, as administrative assistants and other low-level jobs -- suddenly faced losing their SSI benefits.

Microsoft hired private benefit managers to advise every employee on SSI, according to Rylin Rogers, the company's disability policy director.

Many of those workers thought they'd need to ""step away from those jobs, good jobs that they had had for a very long time, which would have been a shame,"" says Dan Rutten with the Washington Initiative for Supported Employment, the nonprofit benefits advisory firm that was called in to help. Most of those disabled employees, guided by the advisers, found waiver programs or cut their work hours to balance their salary increases with SSI's rules.

Fifty years ago, when SSI started, making $65 a month got a person close to the poverty limit. ""It was already inadequate in 1972, but it wasn't laughable,"" says Ne'eman. ""Today we have a situation where the income offset really is frankly insulting.""

People on SSI who ""are having the greatest success working"" are the ones who run into the most problems with SSI's rules, says Jack Smalligan, who studies income benefits for the Urban Institute. ""So the message to beneficiaries is, essentially, that working doesn't pay.""

Haly makes too much to take a monthly SSI benefit check. She's one of a tiny number of beneficiaries who need to qualify solely to keep her Medicaid.

But this summer, Haly learned that she was about to lose that health insurance.

At first, Haly thought it was a simple clerical error.

Every year, she gets recertified for Medicaid. Haly says a caseworker for New York state comes to her home and asks a series of questions to determine that she is still disabled. Haly considers the process ""intrusive,"" given that she has a progressive neuromuscular condition that is incurable.

Usually, the process is automatic. But this spring, when the notice of her coverage renewal arrived, the line that she expected to say that her insurance would last until 2025 said 2024 instead.

The state of New York wasn't extending her Medicaid coverage, even though Haly was currently on SSI, which qualified her for that health insurance.

(A spokesperson for New York's Medicaid agency said rules around confidentiality limited its ability to discuss Haly's case. A spokesperson for Social Security noted confidentiality rules, too.)

Haly went to the Social Security office to straighten it out.

""They had no idea what I was talking about,"" she says. ""Zero.""

She says they offered to help her stop working and sign up for a separate benefit program, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), for people who can no longer work because of a disability.

She recalls: ""The person said, 'I can make you an appointment for SSDI, do you want to claim disability?' I said, 'No, I do not want to collect SSDI.'""

It took several weeks, she says, until she got an appointment to talk over her problem with a Social Security caseworker. Haly says he advised her that she needed to reapply for SSI.

She was reluctant to apply for a benefit that she already held, and had without question, for years. But the staffer was insistent, so she did.

Shortly after, she got a letter from Social Security with a short denial. It said she made too much money to qualify.

SSI's regulations are complex and confusing. Often, recipients find it necessary to hire a lawyer or a benefits manager with specialized expertise to negotiate the rules to stay eligible.

""The rules are so complicated that even the most educated, professional people cannot understand and follow the rules. It's heartbreaking,"" says attorney Wagner at Cornell.

For years, Social Security said Haly qualified for an exception to SSI's earnings limit, called a 1619(b) waiver. It refers to a part of the Social Security law that lets some disabled people earn money over the limit and still qualify for Medicaid.

Social Security's denial this summer turned all that upside down.

It ended her eligibility for SSI because of her growing income, which previously was excluded by the waiver. When she lost SSI, she lost the waiver that went with it. She can't use the waiver now or even reapply for it because the waiver is available only to people who Social Security says are eligible for SSI.

""It's a catch-22,"" says Haly, frustrated.

To be eligible again, Haly would need to impoverish herself and give up the aides and medical care she is unlikely to afford on her own, especially if she can no longer work.

Even then, to reapply for SSI and maybe get the waiver again could take months or even years.

So she's asked Social Security to reverse itself and return to what had been the status quo for years and allow her to stay on SSI, to keep her Medicaid and to keep working.

""My medical expenses are so much, hundreds of thousands a year,"" says Haly. ""Do you not want me to work then? Because I can be a VP at JPMorgan Chase. I pay a lot of taxes being a VP at JPMorgan Chase. Or I can just not work and collect.""

While Haly waits for a decision on her appeal, her Medicaid insurance is in place -- for now.

For a few days in early summer, without Medicaid, everything stopped. Her medicine was delayed. When her medical providers saw her insurance was halted, they canceled her physical therapy sessions and her wheelchair repair.

There would be few options, Haly says, if she loses her appeal to the Social Security Administration. She could stop working and apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. That comes with Medicare. But it would take at least two years to get it.

""Someone like me,"" she says, ""who is a person with a disability who needs full-time care, the only way to get that is in a nursing home.""

For businesses, there's a growing recognition of the value of hiring more workers with disabilities. One trend: The creation of cafes, coffee shops and other small businesses as places where disabled people can be hired to work alongside others without disabilities.

In St. Paul, Minn., attorney Shamus O'Meara opened a specialty popcorn business this year with his 26-year-old son Conor, who is autistic.

Conor O'Meara makes the popcorn and greets customers when they come in.

""When they see Conor,"" his father says, ""it's like, 'Conor, how are you!' It's a true joy to have him here. Everyone knows him. They call him the Mayor of St. Paul.""

The goal of Highland Popcorn (motto: ""Popcorn with Personality"") is to create a place where disabled people can find work.

But Shamus O'Meara says they quickly ran into barriers with SSI. Because of the $65 limit on monthly earnings and the $2,000 limit on assets, many of their employees, including Conor, need to limit their work to just a few hours, a few days a week.

That required Shamus, who hires both disabled and nondisabled workers, to find many extra employees to cover all the shifts.

Work is important to Conor, for social interaction and for the money he can earn.

He takes the bus to two other part-time jobs. At a nearby bowling alley, he cleans the scoring screens and sweeps up the cigarette butts outside. At a pizza restaurant, he buses dishes and wraps silverware in napkins. In addition, he volunteers at a community radio station and hosts a show where he talks about his life and about Minnesota's professional sports teams.

Conor says he'd like to work even more. ""I think Social Security should end that one limiting how many hours you work.""

Tabi Haly's bosses, too, are confounded by SSI's complex and stale rules -- and by the idea that a valued worker would go from a company vice president to having her career ended and possibly needing to move to a nursing home.

""Tabi contributes to our business in a very meaningful way. She's top talent,"" says Bryan Gill, who runs JPMorgan's office of disability inclusion. ""And I want more of Tabi's time contributing to our business.""

Gill says the financial services company makes an effort to hire people with disabilities because it's a way to find talented workers in a tight labor market.

""We do a lot of charity,"" he says. ""We have a lot of philanthropic efforts. This is not one of them. This is a business strategy imperative to the long-term success of this company.""

Haly also writes songs and has recorded two CDs. She started singing as a form of speech therapy to strengthen her weakened lungs.

In the lyrics to one song, ""Waiting in the Wings,"" she asks: ""Do they judge me by my talent? ...Treat me less than a human being? Is that what our life's meant to be?""

""Waiting in the wings means we're waiting backstage,"" she says, waiting for rights. ""What that means here in the States is that we have the liberty to pursue our dreams and live them. And not feel like there are all these barriers to get there.""

Haly says she only wants the chance to keep working and to keep her independence. But she needs to keep her SSI and Medicaid to make that remain her reality."

""They had no idea what I was talking about,"" she says. ""Zero.""

She says they offered to help her stop working and sign up for a separate benefit program, Social Security Disability Insurance, SSDI, for people who can't work because of a disability.

She recalls: ""The person said: 'I can make you an appointment for SSDI, Do you want to claim disability?' I said, 'No, I do not want to collect SSDI.'""

It took several weeks, she says, until she got an appointment to talk over her problem with a Social Security caseworker. Haly says he advised her that she needed to reapply for SSI.

She was reluctant to apply for a benefit that she already held, and had without question, for years. But the staffer was insistent, so she did.

Shortly after, she got a letter from Social Security-with a short denial. It said she made too much money to qualify.

SSI's regulations are complex and confusing. Often, recipients find it necessary to hire a lawyer or a benefits manager with specialized expertise to negotiate the rules to stay eligible.

""The rules are so complicated that even the most educated, professional people cannot understand and follow the rules. It's heartbreaking,"" says attorney Wagner at Cornell.

For years, Social Security said Haly qualified for an exception to SSI's earnings limit, called a 1619(b) waiver. It refers to a part of the Social Security law that lets some disabled people earn money over the limit and still qualify for Medicaid.

Social Security's denial this summer turned all that upside down.

It ended her eligibility for SSI because of her growing income-which before was excluded by the waiver. When she lost SSI, she lost the waiver that went with it. She can't use the waiver now or even reapply for it because the waiver is only available to people who Social Security says are eligible for SSI.

""It's a Catch-22,"" says Haly, frustrated.

To be eligible again, Haly would need to impoverish herself and give up the aides and medical care she is unlikely to afford on her own-especially if she can no longer work.

Even then, to reapply for SSI and maybe get the waiver again could take months or even years.

So she's asked Social Security to reverse itself and return to what had been the status quo for years and allow her to stay on SSI, to keep her Medicaid and to keep working.

""My medical expenses are so much, hundreds of thousands a year,"" says Haly. ""Do you not want me to work then? Because I can be a VP at JPMorgan Chase. I pay a lot of taxes being a VP at JPMorgan Chase. Or I can just not work and collect.""

While Haly waits for a decision on her appeal, her Medicaid insurance is in place-for now.

For a few days in early summer, without Medicaid, everything stopped. Her medicine was delayed. When her medical providers saw her insurance was halted, they canceled her physical therapy sessions and her wheelchair repair.

There would be few options, Haly says, if she loses her appeal to the Social Security Administration. She could stop working and apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. That comes with Medicare. But it would take at least two years to get it.

""Someone like me,"" she says, ""who is a person with a disability who needs full time care, the only way to get that is in a nursing home.""

Popcorn with a personality-and a work limit

For businesses, there's a growing recognition of the value of hiring more workers with disabilities. One trend: The creation of cafes, coffee shops and other small businesses as places where disabled people can be hired to work alongside others without disabilities.

In St. Paul Minnesota, attorney Shamus O'Meara opened a specialty popcorn business this year with his 26-year-old son Conor, who is autistic.

Conor O'Meara makes the popcorn and greets customers when they come in.

""When they see Connor,"" his father says, ""it's like, 'Connor, how are you!' It's a true joy to have him here. Everyone knows him. They call him the Mayor of St. Paul.""

The goal of Highland Popcorn (motto: ""Popcorn with Personality"") is to create a place where disabled people can find work.

But Shamus O'Meara says they quickly ran into barriers with SSI. Because of the $65 limit on monthly earnings and the $2,000 limit on assets, many of their employees, including Conor, need to limit their work to just a few hours, a few days a week.

That required Shamus, who hires both disabled and non-disabled workers, to find many extra employees to cover all the shifts.

Work is important to Conor, for social interaction and for the money he can earn.

He takes the bus to two other part-time jobs. At a nearby bowling alley, he cleans the scoring screens and sweeps up the cigarette butts outside. At a pizza restaurant, he buses dishes and wraps silverware in napkins. In addition, he volunteers at a community radio station and hosts a show where he talks about his life and about Minnesota's professional sports teams.

Conor says he'd like to work even more. ""I think Social Security should end that one limiting how many hours you work.""

A workforce issue, not charity

Tabi Haly's bosses, too, are confounded by SSI's complex and stale rules - and by the idea that a valued worker would go from a company vice president to having her career ended and possibly needing to move to a nursing home.

""Tabi contributes to our business in a very meaningful way. She's top talent,"" says Bryan Gill, who runs JPMorgan's office of disability inclusion. ""And I want more of Tabi's time contributing to our business.""

Gill says the financial services company makes an effort to hire people with disabilities because it's a way to find talented workers in a tight labor market.

""We do a lot of charity,"" he says. ""We have a lot of philanthropic efforts. This is not one of them. This is a business strategy imperative to the long-term success of this company.""

Haly also writes songs and has recorded two CDs. She started singing as a form of speech therapy to strengthen her weakened lungs.

In the lyrics to one song, ""Waiting in the Wings,"" she asks: ""Do they judge me by my talent? ...Treat me less than a human being? Is that what our life's meant to be?""

""Waiting in the wings means we're waiting backstage,"" she says, waiting for rights. ""What that means here in the States is that we have the liberty to pursue our dreams and live them. And not feel like there are all these barriers to get there.""

Haly says she only wants the chance to keep working and to keep her independence. But she needs to keep her SSI and Medicaid to make that remain her reality."
"In Nevada, Latinos could pick the next president. They aren't sold on either candidate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25479/nevada-latino-voters-trump-harris-culinary-union,2024-10-01T12:02:30Z,"LAS VEGAS -- Walking out of a grocery store in a Latino neighborhood on the east side of the city, Flor Elena Fernandez says she's wrestling with who to vote for in this year's election.

The 36-year old housekeeping manager worries about the cost of food. She worries about the cost of living.

""We're all waiting for what is going to happen, especially us Hispanics, says Fernandez, who is originally from Cuba. ""The economy is bad. We're waiting to see what happens.""

Her one and a half year old son, dressed in a red Flash superhero shirt is riding in the cart. Her mom also walks along, smiling knowingly.

Flor Maria Parra, Fernandez' mother, explains that she's already decided.

""Yes, for Kamala Harris,"" Parra, explains. ""At least with Hispanics, she defends the Hispanics a lot, while Trump throws them out.""

Around 1 in 5 voters in the Silver State are Latino. Now, that's more political power than the group has in almost any of the other 7 key states in the electoral college count.

President Biden barely eked out a victory in Nevada, in part by winning 60% of the Latino vote, but polls suggest Trump has stronger Latino support than previous Republican campaigns.

It's here in Las Vegas where Trump unveiled his plan to eliminate taxes on tips, seen as a direct pitch largely to Latino workers who make up the backbone of the state's casino and hospitality industry.

Looking to regain their advantage, the Harris campaign is spending $3 million in Spanish-language radio this month, which it says is the largest investment in Hispanic media ever.

The Democrats have also launched their not-so-secret weapon in the state -- an army of service workers from the Culinary Workers Union who have been helping deliver the party victories for several elections.

Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, admits Nevada, ""to be honest, should be Trump territory.""

""At the end of the day, we're competitive, and we outwork everybody,"" he said, adding, ""there's a pathway to win if we really can get workers talking to workers face to face at the doors.""

That's exactly what they do. Thousands of cooks and servers and room cleaners will take a leave of absence to knock on doors, six days a week for Harris and the Democrats. The Culinary Union will help cover their missed wages as they undertake this different kind of work.

The Trump campaign is also increasing its efforts to reach Latino voters. In Nevada, it's hosting Spanish phone banking sessions, postcard writing nights and trainings for local volunteers.

Tony Fabrizio, Trump's lead pollster, argues that Harris' team is spending so much money on Latinos because they've lost so much ground within the community, especially in Nevada and Arizona.

""I don't care whose national poll you look at -- even yours, from NPR -- it is really very clear that she is underperforming with Hispanics, not only nationally, but in these two key states,"" Fabrizio said.

Back at the supermarket, views of Trump are widely mixed. Alfredo Alcasar is a maintenance worker. He says he doesn't like how Trump talks about Latinos.

""I don't like to be minimized. Trump always minimizes us, he said. ""And why, if we've done nothing bad? All we've done is try to contribute to the country as best we can.""

But Pedro Fernandez, a carpenter -- who is not related to Flor Elena and her mom -- is less worried about Trump's rhetoric and more concerned about inflation and the cost of living.

""We've been here 18 years, and when Trump was in power, the economy was stronger,"" he said.

As for Flor Elena Fernandez, she's torn. It will be her first time voting after recently becoming a citizen, and she wants to make the right choice. She agrees the economy is bad, but she also sees her mother's perspective.

""We know that she has a plan, but we don't know how good it will be,"" Fernandez says of Harris."
JD Vance's time on the trail has often been overshadowed by self-made controversy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5060281/vp-debate-jd-vance-haitian-migrants-abortion-childless-cat-ladies,2024-10-01T09:10:12Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance speaks to a crowd during a rally at the Berks County Fairgrounds on Sept. 21, in Leesport, Penn. Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images hide caption

Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has been an aggressive messenger for Donald Trump's campaign vision for the future and is a constant fixture on the trail, doing interviews and taking questions from the press.

But in the 11 weeks since Vance joined the GOP presidential ticket, that message has been overshadowed by controversy -- often of Vance's own making.

His acceptance speech in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention was heavy on biography and nodded towards a more polished take on Trump's often dire rhetoric.

""My friends, tonight is a night of hope,"" he said. ""A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren.""

Vance's selection came at a moment when Trump was leading in key battleground polls after President Biden's poor debate performance and the GOP was rallying around Trump after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The freshman Ohio senator was viewed as the MAGA heir apparent to the party's future.

But in the run-up to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, there have been two conflicting forces at work on the trail: the message that Vance wants to get out, and what actually sticks.

Take his first solo campaign rally in his hometown, just days after the RNC, where he delivered a populist speech vowing to help lift up ""forgotten communities all across our country.""

""We're going to fight for every single worker in this country,"" he said. ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to put a good dinner on the table and send your kids to whatever vacation and whatever school you want to.""

But another line that broke through to the public -- and not for good reason -- was a comment about Diet Mountain Dew.

""Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,"" he said. ""I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too.""

In the days that followed, Trump struggled to quickly pivot his campaign message to address Vice President Harris after President Biden dropped out of the race, but Vance was quick to fill in the gaps to question her record and make her the focus of attacks on immigration, inflation and other top Republican issues.

When Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and the pair embarked on a swing state blitz, Vance was there, too, countering the Democratic message with the case for a Republican presidency.

""It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States,"" he said in Philadelphia.

But Vance's rapid ascension in politics means he has relatively less experience as a campaigner, delivering stump speeches or handling the intense scrutiny on past and present statements.

So the prebuttal tour came as Vance was also dealing with uproar over old comments he made deriding Democrats in charge as quote ""childless cat ladies.""

""It's not a criticism of people who don't have children,"" Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly. ""I explicitly said in my remarks despite the fact the media has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.""

But the damage was done, as Vance's old comments provided Democrats an opening to attack the GOP ticket as sexist and out of touch.

Then, there's more recent remarks, like a weeks-long inflammatory crusade against Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio that Vance has sought to use as a cudgel to attack Democrats over immigration.

""The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,"" Vance said in a Sept. 15 CNN interview. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

State and local Republican leaders in Ohio have rejected claims made by Trump and Vance about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The city's mayor told news outlets that Vance's staff knew the conspiracies about eating pets were false before Trump uttered the lies on the debate stage last month.

Several times, Vance has also staked out policy positions for the ticket that Trump has later disagreed with or shot down, like when Vance said that Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

Where Trump offered a ""concept of a plan"" for health care, Vance answered a question after a Raleigh, North Carolina campaign speech with more details of how Republicans would overhaul health insurance risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, a broadly unpopular proposal.

Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Vance has also been prolific when it comes to messaging campaign goals, frequently doing media interviews, delivering speeches and taking questions after most every stop -- prioritizing local journalists.

But those Q and A sessions can turn contentious, with the crowd often booing questions from journalists as Vance takes the opportunity to paint himself as a pugilist for Trump, whether it be queries about interest rate cuts or questions about the campaign's support of North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who allegedly called himself a ""Black Nazi"" among other things on a porn forum more than a decade ago. (Robinson has denied the allegation.)

Vance, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps, regularly lectures reporters about what he perceives to be unfair coverage of him and frequently directs them to ask Harris questions instead.

Even in more casual campaign settings, Vance has struggled at times to connect. At one stop at a doughnut shop in Valdosta, Georgia, an employee was awkwardly put on the spot by the candidate -- she then asked not to be filmed on camera. On another visit to a Pennsylvania sandwich shop last weekend, Vance was left standing outside in a parking lot after some initial confusion because staff at the shop were never given advance notice of his visit.

All of these things have contributed to Vance having the lowest favorability rating on this year's presidential ballot -- and one of the lowest of any VP pick in recent history."
How young Republicans and Democrats are whipping up votes in key districts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123646/donald-trump-kamala-harris-georgia-election-young-voters,2024-10-01T09:06:16Z,"A member of the Young Republicans fills out a postcard asking for support for GOP candidates in Georgia. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

In a bustling restaurant in northwest Atlanta, roughly a dozen young Republicans are surrounded by pitchers, chips and salsa, chatting and laughing as they fill out postcards.

""Anybody need a drink?"" calls Winslow Jones, the president of Atlanta Young Republicans.

The group has met for what they're calling Margaritas and Mailers, and today they are handwriting postcards asking for support for two down-ballot GOP candidates running in nearby districts.

""Margaritas help,"" Jones laughs. ""This is an environment where people can come and connect with likeminded people.""

As election day nears, all eyes are once again on Georgia and its 16 electoral votes. And this time, one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention: millennials and Gen Z.

Voters under 44 years old will make up about half the eligible voting population in the U.S. this fall, according to population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. NPR traveled to Atlanta to see how different groups of young organizers are approaching this moment.

At the Young Republican meet-up, Jones points to the intellectual diversity among its members, including the varying opinions on former President Donald Trump.

""I think across the board there can be mixed feelings about Trump,"" she says. ""But I think what we're all united on is this is a much bigger picture here that we need to look at ... issues that are affecting people at large.""

Jones says the issues resonating with younger conservatives like herself include the economy, the U.S.-Mexico border and crime.

Nearby, Jacquelyn Harn is also busy writing postcards. She's the chairwoman of the statewide group, Young Republicans of Georgia.

""We're excited for a change,"" Harn says when asked about Trump's 2024 run. ""We want the life that we had four years ago when President Trump was president. And his policies -- his conservative policies -- we need those back, and we want those to be able to achieve our version of the American dream again.""

Harn says young people have been hit hard by the economy and inflation. She points to housing and the fact that she can't afford to buy a house because she's ""paying rent out the wazoo every month."" And she doesn't see that changing if Kamala Harris wins.

""She's saying day one, she's going to fix the housing crisis and the pricing and inflation,"" Harn says. ""She's had three-and-a-half years to do that, so no one's buying it.""

Yet while younger Republicans in Atlanta are mobilizing, young conservatives in general are becoming increasingly rare, says Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.

""Since the Obama years, the youth vote really has sided with the Democratic presidential candidate more often than not,"" Swint told NPR. ""The only question has been, what's the size of that turnout for the Democratic candidate?""

Back at the Margaritas and Mailers event, NPR asks Harn if it's harder for Republican groups to fire up younger voters who may be watching Harris, who is nearly 20 years younger than Trump and has landed high-profile endorsements likely to resonate with young people, like from Taylor Swift.

Harn says she isn't fazed: ""Taylor Swift is a billionaire who doesn't have to worry about how much groceries costs ... you can't tell me she relates to the average person around this table tonight. So if the best they can do is a celebrity endorsement that is not relatable at all, I don't see what they're doing.""

In the two months since President Biden stepped aside and Harris took the top of the ticket, Democratic groups in Georgia have shifted their campaigning into overdrive.

""Things just got crazy out of nowhere,"" says Davante Jennings, the president of Young Democrats of Georgia. ""Like, more people involved, more support, more work, more canvassing, more text banking. But it's good.""

When we meet Jennings recently at the Atlanta headquarters of the Harris-Walz campaign, he is joined by a dozen 20-somethings all typing on laptops set up on white folding tables, surrounded by pizza boxes. At the front of the room, a screen shows dozens more joining via Zoom. This is a joint text banking event, co-hosted by Young Democrats of Georgia, Men4Choice and Reproductive Freedom for All.

For organizers like Jennings, the goal is to hold onto the wave of enthusiasm Harris' candidacy generated and use it to mobilize all Georgians. At this event, they sent about 64,000 texts, all aimed at a very specific group: men of color, 27 to 50 years old.

""The backbone of the Democratic Party is the Black vote, which is why the Republicans are heavily focused on Black men specifically,"" Jennings says. ""When we show up ... elections seem to kind of flip. And right now it's not 100% guaranteed that we're going to get all of the Black vote.""

Jennings is also acutely aware of how seemingly small moments can build momentum. He just took over as the Young Democrats president from Parker Short, who recently went viral for lip-syncing Kendrick Lamar at a Harris rally in Atlanta. Jennings says the group got a lot more inquiries from potential organizers after that.

Yet while the Harris-Walz campaign is leaning hard into online messaging, embracing memes and viral moments on platforms like TikTok, political science professor Bernard Fraga of Emory University says it may have its limits. It's one thing to have that support from young people online, he says, it's another to turn that into ballots.

""It still remains to be seen whether the Harris campaign can continue that momentum all the way into November and make sure that Gen Z and younger voters are mobilized and active participants in our democracy,"" he told NPR.

Outside of campaigning for either party, a swathe of nonpartisan groups operate in Georgia and are working to simply make sure young people are politically engaged.

Among them is Rise, a nonprofit organization specifically targeting Gen Z students. It recruits ambassadors and pays them $3 for every person they get to pledge to vote. We met Rise's Georgia organizers recently in an area of Atlanta that includes a number of HBCUs, like Morehouse, Spelman and Clark Atlanta University.

In a presentation to a group of college students interested in becoming ambassadors, Rise's leaders tell them to highlight issues that are likely to resonate.

""How many folks in here have been impacted by gun violence?"" asks Aunna Dennis, Rise's director of Georgia. Nearly every hand in the room goes up.

Dennis tells NPR the aim is to mobilize millions of young voters across the country, but specifically in Georgia.

""We got 12 million voters here in this area alone, we have over five million registered voters. And we can unleash the youth wave on each of these campus communities,"" she says. ""That's a win for us.""

Meanwhile, at Kennesaw State University, nonprofit Poder Latinx has come to campus for National Voter Registration day. On the campus lawn, organizers are handing out pins, stickers, drinks -- even bottles of Tajin -- waving students over to the tent and encouraging them to register. By the end of the day, 81 new voters had registered, taking the total to more than 1,100 since Poder Latinx started doing this in March.

One of the students that came by the table was 19-year-old Iambianze Jackson. She told us she is planning to vote for Harris this November, but is less than enthusiastic.

""She doesn't really explain her policies well,"" Jackson says. ""She mainly talks about tax cuts for the middle class but like, she doesn't really have policies.""

And then Jackson says something we heard from a few people in this battleground state: The election can't come fast enough.

""I'm ready for it to be over,"" Jackson says with a laugh. ""I'm ready for the results to come out so we can just proceed from there, whatever happens."""
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
Trump-supporting billionaires are enabling his white supremacist rantings,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-backing-billionaires-enabling-white-supremacy-rcna174186,2024-10-08T00:54:52Z,"Some of Trump's wealthiest backers say they like his economic policies, so they keep quiet about his racism and xenophobia.

According to polls, the top issue in this year's presidential race is inflation/the economy. But at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, last week, there was just about no applause when he stated, ""We will end inflation and make America affordable again. We're going to get the prices down."" When did his audience explode with energy? When Trump gave them lines targeting immigrants, like ""On day one of my new administration, the invasion ends and the deportations begin. We get them out."" And, speaking of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, ""Do you trust her to stop the invasion?"" In response, the crowd loudly chanted, ""We need Trump! We need Trump!""

Regardless of what the polls say the top issue is, Trump knows that his rallygoers get most excited when he gives voice to white supremacy. Two weeks ago, at another rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Black migrants were destroying the character of Springfield, Ohio, and then declared, ""You have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out!"" In response, the crowd delivered a bone-chilling chant: ""Send them back! Send them back!""

Over the weekend, Trump told Wisconsin voters that he ""will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs."" The facts don't back up Trump's claims of a migrant crime wave. (As Frank Figliuzzi noted in an MSNBC column Sunday, the feds just made a huge bust of a white supremacist gang trafficking in fentanyl.) But Trump doesn't care about facts. He cares about scaring his predominantly white base and then persuading it to see him as the guardian of white America.

We know exactly which immigrants Trump is talking about given his long history of demonizing Latino immigrants and the comments he made when he was president, when he referred to Black nations such as Haiti as ""shithole countries."" His supporters know that when Trump promises ""mass deportation"" -- one of the themes of this year's Republican National Convention -- he means Black and brown people.

Everyone understands what Trump is about. But for too long there has been a tendency to excuse Trump's wealthy supporters -- like Elon Musk, who appeared at Trump's rally on Saturday -- as being on the Trump train only for the tax cuts or other financial gain -- as Trump has explicitly promised them at big-ticket fundraisers. However, these wealthy and often well-educated people see the same headlines we do. They should understand that the most visible part of Trump's campaign is racism, and it's long past time they are called out for enabling Trump's racist agenda.

As Forbes magazine detailed in its article on Trump's top billionaires, some are outspoken, while some support Trump for unspecified reasons.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who posted after Jan. 6 attack that Trump should ""resign and apologize to all Americans,"" changed his tune in July when he announced he would endorse Trump. At the time Ackman wrote on social media, ""We are in the midst of a perilous moment for our democracy."" (Seeing Trump, who is facing criminal charges for attempting a coup and called for the ""termination"" of the Constitution, as a guardian of democracy is laughable.)

New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson said this year on Fox News that he is backing Trump again because ""Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border and inflation and gas prices and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there."" The Winklevoss twins, famously depicted in the film ""The Social Network,"" about the founding of Facebook, donated more than $1 million each to support Trump, citing Trump's ""Pro-Bitcoin Pro-Crypto Pro-Business"" position.

But every one of these billionaires is telling us that in exchange for the policy goals they want, they are on board with or at least comfortable with Trump's bigotry. After all, if racism were a deal-breaker for them, would they still be funding his 2024 campaign?

Others, like Musk, though, appear to be more openly on board with Trump's extremist agenda. Musk has peddled the same types of bigoted attacks Trump has about Black migrants in Ohio, demonized DEI programs while suggesting white people are inherently smarter than Black people. And Ackman has been vocally critical of DEI programs with posts on X such as ""DEI is inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.""

Trump has become the head cheerleader for white victimhood and the defender of symbols of white power. This explains why on Friday he told supporters at an event in North Carolina he would rename the local military base to again honor the slave-owning Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, who, as part of the Confederacy, fought to preserve chattel slavery.

""Should we change the name Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?!"" Trump asked, and the crowd exploded with cheers. (The name of that base, like others that honored Confederates, was changed in 2020 when Congress overrode Trump's veto of the bill.) Trump vowed that if wins, he is ""doing it."" This syncs up perfectly with Trump's defense of monuments honoring white supremacy as ""beautiful"" when he was president.

Those who claim that they're supporting Trump for his promises of tax cuts or deregulation don't get a pass when he's using such racist language and promising to carry out racist policies. If a candidate campaigning on white supremacy is elected to the presidency again, they won't be able to evade accountability with the claim that that's not why they supported him.

""I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country,"" Trump told Time magazine in April. He is reportedly planning a second-term overhaul of anti-discrimination law that his allies say would ""dramatically change the government's interpretation of Civil Rights-era laws to focus on 'anti-white racism' rather than discrimination against people of color."" And as the American Civil Liberties Union has recently warned -- citing the mandates of Project 2025 -- if Trump wins there will be a dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs because he and his supporters have characterized them as ""anti-white racism."" Indeed, 84% of his supporters are worried about ""anti-white"" discrimination.

Trump isn't hiding his bigotry. In fact, it's the cornerstone of his campaign. And if he's returned to office, then everybody who helped him get there is responsible: those who voted for him because of the white supremacy and those who say they had other reasons but didn't treat the white supremacy as disqualifying."
Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."
Chris Hayes: How the Trump campaign is gaslighting Americans,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vance-lies-gaslighting-debate-fact-check-rcna174067,2024-10-05T01:12:38Z,"Sen. JD Vance lies with such ease that even sometimes when you're paying attention, you don't know you're being lied to and, frankly, it drives me insane.

Just take this moment from Tuesday night's vice presidential debate:

But that's just not true: The United States, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, already produces more energy than any other nation on earth. Biden's Energy Department helped open the second of two nuclear reactors in Georgia in May. These were the first new reactors built in the United States in more than 30 years. And in July, Biden signed a bipartisan bill into law aimed at vastly growing domestic nuclear energy.

So, what do you call it when someone says the opposite of the truth? Let's just call it the Trump-Vance campaign: an entire political movement premised on Americans not believing their lying eyes and directing hate and rage at out-groups, rather than dealing with the thorny work of attempting to solve real problems with actual solutions.

Vance proved as much with his debate performance Tuesday night. He claimed there were 25 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, a made-up figure he's repeated often on the campaign trail. The actual number, experts say, is less than half of that. He then suggested Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were ""illegal immigrants"" when they in fact hold protected status.

He falsely claimed that Mexican cartels were running guns across the border into the U.S. But everyone who covers the border knows guns flow from America, where they're readily available, to Mexico which has some of the strictest gun laws in the world. Vance also said crime, inflation and border crossings are up. The opposite is true; they are all falling.

But my favorite lie from Tuesday's debate was when Vance said -- in a manner so assured that I literally had a moment where I thought I maybe was missing something -- that Donald Trump spearheaded a bipartisan effort to save the Affordable Care Act.

Again, this just isn't true. In 2016, Trump ran on a promise to kill the ACA. And, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, pointed out during the debate, Trump came within one Senate vote of succeeding in killing it.

Look, this isn't about two parties having good-faith disagreements on whether some policy will have the promised effects. It's about Trump and Vance gaslighting you into not knowing what to believe. Creating this alternate reality has become a central part of their campaign."
Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
Great news on job growth strengthens Dems' pre-election pitch,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jobs-job-growth-democrats-biden-harris-economy-election-2024-rcna174006,2024-10-04T13:28:30Z,"As Election Day 2024 approaches, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality keeps getting in the way.

Expectations heading into this week showed projections of about 150,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in September. As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market fared quite a bit better than that. NBC News reported:

In addition to the encouraging top-line data, the same Labor Department report showed that wage growth continued to outpace inflation.

This is not the final jobs report before Election Day -- that will be released the morning of Nov. 1, five days before voters go to the polls -- but the new data will help drive the public conversation about the economy in the race's final weeks.

The encouraging job numbers also come the week after a surprisingly good report on U.S. economic growth, which led White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard to note in a written statement, ""We learned this morning that the economy has grown by 3.2% per year during Biden-Harris Administration -- even stronger than previously estimated -- and better than the first three years of the previous administration.""

As the 2024 election cycle nears its end, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality, however, keeps getting in the way of GOP talking points.

Let's also circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump's presidency -- when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet -- the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018, and 2019.

According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16.5 million jobs since January 2021 -- more than double the combined total of Trump's first three years. (If we include the fourth year of the Republican's term, the data looks even worse for him.)

For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions:"
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

In the end, election forecasts are not bad at telling us how the future will look, as long as it continues to look like the past."
Harris proposes expanding Medicare to cover in-home senior care,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-home-health-care-sandwhich-generation-098a7ed48dfd94d11fb0efcd5d63b42b,2024-10-08T19:05:50Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is proposing to provide federal funding to cover home care costs for older Americans, aiming to help the "" sandwich generation "" of adults caring for aging parents while raising their children at the same time.

Appearing Tuesday on ABC's ""The View,"" Harris talked about taking care of her mother when she was dying and personally experiencing the challenges many families face when seeking affordable in-home care for their aging loved ones.

She promised that if, elected in November, she will seek to expand Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older Americans, so that it covers long-term care and includes services like in-home aides. Harris said aides could help seniors do things as simple as preparing meals or putting on sweaters because it is ""about dignity for that individual. It's about independence for that individual.""

Her proposal is a new one just a month out from Election Day but the issue is one that President Joe Biden 's administration has been working on for years.

In an effort to soften the effects of inflation, the White House promoted as part of Build Back Better, its legislative agenda that stalled on Capitol Hill years ago, steeply increased federal spending for child care as well as for seniors. After Build Back Better collapsed, the Biden administration continued to promote increasing spending for what it calls ""the care economy,"" a cause Harris has continued to mention after replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

""These plans are common sense. They can help family caregivers work and save both families and the federal government money by allowing seniors to stay in their homes instead of being sent to nursing homes,"" the Harris campaign said in a fact sheet detailing her proposal. ""Medicare at Home will also reduce hospitalizations.""

As part of a blitz of media interviews she's been doing in recent days, Harris sat down after her appearance on ""The View"" with radio personality Howard Stern, who said that his mother is 97. Taking care of an elderly parent, he said, ""will bankrupt you.""

Such costs have increased pressure on adults caring for their parents and kids simultaneously. In 2019, roughly 30% of family caregivers of older Americans lived in households that included children or grandchildren, according to AARP.

Harris would likely have to work with Congress to achieve key parts of her proposal. Harris' campaign points to past, similar proposals projected to cost $40 billion annually, but says much of that can be offset by savings achieved through efforts begun by the Biden administration to expand Medicare's ability to negotiation prices with major drug manufacturers.

Harris is also promising to further expand Medicare to include hearing and vision coverage, while changing existing rules that can allow federal authorities to seize a deceased beneficiary's home to recuperate costs. The campaign fact sheet says that practice ""means that those homes are not passed on to the seniors' children, which particularly harms rural and minority families."""
LA County voters face huge decision on homeless services funding,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/los-angeles-taxes-california-general-news-2c5afdfa6ec14c30f345b72fcc13d609,2024-10-08T17:56:55Z,"Los Angeles voters' decision about a new sales tax next month will have a significant effect on the resources dedicated to California's largest homeless population: Either the county will be set to receive about $1 billion annually, or it will have until 2027 to find a new funding stream.

Measure A would repeal an existing quarter-cent sales tax and replace it with a half-cent sales tax, slightly increasing what consumers pay for everything from clothes to sporting equipment. If it passes, it's expected to raise more than $1 billion a year for shelters, housing and other services in a county where more than 75,000 people have nowhere to call home. If the measure fails and nothing else replaces it, the existing tax that funds much of the county's homeless services will expire in 2027. Officials and service providers worry that would gut LA County's homeless response system at a time when it's most needed.

""To not have those services at our disposal to address the crisis that we're seeing on our streets would be an absolute travesty,"" Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath said.

Supporters of the measure include local nonprofits such as the Los Angeles-area branches of United Way and Habitat for Humanity. As of late September, 49% of likely voters surveyed in a poll co-sponsored by the LA Times said they would vote for Measure A -- just short of the majority the measure needs to pass. Another 33% said they would vote no, and 17% remained undecided.

But with few obvious signs of improvement on the streets, even after seven years of taxes, some critics wonder whether putting more money into existing programs is the right approach.

""We pour too (many) tax dollars into a system that is broken,"" said Lance Christensen, vice president of education policy and government affairs for the California Policy Center, a conservative fiscal watchdog group. The group hasn't taken an official position on Measure A.

Los Angeles County voters in 2017 passed a quarter-cent sales tax dubbed ""Measure H."" That tax helped the county ramp up its fight against homelessness and today helps fund many of the area's programs, including Pathway Home, which launched last year to move people out of encampments, into hotels, and ultimately into housing. This year, it will make up about a third of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's total budget, said Paul Rubenstein, deputy chief external relations officer for the authority.

In all, funds raised by the 2017 tax have helped move more than 42,000 people into permanent housing and 80,500 into temporary housing, according to the county's Chief Executive Office.

If the original tax expires in 2027 without a replacement, and housing programs funded by that tax close, the county's Chief Executive Office estimates unsheltered homelessness could increase by 28%, or nearly 15,000 people.

Measure A would repeal and replace that tax with one that is larger and would fund a wider variety of resources. For example, the prior tax paid for shelters and services, but not for new housing. If Measure A passes, money also would be set aside to build new affordable housing.

""Services alone don't solve the problem,"" Horvath said. ""We need both.""

Nearly a third of the money raised by the new tax would go to the LA County Affordable Housing Solutions Agency, to be spent on new homes and services aimed at preventing people from going through eviction or foreclosure. Most of the rest would be spent on homeless services.

Measure A also would come with some guardrails built into the spending process. Two new oversight bodies are tasked with setting specific goals for programs that spend Measure A dollars. The first is the Executive Committee, which includes two county supervisors, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, Newsom homelessness advisor Hafsa Kaka, and officials from other cities around the county.

The second is the Leadership Table, which includes service providers, people from the business community, city and county staffers and three people who have experience being homeless themselves. The inspiration for both groups came from Houston. A delegation of LA County leaders visited the Texas city in 2022 and came back wanting to replicate the way its city, county, business, faith and service leaders work together, according to Peter Laugharn, president and CEO of the nonprofit Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, which led the trip.

Together, the two groups will set goals for Measure A-funded programs, track their outcomes and potentially reallocate funds away from underperforming initiatives.

""I think we're going to come up with some very good stuff,"" said Laugharn, co-chair of the Leadership Table.

Proponents hope those two oversight bodies will add an extra layer of transparency and accountability at a time when homelessness spending at the state and local levels is under intense scrutiny.

A scathing audit released earlier this year found California fails to track both how much it spends on homeless services, and whether that spending is effective. And the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (one of the main agencies that distributes homeless funding in Los Angeles County) is currently being audited as part of a legal settlement between advocates for the rights of unhoused residents and the city and county of LA. A federal judge overseeing that settlement recently blasted the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority for failing to make records of its spending available, according to LAist.

Critics of Measure A aren't convinced the new oversight bodies will help the county spend the tax dollars more wisely.

""This is too much administration. Too much bureaucracy,"" said Susan Shelley, spokesperson for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which wrote the official statement in opposition to Measure A that will appear on voters' ballots.

But the association's main complaint is even simpler: A tax increase is not the way to fund the county's fight against homelessness.

Los Angeles County already has some of the highest sales tax rates in California, with some cities above 10%.

""This is very harsh on people,"" Shelley said, ""especially with inflation pushing prices up.""

"Stock market today: Chinese shares soar, then fade as Beijing outlines details of stimulus",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-treasury-china-rates-c1c41b35ddbb4fd0bf93ee93df1f1a2c,2024-10-08T03:48:19Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- Shares soared Tuesday in Shanghai as Chinese markets reopened after a weeklong holiday but then gave up a chunk of their initial gains as officials in Beijing outlined details of plans to revive the world's second-largest economy.

The Shanghai Composite index was up 5.5% at 3,519.88 and in Shenzhen, Japan's smaller market, the main index gained 5.3%. The Shanghai benchmark initially gained 10% but fell back as officials of China's main economic planning agency briefed reporters about a slew of policies announced earlier meant to address key problems such as a property market slump.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 5.8% to 21,758.45 as traders sold to lock in profits from recent gains.

""China's markets rally has hit a wall, leaving investors deflated. The reopening surge from the week-long holiday barely had time to gather steam before fizzling out, and now the once-thrilled bulls are licking their wounds,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Elsewhere in Asia, markets were mostly lower.

Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1.2% to 38,861.09. as the dollar fell to 147.91 Japanese yen from 148.18 yen. A weaker yen tends to push share prices higher.

The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.5% to 2,596.38. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% to 8,187.10.

On Monday, U.S. stocks slid after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.

The S&P 500 dropped 1% to 5,695.94 and is still close to its all-time high set a week earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% to 41,954.24, coming off its own record. The Nasdaq composite sank 1.2% to 17,923.90.

It's a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. A blowout report on U.S. jobs growth released Friday raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.

When Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.

It's more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.

The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.

Treasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil.

Brent crude, the international standard, shed $1.23 to $79.70 per barrel. It had jumped 3.7% Monday. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, slipped $1.24 to $75.90. It also gained 3.7% on Monday.

Stocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500's returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.

Apple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.

An exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.

If Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.

Analysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth.

In other dealings early Tuesday, the euro rose to $1.0986 from $1.0977.

Home insurers argue for a 42% average premium hike in North Carolina,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-home-insurance-hearing-helene-96549139712a6c35fd0cb6e69b755d5d,2024-10-07T20:43:00Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- With many western North Carolina residents still lacking power and running water from Hurricane Helene, a hearing began Monday on the insurance industry's request to raise homeowner premiums statewide by more than 42% on average.

A top lieutenant for Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey opened what's expected to be multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments by attorneys for the state Insurance Department and the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies seeking the increase.

In over 2,000 pages of data filed last January, the Rate Bureau sought proposed increases varying widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to 99% in some beach areas. Proposed increases in and around big cities like Raleigh, Charlotte and Greensboro are roughly 40%.

Across 11 western counties that were hit hard by Helene, including Asheville's Buncombe County, the requested increase is 20.5%. The percentages are based on insurance payouts of years past and future claims projections.

After taking public comment, Causey rejected the request in February, prompting the hearing. In previous rounds of premium rate requests, the industry and commissioners have negotiated settlements before a hearing. Before the last such hearing in 2021, they settled on a 7.9% average premium increase after the bureau had sought 24.5%.

This time, Causey told reporters, ""we were not able to come anywhere close. So that's why we're here today.""

When the hearing ends, the hearing officer, in consultation with Causey, will decide within 45 days whether the proposed rates are excessive, and if so, issue an order that sets new rates. That order could be challenged at the state Court of Appeals.

Rate Bureau attorney Mickey Spivey told hearing officer Amy Funderburk that the highest inflation in 40 years -- particularly on building materials -- combined with calamitous storms that are ""getting worse and worse"" show that current premium rates are ""severely inadequate.""

Spivey cited Helene, which inflicted unprecedented destruction in the state's western mountain communities, as well as Hurricane Florence in 2018, which caused billions of dollars of in damage in eastern North Carolina, much of it paid for by insurance companies.

Not mentioned Monday: Hurricane Milton, which grew explosively to a Category 5 hurricane while closing in on Florida on a path expected to mostly miss North Carolina.

""Whether you want to call it climate change or not, there is no denying that we are having bigger, stronger and more costly catastrophic storms than we've seen in any of our lifetimes,"" Spivey said.

The Insurance Department's attorney, Terence Friedman, argued that the industry continues to use actuarial methods that ignore what state law requires in calculating rates increases.

Friedman said the bureau's requested rates are inflated and that the department's actuaries will demonstrate there are ""alternative recommended rates that will allow the bureau's members to earn what they're constitutionally entitled to.""

But Spivey said the Insurance Department's witnesses would seek to actually lower premium rates, or limit increases of less than 3%.

Without a fair profit and the ability to cover claims, Spivey said, the industry will have to invoke a legal exception more frequently, insuring high-risk homeowners only if they agree to pay premiums that are up to 250% of the Bureau's rate. Otherwise, he said, more insurers will stop issuing policies altogether.

The ""consent to rate"" exception in North Carolina's law has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers, as some states have experienced, said David Martlett, an insurance professor at Appalachian State University.

While each state has different models to regulate rates, those affected by more hurricanes and storms are essentially faced with two options, Marlett said: Allow rates to keep rising to cover claims, or ""somehow we build structures that are able to withstand climate change.""

Friedman criticized the bureau for citing Helene in its opening statement, saying it shouldn't be used as grounds to raise rates on the storm's survivors. He also noted that most of Helene's damage was caused by flooding, which is covered separately from the homeowners' policies now being considered.

The proceedings are likely to continue after early voting begins on Oct. 17. Causey, a two-term Republican commissioner, is being challenged by Democrat Natasha Marcus, a state senator.

She held a news conference outside the Insurance Department headquarters criticizing Causey for declining to preside over the hearing, calling it a ""ridiculous dereliction of one of his major duties in this job."" She also lamented that any decision will be made after Election Day.

Causey said he's not hearing the case in part because he's not an attorney. State law allows him to pick someone else to preside over the hearing, which is a quasi-judicial proceeding."
EEUU ha gastado cifra récord en ayuda a Israel desde inicio de guerra en Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-49f2e56e58227c28dc174d0d1959a00e,2024-10-07T15:00:39Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Estados Unidos ha gastado un récord de al menos 17.900 millones de dólares en ayuda militar a Israel desde que comenzó la guerra en Gaza y llevó a una escalada del conflicto en todo Oriente Medio, según un informe del proyecto Costos de la Guerra de la Universidad de Brown, publicado el lunes al cumplirse un año de los ataques del grupo armado palestino Hamás contra Israel.

Se han destinado 4.860 millones de dólares adicionales a la intensificación de las operaciones militares estadounidenses en la región desde los ataques del 7 de octubre de 2023, dijeron los investigadores. Eso incluye los costos de una campaña liderada por la Armada para sofocar los ataques contra el transporte marítimo comercial por parte de los hutíes de Yemen, aliados de Hamás y respaldados por Irán.

El informe -- completado antes que Israel abriera un segundo frente, esta vez contra el grupo político-paramilitar Hezbollah, también respaldado por Irán, en el Líbano, a fines de septiembre -- es uno de los primeros recuentos de los costos estimados de Estados Unidos, mientras el gobierno del presidente Joe Biden respalda a Israel en sus conflictos en Gaza y Líbano y busca contener las hostilidades de los grupos armados aliados de Irán en la región.

El costo financiero se suma al costo en vidas humanas: los milicianos de Hamás mataron a más de 1.200 personas en Israel hace un año y tomaron a unos 250 como rehenes. La ofensiva de represalia de Israel ha cobrado la vida de casi 42.000 personas en Gaza, según el Ministerio de Salud palestino, que no distingue entre civiles y combatientes en su recuento.

Al menos 1.400 personas en Líbano, incluidos combatientes de Hezbollah y civiles, han muerto desde que Israel amplió sus ataques en ese país a fines de septiembre.

Los costos financieros fueron calculados por Linda J. Bilmes, profesora de la Facultad de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de Harvard, quien ha evaluado los costos totales de las guerras estadounidenses desde los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001, y sus colegas investigadores William D. Hartung y Stephen Semler.

Entre otros datos, se destaca que Israel es el mayor receptor de ayuda militar estadounidense en la historia, con 251.200 millones de dólares ajustados a la inflación desde 1959, según el informe.

Aun así, los 17.900 millones de dólares gastados desde el 7 de octubre de 2023 en dólares ajustados a la inflación son, con mucho, la mayor cantidad de ayuda militar enviada a Israel en un año.

Gran parte de las armas estadounidenses entregadas en el año fueron municiones, desde proyectiles de artillería hasta destructores de búnkeres de 2.000 libras y bombas guiadas de precisión.

Los gastos van desde los 4.000 millones de dólares para reponer los sistemas de defensa antimisiles Cúpula de Hierro y Honda, de Israel, hasta dinero en efectivo para fusiles y combustible para aviones, según el estudio."

Measuring inflation

The Labor Department releases its consumer prices report for September on Thursday.

Economists predict inflation continued easing last month. The Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in 2022 to combat inflation. It's goal has been to cool inflation back to 2%. It started cutting interest rates at its last meeting.

Stock market today: Asian shares climb after blockbuster US jobs report,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-oil-24925e5840a2491fbc1acc07543bc37d,2024-10-07T04:50:17Z,"Asian shares advanced Monday after a surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report raised optimism about the economy, sparking a rally on Wall Street.

U.S. futures slipped and oil prices also fell.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.9% to 39,354.63 after the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. The Japanese currency has bounced on speculation over the central bank's plans for interest rates since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last week.

In a policy speech on Friday, Ishiba said he wants to see salary increases that outpace inflation and that he will promote investment to create ""a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution."" He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience.

But he offered no major new initiatives, and his initial public support ratings are around 50% or lower, relatively low for a new leader, according to Japanese media. He plans to dissolve parliament on Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27.

After surging against the dollar the yen fell back late last week. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 148.57 yen, down from 148.72 late Friday. Lower interest rates tend to boost prices of shares and other assets.

Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4% to 23,056.53 and the Kospi in Seoul surged 1.1% to 2,597.34.

Taiwan's Taiex gained 1.3%.

Mainland Chinese markets reopen from a weeklong holiday on Tuesday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. Before the Oct. 1 National Day holiday began, announcements of policies aimed at reviving the ailing property market pushed share benchmarks sharply higher and this week could bring more volatility.

""More fiscal stimulus to stabilize the property market and restructure local government debts, and structural reforms to address the over-capacity and deflation issues are needed to turn around the economy,"" B of A Securities said in a research note, pointing to continued declines in home sales, housing prices and credit growth.

On Friday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.9% and got close to its all-time high set on Monday, closing at 5,751.07. The Dow gained 0.8% to 42,352.75, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.2% to 18,137.85.

Leading the way were banks, airlines, cruise-ship operators and other companies whose profits can benefit the most from a stronger economy where people are working and better able to pay for things. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 4.9% higher, JPMorgan Chase rose 3.5% and the small companies in the Russell 2000 index gained 1.5%.

Worries over tensions in the Middle East still are casting a shadow, having pushed oil prices sharply higher as the world waits to see how Israel will respond to an Oct. 1 missile attack by Iran.

But U.S. benchmark crude oil slipped 19 cents to $74.19 per barrel early Monday, while Brent crude, the international standard, lost 29 cents to $77.76 per barrel.

Treasury yields soared Friday after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August's hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists' forecasts.

Recent encouraging data on the economy have raised hopes that the job market will hold up after the Fed pressed the brakes on the economy through higher rates in order to stamp out high inflation.

The Fed has begun cutting interest rates and Friday's jobs report was so strong traders are now forecasting it will not deliver another half-point interest rate cut before the end of the year after doing so in September.

In other dealings early Monday, the euro rose to $1.0973 from $1.0967."
"Tips, overtime, Social Security: A look at Donald Trump's no-tax pledges and what they might cost",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-taxes-social-security-overtime-tariffs-989016ef41dc1533b05d1871d69c03ff,2024-10-07T04:21:13Z,"Donald Trump has pledged to end taxes on everything from tips to Social Security and overtime pay if he's elected to the White House again. But he hasn't detailed how he would fund those ideas and avoid creating a huge budget shortfall, beyond arguing he will usher in an economic boom.

He argues his ideas would improve Americans' personal financial standing and the overall U.S. economy. A debate about the tax code will be a dominant legislative issue next year given that tax cuts Trump signed in 2017 will be set to expire. If he's elected again, Trump could push Congress to enact some or all of his proposals, though that might be difficult if Democrats end up in control of either the House or the Senate.

Estimates from outside economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts ranged between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years, depending on which ideas become policy and how they're implemented.

A look at Trump's various tax-related ideas:

In June, Trump announced his plan to exclude workers' tips from federal taxes, saying he got the idea from a waitress at his Las Vegas hotel.

""To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,"" Trump said, adding: ""We're going to do that right away, first thing in office.""

Trump made the announcement in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes and home to the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country. Nevada has an average of 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put it in play this fall.

Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax -- which funds Medicare and Social Security -- as well.

Vice President Kamala Harris has echoed Trump's call for no taxes on tips, making a pledge that would apply to hospitality and service industry workers at a Nevada rally of her own two months after her GOP opponent's announcement.

Trump has also pledged tax cuts for older Americans, posting on Truth Social in July that ""SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!""

The challenge is that taxes on Social Security benefits help to pay for the program. The loss of revenue could mean that Social Security would be unable to pay out its full benefits in 2033, two years ahead of the current estimate, according to Brendan Duke of the liberal Center for American Progress.

According to the Social Security Administration, recipients must currently pay federal income taxes if combined income -- 50% of the benefit amount plus any other earned income -- is higher than $25,000 annually if filing individually, or $32,000 if filing jointly.

While in the Senate, Harris co-sponsored a bill that would have required the wealthy to pay higher Social Security taxes and made benefits more generous for some. The White House has said her views on the program are similar to Biden's, but Harris hasn't talked in detail about Social Security during her campaign.

Trump has also said he would support legislation to eliminate taxes on overtime pay.

""That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said in September at a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it's a lot easier to get the people.""

Harris has not said if she would also call for cuts to taxes of overtime pay.

Trump's plans include proposed breaks for businesses, too. He's called for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S.

""We're putting America first,"" Trump said. ""This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs.""

As president, Trump signed legislation in 2017 that cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.

Harris has said she believes that big corporations and the ultra-wealthy should pay more in taxes -- including a 28% rate for corporations -- and wants to use those revenues to help spur the construction of 3 million homes and offer tax breaks for parents.

Ahead of a September rally on Long Island, Trump pledged that he would ""get SALT back,"" suggesting he would eliminate a cap on state and local tax deductions that were part of tax cut legislation he signed into law in 2017.

The so-called SALT cap has led to bigger tax bills for many residents of New York, New Jersey, California and other high-cost, high-tax states, and is an important campaign issue in those states, particularly among those New York Republicans serving in districts Biden won.

Some Democrats have pushed to lift the $10,000 cap, a move many Republicans have said they oppose. Some, including Trump's former GOP primary foe Nikki Haley, have called for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Some of that notion is enshrined in Republicans' 2024 platform, although the permanence provision specifically calls out portions ""that doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans.""

Harris has not said that she would try to preserve Trump-era tax cuts, which are set to run out at the end of next year. But, like Biden, she has vowed not to raise taxes for Americans who earn less than $400,000 annually.

Angling to bring back more overseas jobs and manufacturing to the U.S., Trump has said repeatedly that he wants higher tariffs on imported goods, and has said the idea wouldn't increase inflation. He has floated the idea of a universal tariff as high as 20% on all imports and even higher tariffs on Chinese products and on U.S. companies that move factory jobs overseas.

In a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump suggested that tariffs could be used to solve seemingly unrelated challenges such as the rising cost of child care in the U.S., as part of a broader promise that tariffs can raise trillions of dollars to fund his agenda without those costs being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. That's a view with which many economists disagree since tariffs directly raise the prices of purchasing goods.

Particularly as it relates to the U.S. auto industry, it's a notion he called for again recently in Savannah, Georgia, where Trump said he'd put a 100% tariff on every car imported from Mexico. Calling for a ""new American industrialism,"" Trump suggested that the only way to avoid those charges would be for an automaker to build the cars in the U.S.

Harris has described Trump's ideas for tariffs as a ""sales tax"" on American households that could cost a typical family roughly $4,000 annually.

Top US trade official sees progress in helping workers. Voters will decide if her approach continues,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/katherine-tai-trade-tariff-workers-trump-election-250fab4c5dbc1c10f0780844dcdb2b12,2024-10-06T12:00:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the U.S. trade representative, Katherine Tai is legally required to avoid discussing the presidential election. But her ideas about fair trade are on the ballot in November.

Voters are essentially being asked to decide whether it is best to work with the rest of the world or threaten it. Do they favor pursuing worker protections in trade talks, as Tai has done on behalf of the Biden-Harris administration? Or should the United States jack up taxes on almost everything it imports as Donald Trump has pledged to do?

After nearly four years in her job, Tai feels she is making progress on getting the U.S. and its trade partners to focus more on workers' rights. Decades of trade deals often prioritized keeping costs low by finding cheap labor that could, in some cases, be exploited.

""You can't do trade policy by yourself,"" Tai said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""I am confident that the path that we are on is the right path to be on. I think the only question is how much progress we are able to make in these next years.""

It is an approach that has drawn criticism from business leaders, economists and Republicans who say that the U.S. has not made enough progress on new trade partnerships and countering China's rise.

""There have been no trade deals, no talks to expand free trade agreements,"" Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said in an April congressional hearing with Tai. ""Compared to China's ambitious agenda, the United States is falling behind in every region in the world.""

Trump says that broad tariffs of at least 20% on all imports -- and possibly even higher on some products from China and Mexico -- would bring back American factory jobs. Most economists say they would hurt economic growth and raise inflation, though the former president has dismissed those concerns.

""If you're a foreign country and you don't make your product here, then you will have to pay a tariff, a fairly substantial one, which will go into our treasury, will reduce taxes,"" Trump, the Republican presidential nominee this year, said at a recent rally in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Tai has degrees from Yale University and Harvard Law School, but strives for a blue-collar perspective on trade. She said that she has injected once-excluded labor union voices into the trade process.

The Biden-Harris administration has not rejected tariffs. It kept the ones on China from Trump's presidency. It has imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles, even though there is not much of a U.S. market for these vehicles that can cost, without tariffs, as little as $12,000. Tai sees that as a way to shield an emerging industry against subsidized and unfair competition.

But the administration also is looking to bolster U.S. workers in the face of competition from China through other industrial policies, such as funding for computer chip factories and tax breaks for technology in renewable energy sources.

The reality, according to some economists, is that domestic factories did not simply lose jobs to China. There were productivity gains that meant some manufacturers needed fewer employers and there was a broader shift as more workers moved away from manufacturing and into the services sector. Those factors often get less emphasis from Tai, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

""It seems to me that she's focusing on the easy one -- the one where you can blame the 'bad guy,' China,"" Lovely said.

There is unfinished work.

The trade pillar of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework spearheaded by Tai remains incomplete. That effort by Washington and its allies in Asia is meant to counterbalance China's ascendance without needing a trade deal, but it puts more of a focus on workers' rights and environmental protections than past proposals.

""What I have discovered is that we actually all want the same thing,"" Tai said. ""Fundamentally, what we're doing is innovating the way you do trade policy, innovating the way globalization is going to play out into the future.""

Tai said she is trying to foster a trade policy with other countries that ""allows for us to build our middle class together and to stop pitting them against each other, because that's been the model we've been pursuing for the last several decades.""

William Reinsch at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said it is not surprising that Asian countries involved in the initiative would say they support their middle-class workers. But he saidt Democrats have not provided the access to U.S. markets that trade partners want in return for the focus on workers.

""The consistent message we have gotten from the Asian partners is that they are looking for tangible benefits, and the U.S. is not providing any,"" he said. ""Trying to rearrange the traditional social order, however meritorious that would be, can be an uphill battle.""

Tai sees herself as having a proof of concept that her approach to trade can thrive. It just happens to come from the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised North American trade deal signed during the Trump administration and cited by Trump as evidence that he knows how to negotiate with the rest of the world.

In her interview, Tai said the agreement includes a ""rapid response mechanism"" that enables the government to penalize factories that violate workers' rights. Tai said that as of late September, the U.S. government has invoked the mechanism 28 times and concluded 25 of those efforts.

Tai said that has directly benefited 30,000 Mexican workers who could elect their own union representation, allowing them to receive higher wages, back pay and other benefits.

""We are empowering workers through trade,"" she said. ""And by empowering Mexico's workers, we are ensuring that America's workers do not have to compete with workers in our neighboring country who are being exploited and who are being deprived of rights.""

Praise for the agreement appears to be a rare point of convergence on trade between Trump and the Biden-Harris administration. But their perspectives are different. Trump tells voters that his threats of massive tariffs can cause foreign governments to accept America's terms on trade and immigration.

""I ended NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with the USMCA, the best trade deal ever made,"" he said Monday, referring to the North America Free Trade Agreement signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.

Tai, barred by the federal Hatch Act from weighing in on the presidential campaign from her office, is cautious in her remarks. But she disputes Trump's claim.

She notes that there were actually two negotiations on trade with Canada and Mexico. The first negotiation was among the Trump administration and the other two nations. But the second was between Trump's team and congressional Democrats who needed to ratify the deal and that led to worker protections, a component Tai worked on when she was a congressional staffer.

But then, she added, just getting a written deal on trade protections and rights is never enough. The text needs to be backed up by action.

""They're just words on the page unless it's implemented,"" she said."

The president has been less available than his recent predecessors to questions from White House press corps, making his surprise appearance welcome to the gathered reporters who waited as his press secretary's daily briefing was moved up 15 minutes, then delayed for nearly one hour.

The president stepped through the press room's blue door in a dark gray suit and red tie and proceeded to make news in response to questions about comments on the 2024 presidential election, the latest jobs numbers and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The 81-year old stepped aside from the Democratic nomination this summer, backing Vice President Kamala Harris instead. He acknowledged doubts about whether the November election would be peaceful, given comments by former President Donald Trump that the results could be rigged.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful,"" Biden said. ""The things that Trump has said, and the the things that he said last time when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.

""Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on social media. ""But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris.""

The jobs reports are legitimate and have capped a solid run for the U.S. economy. Growth has stayed solid even as the inflation rate has dropped from a four-decade high in 2022 to an annual rate of 2.5%.

Consumer confidence has been weak relative to overall economic growth, a sign that many people still don't feel the strength seen in the latest jobs and inflation numbers. But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again movement.

""If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call 'fake,'"" Biden said. ""The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere.""

The president also highlighted the deal reached Thursday to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers on East and Gulf coast ports until Jan. 15, creating time to try to hash out a new contract.

Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.

Since Hamas attacked Israel nearly a year ago, Israel has retaliated by bombarding the Gaza region in ways that have raised human rights concerns, as well as killing Hezbollah leaders and launching airstrikes in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel and there are concerns about additional retaliation that could cause the conflict to deepen.

When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.

""Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they're going to do in terms of a strike,"" Biden said Friday. ""That's under discussion. I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

The president emphasized that he and Harris are ""singing from the same song sheet"" on foreign and domestic policy, calling her a ""major player in everything we've done.""

As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race. Biden cocked his head and smiled."
Dockworkers' union suspends strike until Jan. 15 to allow time to negotiate new contract,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-ports-dockworkers-agreement-ila-f136bdcd52738e94f2938aaa79a1fa2a,2024-10-04T10:57:53Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports are returning to work after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.

The International Longshoremen's Association is suspending its three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.

A person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn't want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract.

Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points.

Industry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn't gum up the supply chain too badly.

The settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It's also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up prices and reignited inflation.

The union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States.

Most retailers had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the strike.

""With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold,"" President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement.

In a statement later, Biden applauded both sides ""for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.""

Biden said that collective bargaining is ""critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.""

The union's membership won't need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike. Until Jan. 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on Sept. 30.

The union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers.

Thomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal.

""I'm sure that if they weren't going anywhere they wouldn't have suspended (the strike),"" he said. ""They've got wages. They'll work out the language on automation, and I'm sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.""

Kohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that.

Just before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress.

Thursday's deal came after Biden administration officials met with foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a person briefed on the day's events who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said.

Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn't worsen a natural disaster, the person said.

By midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase, bringing about the agreement, according to the person.

Google says it will stop linking to New Zealand news if a law passes forcing it to pay for content,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/google-news-zealand-media-digital-bargaining-meta-26a85c5690378316d1b7e770529462b5,2024-10-04T10:50:01Z,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Google said Friday it will stop linking to New Zealand news content and will reverse its support of local media outlets if the government passes a law forcing tech companies to pay for articles displayed on their platforms.

The vow to sever Google traffic to New Zealand news sites -- made in a blog post by the search giant on Friday -- echoes strategies the firm deployed as Australia and Canada prepared to enact similar laws in recent years.

It followed a surprise announcement by New Zealand's government in July that lawmakers would advance a bill forcing tech platforms to strike deals for sharing revenue generated from news content with the media outlets producing it.

The government, led by center-right National, had opposed the law in 2023 when introduced by the previous administration.

But the loss of more than 200 newsroom jobs earlier this year -- in a national media industry that totaled 1,600 reporters at the 2018 census and has likely shrunk since -- prompted the current government to reconsider forcing tech companies to pay publishers for displaying content.

The law aims to stanch the flow offshore of advertising revenue derived from New Zealand news products.

Google New Zealand Country Director Caroline Rainsford wrote Friday that the firm would change its involvement in the country's media landscape if it passed.

""Specifically, we'd be forced to stop linking to news content on Google Search, Google News, or Discover surfaces in New Zealand and discontinue our current commercial agreements and ecosystem support with New Zealand news publishers,"" she wrote.

Google's licensing program in New Zealand contributed ""millions of dollars per year to almost 50 local publications,"" she added.

The News Publishers' Association, a New Zealand sector group, said in a written statement Friday that Google's pledge amounted to ""threats"" and reflected ""the kind of pressure that it has been applying"" to the government and news outlets, Public Affairs Director Andrew Holden said.

The government ""should be able to make laws to strengthen democracy in this country without being subjected to this kind of corporate bullying,"" he said.

Australia was the first country to attempt to force tech firms -- including Google and Meta -- to the bargaining table with news outlets through a law passed in 2021. At first, the tech giants imposed news blackouts for Australians on their platforms, but both eventually somewhat relented, striking deals reportedly worth 200 million Australian dollars ($137 million) a year, paid to Australian outlets for use of their content.

But Belinda Barnet, a media expert at Swinburne University in Melbourne, said Meta has refused to renew its contracts with Australian news media while Google is renegotiating its initial agreements.

As Canada prepared to pass similar digital news bargaining laws in 2023, Google and Meta again vowed to cease their support for the country's media. Last November, however, Google promised to contribute 100 million Canadian dollars ($74 million) -- indexed to inflation -- in financial support annually for news businesses across the country.

Colin Peacock, an analyst who hosts the Mediawatch program on RNZ, New Zealand's public radio broadcaster, said Google ""doesn't want headlines around the world that say another country has pushed back"" by enacting such a law.

While Google pointed Friday to its support of local outlets, Peacock said one of its funding recipients - the publisher of a small newspaper - had told a parliamentary committee this year that the amount he received was ""a pittance"" and not enough to hire a single graduate reporter.

Minister for Media and Communications Paul Goldsmith told The Associated Press in a written statement on Friday that he was still consulting on the next version of the bill.

""My officials and I have met with Google on a number of occasions to discuss their concerns, and will continue to do so,"" he said.

Goldsmith said in July that he planned to pass the law by the end of the year.

"Japan's new leader expresses regret for governing party slush fund scandal, vows stronger defense",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-policy-us-china-security-economy-a5412430588c624ea25ee5dc8f38ae7f,2024-10-04T06:18:05Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- New Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba opened his first policy speech in office Friday by expressing deep regrets over the governing party's slush funds scandal that dogged his predecessor.

Ishiba replaced Fumio Kishida on Tuesday with the paramount mission of quickly pacifying public anger over financial misconduct in the Liberal Democratic Party and regaining support ahead of an Oct. 27 parliamentary election.

""I will achieve politics that is not for politicians but for the people,"" Ishiba said, pledging to provide sincere explanations and ensure that lawmakers abide by the rules.

He set five policy pillars to uphold, including security, economy and disaster resilience.

Ishiba said he will bolster Japan's military capability to defend itself from threats from China, Russia and North Korea under the framework of the Japan-U.S. security alliance.

He did not mention two goals he advocated before taking office -- making the Japan-U.S. security alliance more equitable and establishing a NATO-like collective defense system in Asia -- apparently to avoid controversy ahead of the election that the LDP must win.

Omitting those goals also saves him from possibly irking Washington, but may disappoint those who saw him as willing to speak up even when he risked disagreement with his own party.

Ishiba noted violations of Japanese airspace last month by Chinese and Russian warplanes and North Korea's advancing missile technology and testing as examples of the worsening security environment that Japan faces and stressed the need for a further buildup of Japan's military.

He said he will promote a ""strategic, mutually beneficial relationship"" with China and increase communication on all levels to build ""stable and constructive"" ties. He also said he will further strengthen and expand Japan's ties with South Korea and the trilateral cooperation Japan has with it and the United States.

He called the Japan-U.S. security alliance a cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy and security as well as the foundation of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and international society.

The first public support ratings for Ishiba as prime minister were around 50% or even lower, the lowest levels for a new leader, according to Japanese media.

Opposition leaders have criticized him for rushing to hold an election after only adding a new face and fresh image to the party without any concrete results. He plans to dissolve parliament next Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27, allowing only a few days of debate on his policies.

On the economy, Ishiba said in his speech that he wants workers to have sustainable salary increases that exceed inflation, and will promote investment to create ""a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution."" He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience.

Despite earlier supporting a phasing out of nuclear power following the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, he pledged to maximize the use of nuclear energy and push for geothermal and other renewable sources to meet the soaring electricity needs of data centers in the age of AI."
Jobs report is likely to show another month of modest but steady hiring gains,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-federal-reserve-inflation-unemployment-economy-87447d5187b37bb0f5cf996e25bad808,2024-10-04T04:06:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. labor market is still reliably cranking out jobs each month, enough to give Americans the confidence and paychecks to keep spending and sustaining the economy. Yet the pace of hiring has lost momentum over the past several months, evidence that employers have become more cautious.

September likely brought more of the same. The Labor Department is expected to report Friday that employers added a decent but hardly spectacular 140,000 jobs last month, roughly matching August's 142,000 gain, according to forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet.

""We'll get modest employment gains, not all that great, but enough to keep the economy moving forward,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College.

The economy's resilience has come as a relief. Economists had expected that the Federal Reserve's aggressive campaign to subdue inflation -- it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 -- would cause a recession. It didn't. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.

Last month, the Fed began cutting rates, in part to try to bolster the slowing job market. And, as Bethune noted, the once unlikely prospect of a ""soft landing'' -- in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession -- ""is already secure.''

The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market's durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor.

Across the economy, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world's largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter.

On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that America's services businesses grew for a third straight month in September and at an unexpectedly fast pace. The economy's service sector is closely watched because it represents more than 70% of U.S. jobs.

Last month, the nation's households increased their spending at retailers. And even with hiring having slowed, Americans are enjoying extraordinary job security. Layoffs are near a record low as a percentage of employment. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits also remains near historically low levels.

Companies seem generally reluctant to let workers go even though they are also hesitant to expand their payrolls. That unusual dynamic may stem from many employers having been caught flat-footed and short of staff after the economy began roaring back from the pandemic recession.

Employers added an average of just 116,000 jobs a month from June through August, including a dismal 89,000 in July. That marked the weakest three months of hiring since mid-2020. Hiring has plummeted from a record average of 604,000 a month in 2021 at the end of COVID recession and 377,000 in 2022.

Posted job openings, too, have declined steadily, to 8 million in August, after having peaked at 12.2 million in March 2022.

Workers have noticed the chillier environment for jobseekers. Far fewer feel confident enough to leave their jobs to seek a better position. The Labor Department reported this week that the number of Americans who are quitting their jobs fell to its lowest level since August 2020, when the economy was still reeling from COVID.

Job-hopping isn't as lucrative as it had been, either. Last month, those who changed jobs were earning 6.6% more than they had earned a year earlier -- a 1.9 percentage point premium over the 4.7% median pay gain of those who stayed put. The job-hopping premium used to be far higher -- a peak of 8.8 percentage points in April 2022, according to Liv Wang, lead data scientist at ADP Research.

Two and a half years of high interest rates, it seems, have taken a toll on the job market. But relief might be coming.

The Fed last month slashed its benchmark interest rate by a hefty half-percentage point -- its first and biggest rate cut since the 2020 recession. The central bank said it was encouraged by progress in its fight against inflation. Consumer prices were up 2.5% from a year earlier in August, barely above the Fed's 2% inflation target and down dramatically from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.

Friday's jobs report may bring more good news on inflation. Diane Swonk, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm KPMG, said she expects that average hourly wages rose 0.2% last month, down from a 0.4% increase in August. That would translate, she says, into a 3.7% gain from a year earlier. That's close to the 3.5% that many economists regard as consistent with the Fed's inflation target. Such a drop would ease pressure on employers to pass along the cost of higher wages by raising their prices and thereby feeding inflation.

The Fed's focus shifted to supporting the job market as hiring slowed this summer and unemployment rose, even while remaining relatively low. The central bank has signaled that it expects to cut its key rate twice more this year -- likely by modest quarter-points -- and four additional times in 2025.

The expectation of lower borrowing costs could encourage employers to pick up the pace of hiring.

""They see light at the end of the tunnel of this monetary tightening that's been going on a couple of years,'' Bethune said."
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Middle East tensions weigh on Wall St,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-oil-iran-cb6a744bb4c16fe09d59091a60c66609,2024-10-04T03:54:40Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- Asian shares were mixed Friday after worsening tensions in the Middle East sent shares lower on Wall Street, while boosting crude prices.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3% in morning trading to 38,668.36. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.7% to 8,145.70. South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,577.51. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.6% to 22,473.56. Trading was closed in Shanghai.

In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 146.52 Japanese yen from 146.83 yen. The euro stood unchanged at $1.1034.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office on Tuesday, was due to give a policy speech on Friday that could indicate his government's stance on issues such as interest rates and spending.

The Bank of Japan has begun very gradually raising its benchmark rate from near zero. It now stands at around 0.25%. Expectations of rising rates had pushed the yen higher after the Liberal Democrats elected Ishiba to head the ruling party and thus serve as prime minister. But the yen has fallen back against the dollar in the past two days after officials sent clear signals that they did not favor further rate hikes at this time.

A cheaper yen could work as a plus for Japan's giant exporters like Nintendo and Toyota by boosting the value of its overseas earnings. But it raises the cost of imports of oil and other vital commodities, pushing prices higher and pinching household spending.

Stocks sank Wednesday on Wall Street as oil prices kept rising as the world waits to see how Israel will respond to Iran's missile attack on Tuesday.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,699.94 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% to 42,011.59. The Nasdaq composite edged less than 0.1% lower to 17,918.48.

Benchmark U.S. crude added 5 cents to $73.76 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 8 cents to $77.70 a barrel. On Thursday, Brent leaped 5% after starting the week below $72. It's potentially on track for its biggest weekly percentage gain in nearly two years.

The rise came after President Joe Biden suggested on Thursday that U.S. and Israeli officials were discussing a possible strike by Israel against Iranian oil facilities.

""We're in discussion of that,"" Biden said to reporters. He added, ""I think that would be a little ... anyway,"" without finishing the thought. Biden also said he doesn't expect Israel to retaliate immediately against Iran.

Iran is a major oil producer and a broadening of the fighting could choke off Iran's flows to China and also affect neighboring countries that are integral to crude supplies. Helping to keep prices in check, though, are signals that oil inventories remain ample at the moment. Brent crude fell to its lowest price in nearly three years last month.

A report Thursday showed growth for real estate, health care and other U.S. services businesses accelerated to its strongest pace since February 2023.

A separate report suggested the number of layoffs across the United States remains relatively low. Slightly more workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, but the number remains low compared with history.

Outside of this week's worries about the Middle East, the dominant question hanging over Wall Street has been whether the job market will continue to hold up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed wanted to press the brake hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation.

Stocks are near their records because of hopes the U.S. economy will indeed continue to grow, now that the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year."
What's next after prosecutors reveal new evidence in Trump's 2020 election interference case,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-capitol-riot-jack-smith-jan-6-e687b91aa27df9f985580c122c5ef34c,2024-10-03T18:59:03Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Special counsel Jack Smith has provided a road map for how prosecutors hope to prove their case charging former President Donald Trump with an illegal scheme to overturn his 2020 election loss -- if it ever gets to trial.

In court papers unsealed Wednesday, Smith's team details new evidence of Trump's ""increasingly desperate"" efforts to cling to power even as those close to him sought to convince him that he had lost the presidency.

It comes just over a month before the presidential election that could determine the future of the case.

The Republican presidential nominee, who has railed against the case as politically motivated, slammed the filing in a NewsNation interview, calling it ""pure election interference"" and ""weaponization of the government.""

Here's a look at what the filing means and what's next:

The purpose of the filing is to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington that allegations against Trump can move forward to trial even after the Supreme Court in July ruled that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.

While the Supreme Court said former presidents have at least presumptive immunity for actions taken in their official role as president, the justices said they are not shielded from prosecution for things they do in their private capacity.

Smith's team is trying to make the case that Trump's prosecution is not off limits because he was acting as a private candidate for office -- not a commander in chief -- when he schemed to overturn the will of voters. Prosecutors say Trump ""must stand trial for his private crimes as would any other citizen.""

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" prosecutors wrote.

""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role.""

The case was supposed to go to trial in March in Washington's federal court but was put on hold last December so Trump could appeal his sweeping claims of presidential immunity. Trump had asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the case entirely, saying it the ""Presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the President faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office.""

While the Supreme Court didn't dismiss the case, it effectively stripped from the indictment allegations involving Trump's dealings with the Justice Department. And it sent the case back to Chutkan to determine which of the remaining allegations in the indictment involve official actions for which Trump may be immune from prosecution and which allegations, if any, can move forward to trial.

In August, Smith's team filed a new indictment that kept the same criminal charges but narrowed the allegations in an attempt to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling.

Trump's lawyers had objected to the filing, accusing prosecutors of wanting to publicize their ""politically motivated manifesto"" to hurt Trump's campaign in the final weeks before the election.

The defense will now get a chance to respond to the arguments from Smith's team. Trump's response is due later this month, but his lawyers on Tuesday evening asked for a five-week extension to file by Nov. 21.

Trump's lawyers have argued that the allegations in the indictment -- including conversations with his vice president and pressing state officials on the administration of elections -- cut to the core of Trump's responsibilities as commander in chief. Trump attorney John Lauro told the judge during a hearing last month that the Supreme Court's opinion required the outright dismissal of the case -- a position the judge made clear she did not accept.

Even if the judge agrees with prosecutors, the case isn't heading to trial anytime soon. Her rulings are expected to be appealed -- likely all the way to the Supreme Court.

And if Trump defeats Biden, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek the dismissal of this case and the other federal prosecutions he faces. Or Trump could potentially order a pardon for himself.

The filing gives Democrats new material to use as they campaign against Trump and offers voters a reminder of the allegations just a month out from Election Day, even as voting has already begun in some states.

Trump, too, has seized on the report, casting it as yet another effort by his rivals to try to hobble his campaign -- complaints that have proven a powerful motivator for his base and a boon for his fundraising.

It's unclear, though, what impact it will have on voters, given the wealth of detail about the 2020 campaign that has already been released as well as Trump's multiple indictments. In polling, concerns about protecting democracy have typically lagged behind concerns about issues like the economy and inflation.

That includes a recent CNN poll that found 4 in 10 likely voters said the economy was their most important issue when deciding how to vote, versus about 2 in 10 who said it was protecting democracy.

The issue of protecting democracy appears to be more important for Democrats and voters already backing Harris. Roughly 4 in 10 voters who support Harris say it is their top issue. For Republicans and Trump supporters, about 6 in 10 name the economy as their top voting issue, followed by immigration. Just 5% of Trump supporters said protecting democracy was their top issue.

The US could see shortages and higher retail prices if a dockworkers strike drags on,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-holidays-shortages-inflation-c195bedec63d41afcec3c942ebb27e93,2024-10-03T16:52:51Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. ports from Maine to Texas shut down this week when the union representing about 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for the first time since 1977.

Workers began walking picket lines early Tuesday near ports all along the East and Gulf coasts.

A shutdown that lasts more than a few weeks has the potential to raise prices and create shortages of goods throughout the country as the holiday shopping season -- along with a tight presidential election -- approaches.

President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday that he thought progress was being made in ending the strike. Asked how much, Biden said ""We'll find out soon.""

The International Longshoremen's Association is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and container-moving trucks that are used in the loading or unloading of freight at 36 U.S. ports. Those ports handle roughly half of the nations' cargo from ships.

The contract between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, expired Tuesday.

The union's opening demand was a 77% pay raise over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying that it would make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.

On Monday, before workers hit the picket lines, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The alliance also said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options.

While any port can handle any type of goods, some ports are specialized to handle goods for a particular industry. The ports affected by the shutdown include Baltimore and Brunswick, Georgia, the top two busiest auto ports; Philadelphia, which gives priority to fruits and vegetables; and New Orleans, which handles coffee, mainly from South America and Southeast Asia, various chemicals from Mexico and North Europe, and wood products from Asia and South America.

Other major ports affected include Boston; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Wilmington, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; Mobile, Alabama; and Houston.

If a strike were deemed a danger to U.S. economic health, President Joe Biden could, under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period. This would suspend the strike.

But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden said ""no"" when asked if he planned to intervene.

""Because it's collective bargaining, I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" Biden said.

If the strike is resolved within a few weeks, consumers probably wouldn't notice any significant shortages or price hikes. But a work stoppage that persists for more than a month could be a different story, depending on what you're shopping for. Most holiday retail goods have already arrived from overseas, so there is a buffer. Prices on everything from fruits and vegetables to cars may head higher, at least temporarily, if it drags on.

That would be unwelcome news after snarled supply chains sent prices jetting higher at the end of the pandemic, and could be potentially damaging politically with Election Day about a month away.

Container loads of highly perishable bananas are stuck at some ports and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters Thursday that it will be hard to retrieve them due to the strike. Biden has urged shipping companies in particular to try harder to resolve the dispute, he said.

""That's the most effective way of getting the bananas to wherever they need to go. And hopefully the shippers will come to the table,"" Vilsack said. ""The union will come to the table. Collective bargaining will work, and we'll get this resolved quickly.""

Limiting the duration of this strike is the key to preventing shortages and higher prices, Vilsack said.

""Our assessment is if this lasts a couple of weeks, we're not talking about a significant disruption,"" he said. ""If you get into months, then obviously that's a different situation.""

Since the major supply chain disruption in 2021, retailers have adapted to supply chain disrupters being the new norm, said Rick Haase, owner of a mini-chain of Patina gift shops in and around the Twin Cities in Minnesota.

""The best approach for Patina has been to secure orders early and have the goods in our warehouse and back rooms to ensure we are in stock on key goods,"" Haase said.

Still, housing those goods for longer can have an inflationary impact at the register because retailers will need to recoup those storage costs, or absorb them.

Jay Foreman, CEO of Basic Fun, a Boca Raton, Florida, the maker of Care Bears and Lincoln Logs, has already shifted all of the toy company's container shipments away from the East Coast to West Coast ports, primarily Los Angeles and Long Beach. That too, comes with a cost.

The maneuver added anywhere from 10% to 20% in extra costs that his company will have to absorb because Basic Fun's prices for the next 10 months are locked in with retailers. But Foreman would consider raising prices during the second half of 2025 if the strike is prolonged.

Daniel Vasquez, who owns the import, export specialty company Dynamic Auto Movers in Miami, increased inventory, specifically for vehicles that take longer to ship, in anticipation of a strike.

He too stopped relying on one port or shipping partner and has expanded his relationship with smaller ports and shipping companies that can bypass congested areas.

Jonathan Gold, vice president of the supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, said the strike arrives with the supply network already facing challenges from Houthi attacks on commercial shipping that have essentially shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal.

Rising uncertainty over the supply chain arrives at the peak of the holiday shipping season for retailers, which traditionally runs from July through early November. Many big retailers, anticipating a strike, started shipping goods to U.S. distribution centers in June, and Gold said that the majority of those products are already in the U.S.

Yet on top of the cost of storing goods for longer, retailers will have a hard time replenishing their inventory should the strike drag on, and as Gold pointed out, carriers are already announcing surcharges on shipped containers due to potential disruptions.

Toy companies had ready diverted many shipments through Los Angeles in anticipation of a strike and inventories at stores are right now are healthy, said Greg Ahearn who leads The Toy Association, the nation's leading toy trade group. He said Wednesday that the strike becomes more problematic with time, specifically in satisfying demand for popular toys as Christmas approaches.

As much as 60% of annual sales for toy companies occur during the current quarter, Ahearn said.

""The longer this goes on, the higher probability that toys that parents and caregivers want for their children will be scarce and with scarcity comes the potential for higher prices,"" he said

"Amazon, Target and other retailers are ramping up hiring for the holiday shopping season",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stores-hiring-holidays-shopping-retail-3de4077d308ef0045bd1d38516b6edcb,2024-10-03T11:43:48Z,"Retailers are ramping up hiring for the holiday season, but fewer seasonal employees are expected to be taken on this year to help customers in stores and assemble online orders in warehouses.

E-commerce giant Amazon said Thursday it will hire 250,000 full, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, rounding out a series of announcements made in recent weeks by the country's top retailers.

Amazon is hiring the same number of employees it did last year, similar to Bath & Body Works and Target, which said in September it will bring in roughly 100,000 seasonal employees and offer current employees the option to work extra hours during the holiday shopping period.

Meanwhile, the department store Kohl's encouraged people to apply for positions but stayed mum on its plans, mirroring Walmart, which said it's been hiring store associates throughout the year and will tap into its own staff when needed during the busy season.

Others have indicated they will scale back their hiring. Macy's said it will add more than 31,500 seasonal positions this year across its Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury stores, as well as its distribution centers. Last year, the company added 38,000.

The holiday shopping period is the busiest time of year for online and brick-and-mortar retailers, some of which have already announced discount events to entice consumers planning to shop early for gifts.

The consulting firm Deloitte forecasts U.S. retail sales will increase between 2.3% to 3.3% during the November to January timeframe and reach a total of $1.59 trillion. EY-Parthenon, the consulting arm of Ernst & Young, forecasts a similar 3% jump in sales during the traditional November-December period. However, it says price increases due to inflation are likely to account for a big chunk of that growth, noting real volume sales will only rise 0.5% year-over-year.

Online sales, a growing segment of retail, is expected to increase 8.4% and reach a record $240.8 billion, according to Adobe, which tracks e-commerce transactions.

""At the moment, retailers appear optimistic for a strong holiday shopping season, which is being reflected in the hiring plans of major retailers and warehouses,"" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Overall, U.S. retailers are expected to add 520,000 new jobs in the final quarter of this year compared to 564,200 in 2023, according to a report released last month by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm, which analyzes non-seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says that's more than the 509,300 seasonal jobs retailers added in 2022. But it represents the second-lowest total since 2009.

Generally, the labor market has gradually lost momentum since the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate numerous times in 2022 and 2023 to combat high inflation. Last month, the Fed cut its key rate for the first time in more than four years. It reflected its new focus on bolstering the job market, which saw positive signs this week when data from the Labor Department showed job openings rose unexpectedly in August.

But the retail industry may encounter challenges filing openings in the coming weeks and months ""due to the demands of the job and pay,"" Challenger said.

To scoop up employees, companies like Macy's and JCPenney as well as sporting goods stores Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's are recruiting workers through nationwide hiring events. Macy's had said it would offer on-the-spot interviews during its first event, which took place last week in its stores and warehouses. The company plans to hold three more events this year.

""We are finding strong application flow,"" said Macy's, adding nearly a third of its recent hires are employees who've previously worked at the company.

Amid the growth in online shopping, the delivery giant UPS is planning to hire 125,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush, up from 100,000 last year.

Radial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for brands like Calvin Klein and Express, says it will hire fewer people but also plans to scale its staff based on real-time demand. That approach allows the company to meet customers' needs ""without overcommitting,"" said Billy Peterson, a senior vice president at Radial.

On the buyer side, consumers have been resilient with their spending while also showing signs of stress, with credit-card debt rising and savings rates falling, trends that could weigh on spending in future months.

Retail sales ticked up from July to August, after jumping the most in a year and a half the previous month. At the same time, consumers have been more prudent about their purchases and pushing back against high prices by trading down to store brands or seeking out deals for products.

However, holiday shoppers could see even higher prices on products if a port workers' strike that has shut down all the major dockyards on the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and the Gulf coast persists for more than a month."
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed and the yen slips against the dollar,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-yen-iran-8c9ee16a53152dcb07bafd0051c3de93,2024-10-03T04:34:23Z,"Asian shares were mixed on Thursday after U.S. stocks were little changed as investors watched to see developments in the Middle East.

The U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese yen as officials downplayed the likelihood of an interest rate hike soon.

That helped push Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index higher. It gained 2.2% to 38,655.03, while the dollar traded at 146.80 Japanese yen, up from 146.41 yen late Wednesday.

The dollar had been trading around 142 yen after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Shigeru Ishiba to head the party and succeed Fumio Kishida as prime minister. Ishiba had expressed support for the central bank's recent moves to raise its near-zero benchmark interest rate, which stands at around 0.25%. That led traders to bet that the yen would gain in value.

But after a meeting between Ishiba and Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda, both officials indicated that the central bank did not view further rate hikes as suitable for the economy at this time. That prompted a flurry of selling of yen.

The meeting between Ishiba and Ueda was not expected to bring major news, however, ""when Ishiba hinted that growing global risks should keep the BoJ firmly grounded, yen bulls hit the exits faster than you can say 'sayonara,'"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.5% to 21,661.99 as investors locked in profits after it roared 6.2% higher a day earlier on a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent announcements from Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy.

With Shanghai and other markets in China closed for a weeklong holiday, trading has crowded into Hong Kong. Markets in South Korea and Taiwan also were closed. India's Sensex fell 0.7%.

Oil prices rose again as the world waited to see how Israel will respond to Tuesday's missile attack from Iran.

U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 73 cents to $70.83 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 67 cents to $74.57 per barrel.

Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and a worry is that a broadening war could affect neighboring countries that are also integral to the flow of crude.

On Wednesday, Wall Street benchmarks ended little changed amid uncertainty over conflict in the Middle East.

The S&P 500 gained less than 1 point, to 5,709.54, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1% to 42,196.52. The Nasdaq composite added 0.1% to 17,925.12.

In the bond market, Treasury yields rose after a report indicated hiring by U.S. employers outside the government may have been stronger last month than expected.

The report from ADP Research said private-sector employers accelerated their hiring in September. That could be an encouraging signal for the more comprehensive report on the U.S. job market due to arrive Friday from the U.S. government.

The dominant question hanging over Wall Street has been whether the job market can keep holding up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed was trying to press the brakes hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation.

Stocks are near records in large part on the belief that the U.S. economy will continue to grow now that the Federal Reserve has shifted to cutting interest rates. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year.

Nike sank 6.8% even though the athletic giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and the slump shows how much work incoming CEO Elliott Hill has in making the brand cool among customers.

Tesla sank 3.5% despite reporting an increase in its deliveries of electric vehicles during the latest quarter, the first time that's happened this year. The number topped analysts' forecasts, but investors may have been expecting an even bigger increase."
"Haunted by 2016, some Michigan Democrats worry that Harris remains ill-defined in swing state",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-democrats-harris-election-voters-46306c264cd27fa553eda0c2df55ced7,2024-10-03T04:23:26Z,"EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) -- Bill Clinton stood with Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell outside a suburban Detroit grocery store two days before the 2016 election when it was clear to both that Hillary Clinton would lose the state. ""They didn't listen to you,"" Dingell recalled the former president saying.

Democrats in the state have seemed ascendant since, controlling the governorship, both Senate seats and the state legislature. But some party leaders here are worried that trend is not enough to put distance between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris' campaign is banking on the fact that they have spent considerably more money than Trump on ads and have a stronger voter outreach program.

Michigan is a state that Harris almost certainly must win to capture the White House, and Democrats' concerns are rooted in the fear that polls don't register all Trump supporters both here and in other battleground states as the campaign enters a critical final phase.

""Anyone who's from Michigan knows that, if you believe the polling, like, I got a bridge I'm going to sell you somewhere,"" said Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic Senate nominee.

Dingell and others have said Harris is still relatively new to many voters and that she needs to make her plans clearer to voters. The congresswoman also said Harris needed to counter efforts by Republicans to paint her as out of touch with Michigan workers.

The state of play today? ""No one is winning this state right now,"" Dingell said.

Patrick Schuh, a veteran Michigan Democratic campaign strategist now deputy national states director for the Democratic voter outreach group America Votes, said voters they have canvassed ""are still wanting to hear more about what Harris stands for as a candidate.""

In some ways, it is simply the worrying point in a campaign, and some Michigan Republicans have concerns that mirror Harris supporters, pointing to Harris' spending edge and lack of a get-out-the-vote effort directly from the Trump campaign.

Trump and allied groups have focused in this automotive manufacturing stronghold on the false claim that Harris ""wants to end all gas-powered cars,"" as one ad that began airing this week states.

As vice president, Harris was the tie-breaking vote for the Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $7,500 tax credits for new electric vehicle purchases.

In an ad airing in Detroit this week, Harris emphasized her biography as a former California attorney general and district attorney ""fighting on behalf of others.""

A complication for Harris has been opposition to the Biden administration's support for Israel in the war in the Middle East within metro Detroit, especially Dearborn, an area that is home to the nation's largest Arab American community. After months of ongoing discussions with Harris' team, communication with some Arab American leaders has stalled, according to Arab American News Publisher Osama Siblani, a prominent leader in the community. Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser, met virtually with some Arab and Muslim leaders on Wednesday to discuss the escalating war in the Middle East.

The death of a Dearborn resident, who Dingell and other community leaders this week said was killed in south Lebanon, has only ignited anger in the traditionally Democratic area. Kamel Ahmad Jawad's death was confirmed Wednesday by a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council.

Harris may overcome divisions within the Democratic coalition by boosting voter turnout in Wayne County, home to Detroit, where low turnout in 2016 contributed to Clinton's loss. Black community leaders noted that excitement surged when Harris entered the race in the summer, and that some momentum continues in the majority-Black city of Eastpointe, just north of Detroit.

Canvassers knocking on doors there for Harris last week encountered several who were firmly committed to voting for her, though some undecided voters wanted to learn more.

""I just go off of what I see in the commercials, and Kamala just seems like she's more for the middle class,"" said Taneisha Stinson, a single mother for whom affordable child care is a top issue.

It's understandable for some Democrats to be nervous, given Michigan's recent narrow presidential election margins, said Amy Chapman, a Democratic strategist in Michigan. Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes. In 2020, Biden carried it by a little more than 154,000 votes, but only by 2.8 percentage points.

""If people are worried, they should be,"" said Chapman, who was Barack Obama's state campaign director in 2008. ""But, not in an 'oh no' way, rather in a we-have-to-work-hard way.""

Harris has not ignored pleas to compete aggressively in Michigan, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016 when she became the first Democrat to lose Michigan in 28 years.

Since entering the race on July 23, Harris' campaign and outside groups that support her candidacy have spent more than $79 million in advertising in Michigan, compared to Trump and groups supporting him which have spent more than $62 million, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact. From Oct. 1 through Election Day, Harris and pro-Harris groups have reserved more than $40 million in Michigan ad spending, compared to $25 million for Trump's campaign and allied groups, according to the firm.

Harris' campaign also has 52 staffed campaign offices in Michigan, including three in Detroit, two in the Grand Rapids area, the state's second-largest metro area and two in vote-rich Oakland County, Detroit's more affluent northwest suburbs. Trump's campaign said they had dozens of offices across the state and in similar places.

""Democrats' financial resources absolutely dwarf anything that the Republicans have,"" said former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler. ""But Trump is making stops in locations that have never had presidential visits before, and those are impactful with margins this close.""

Due, in part, to an abbreviated campaign, Harris has visited Michigan three times, with a fourth stop planned for Friday in Flint. In contrast, Trump has made 11 visits to the state, with a 12th planned Thursday in Saginaw. His stops have spread across various regions, while Harris' efforts have largely focused on the Detroit area.

Public polling, along with insights from campaign operatives in both major parties, indicates that neither candidate holds a clear advantage. On a call with donors this week, Slotkin said her campaign's polling showed Harris ""underwater"" in the state, a synonym for trailing. Her comments to donors were first reported by Axios.

Slotkin dismissed the term as ""just an expression that this is an exceptionally close race,"" when asked to clarify her remark.

Still, the scenario isn't what Democratic activist Lori Goldman expected after the party's enthusiasm spiked with Harris' July entry into the race.

""What did we see? Money coming in like crazy. Everybody was excited. There was such a bump,"" said Goldman, who founded Fems for Dems, a leading Michigan Democratic voter outreach group based in Oakland County. ""And now, you know, it's neck and neck.""

""It is PTSD,"" Goldman said.

Goldman was referring to what Dingell remembers as the outcome of her unheeded warnings in 2016. The Democratic nominee campaigned in Michigan only four times from June through the election. Instead, she focused more on Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, all of which she also lost.

Polls that showed Clinton ahead in Michigan, said Michigan Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond, as others did at the time, did not accurately reflect Trump's support in the state.

""Smart Democrats have a healthy sense of paranoia,"" Hemond said. ""If polling is as far off as it was in 2016, we're cooked."""
"Casey, McCormick to meet for first debate in Pennsylvania's battleground Senate race",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-senate-debate-casey-mccormick-89f4120ac553b31d778523dc699d5771,2024-10-03T04:22:51Z,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Republican challenger David McCormick will meet Thursday night for their first debate in an expensive race for a swing-state seat that could help determine control of the Senate in November's election.

Casey, perhaps Pennsylvania's best-known politician, is seeking a fourth term and is facing what he calls his toughest reelection challenge yet.

Casey, 64, is a staunch ally of labor unions, a former state auditor general and treasurer and Pennsylvania's longest-serving Democrat in the Senate. He has campaigned on preserving the middle class, abortion rights, labor rights and voting rights, and calls McCormick and former President Donald Trump a threat to all those.

McCormick, 59, is making his second run for the Senate after losing narrowly to Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022's Republican primary. He is a former hedge fund CEO who served at the highest levels of former President George W. Bush's administration and sat on Trump's Defense Advisory Board.

He has accused Casey of rubber-stamping Biden administration policies on immigration, the economy, energy and national security that he blames for inflation, domestic turmoil and war. He also has attacked Casey as out of touch after being in elected office for almost three decades.

Casey, in turn, has attacked McCormick as a carpetbagger from Connecticut's ritzy "" Gold Coast "" who got rich at the expense of others while an executive at a hedge fund there.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking ""greedflation"" -- a blunt term for corporations jacking up prices and ripping off shoppers to maximize profits -- as fast-rising prices opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats.

McCormick, meanwhile, has made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border, speaking to Jewish audiences across the state and arguing that Casey and the Biden administration have not fought antisemitism or backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map. A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

More than $150 million has been spent on the race so far, according to Federal Election Commission records, and the total is on track to exceed $300 million, based on campaign ad tracking by AdImpact, which includes spots reserved between now and Election Day.

The 60-minute debate will air on TV starting at 8 p.m. across Pennsylvania and stream live online. The debate is being hosted by WHTM-TV in Harrisburg.

The candidates have agreed to another debate, to be held at a Philadelphia TV station Oct. 15.

Both Casey and McCormick were uncontested for their party's nominations in the primary election.

Also on the Nov. 5 Senate ballot are John Thomas of the Libertarian Party, Leila Hazou of the Green Party and Marty Selker of the Constitution Party. They were not invited to the debate."
"Figures, Dobson clash in congressional debate",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/alabama-congress-figures-dobson-election-debate-d7450f75e79ae2c3667e08d67c3dac8c,2024-10-02T20:53:24Z,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Congressional hopefuls Shomari Figures and Caroleene Dobson clashed in a debate Wednesday punctuated by policy differences and verbal swipes at each other's resume.

Figures, a Democrat, and Dobson, a Republican are running to represent Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, which was redrawn after a lengthy redistricting battle. The two faced off in Montgomery in a candidate forum hosted by the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce and broadcast online by WSFA.

Dobson attacked Figures, who worked in the Obama White House and as a former top aide to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, over his background in the nation's capital. Figures said his opponent was opting for a ""photo-op"" over meaningful solutions.

Dobson repeatedly called Figures a ""Washington D.C. insider"" and said he was ""part of an administration that for the past four years crushed American opportunity.""

""He wants to continue the policies of the last four years, but you and I should ask ourselves: Are we better off than we were four years ago?"" Dobson said.

Figures, speaking after the forum, said he does not ""run from the fact"" that most of his professional career was spent in Washington. Nonetheless, he said, Alabama is his home. ""The root of it is: This is home for me. This where I was born, where I was raised,"" Figures said.

He added that he is the son of two Alabama legislators and grew up in Mobile.

Dobson has made border security, a cornerstone of her campaign. Figures referred to a campaign trip that Dobson took to the Mexico border to highlight immigration issues as a ""photo-op"" while saying he has been at the border ""as a staffer"" to work on legislation to provide more resources to border agents.

""My opponent mentions the border, but what she fails to mention about the border is that in her early legal career, she spent time in Texas actually selling millions of acres of our border state land in Texas to shadow companies owned by Mexican investors,"" Figures said.

Dobson responded that the transaction involved a Mexican company that was buying office space in Texas as it fled the drug cartel crisis in Mexico. She said Figures was part of the transition team for the Biden administration that ""flung open our borders and has resulted in less safe communities.""

Alabama's 2nd Congressional District was redrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Alabama had likely illegally diluted the influence of Black voters when drawing congressional lines. A three-judge panel selected new lines to give Black residents¸ who now make up nearly 49% of the district's voting-age population, an ""opportunity"" to elect a candidate of their choice.

The open seat has sparked a heated race for the district that could help decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Some of the sharpest policy contrasts were over abortion and healthcare.

""I do not believe it is the government's role to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body. I think it's pretty simple. If you don't believe in abortion, if you don't want an abortion, don't have one,"" Figures said.

Dobson described herself as ""pro-life"" but said the issue should be left to the states.

""This is an issue that's best left to state legislatures to decide with compassion and common sense,"" Dobson said.

Dobson said she supports exemptions to abortion bans for rape, incest and for a pregnant woman's health. Alabama's abortion ban does not have exemptions for rape and incest.

Both candidates spoke of the need to address infrastructure and healthcare challenges in the district.

Figures said four rural hospitals have closed in the district since the campaign began, and life expectancy in Alabama lags most of the nation. Figures urged Alabama to expand its Medicaid program to cover more low-income people who he said are often working jobs but don't have access to health insurance. He said he would support legislation that would renew financial incentives to holdout states to expand their programs. Alabama is one of 10 states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

""In the state of Alabama, you are just barely expected to live past your 60s, your 60s. That is unacceptable, and for too many people. That is because of lack of health care earlier in life,"" Figures said.

Dobson said she would encourage state officials to ""examine"" the issue of Medicaid expansion but said that inflation is helping to drive healthcare costs.

""We also have to recognize that the best insurance is the one that you get through your job. So, we need to create more jobs to allow people to have private insurance that is going to pay those reimbursements to keep our rural hospitals open,"" Dobson said.

The two candidates will meet again on Oct. 10 in an online debate hosted by al.com."
"Tokyo shares fall, Hong Kong's advance as tensions escalate in the Middle East",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-strike-iran-3c147dc46c6ef60cd1e16dd099c4be3e,2024-10-02T04:25:08Z,"Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, with Tokyo's benchmark falling while Hong Kong's advanced despite the sharp escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

Oil prices extended gains after Iran fired dozens of missiles into Israel, potentially raising the risk of disruptions to supplies. That news overshadowed an upbeat report showing U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience.

But regional trading was thin, with mainland Chinese markets closed for a weeklong national holiday.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 lost 1.7% to 37,993.18. It has retreated since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party chose Shigeru Ishiba to lead the government, replacing Fumio Kishida, who stepped aside on Tuesday. A weaker Japanese yen and higher energy prices would add to Ishiba's burdens as he works to pep up the economy.

The dollar was trading at 143.82 yen, up from 143.57 yen late Tuesday.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.3% to 21,615.87, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent moves by Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy with policies aimed at reviving the ailing property sector and supporting financial markets.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was flat at 8,208.50 and the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.5% to 2,579.63.

On Tuesday, U.S. stocks retreated from their records, with the S&P 500 dropping 0.9% to 5,708.75. The Dow dropped 0.4% to 42,156.97, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5% to 17,910.36.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran's missile attack a ""significant escalation,"" although he said it was ultimately ""defeated and ineffective.""

Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and the potential for a wider conflict could affect other, neighboring producers of crude. The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose as much as 5% before settling 2.4% higher. Brent crude, the international standard, rallied 2.6%.

Early Wednesday, U.S. crude was up $1.15 at $70.98 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.10 to $74.66 per barrel.

On Tuesday, oil-and-gas producers logged some of the market's biggest gains. ConocoPhillips rose 3.9%, and Exxon Mobil climbed 2.3%.

Shares of defense contractors also rallied. Northrop Grumman rose 3%, and RTX added 2.7%. RTX partners with Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to make the ""Iron Dome"" air defense system that Israel's government uses.

Most U.S. shares fell.

The all-time high that the S&P 500 set on Monday was its 43rd of the year so far. Stocks had been jumping on hopes the U.S. economy can continue to grow despite a slowdown in the job market, as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years, and it's indicated it will deliver more cuts through next year.

The dominant question hanging over Wall Street is whether the cuts will ultimately prove to be too little, too late after the Fed earlier kept rates at a two-decade high in hopes of braking on the economy enough to stamp out high inflation.

A discouraging report arrived Tuesday, showing U.S. manufacturing weakened by more in September than economists expected.

Another threat to the economy could lie in a strike by dockworkers at 36 ports across the eastern United States that could snarl supply chains and drive up inflation.

The workers are asking for a labor contract that doesn't allow automation to take their jobs, among other things. Supply chain experts say consumers won't see an immediate impact because most retailers have stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items.

An encouraging update from Europe showed inflation among the 20 countries that use the euro came in below 2% in September, the first time that's happened in more than three years. That could give the European Central Bank leeway to cut interest rates more quickly."
FACT FOCUS: A look at false and misleading claims during the vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-walz-vance-misinformation-fact-check-a3f67b1fdef425038dfac9267861247c,2024-10-02T04:13:45Z,"The vice presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Tuesday engaged in a fast-moving, largely civil debate on a wide range of issues. Here's a look at some false and misleading claims from the debate.

___

VANCE: ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration agreed last year to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets as part of a deal to free five U.S. citizens being held by Iran. But administration officials say not a dollar of that has yet been given to Iran. It was part of a deal negotiated by the Obama administration, before Biden and Harris took office, that could have allowed Iran to access frozen assets in exchange for accepting limits on its nuclear program.

In 2016, Iran said it had received access to more than $100 billion worth of frozen overseas assets following the implementation of a landmark nuclear deal with world powers. The money had been held in banks in China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey since international sanctions were tightened in 2012 over Tehran's nuclear program. Then-Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told Congress that only about $50 billion of the frozen assets would actually be accessible by Iran.

WALZ: ""They were charging $800 before this law went into effect.""

THE FACTS: Walz overstated how much Americans were paying for insulin before a new law capped prices at $35 per month for millions of older Americans on Medicare. A December 2022 study found that people who were on Medicare or enrolled in private insurance paid $452 yearly on average before the new law took effect.

VANCE: ""You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

THE FACTS: Most economists blame a long-term decline in the housing supply for the steady increase in home prices. The number of new homes under construction plunged from an annual pace of 1.4 million in April 2006 to barely above 400,000 in August 2011, and didn't recover to 2006 levels until 2021.

Vance said at least one prominent economic analysis from the Federal Reserve supports his claims that immigrants are pushing up housing costs, but he didn't provide details. He was likely citing a May 2024 blog post by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Kashkari says immigration's long-run effect on inflation is ""unclear,"" but immigrants need a place to live and their arrival has overlapped with higher prices.

There might be upward pressure on home prices in some markets because of immigrants arriving, but most economists say the issue is a lack of supply of homes on the market. Homebuilders say they need the immigrants to build the homes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a September news conference that high mortgage rates mean people aren't listing their homes for sale and there has not been enough supply.

WALZ: ""Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies.""

THE FACTS: That's not true. The conservative initiative calls for the collection of ""accurate and reliable statistical data about abortion, abortion survivors, and abortion-related maternal deaths,"" but not a record of every pregnancy that occurs.

More specifically, Project 2025 proposes that the Department of Health and Human Services require all states to report detailed information about abortions that are performed within their borders, including the total number of abortions, the age and state of residence of the mother, the gestational age of the fetus, the reason for the abortion and the method used to perform the abortion. It suggests that this data be separated into categories such as spontaneous miscarriages, intentional abortions, stillbirths and other medical treatments that result in the death of the fetus, like chemotherapy.

VANCE: ""We've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.""

THE FACTS: That figure is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports more than 10 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through September 2024.

That's arrests, not people. Under pandemic-era asylum restrictions, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.

According to the Department of Homeland Security's latest available estimate, there were approximately 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. as of January 2022, 79% of whom entered prior to January 2010.

VANCE: ""It says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late-term abortion.""

THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents a bill Walz signed into law in 2023, updating language about the care of newborns.

The new language uses the phrase ""an infant who is born alive"" instead of ""a born alive infant as a result of an abortion."" It states that medical personnel are required to ""care for the infant who is born alive"" rather than ""preserve the life and health of the born alive infant.""

Both the current version of the law and the 2015 version that was amended state that ""an infant who is born alive shall be fully recognized as a human person, and accorded immediate protection under the law.""

Infanticide is criminalized in every state, including Minnesota, and the bill does not change that.

VANCE: ""Remember he said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully.""

THE FACTS: It's true that Trump told the crowd gathered near the White House, ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

But Vance ignored the incendiary language Trump used throughout his speech, during which he urged the crowd to march to the Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify President Joe Biden's victory. Trump told the crowd: ""If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."" That's after his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, declared: ""Let's have trial by combat.""

Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-republican-agenda-speaker-johnson-fb0d90c029b5ba595d3ef58b887794b5,2024-10-01T23:34:48Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Mike Johnson laid out on Tuesday a policy agenda should Republicans take the majority next year that extends the tax cuts approved when Donald Trump was president, reduces the size of the federal workforce and gives parents more choice on where they can send their children to school.

Johnson emphasized five main policy points during a speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He talked of extending and building on the Trump tax cuts, confronting China, boosting oil and gas production, expanding school choice and cutting the size and scope of the federal government.

""The survival of the American dream depends upon our victory,"" Johnson said.

The speaker and House Republicans are fighting this election season to hold their narrow House majority, with just a handful of seats to spare. Republicans are hopeful that a Trump victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the election will help propel them to majorities in the House and Senate, which would give them unified control of Washington for the first time since 2018 and the ability to enact a sweeping legislative agenda.

Against the campaign backdrop, Johnson provided a bleak view of the economy under President Joe Biden, though the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, inflation is on the decline and the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards. He spoke to an audience of Wall Street investors, traders and others who have witnessed stock markets reach record highs in recent days.

But Johnson said that as he has traveled the country, he's meeting business owners on the verge of collapse because of high inflation, high taxes and over-regulation. And he said he's met moms and dads who have resorted to donating plasma and setting up crowdfunding pages so that they didn't lose their homes.

""Our incredible people are hanging on right now in spite of so many unprecedented challenges, but many can't afford to do it much longer,"" Johnson said.

The first policy priority he outlined was enhanced tax breaks, citing specifically immediate expensing for research and development costs. He also cited the need for a ""strong"" child tax credit, though he did not provide specific numbers. He said the Republican tax policies would ""respect the dignity of work, and it doesn't pay people more for staying out of the workforce.""

Trump has laid out a series of tax cuts on the campaign trail, such as extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 overhaul, and not taxing tips and Social Security. Outside experts say the tax cuts proposed by Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would cause the debt to rise even faster the pace under current law.

Doing more to confront China and rolling back environmental regulations are a common denominator for Republicans that Johnson embraced in his speech. On education, he said millions of Americans have the opportunity to send their children to a school that best fits their need, and ""Republicans want to expand that choice so that every American has that opportunity.""

Johnson also emphasized cutting the debt by cutting the size of the federal government, saying ""we're going to reduce the size of the federal workforce and root out a long list of non-essential jobs through the federal bureaucracy.""

""It's hard to roll back the entrenched bureaucracy and face the system that has produced the decline. It's a difficult task, but it's a task that can be achieved,"" Johnson said."
Michigan's minimum wage to jump 20% under court ruling,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-minimum-wage-increase-9c9a63a92b2cc29b521a9fa9a7dfc711,2024-10-01T22:46:34Z,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan's current minimum wage will rise 20% by the end of February to $12.48 per hour, officials said Tuesday, the result of a major state Supreme Court decision.

The $10.33 minimum wage will increase to $10.56 on Jan. 1 and then $12.48 on Feb. 21, according to the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. The figure will rise each year and reach $14.97 by February 2028, followed by annual inflation adjustments determined by the state treasurer.

The state released the wage schedule following a summer ruling by the Michigan Supreme Court. The court ruled 4-3 in favor of reinstating major changes to the minimum wage and sick leave law sought by advocates for low-wage workers.

More than 280,000 people signed petitions in favor of the improvements. But instead of putting the issue on the 2018 statewide ballot, the Republican-controlled Legislature approved the changes, then watered them down before a new governor and new members of the Legislature took office. The Supreme Court said the actions were illegal.

In February, the minimum wage for workers who regularly get tips will be 48% of the standard minimum wage, the labor department said. By 2030, the two categories will reach even levels.

Some restaurant and bar workers fear the public won't tip them if they know they're getting a higher base wage. Instead, certain industry workers favor the current Democratic-controlled Legislature changing the law."
Late payments to nonprofits hamper California's fight against homelessness,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/philanthropy-nonprofits-homelessness-general-news-f6209259eb08cbad87ef7b880fafb89d,2024-10-01T16:03:02Z,"California's homeless service providers have a problem: They aren't getting paid on time, and it's making it even harder for them to get people off the street.

Nonprofits that provide everything from shelter beds, to counseling for homeless residents, to affordable housing, say they regularly are kept waiting weeks, if not months, for the city, county and state funding they rely on. That means they're struggling to pay their employees, make rent payments for their clients, and, in some cases, even keep the lights on. Some are turning down new projects despite the massive need for services in their communities. Others are borrowing to stay afloat, ending up paying tens of thousands of dollars each month in interest -- money they would rather spend on helping homeless Californians. It's hampering the state's efforts to solve what is arguably its biggest problem: Nearly 186,000 people have nowhere to call home.

""It is the single biggest factor in our inability to grow and serve more people,"" said Vivian Wan, CEO of Abode Services, which provides shelter, housing and other aid for unhoused people across seven Bay Area counties. ""This is a huge issue.""

And it's getting harder to ignore. With inflation driving up expenses and the growing homelessness crisis driving up need, some nonprofits have reached their breaking point. After a group of Los Angeles-based homeless service providers raised the alarm earlier this year, the county Board of Supervisors overhauled the way it doles out funds. Providers hope the move will be replicated throughout the state.

Why are nonprofits missing millions of dollars?

It's the kind of problem that's a hallmark of bureaucracy.

When a city opens a new shelter or housing program, it lacks the capacity to run the program itself, so it contracts with a nonprofit that has expertise working with unhoused clients. The nonprofits who provide these services told CalMatters that because city officials are trying to move quickly, they sometimes set up the program and start providing services immediately -- even before a formal contract is signed. The nonprofit can't get reimbursed for the services it's already provided until that contract is finalized, which can take months.

But even when a contract is drawn up right away, it generally requires the nonprofit to start work before getting paid, and then send an invoice to the city asking for reimbursement. That process can get bogged down in delays at multiple levels.

First, drafting invoices is onerous and time-consuming, requiring the nonprofit to account for every penny spent. Next, the city or county has to go over each invoice with a fine-tooth comb, which can take weeks or months. Finding any problems means the process starts over.

Delays also crop up when the city is waiting for state funding to pay its contracts.

Santa Cruz County usually pays its invoices within two to four weeks, said Robert Ratner, director of Housing for Health for the county. But if there's a problem with the invoice, payment could be delayed another month.

""I think everyone involved would like it to go faster,"" he said.

On any given day, Abode generally is owed between $35 million and $40 million from their various government contracts, Wan said. Despite those missing funds, Abode still has to make rent payments on the first of every month for its thousands of clients living in subsidized housing.

""We're not going to let people become homeless or not get their rent paid,"" Wan said.

Instead, she's turning down new projects that would make the organization's funding gap worse -- to the detriment of the people in desperate need of Abode's services. She recently decided not to apply for a contract providing rental assistance on behalf of the Santa Clara County Probation Department, even though Abode is one of the few organizations that could do the work.

Multiple nonprofits CalMatters spoke with said they've had to take out high-interest loans to fill the gaps while they're waiting for government funds. The People Concern, which provides homeless services in Los Angeles County, is paying $63,000 a month in interest on its lines of credit. The nonprofit will never get that money back, even when its government checks come in.

""That's $63,000 a month we should just be burning, because we can't be compensated for it,"" said CEO John Maceri.

Funding delays also are hampering Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' signature effort to get Angelenos off the streets. Through the program dubbed Inside Safe, the city contracts with nonprofits to move people from encampments into hotels.

PATH was one of the nonprofits that jumped at the chance to participate, back when the program first launched in 2022. But lately, CEO Jennifer Hark Dietz is more wary. As of last month, the city owed her organization close to $7 million for its work on Inside Safe. The city, under recent pressure from local nonprofits to speed up its reimbursements, paid off some of that last week. But it still owes PATH $1.18 million for work done in June, Dietz said.

Now, to avoid over-extending her organization, she's having to make hard choices. She's started refusing when the city asks her to take on new Inside Safe locations before a contract is in place.

""It's definitely for me, personally, heartbreaking,"" she said.

Mayor Bass knows there's a problem, and says her office is working on a solution with the city council, but she hasn't provided details on what that solution will look like or when it will roll out. The situation came to a head in May, when the city owed $26 million on its homeless services contracts. In September, the mayor said that money has been paid and all Inside Safe invoices for the first quarter of the fiscal year have been processed.

""We must transform the City's entire approach to payment -- going beyond the payments for service providers -- to overhaul and modernize the entire system,"" Bass said in an emailed statement.

Los Angeles County recently tried to do just that. Now, the county offers nonprofits advances on some of their contracts upfront, so they don't have to do work without first getting paid.

""It's new,"" Paul Rubenstein, deputy chief external relations officer for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, said of the overhaul. ""But it feels like it's working.""

Sometimes, the state government is to blame for these delays. In April, Gov. Gavin Newsom awarded his latest round of grants through the Encampment Resolution Fund, a program that doles out state money to help cities and counties clear encampments and move camp occupants indoors. Marin County, which won an $18 million grant, was told to expect the contract in July, said Gary Naja-Riese, director of the county's Whole Person Care and Homelessness Division. Instead, the document kept getting delayed, and now it's been five months and no one has yet to see a penny. The state finally sent out the contracts last month, but it's unclear when the money will come through.

That's created a big headache in Santa Barbara County. The county won a nearly $8 million grant to clear 21 vehicle encampments, and it contracted with nonprofit New Beginnings to do the work of connecting with people living in cars and RVs, offering them services and moving them into housing. New Beginnings got straight to work as soon as its contract with the county was signed in June, and so far has moved at least 23 people into shelter and another six into permanent housing. They couldn't afford to wait: the grant has a strict timeline, requiring recipients to spend half the money by June 30, 2025, or risk losing it.

But New Beginnings has yet to be paid for that work. The nonprofit has had to borrow money -- $350,000 so far, at a 9.5% interest rate -- to make ends meet in the meantime, said Executive Director Kristine Schwarz. She's worried borrowing too much more will plunge her organization into a hole it can't get out of. So she's pulling back on the services she offers. That means she's leaving people on the street because she can't afford a hotel room for them, she said.

""I can't just continue to spend money without any idea of when we're going to get reimbursed,"" Schwarz said.

The delay at the state level is at least partly because the California Department of Housing and Community Development took over the grants from another state agency this year.

""The ERF Round 3, Window 1 standard agreements were somewhat impacted by the transition and additional accountability considerations, but that should not be an issue going forward,"" Megan Kirkeby, deputy director of housing policy development for the Department of Housing and Community Development, said in an email to CalMatters. Cities and counties will be reimbursed for money they spent before the contracts were signed, she said.

Funding delays are an especially dire problem for small nonprofits. Kalain Hadley's organization Reclaim-Possibility provides 44 beds in Los Angeles for men recently released from jail and prison. Hadley opened right before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and because he had no clients and therefore no income, had to burn through his savings and go into debt to keep the organization afloat.

Now, his payments come from the state and Los Angeles County, through two contractors that act as intermediaries. They're usually at least a few days late, Hadley said. That might not be a big deal for a larger nonprofit, but for an organization like his that has no cushion, it's devastating.

""I'm running around trying to withdraw cash so I'll be able to pay my folks over the weekend. And that's the pattern every month,"" he said. ""I need my money when it's due.""

To stay afloat, Hadley is taking advantage of a new lifeline in Los Angeles County. Nonprofit Future Communities Institute recently launched a program called the LA Working Capital Fund to give no-interest bridge loans to homeless service nonprofits waiting for government funding. So far, Hadley has taken out four loans ranging from $15,000 to $20,000 - all of which he's paid back.

Future Communities Institute hopes to raise money to scale up the program and offer more loans, said Justin Szlasa, director of homeless initiatives.

Without that money, Hadley's nonprofit might have shut down by now, he said. But even so, the loans aren't a solution to the overarching problem -- they're just a Band-Aid.

""Somebody needs to figure out why we can't get paid on time,"" Hadley said.

Marketing plans are key for small businesses ahead of a tough holiday shopping season,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/small-business-holiday-shopping-marketing-4162ba863014fcd3ad456a983312a61a,2024-10-01T15:42:57Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- The holidays are the busiest time of year for many small retailers and other businesses.

But the holidays this year could be particularly challenging. Although inflation has retreated, small businesses are still dealing with high costs and consumers have been tightening the purse strings, too. And a longshoreman strike that kicked off Tuesday could cause shipping delays that could put a major wrench in retailers' plans if it isn't resolved quickly.

Stepping up marketing is one way to bolster holiday results. In a survey by email marketing firm Constant Contact, 51% of small business owners said they believe social media marketing and email marketing have the biggest impact on their holiday goals.

Kristen Tarnol owns Emerald Forest Gifts in Studio City, California. The shop has been open for 37 years, so Tarnol has a significant number of returning customers each year. But marketing is still key, she said.

""I have to continue to bring in new clients as well so we'll use both email and social,"" she said. ""Also, I plan to try some events this year in the shop to raise everyone's festive energy.""

The top three things small business owners say they're doing to have a successful holiday season are improving their efficiency (35%), offering special promotions or discounts (28%) and creating an end-of-year marketing strategy (26%). Starting early is key.

""Small businesses are incredibly resilient, but as they head into a holiday season filled with uncertainty, they must get proactive in their marketing to ensure success,"" said Sarah Jordan, chief marketing officer at Constant Contact. ""The (small businesses) who thrive will be the ones who start their holiday marketing early, streamline their work with automations, and engage customers consistently throughout the season.""

Another quirk of the season: Hannukah doesn't start until Dec. 25 this year, so that will stretch out the season. Tarnol of Emerald City Gifts plans to start her marketing Nov. 1, so that means more than two months of holiday marketing.

""Usually, we are recovering between Christmas and New Years, but this year, we will be going, going, going, until after Jan. 2,"" she said.

Constant Contact polled owners of more than 1,600 small businesses with 250 employees or less in August in the U.S., U.K., Australia and the United Kingdom."
US job openings rise to 8 million as labor market remains sturdy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/job-openings-economy-unemployment-inflation-federal-reserve-4f4122a0601c7622a53de1625d63f51f,2024-10-01T14:16:35Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience.

The Labor Department reported Tuesday that employers posted 8 million vacancies in August, up from 7.7 million in July. Economists had expected openings to be virtually unchanged.

Layoffs fell in August. But the number of Americans quitting their jobs -- a sign of confidence in the labor market -- slid in August.

Job openings have come down steadily since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022, but they remain above where they stood before the coronavirus pandemic hit the American economy in early 2020. When the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, companies scrambled to find enough workers to keep up with customer orders.

The overheating economy caused an outburst of inflation, and the Federal Reserve responded by raising its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has come down -- from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.5% in August.

The economy proved surprisingly resilient in the face of the Fed hikes, averting a widely forecast recession. But the job market has gradually lost momentum. Hiring averaged just 116,000 net new jobs a month from June through August -- the weakest three-month average since mid-2020.

When the Labor Department releases its jobs report for September on Friday, it is expected to show that employers added 143,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate remained at a low 4.2%, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.

The Fed, satisfied with the progress against inflation and worried about the cooling job market, last month cut its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, the central bank's first and biggest rate cut since March 2020."
Port strikes extend a new era of American labor activism,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/port-strike-dockworkers-boeing-0d5333299539255be379ab58d836dbd3,2024-10-01T12:09:59Z,"The U.S. dockworkers who went on strike early Tuesday are just the latest unionized group to back their demands for better contracts by walking off the job to illustrate their value to both the national economy, and their employers' bottom line.

Unions representing auto workers, actors, hotel housekeepers and aircraft assembly workers all called strikes as organized labor made itself heard over the past year. Members argued they made the sacrifices their companies asked of them during the pandemic and rough economic patches, and now it's time to catch up, particularly after several years of heightened inflation.

Between 2022 and 2023, the number of work stoppages rose 9% to 466 strikes and four lockouts, according to figures maintained by Cornell University's IRL School. However, the number of workers involved in work stoppages, approximately 539,000, was more than double than the previous year, according to the school's research.

A database maintained by Cornell and the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recorded 250 strikes and other labor actions in 2024 as of Monday.

Here's a look at some recent showdowns between companies and organized labor

Dockworkers at 36 ports from Maine to Texas hit picket lines early Tuesday, the first strike for them in decades, over wages and automation even though progress had been reported in contract talks. The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association expired at midnight.

The alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The alliance also said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options. In a statement early Tuesday, the union said it rejected the alliance's latest proposal because it ""fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation."" The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June.

Workers at the Port of Philadelphia walked in a circle outside the port and chanted ""No work without a fair contract."" The union, striking for the first time since 1977, had message boards on the side of a truck reading: ""Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.""

If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season -- potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys and artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.

Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job at Boeing factories near Seattle and elsewhere on Sept. 12 after union members voted overwhelmingly to reject a proposed contract and go on strike. Boeing and negotiators from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers have held three bargaining sessions alongside federal mediators. The company presented a revised contract last week, but the union refused to present it for a vote after surveying its members, who said it failed to meet their wage and pension demands.

Earlier this month video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers' union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.

The performers had been striking for over a month.

Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.

The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around ""exploitative uses"" of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.

Last month, thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts, a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.

The Culinary Workers Union announced on the social platform X that the deal came together after a year of negotiations. It covers over 4,000 hotel and casino workers, from housekeepers and cocktail servers to bartenders and porters.

Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson, said the deal mirrors the major wins secured in recent contracts awarded to 40,000 hospitality workers at 18 Strip properties owned or operated by casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.

Those wins included a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.

The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.

More than 10,000 workers at 25 hotels across the U.S. staged a Labor Day weekend strike to amplify their demands for higher pay, fairer workloads and the reversal of COVID-era cuts. The majority of the striking housekeepers and other hospitality workers represented by the UNITE HERE union stayed off the job for a few days. On Sept. 24, about 2,000 unionized workers at Hawaii's largest resort, the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort, joined another couple thousand hotel workers who remained on strike at Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott hotels in Honolulu, San Diego and San Francisco, according to the union.

Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.

The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser's facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.

The lead up to the agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.

The agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.

Late last year, the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly ratified new contracts with Ford and Stellantis, along with a similar deal with General Motors, that would raise pay across the industry and force automakers to absorb higher costs.

The agreements, which run through April 2028, ended contentious talks that began in the summer of 2022 and led to six-week-long strikes at all three automakers.

The new contract agreements were widely seen as a victory for the UAW, though Ford's top executive said the company will rethink where it will build cars in the future. The companies agreed to dramatically raise pay for top-scale assembly plant workers, with increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into 33% wage gains.

Top assembly plant workers were to receive immediate 11% raises and would earn roughly $42 an hour when the contracts expire in April of 2028.

Under the agreements, the automakers also ended many of the multiple tiers of wages they had used to pay different workers. They also agreed in principle to bring new electric-vehicle battery plants into the national union contract.

UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year before hitting the picket lines as they had vowed to do. The run up to the approval was not smooth though, with contentious labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.

After negotiations broke down in early July 2023, Atlanta company reached a tentative contract agreement with the Teamsters just days before an Aug. 1 deadline.

At the time the agreement was struck, full- and part-time union workers were set to get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more in total by the end of the five-year contract. Starting hourly pay for part-time employees also got bumped up to $21, but some workers said that fell short of their expectations.

UPS said at the time that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver would make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. It was not clear how much of that figure benefits accounted for.

As part of the deal, the delivery company also agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a full holiday, end forced overtime on drivers' days off and stop using driver-facing cameras in cabs, among a host of other issues. It eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers and tentative deals on safety issues were also reached, including equipping more trucks with air conditioning.

Hollywood's actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.

Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.

Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.

The agreement also included a hard-won provision that temporarily derailed talks: the creation of a fund to pay performers for future viewings of their work on streaming services, in addition to traditional residuals paid for the showing of movies or series."
Nigeria's independence anniversary is marked by protests and frustration over economic hardship,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-independence-protests-tinubu-d321d54a7750e82b4391c27b28db68f2,2024-10-01T11:39:49Z,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigerians on Tuesday staged protests against economic hardship as the West African nation marked its 64th independence anniversary with its president calling for patience. Police fired tear gas to disperse some of the protesters, resulting in clashes.

Dozens of people in a few states waved placards and the green-and-white national flag, demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people, in a country that has some of the world's highest poverty and hunger levels despite being a top oil producer on the continent.

It was the second protest in two months in Africa's most populous country amid worsening hardship caused by government reforms introduced to save money and shore up dwindling foreign investments. During the last protest in August, at least 20 protesters were shot dead and hundreds of others were arrested.

The government has defended the reforms even though they have helped push the inflation rate to a 28-year high and the local naira currency to record lows against the dollar.

In the capital city of Abuja where government officials and the military attended an independence anniversary parade, some protesters in another part of the city were dispersed with tear gas.

There was a heavy security presence along major roads in other cities, including in the economic hub of Lagos, where some protesters were killed during demonstrations against police brutality in 2020.

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who has been in office since May last year after an election campaign forged on ""renewed hope,"" defended the reforms as necessary and said they were already yielding results, such as $30 billion in foreign direct investments attracted in the last year.

""Once again, I plead for your patience as the reforms we are implementing show positive signs, and we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,"" Tinubu said in a broadcast.

Tinubu announced a national youth conference whose recommendations on key national issues will be considered and implemented.

The protests were gaining momentum on social media as many people complained of their struggles to find jobs or not having enough food to eat.

Nigeria remains ""an unfortunate case of running very hard and staying in the same place,"" said Cheta Nwanze, managing partner at Lagos-based SBM Intelligence research firm.

Nigeria continues to perform poorly in key areas like education and health, he said.

""If your population is not healthy ... or not educated, you can't possibly make progress,"" Nwanze added."
Dockworkers go on a strike that could reignite inflation and cause shortages in the holiday season,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/dockworkers-strike-ports-ila-longshoremen-91703e4798dbc9ee82185e983f31a3f6,2024-10-01T10:47:03Z,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A strike by dockworkers at 36 ports from Maine to Texas, the first in decades, could snarl supply chains and lead to shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks.

Workers began walking picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation even though progress had been reported in contract talks. The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association expired at midnight.

The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and could become a factor if there are shortages.

Workers at the Port of Philadelphia walked in a circle outside the port and chanted ""No work without a fair contract."" The union, striking for the first time since 1977, had message boards on the side of a truck reading: ""Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.""

Local ILA president Boise Butler said workers want a fair contract that doesn't allow automation of their jobs.

Shipping companies made billions during the pandemic by charging high prices, he said. ""Now we want them to pay back. They're going to pay back,"" Butler said.

He said the union will strike for as long as it needs to get a fair deal, and it has leverage over the companies.

""This is not something that you start and you stop,"" he said. ""We're not weak,"" he added, pointing to the union's importance to the nation's economy.

At Port Houston, at least 50 workers started picketing around midnight local time carrying signs saying ""No Work Without a Fair Contract.""

The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers. But no deal was reached.

The union's opening offer in the talks was for a 77% pay raise over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying it's necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.

Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The alliance also said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options.

The union wants a complete ban on automation. It wasn't clear just how far apart both sides are.

In a statement early Tuesday, the union said it rejected the alliance's latest proposal because it ""fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation."" The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June.

Supply chain experts say consumers won't see an immediate impact from the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items.

But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage could lead to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses.

If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season -- potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys and artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.

The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation's supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.

It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight from the West Coast, but analysts say they can't move enough to make up for the closed Eastern ports.

J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume.

Retailers, auto parts suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off period.

But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has worked to court union votes for Democrats, said ""no"" when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage.

A White House official said Monday that at Biden's direction, the administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward.

Inflation in Europe falls below 2% and opens the way for faster rate cuts,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/europe-inflation-ecb-economy-847e2d9d7ed449fb347cac18682dcc1a,2024-10-01T09:20:10Z,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 1.8% in September, below the European Central Bank's target of 2% for the first time in more than three years as falling energy prices give consumers relief from a burst of inflation that at one point reached into double digits.

Tuesday's official figure coupled with an anemic growth outlook could pave the way for faster interest rate cuts from the ECB, which has already trimmed rates twice.

Inflation fell from 2.2% in August, according to European Union statistics agency Eurostat. The last time inflation hit the ECB's 2% goal was in June, 2021 when it was 1.9%.

Economists have started to consider the possibility of a rate cut at the bank's Oct. 17 meeting. A few weeks ago, the expectations were that the central bank would wait until December before lowering borrowing costs again for consumers and businesses.

The bank must juggle the need to make sure inflation is under control, which would mean waiting longer to lower rates, against concerns over slow economic growth, which would argue for swifter cuts.

Higher central bank interest rate benchmarks combat inflation by raising rates throughout the economy, making it more expensive to borrow and spend. That reduces demand for goods and pressure on prices. But that also slows economic activity.

The ECB, U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks rapidly raised rates to combat a burst of inflation that broke out as the economy rebounded from the pandemic, straining supplies of parts and raw materials, and after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The invasion led Russia to cut off natural gas pipeline supplies to Europe, spiking energy prices there and raising fears that Russia oil would be lost to the global market. Those strains have largely eased and inflation is low enough that central banks are cautiously trimming rates to keep the economy chugging.

The ECB might not be able declare final victory over inflation quite yet. Economists expect inflation to tick slightly higher before the end of this year, and some underlying measures of inflation such as services prices are still high enough to instill caution. Bank President Christine Lagarde has said the bank is not committing to a future rate cut schedule but will take decisions meeting to meeting based on incoming economic data."
"Asian markets mixed, Japanese stocks rally from Monday's slump",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-japan-fed-6b846be540b1ede94c2a2cb8410e6f15,2024-10-01T06:02:38Z,"HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index regaining some of its sharp losses from a day earlier.

A quarterly ""tankan"" survey by the Bank of Japan showed business confidence among large manufacturers remained steady at 13, indicating an improved outlook for business conditions. A positive number indicates that more companies maintain an optimistic outlook on business conditions than those who feel pessimistic.

The survey is closely monitored for clues about the impact of the Bank of Japan's interest rate decisions, especially after the central bank ended negative rates in March and raised its short-term rate to 0.25% in July.

Japan also reported that its unemployment rate for August fell to 2.5% from 2.7% in July, in line with market expectations.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rallied 1.5% in early Tuesday to 38,476.33, as the yen weakened. The dollar is trading at 144.00 yen, up from 143.62 yen.

On Monday, the Nikkei tumbled nearly 5% as markets reacted to the selection of Shigeru Ishiba to be Japan's next prime minister. Ishiba was due to take office Tuesday following the resignation of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

Ishiba, an expert on defense and on domestic economic issues, was seen as a less favorable choice than some of his rivals in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, partly because he has voiced support for raising interest rates. That caused the Japanese yen to briefly jump in value against the dollar, which would hurt profits of large export manufacturers.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped nearly 0.7% to 8,214.80 after the data showed that retail sales in August rose 3.1% from the same period last year, which is above expectation.

Markets in China and South Korea were shut for holidays. Mainland Chinese markets, which had their best day since 2008 on Monday, will remain closed until Oct. 7 for the National Day break.

On Monday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to reached an all-time high at 5,762.48 and clinched its fifth straight winning month and fourth straight winning quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1% to 42,330.15. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 18,189.17.

Wall Street has catapulted to records on hopes the slowing U.S. economy can keep growing while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to offer it more juice. A big test will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers its latest monthly update on the job market.

An overriding worry on Wall Street is whether the economy may already be heading for a recession. Even though the Fed cut rates earlier this month and has indicated more relief is on the way, U.S. employers have already begun paring back on their hiring. Before this month, the Fed had kept interest rates at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stamp out high inflation.

In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose after investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a hint that coming cuts to interest rates may be more traditional sized.

The Fed began its rate cuts with a larger-than-usual reduction of half a percentage point, and many traders expect the next meeting in November could yield a similar sized reduction. Fed policy makers already had indicated they were planning two more cuts this year of the traditional size of a quarter of a percentage point.

But Powell said again on Monday that rate cuts are not something the Fed needs to work quickly on. After his comments, traders were betting on just a 35% probability the Fed will cut rates by another half a percentage point in November. That's down from a 53% chance seen the day before, according to data from CME Group.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78% from 3.75% late Friday.

In other dealings Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude oil added 10 cents to $68.27 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 15 cents at $71.85 per barrel."
Japan's central bank survey underpins optimism about growth,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-tankan-boj-inflation-growth-89fdbf4112aa7118b095bf2bb71ddfd5,2024-10-01T01:48:04Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- Business sentiment among Japan's large manufacturers stood unchanged in the latest quarter from the previous quarter, according to a closely watched survey called ""tankan"" released Tuesday.

The Bank of Japan survey put the benchmark index at plus-13 for the July-September quarter, the same from the previous survey conducted for April-June.

A positive number means more companies said they were optimistic about business conditions than those feeling pessimistic.

The index for large nonmanufacturers stood at plus-34, up from plus-33 the previous quarter.

The results were in line with analyst forecasts.

Japan's economic growth is thought to be on relatively solid ground, managing to grow despite pressures from a declining workforce, a weakening currency and deflationary pressures that previously dragged on for years.

But recent data show average wages are holding up or in some sectors rising, adding to market optimism. Tourism, which brings in foreign revenue, is booming, now that restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic were lifted.

The tankan is among the data being closely watched to show what the central bank might do on interest rates. The Bank of Japan ended negative interest rates in March and in July raised its short-term policy rate to 0.25%.

The Bank of Japan hopes to continue to raise rates if conditions appear to back the view that its 2% inflation target is being maintained.

The latest tankan showed that Japan's companies expect consumer prices to rise 2.4% a year from now, the same rate as they said in the survey three months ago.

Japan's economy, the world's fourth largest, grew at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to government data, as wage growth and consumer spending kept growth going, despite risks from slowdowns in the Chinese and U.S. economies.

Political change is also a factor. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida resigned in a planned move Tuesday before his likely successor Shigeru Ishiba takes office later in the day. Major economic policy changes are not expected, however."
"Live music, breakfast and a raffle: Mexico's president makes the most of his final day in office",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-lopez-obrador-23a4d11e77441fb4b132370b81d9ec52,2024-10-01T00:27:16Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador turned his final morning briefing Monday into a variety show featuring live music, breakfast and a raffle to gift his watch to a journalist.

""I dedicated myself to serve the people,"" the 70-year-old leader said. ""I leave very satisfied to have the affection of many Mexicans.""

Outside the National Palace, hundreds of boisterous supporters of the folksy populist showered him with love while mariachis gave a brassy serenade.

Despite having historically high approval ratings and majorities in Congress, López Obrador never proposed changing the constitution to open the possibility of a second six-year term as other Latin American leaders have. He did, however, push through sweeping constitutional changes for the judiciary and the country's National Guard in his final days.

Monday was his 1,438th morning briefing, a radical change he brought to the presidency after years of less accessible leaders. His briefings, known as ""las mañaneras,"" set the day's agenda and gave journalists the opportunity to ask questions, though López Obrador addressed what he wanted -- and ignored what he didn't.

On Monday, he talked about his achievements -- as he has for the past six years -- noting that today someone earning the minimum wage can buy twice as many kilograms of tortillas and eggs as they could before because he raised that wage and beat back inflation.

After the briefing, some reporters -- who became regular fixtures at the ""mañaneras"" and didn't hide their support for López Obrador, gave interviews to other journalists. Some shouted that they wanted to give the president parting gifts or take a final selfie with him. The reporter who won the president's watch leaped euphorically from his seat when his name was called.

After Tuesday's inauguration, as he has promised many times, López Obrador will retire to his ranch in the southern state of Chiapas and leave public life."

""We're diversified here,"" laughed dairy farmer Tom Oberhaus in an interview with Fox News Digital.

He explained that he and his wife are conservative Republicans who have been sure of who they were supporting in the 2024 election for a long time.

""There's no question in our mind that our four years under Trump management was much better than the three and a half years under Biden management - or whoever is, you know, that's the great mystery is, who is actually running the government right now?"" he asked.

They previously voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

One issue he has with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee, is that she vouched for President Biden's cognitive ability.

""It bothers the heck out of me that we're thinking about electing a person that just six weeks ago... told us 'Oh, Biden's on top of it. He's really aggressive and really knows what he's doing,'"" Oberhaus said.

""We all seen that in the debate, you know, he's past his time,"" he said of Biden's June debate with former President Trump that preceded his campaign suspension.

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT

Critics have claimed Trump is bad for farmers, pointing to his fondness for tariffs and his past trade conflict with China. But Oberhaus said the tariffs, which ramped up in 2018, ""certainly didn't hurt us.""

""We're much better off with tariffs than having that government printing press printing out money,"" he added.

At Cozy Nook Farm, Oberhaus said their biggest struggle has been inflation. ""We've been [eaten] alive by inflation,"" he claimed.

He explained that they do not set their own prices, and they tend to ""run a couple of years behind everybody else.""

They're now paying ""twice as much for tires and fuel and feed and everything else."" However, ""our milk price stays the same, until just now in the last month that it finally came up.""

He also stressed illegal immigration as a top issue for him, even hundreds of miles from the southern border. But the problem is surfacing even as far north as Wisconsin, he explained.

""Little town of Whitewater 35 minutes away,"" he said. ""It's a town of, what, 15,000 people? And then they got a thousand new immigrants.""

Local Wisconsin outlets reported that last year Whitewater Police Chief Daniel Meyer and City Manager John Weidl penned a letter to Biden, asking for help after the ""rapid increase"" of about 800 to 1,000 immigrants since 2022.

""As a municipal government, our focus is not on legal status, but rather ensuring we are providing the resources expected of a municipality to all residents of the City. Unfortunately, we are increasingly finding it difficult to do that,"" the letter reportedly read.

""How do you handle that?"" asked Oberhaus.

As for those who argue that with strict immigration enforcement there would result in fewer people to work on farms, he called it ""baloney.""

On Trump, who recently ventured into Wisconsin's biggest Democratic enclaves in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the farmer said, ""I think that's the sign of a leader - that you're not afraid to go into the other camp and tell them what your ideas are."""

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
Wisconsin Senate race shifts to 'toss up' by handicapper as Tammy Baldwin fights for re-election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-senate-race-shifts-toss-up-handicapper-tammy-baldwin-fights-re-election,2024-10-08T14:09:54Z,"Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Andrew Iverson emphasized the ground game strategy in the battleground that includes turning out Republican voters in deep blue areas.

A top political handicapper shifted its rating for the Wisconsin Senate race on Tuesday to ""Toss Up"" with less than a month until election day.

The race in Wisconsin, a pivotal battleground state in both the presidential and Senate matches, was most recently considered ""Lean Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report.

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT

The handicapper cited changes in polling in recent days, with Hovde appearing to close the gap with Baldwin. But Cook also referred to private polling from both campaigns, which it said each showed the race within the margins of error.

A source familiar confirmed to Fox News Digital that Baldwin's internal polling shows such a race.

VULNERABLE DEM JON TESTER TURNS ON BIDEN ADMIN OVER DEI AFTER MONTANA UNIVERSITIES STRIPPED OF FEDERAL FUNDS

In response to the rating shift, Hovde spokesman Zach Bannon said, ""Sen. Baldwin's radical agenda has sparked record high inflation, created chaos [at] the southern border, and made our communities less safe. Eric Hovde is going to win because the people of Wisconsin are ready for change.""

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

""After 25 years in Washington, Tammy Baldwin has become the typical D.C. politician, voting in lock-step with the failed Biden agenda and hiding her Wall Street partner's stock trades from her constituents. Wisconsinites are ready for change, and Eric Hovde has the momentum,"" said National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesman Tate Mitchell in a statement.

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

The latest Marquette Law School poll showed Baldwin winning the battle, 51% to Hovde's 45%. The survey interviewed 882 registered voters over Sept. 18-26. The poll's margin of error was +/-4.4 percentage points.

With Cook's ratings change, Wisconsin joins other ""Toss Up"" Senate races in Ohio and Michigan."
Lake rips Biden-Harris 'double whammy' policies affecting Arizonans : 'Driven us over the cliff',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lake-rips-biden-harris-double-whammy-policies-affecting-arizonans-driven-us-over-the-cliff,2024-10-07T10:21:22Z,"PHOENIX, Ariz. - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake told Fox News Digital that illegal immigration has disproportionately hammered residents of her state which she says has created a ""double whammy"" that will result in GOP wins in the state in November.

""I think most Americans think that they have driven us right over the edge, over the cliff,"" Lake told Fox News Digital about the policies of the Biden-Harris administration. ""And we're hoping that we can pull this back come November and that's what we plan to do. But our polling shows that the economy is really affecting everybody. The border is affecting everybody.""

Lake explained to Fox News Digital that the current administration's border policies have disproportionately hurt Arizona particularly when it comes to housing costs.

""It's basic supply and demand,"" Lake said. ""21 million people coming in, even if you take the estimate that Joe Biden and Kamala are giving, which is 10 million, they've got to live somewhere. They're living in homes and apartments and hotels and these are taking away housing opportunities for Americans and also jacking up the prices as well. Because right now, when you have a very limited supply of housing, which we do, we have not built enough homes and apartments in the past 20 years to keep up with the demand. So now all of a sudden, you add 21 million people, you've got a supply and demand issue. You got you don't have enough supply and you have a lot of demand.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

Lake continued, ""We know that these people that are pouring across our country illegally, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are bringing in hand-holding and saying, yes, please come in and we will supply you housing, federally subsidized housing, which means you and I are paying for it. And we will give you an ID card with thousands of dollars a month to pay for your food. They don't have living expenses like the American people do. The American people are barely getting by because living expenses have gone up so they can then afford to take these jobs making less than the going rate, which takes Americans salaries and hourly wages and depresses them or pushes them down. So it's a double whammy and it's really affecting Arizona particularly hard.""

On inflation, Lake pointed to data showing that Phoenix was at one point the hardest hit city in the country.

""I talk to more Arizonans than anybody in the whole country,"" Lake told Fox News Digital. ""I have a better relationship with the people of Arizona, I think, than anybody in the country and they're struggling. You know, it kills me to see families and people who are retiring or retirees, Arizona used to be an affordable state it's not so much anymore, who are telling me now, Kari, I've never had to go to a food bank in my life. As a matter of fact, I used to donate to food banks. Now I'm finding myself there every couple of weeks just to make ends meet. I can't even afford the basics. It breaks my heart because the people of this state are incredible, hard working people.""

FLASHBACK: ARIZONA DEM SENATE CANDIDATE CALLED TRUMP VOTERS 'DUMB': 'WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD'

""They don't deserve this and they don't want to be asking for a handout, but they're working as hard as they ever have. Some of them are doing two jobs and there's not enough hours in the day. They can't work any harder than they already are and they're still not making ends meet. So it's very distressing for the people and it's distressing for me because I really, truly love the people of the state.""

Lake, who is running for Senate against Dem. Rep. Ruben Gallego who she says is responsible for supporting the Harris-Biden immigration and inflation record, told Fox News Digital that she believes Republicans will have success in November as a result of those policies.

""Every main issue that we're facing as a country somehow seems to kind of come right through Arizona and this is why I feel so comfortable that we're going to win this because, well, first of all, we're registering voters left to right,"" Lake said.

""People are saying, yep, we're voting, we're going to become a Republican. People who've never been a Republican before are now registered Republicans...We're calling people who haven't voted in a number of elections, people who maybe skipped the last 4 or 5 elections. I guess they are called low propensity voters and we're asking, are you going to vote? And they're saying, 'Hell, yes, I'm going to vote. Absolutely, I'm going to vote. I'm struggling right now. This is the first election I voted in a number of elections.' But this one really matters. I think it's our last election. If we don't get this right as a free America."""

""JOIN OUR TEAM,"" Musk-founded America PAC reads on its website. ""Email us if you are interested in working on increasing voter registration and voter turnout. Pay starts at $30 per hour, with bonuses for performance.""

Musk endorsed former President Trump earlier this summer as the 45th president seeks to again win the Oval Office. The Tesla founder joined Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening as Trump made a historic return to the town following an assassination attempt that left him bloodied and injured on July 13 during a rally.

""I think it's the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms... They want to take away your right to vote effectively,"" Musk told the crowd on Saturday.

The PAC was officially formed earlier in the summer, with Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings from late last month showing the America PAC has already invested at least $2.4 million in more than a dozen key congressional races. Musk said in July he planned to commit about $45 million a month to the super PAC.

A former North Carolina judge whose church is supporting relief efforts for those affected by Hurricane Helene told Fox News Digital there ""is a resounding faith"" among residents that ""God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this.""

Judge Phil Ginn, a resident of Boone, said the Perkinsville Church in the western North Carolina town is one of several in the region stepping up in the wake of the devastating storm, which has so far left more than 230 dead and caused billions in property damage.

""We're housing people in our church. We've given up all of our Sunday school space to literally house people who are coming to work,"" said Ginn, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. ""And so our church had just seen fit to not only help our neighbors, but to help those who are coming here to help our neighbors by feeding them. We've got a shower trailer set up and washer and dryer to keep their clothes clean.""

Ginn described the storm as a ""generational event"" and said the recovery effort is going to be a ""marathon that's going to last for years."" However, he added that ""it's amazing to me to see God has come to us during the storm.""

""There is a resounding faith among folks that I'm talking to out there that God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this. And so we have that faith to lean into,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital. ""And it is stronger now than it ever was. The bond between us as human beings, as brothers and sisters, has really increased.""

The help seems to be coming more from local people than the federal government, Ginn said.

President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump have each made multiple trips to affected areas, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has committed $110 million in federal aid to Helene victims, the White House said Saturday.

Ginn said people are coming together to help each other regardless of their circumstances or backgrounds.

""Nobody's asking what your politics are. Nobody's asking what your faith is. Nobody's asking if you just got out of prison. There's nothing of that,"" he said. ""It's just if you need help, you're getting it from local people.""

Ginn's seminary, working alongside Samaritan's Purse and the North Carolina Baptist Men's Association, has established the SES Benevolence Fund for Hurricane Helene Relief, which is helping provide food, water, hygiene items, first aid kits and other essentials to those in need across four southeastern states.

""The great problem that we have right now is that virtually all of the damage was caused by water or mud, and none of that is covered by insurance. And so we've got families who were barely edging by with inflation and everything else, and now they've lost everything,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital.

""They've lost all their personal possessions. They can't live in their home. Their property is gone ... so it's going to be a mental health issue, and it's going to be an economic issue as well.

""It will never return to what it was,"" Ginn added. ""We have not only buildings gone and towns gone, but the land on which these buildings are set ... that's gone too. Rivers have changed courses.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

President Joe Biden held the floor for an impromptu Q&A session Friday afternoon during the White House press briefing, where he claimed Vice President Kamala Harris is ""in constant contact."" His comments may not come across as music to the Harris campaign's ears.

In the president's surprise appearance, he remarked on the port strike, the latest jobs numbers, and briefly on Hurricane Helene. No reporters asked about the administration's response to the storm, but one asked Biden to assess whether Harris has been deeply involved in policy.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

The president strongly linked Vice President Harris to the Biden administration's record over the past 3 ½ years, despite the Harris campaign's attempts to distance her from everything from ""Bidenomics"" to inflation to the border crisis, since Biden announced he was ending his reelection campaign, and Harris assumed the mantle of nominee.

Harris recently changed the Biden fiscal year 2025 plan from a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% on a salary of $1M or more to her own 28%, for example. As illegal migration across the border surged to historic levels, Harris has also insisted she was never in charge of Biden's border policy, despite Biden personally handing her the reins at the White House in March 2021.

Axios reported that Harris would begin creating some daylight between herself and Biden in August in order to defeat Trump, as inflation raged, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East heated up, the border crisis continued, crime lingered as a concern, and other factors, including Harris' own weak approval rating, weighed her campaign down. Other outlets and pundits on the left soon followed suit.

But Biden has reportedly bristled about his vice president distancing herself from him behind the scenes. He has also hinted that he believes he could have won the election had he not dropped out.

During an appearance on The View last week, Biden said, ""I never fully believed the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance to my running again. The fact of the matter is, my polling was always in range of beating [Trump]."" Biden even joked about jumping back into the race during Friday's surprise appearance at the White House.

He also began his first White House briefing appearance of his presidency at the same Harris was taking the stage at a campaign event, raising questions over whether it was a communications issue between him and the campaign, or he was trying to upstage her.

Biden sparked questions on the topic before, on the anniversary of September 11, by wearing a Trump hat momentarily. The White House referred it to as a ""unity gesture"" - after Biden spent years casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy.""

The Harris campaign has further distanced itself from the Biden administration by mentioning him less and less often as the election nears. During Tuesday's Vice Presidential Debate, Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, only referred to the sitting president by referencing the ""Biden-Harris administration.""

Trump national security advisors mock Biden's warnings to Israel to stick to 'proportional' Iran response,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-israel-response-iran-trump,2024-10-04T19:26:57Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joined 'Fox & Friends'

A ""painful"" Israeli response weighs over the heads of the Iranian regime after their ballistic missile attacks on Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden has insisted that an angry Israel should not strike Iran's nuclear sites - and should make sure its response is measured - proportional.

""Iran launched a war into Israel,"" said former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel.

""So to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

On Thursday, he revealed that he was ""discussing"" recommending Israel target Iran's energy facilities.

""That put the oil markets into a tailspin, even if we are talking to them about it. It's not something you muse about publicly,"" said former Trump deputy national security advisor Victoria Coates.

""If you've made a decision, and you have something to announce, fine. You want to level with the American people as much as you can. These random comments are really damaging and confusing to the Iranians, because . . . they don't have any guidelines or guardrails about what might be coming and so they might do something weird.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH KHAMEINI DEFENDS MISSILE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL

Israel's counterattack could come at any moment. ""We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.

Rather than its longtime goal of helping to negotiate a ceasefire, the Biden administration has now shifted its priority to containment - helping the region avoid all-out war between its two hegemonic superpowers.

""This is the 1930s all over again. G7 leaders - led by President Biden - are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital.

""The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality,"" he went on. ""Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?""

Former President Donald Trump has not said how Israel should respond to the attacks - which he insists never would have happened under his watch.

Striking Iran's nuclear facilities risks provoking all-out war on yet another front for Israel in the eyes of the Biden administration. The Trump team is caught between an anti-war mindset and a penchant for supporting Israel without conditions. It's unclear whether they still believe the two can exist in harmony.

Proportionality is ""clearly not what Israel is doing,"" according to Coates.

""It really seems to me that after the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] left Washington in July, after that visit, some factor, or combination of factors, really changed his calculus,"" she said.

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""He appears to have gotten home with the attitude of, 'I want to get everything I can get done before the election.' He's not really listening to the White House at all, which is unfortunate.""

After Iranian plots to assassinate him and the hacking of his campaign, Trump did say that if he were president, he would tell Iran, ""I'm going to blow you to smithereens"" if they harm any U.S. political figures.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he wished he had responded more forcefully after Iran fired dozens of missiles at U.S. forces stationed in Iraq in 2020, leaving many with traumatic brain injuries.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean? 'Injured' means -- you mean, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort,"" Trump said.

""So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq,"" Trump continued, saying 'Iraq' instead of 'Iran.' ""When you say not tough, they had no money. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. And when we hit them, they hit us. And they called us, and they said, 'We're going to shoot at your fort, but we're not going to hit it.'""

Defense officials have said more than 100 suffered traumatic brain injuries after the January 2020 attack.

That attack came after Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani due to an uncovered Iranian plot to kill American diplomats and service members.

Trump vowed to hit 52 Iranian sites ""very hard"" if Iran were to carry out the plot, representing the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days after being seized at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979.

Still, in January, Iran lobbed attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, including the Ain al-Assad military base, and a second facility near Erbil airport.

In March, three U.S.-led coalition forces were killed when multiple rockets hit Taji military base.

Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, has insisted to reporters this week that ""nobody [was] ever tougher on Iran"" than he was.

'Look at the World today -- Look at the missiles flying right now in the Middle East, look at what's happening with Russia/Ukraine, look at Inflation destroying the World. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT!' he wrote on Truth Social.

Alexander Vindman, the former Trump National Security Council Director for European Affairs for the United States, claimed that the former president was ""fearful"" of escalation with Iran.

""Iran struck first and early, during Trump's presidency, attacking US troops. Trump consistently recoiled in fear inviting further attacks,"" he wrote on X.

""Fact check: In 2020, Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in retaliation for the Soleimani assassination. 110 U.S. service members sustained traumatic brain injuries. Many administration officials remain on an Iranian hit list today,"" former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

But Patel argued the Biden administration's lifting of sanctions on Iran -- and the Obama administration's 2015 nuclear deal -- is what led to the attacks in the first place.

""The JCPOA, which was called the 'Iran nuclear deal' for a reason. It was never intended to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It literally gave them one on a timeline,"" he said.

""Now I believe they have one, because for four years they haven't stopped them or slowed them down. They've only been successful in politicizing national security."""
"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

""I think one of the bigger things to look at has been abortion... Michigan has been one of the stronger states in supporting that,"" the voter told Fox News Digital. ""He can do a very good job in getting us to just see the value of life."""

A Florida restaurant owner struggling to keep doors open in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic received a surprise message of support from former President Trump.

""I'd like to ask everybody to pitch in and help save Harry and the Natives. It's a special restaurant, a very special place. People love it. It's been around a long time. Like a really long time. But it's fallen prey to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's economy,"" Trump told owner Harry MacArthur in a pre-recorded message Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We have to keep the good ones open, especially when it comes to Florida. Florida is a very, very special place, and that's a very, very great restaurant. So Harry and the Natives, keep it going. We love it. And you're going to be around for a long time.""

'ECONOMY WAY BETTER UNDER TRUMP': BLACK VOTERS SHARE IF THEY WERE BETTER OFF 4 YEARS AGO

Co-host Steve Doocy hosted Friday's show from the packed restaurant in Hobe Sound after MacArthur wrote on Facebook he would have to shut down unless something changed by October 12.

The community, however, rallied behind MacArthur by supporting a GoFundMe set up by his son, Wyatt.

MacArthur called the response from Trump and the community ""overwhelming.""

""Turns out everybody cares,"" he said.

The restaurant has been in MacArthur's family for 72 years. Although the business was originally run by his parents, MacArthur reopened the business as Harry and the Natives after his father died in the 1980s.

MacArthur's business was close to bankruptcy in 2021, but after a ""Breakfast with Friends"" segment, the business was able to hold on. But the financial struggle was not over.

"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."
Port strike longshoremen union boss linked to murdered mobster in 'farce' racketeering case he beat at trial,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/port-strike-longshoremen-union-boss-linked-murdered-mobster-farce-racketeering-case-he-beat-at-trial,2024-10-04T13:40:45Z,"FOX Business' Cheryl Casone previews the September jobs report, break downs the tentative agreement with the International Longshoremen's Association and discusses the hold on Biden's student loan forgiveness plan.

Harold Daggett, the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, which went on a brief strike this week in a labor dispute that could have created a shipping crisis across the U.S., was once cleared of federal racketeering charges in connection with alleged mafia ties to the same union.

Daggett's attorney, his cousin George Daggett, said the 2005 charges were politically motivated and based on weak evidence.

""This trial was a farce,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.""

The Justice Department failed to convict - but the case had deadly results. One of the co-defendants, a reputed Genovese family captain named Larry Ricci, disappeared mid-trial and was later found dead in the trunk of a car outside the Huck Finn Diner in Union, New Jersey, 20 miles west of New York City.

DOCKWORKERS' UNION REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT, WILL SUSPEND PORT STRIKE UNTIL JANUARY

""He's either been abducted -- that is unlikely because he'd be far too difficult a person to keep hostage -- or killed,"" Ricci's attorney Martin Schmukler told the court after he vanished mid-trial, The Associated Press reported at the time. He was later acquitted in absentia.

The commission, at the time a joint oversight operation between the states of New York and New Jersey, pressured federal prosecutors to bring charges it couldn't prove, George Daggett told Fox News Digital.

This trial was a farce. People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.

-- George Daggett, cousin and lawyer of ILA President Harold Daggett

Harold Daggett denied the criminal accusations and said he was a victim of mob extortion. He testified that another mobster, George Barone, put a gun to his head and threatened to massacre his family.

MOBSTERS CHARGED IN INTERNATIONAL PLOT TO CONTROL NEW YORK GARBAGE TRUCK INDUSTRY

""I was so nervous, I urinated all over myself,"" he testified at the time, according to a New York Post report. In a separate deposition, he denied knowing Barone was a Genovese ""soldier,"" court documents show.

Prosecutors had alleged that Daggett had ties to the Genovese crime family as far back as 2000, and the union has long been accused of handing no-show jobs to mobsters' relatives and providing kickbacks.

In exchange for union contracts, the mob was supposed to protect the careers and salaries of corrupt ILA officials, prosecutors alleged.

UNION LEADER SLAMS 'MONEY CRAZY' SHIPPING COMPANIES FOR REFUSING TO 'SHARE' 'BILLIONS' EARNED DURING PANDEMIC

The Justice Department couldn't convince jurors that the defendants were guilty of a crime.

George Daggett, the attorney, said the case began after his cousin asked a Catholic priest for financial advice and had $18 million in union funds placed under the supervision of the same money manager who worked with Our Lady of the Lake Church in Sparta, New Jersey.

""So at the trial, every time a mobster's name was mentioned, the government had a big board, and they made a circle, [and] every time a mobster was mentioned, they put his picture up on this big board,"" he said. ""The government's case ended, and I took Father Cassidy's picture and I put it in the middle of all those mobsters. So that's the kind of trial it was.""

Although the case had to do with allegations of extortion and interference with commerce, prosecutors asked their first witness how many people he'd killed, Daggett said.

""You knew for the government it was all downhill after that,"" he said.

After Ricci's disappearance, his attorney continued to work on his behalf at trial and clear his name.

DESANTIS TAKES MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS AS 'UNACCEPTABLE' STRIKE THREATENS PRODUCT SUPPLY

""What happened was it was not a good fact-pattern for the government, but the Waterfront Commission was pushing so hard that the eastern district said OK,"" Daggett told Fox News Digital. ""Larry Ricci lost his life because, I guess, people thought that everybody was going to be guilty. There was no way [the verdict] could've been guilty.""

Another co-defendant, Albert Cernadas pleaded guilty, but jurors went on to find Daggett, Ricci and Arthur Coffey, another ILA executive, not guilty at trial.

No one has been charged with Riccis' death, although federal prosecutors said they overheard on wiretaps a New Jersey mobster discussing the retrieval of the murder weapon with his son. That man, Michael Coppola, was sent to prison in another RICO case, which involved ILA kickbacks, identity fraud and the 1977 murder of a man named John ""Johnny Cokes"" Lardiere.

Prosecutors have also hinted that Ricci's murder opened a path for other suspected mobsters to corruptly profit off of the ILA, according to court documents.

Harold Daggett became the union's president in 2011. He has been purported to drive a yacht and a luxe Bentley car, live in a sprawling mansion in Sparta, New Jersey, and brought home more than $900,000 in union pay last year - $728,000 for being union president, and another $173,000 for his past role in local 1804-1, which he left in 2011, FOX Business reported.

The ILA, which represents dock workers on the East and Gulf Coasts, went on strike this week in a dispute over what the union calls unfair pay against a backdrop of steep inflation, a rising minimum wage that has outpaced union raises, and the threat of losing human jobs to automation.

The union was demanding concessions from the U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, before the sides reached a deal late Thursday.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 U.S. workers at ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, said the sides reached a provisional wage agreement that extends the current contract until Jan. 15, 2025.

""Things were rough back then [in 1977, when] we went on strike for 80 cents,"" Harold Daggett told FOX Business Tuesday. ""The companies only made like $5 to 10 million, but since COVID and before COVID 'til now, they're making billions and billions of dollars. It's a whole different story, but they don't want to share it. They'd rather see a fully automated terminal right here on the East Coast so they can make more money. They're money crazy.""

The strike could have crippled the U.S. supply chain and cost the country's economy more than $4. billion a day, according to one JPMorgan analysis."
Los Angeles' plan for a car-free 2028 Olympics is a costly pipe dream,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/los-angeless-plan-car-free-2028-olympics-costly-pipe-dream,2024-10-04T09:18:14Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Tom Cruise turned all Olympic eyes from Paris to Los Angeles this summer with his daring closing ceremony stunts. But those eyes had best now turn to the LA Olympic Organizing Committee and Mayor Karen Bass.

In only four short years, the Olympics come to LA, meaning Mayor Bass and the Olympic organizers have just four years to transform Los Angeles into a metropolis fit for the international attention brought by the Olympics. That seems like a big task for a city whose failed governance leaves it with rampant crime, homelessness, congestion, crumbling infrastructure, business and regulatory nightmares, and tax and budget shortfalls.

The LA solution: a ""car-free"" Olympics!

Personal vehicles will not be allowed at Olympic venues. Private parking will simply not be available. Don't even think about driving to an event. Bass and the LA Organizing Committee plan to spend over $900 million on a massive public transit overhaul.

LOS ANGELES KICKS OFF JOURNEY TO 2028 OLYMPICS IN STYLE

Called the ""Twenty-eight by '28 Project"" and initiated in January 2018 during the bidding process for the 2028 Olympics, it proposes 28 transit projects to facilitate the movement of more than one million anticipated visitors the Olympics will bring - all without cars.

How is the Twenty-eight by '28 Project going six years after being proposed and only four years out from the Games?

The answer is not well. I serve on the board of the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). We recently received a report from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority admitting that it will miss the '28 deadline for 10 of the 28 projects. Only five have so far been completed in the past six years of planning.

Bass does not let this diminish her enthusiasm for a car-free Games. She promises that LA will purchase or borrow and then deploy 3,000 buses. I can't imagine at what cost, both financial to Los Angeles, but also on other transportation agencies like OCTA and the people they serve around the country.

ANGEL REESE TRIES TO TAMP DOWN 2028 OLYMPIC EXPECTATIONS AFTER TEAM USA'S LATEST GOLD

That is a mammoth, market-warping diversion of resources - 3,000 buses - to just one city. Other places like Orange County can well expect to feel the pain caused by such a market disrupting force.

The car-free Olympics promise was never serious public policy. Southern California, for the foreseeable future, will remain dominated by personal vehicles. Just over 7.5 million registered motor vehicles exist in LA County, including cars, trucks and motorcycles. The city itself covers a vast 469 square miles, in a stark contrast to Paris's compact 41 square miles. This sprawling landscape complicates public transit use as residents often need to make multiple transfers to reach their destinations, diminishing the likelihood of opting for buses or trains.

Then there are the substantial safety concerns inherent in today's LA public transit system. The public worries rightly about personal safety while on the system. Just last week, in the early hours of Wednesday, Sept. 25, an LA Metro bus was hijacked by a gunman who held the driver at gunpoint, led the police on a pursuit, and murdered one of the passengers.

LOS ANGELES ALLEGEDLY PLANS TO SPEND $500K TO INSTALL OLYMPIC FLAGS AT CITY HALL

That level of dramatic violence is admittedly rare. But we do see persistent knife attacks, sexual assaults, homeless vagrant activity and other crimes on public transportation. This is the transit system to be foisted on visitors from all over the world to accomplish the vision of a car-free Olympics.

Given the city's deep-rooted car culture, the lack of public transit infrastructure, the long commutes that residents have come to accept as normal, and the sheer physical safety concerns, local residents will likely skip the Games rather than abandon their vehicles.

Public transportation cannot rise to the occasion, as the LA Metro report frankly admits, leaving a potentially miserable experience for out-of-town visitors and a very bad lasting image for Los Angeles and the Olympics organizers. At least Orange County had nothing to do with these bad decisions, even if we will feel some of the consequences.

A car-free Olympics was always an enviro-activist pipe dream. It sounded good to certain interest groups, but is nothing more than a liberal government's virtue signaling and self-deception.

The LA Metro report of missed targets throws the harsh light of reality on such wishful thinking. Delays, rising costs due to inflation, failures to meet deadlines and inefficient government bureaucracy can't deliver on the empty promises of politicians. A car-free Olympics, at least as sold when LA made its bid, is one of those empty promises."
Harris claims ad quoting her 2019 vow to ban fracking is 'mischaracterization' to make people 'afraid' of her,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-claims-ad-quoting-her-2019-vow-ban-fracking-mischaracterization-make-people-afraid-her,2024-10-03T23:33:00Z,"The 'Fox & Friends Weekend' hosts react to a resurfaced video of Kamala Harris saying she would 'put an end to fracking once and for all.'

Vice President Kamala Harris argued this week that an ad showing a clip of her past rhetoric about fracking is misleading and ""intended to make people afraid of my presidency.""

CBS Pittsburgh's Jon Delano spoke with Harris in an interview on Tuesday, challenging her to clarify her evolving stance on fracking, one of many key issues where she has been accused of flip-flopping for political gain.

""I wanted to ask you, there's a political ad on TV from a 2019 climate hall town meeting that you had, in which you basically said, quote, 'There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,' unquote,"" the interviewer said. ""The ad claims that if you are elected president you will ban fracking and you will cost Pennsylvania over 300,000 jobs. Have you changed your view on fracking, and if so, why?""

HARRIS DODGING FLIP-FLOP ATTACKS AS FACELESS SURROGATES FLIP KEY POSITIONS: 'PLAYING POLITICS'

""So let me start by saying that that ad, as you described it, is absolutely a mischaracterization, that I think is intended to make people afraid of my presidency,"" Harris said.

""Let me be absolutely clear, as I've been when I said it back in 2020, I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to open up more fracking leases,"" she added, referencing her role as vice president in getting the so-called Inflation Reduction Act through the deadlocked Senate.

In 2020, Harris was asked about fracking during her vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, but did not reveal a reversal of her stated 2019 opposition to fracking, instead simply saying that Biden would not ban fracking as president.

""Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that,"" Harris said.

""I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact,"" she added during another portion of the debate.

On Tuesday, Harris said, ""My perspective on this is grounded in a number of things, including that we don't have to ban fracking to do the work that we can do to also invest in a clean energy economy.""

She then made multiple promises to American voters.

""I'm going to bring jobs back to rural communities. I'm going to make sure that we invest in those communities that have done the kind of work that you have in mind when you talk about Pittsburgh, when you talk about the greater aspect of Pennsylvania,"" she pledged.

"Voters in critical Michigan county focused on economy, candidate character as 2024 race tightens",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-critical-michigan-county-focused-economy-candidate-character-2024-race-tightens,2024-10-03T18:04:18Z,"Voters in Kent County, Michigan, a swing county in one of the most critical swing states, told Fox News Digital about the issues weighing on their mind and whom they support in the upcoming election.

Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins November's presidential election, but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.

""I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don't think that's right,"" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.

The comments come as Kent County, which includes Michigan's second-largest city of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November.

While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state's population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Barack Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while former President Donald Trump took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.

This year's race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.

""Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn't bring us into any wars,"" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris' ""stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.""

Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.

""People having the rights to be in our country and the rights to health care,"" said0 the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.

""Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,"" he added. ""Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.""

However, another voter disagreed on the economy, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.

""I believe that a person who has run a company, that's been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,"" the voter said.

That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.

""I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,"" he said. ""I think other world leaders took note of that.""

Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.

""One candidate gets it and the other doesn't,"" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.

""She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don't think Trump understands that,"" the voter continued.

Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.

""One day I'll go one way and another day I'll go another way,"" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.

""It's hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,"" she said on Harris, while also noting that he finds it ""very hard to believe"" that someone as rich as Trump "" could care about people that don't have any money.""

The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the ""tone of his voice.""

""The name calling, I don't particularly care for that,"" the voter said."
Ohio GOP Senate candidate Moreno hits Brown on Inflation Reduction Act vote in ad that's part of $25M buy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-gop-senate-candidate-moreno-hits-brown-inflation-reduction-act-vote-ad-thats-part-25m-buy,2024-10-03T16:19:51Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno is hitting incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

VIRGINIA SENATE DEBATE: CLINTON EX-RUNNING MATE KAINE, GOP CHALLENGER CAO SPAR ON IMMIGRATION, DEI IN MILITARY

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

NRA TARGETS SEN SHERROD BROWN IN 7-FIGURE AD BUY IN OHIO: 'VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT'

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

The bureau said the index for all items, less food and energy, advanced 3.2% over the year, while food prices increased 1.8%. Energy prices declined 2.6%, ""largely the result of decreasing prices for gasoline,"" it added."
"Biden will 'wreck' US economy by failing to intervene in dockworkers' port strike, GOP leader warns",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-wreck-u-s-economy-failing-intervene-dockworkers-port-strike-gop-leader-warns,2024-10-03T15:26:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., slammed President Biden for failing to intervene in the dockworkers' port strike, expressing concern over the impact it will have on American families who are already struggling with crippling inflation.

Scalise accused Biden of potentially allowing the strike to ""wreck"" the U.S. economy during ""Fox & Friends,"" arguing that consumers will struggle even more with rising costs as the International Longshoremen's Association's (ILA) strike drags on.

PORT STRIKE WILL BRING ANOTHER HIT TO FARMERS, SAYS FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL

""The president said we're just going to let it go on and wreck the economy,"" Scalise told Lawrence Jones. ""We're losing over $5 billion a day and costs are going to start going up even higher on families who are already struggling under the Biden-Harris inflation economy. Food on the shelves is going to become more scarce.""

Although Biden could invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act to intervene in the strike, he has insisted against taking action. Under that law, Biden could enact an 80-day ""cooling off"" period for negotiations to resume while workers are back at work.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 dockworkers, began its first strike since 1977 after its six-year contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents port employers, expired Monday night.

The 36 ports impacted by the strike on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

Negotiations between the ILA and USMX have been deadlocked thus far over the union's demands related to wage hikes and compensation, as well as protection from automation at ports.

Scalise argued that Congress would not support a ban on automation despite demands from the ILA.

""When we're competing globally, we're not just competing one city against another,"" he said. ""You've got ports all around the world that are heavily automated, and they still have humans, by the way, who actually run the devices. These automated devices aren't running themselves, but they're already making with overtime over $200,000 a year, in some cases, and they want to shut the economy down to get more.""

THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT: WHY BIDEN COULD USE THIS LABOR TO PREEMPT A PORT STRIKE

""Who pays for this? And this will add even more to inflation,"" he continued. ""There are a lot of families making 50,000 a year that are saying please stop adding to the costs, and Biden and Harris won't do anything because they want to see those prices keep going.""

Meanwhile, the president has faced fierce scrutiny for spending numerous days at the beach while the nation faces implications of the strike along with various other crises - the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and surging violence in the Middle East.

""We see Joe Biden on the beach. He comes to the White House whenever he wants to,"" Jones said. ""Kamala Harris is on the campaign trail. The Cabinet members are just on the Sunday shows as allies of Kamala Harris. You're in leadership of our government, but who's running the country right now?""

""It's a really scary thought,"" Scalise responded. ""When you look at some of the bills we passed, we passed bills to secure the southern border. Joe Biden came out, said he's against it. Kamala Harris said she's against it. We have bills to produce our own American energy, so we don't need to give Iran and Russia billions of dollars a month. President Biden and Kamala Harris oppose that, so... you see a clear divide. The country is going to speak really loudly on this.""

""I think JD Vance said it best at the debate the other night,"" he continued. ""Kamala Harris talks about what you do on the first day. Kamala Harris's first day was 1,400 days ago, and look at the results. The world's on fire. Americans can't drive to go to the grocery store, let alone put food on the table."""
This is who gets the blame for the port strike. Hint: It's not labor or management,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/who-gets-blame-port-strike-hint-its-not-labor-management,2024-10-03T11:12:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration gave America 40-year-high inflation, labor unrest, and now potentially the costliest strike in American history. By directing its 45,000 members to walk off the job, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union is crippling eastern seaboard ports and costing $5 billion per day.

In October 2021, I warned that the tax-and-spend agenda of the Biden-Harris administration would set an inflationary fire and torch Americans' finances, resulting in labor unrest. By the fall of 2023, we had the largest auto strike in history as the United Auto Workers (UAW) demanded higher wages to counter their losses from inflation.

While the UAW strike was disruptive to the auto industry, it didn't cause severe economic harm or noticeably impact the consumer. The ILA walk-off is an order of magnitude worse, with the potential for severe disruptions to the economy if it lasts more than just a few days.

BALTIMORE RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS PORT STRIKE IS ALREADY IMPACTING BUSINESS: 'IT REALLY HURTS'

The 36 ports on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

In short, America's international trade has been severely hamstrung, with consumers and businesses alike about to get hit hard if this labor dispute isn't resolved quickly.

The primary reason for this and other labor unrest over the last three years has been the stratospheric rise in the cost of living, which stems directly from mismanagement by the Biden-Harris administration.

Biden and Harris pushed for runaway federal deficits, fueled with newly created money from the Federal Reserve, destroyed one-fifth of the dollar's value in less than four years. It also caused violent fluctuations in interest rates for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

The result has been a cost-of-living crisis with homeownership affordability plunging to some of the lowest levels on record, while families pay over $300 billion annually just in interest on their outstanding credit card balances. Despite the average American's weekly paycheck being larger than ever before, it buys less than it did just four years ago.

But the plunge in the dollar's purchasing power has hit businesses every bit as hard as consumers, and the Biden-Harris administration's own data proves it. Prices paid by firms and by customers have both increased 20% since January 2021, meaning businesses have merely passed on their cost increases to consumers.

Inflation has massively increased both the cost of living and the cost of doing business, leaving no winners but government. So, while workers are demanding higher wages to combat today's sky-high cost of living, management is desperate to control increases in the cost of doing business -- and that includes labor costs. With such tight margins, any pay increases to workers will result in higher prices for customers.

But that didn't stop the Biden-Harris administration from weighing in and siding with the strikers, citing growth in corporate profits as somehow indicative of management's misbehavior. Corporate profits have increased in the same sense that families' paychecks have increased, but both buy less, on average, than they did four years ago because of the hidden tax of inflation.

Of all the politicians in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris owns a disproportionate amount of the blame for inflation over the last four years. Not only was she the biggest cheerleader of the president's big-government agenda, but she also cast the tie-breaking vote on trillions of dollars in inflationary federal deficit spending.

What's particularly worrisome is that Harris hasn't learned from her mistakes. She's doubling down instead, proposing more of the same economic malfeasance that got America into this mess. If public policy continues down the path of the last three-and-a-half years, it will mean more inflation, more labor unrest, and evermore disruptive strikes."

Stop the insanity. Our national debt now tops $35 trillion...,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/stop-insanity-national-debt-now-tops-35-trillion,2024-10-03T10:06:48Z,"They know entitlement programs feature benefit promises far exceeding their tax base, but have done nothing to make them sound. Meanwhile, both parties demand more spending increases -- despite the national debt soaring to $35 trillion, or more than $100,000 for each American, rich and poor alike. Under rosy assumptions, over $20 trillion in debt is projected to be added over the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

TRUMP, HARRIS BLASTED FOR IGNORING EXPLODING BUDGET DEFICIT, AS ECONOMISTS PLEAD WITH BOTH TO 'GET REAL'

Some argue tax cuts are to blame for the soaring debt. But as data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows, revenue has remained largely stable while spending has grown significantly above prior levels.

Much of the growing debt is baked into the budgetary cake, and experts have long warned about rising costs when the Baby Boom generation retires. But growing Social Security payouts -- long ago engineered to rise faster than prices -- are only part of the problem. Soaring health spending, driven by the same demographic factors and compounded by exploding medical costs, is an even bigger challenge.

America's mountain of debt has been exacerbated by massive so-called emergency spending enacted by both parties. During the pandemic, legislation added over $5 trillion to the debt. Now the nearly $1 trillion in annual interest on the debt exceeds all federal spending on children, and defense spending, too.

Efforts to balance the budget are repeatedly dismissed. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, one of us regularly proposed and passed balanced budgets, only to see hope for such discipline overcome by a desire for ever-greater spending. Important-sounding commissions (including one dubbed the ""supercommittee"") issued detailed recommendations that were mostly ignored.

Experts produced reams of data showing nations deep in debt inevitably reach a financial crisis, even as proponents of modern monetary theory (MMT) argued no amount of spending is too great. According to MMT advocates, the federal government can always print more money.

Americans have already experienced where inaction and that illogic lead. During the pandemic, former Obama Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that massive new federal spending would lead to significant inflation, which is exactly what happened, with prices growing 20% since the start of the Biden-Harris administration.

The Federal Reserve's response led to the highest interest rates in two decades, helping drive the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home up by over $1,000. Lower-income Americans spend a greater share of their income on housing, so such rising costs are just one example of why they tend to suffer most from inflation and higher interest rates.

Yet despite expressing concerns about inflation, both presidential tickets propose even bigger deficits. In fact, they seem to be in a bidding war to make them worse. Former President Donald Trump proposed exempting tip income from federal taxes, and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly followed suit. Both ignored the 10-year costs of this proposal, which stretch into hundreds of billions of dollars.

Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance suggested more than doubling today's $2,000 child tax credit to $5,000, which Harris one-upped by proposing $6,000 payments in a child's first year. Senator Vance hasn't spelled out important details of his plan, but we know most of Harris's plan comprises bigger benefit spending instead of tax relief. Both proposals would cost over $1 trillion during the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

Neither campaign has a plan to cover the new costs. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, counting their economic effects, Trump's plans would increase deficits by $4 trillion versus Harris's $2 trillion. But that assumes Harris doesn't revive the massive spending plans she promoted as one of the most liberal members of the Senate. Her plans included a ruinously expensive Medicare-for-all proposal, along with $2,000-per-month stimulus checks for most Americans costing $21 trillion. If you believe a Harris administration wouldn't revive such proposals during the next economic crisis, you haven't paid attention to recent Washington policymaking.

While both campaigns suggest we can have higher spending and debt alongside lower prices and interest rates, recent experience suggests otherwise. So where does the buck really stop? That is, who will ultimately pay for all this?

The reality is every American will pay, especially those with modest incomes and younger Americans who will suffer the longest from higher taxes, inflation and interest rates. We should demand more from our leaders than promises of bigger giveaways, followed by empty handwringing about the soaring debt and financial pain that inevitably result.

Amazon just left a package on everyone's doorstep. Its CEO, Andy Jassy, is instructing corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office beginning Jan. 2. And, it's not a request.

The decision marks a significant shift from Amazon's earlier return-to-work stance, which required corporate workers to be in the office at least three days a week.

Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are two other large companies that are requiring five days a week in the office. In 2023 alone, 66% of workers say they're in the office five days a week and you can expect more employers across the country to follow suit.

The bad news is that it's going to be wildly more expensive to return to the office post pandemic and here's what you need to plan for in your family budget.

COMPANY PLANS TO TRACK WORKERS' LOCATIONS IN RETURN-TO-OFFICE CRACKDOWN

With 50% of people having not made a repayment to their student loans, credit card debt north of $1.1 trillion, and inflation taking a toll on the budgets of families across America, what can you expect for increased costs when your employer makes you return to work full time?

Workers spend on average $51 per day when they go to the office, which includes:

This doesn't include the crippling cost of child care. Overall, the difference for the average family will be an increase of $612 a month to be back in that cubicle because the boss says it's better for the company culture.

Prices are up substantially over the past four years under President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and if you can no longer work from home, here are some of the additional costs you might encounter and ways to offset them.

FORMER AMAZON ENGINEER SAYS COMPANY'S 5-DAY RETURN-TO-WORK POLICY CAUSES EMPLOYEES TO RETHINK JOBS

Fuel or Public Transportation: Daily travel to and from work will add costs for gas, parking, bus or train fares. Make sure to check your company benefit manual to see what deals or reimbursed expenses they have for employees.

Car Maintenance: More driving leads to wear and tear, increasing maintenance costs like oil changes, tires and repairs. This is the perfect time to get your car a complete checkup to make sure you don't run into unforeseen auto expenses.

Lunch: You may need to buy lunch more often, so it's best to meal plan at home as the cost for eating out is rarely less than $10 to $15 a pop.

Snacks/Coffee: Skip the Starbucks line and use as much as you can for free with coffee and snacks at the workplace.

BOSSES ADMIT THAT RETURN-TO-OFFICE MANDATES WERE MEANT TO MAKE STAFF QUIT

Clothing: Depending on the dress code, you might need to invest in new business or professional attire, including shoes. It's a great time to check your company policy.

Dry Cleaning/Laundry: Professional clothes may require special cleaning, which adds an extra cost. Many people haven't had to hit the dry cleaner at all over the past several years.

If your home office setup has been more convenient, you might miss the comforts or setup at home, prompting you to buy extra supplies for your work environment.

Longer Hours: Commuting adds time to your day, which reduces your availability for personal activities, self-care or family time. This is important if you must pick your kids up for day care or even the unexpected number of times you'll have to pick up food on the way home because there isn't time to make dinner.

Gym Memberships or Fitness Programs: If you used to work out at home, returning to an office could lead you to rejoin a gym or fitness class. It's possible your employer will have an on-campus gym or a discounted gym membership for you.

Gadgets and Subscriptions: You might need additional items like portable chargers or subscriptions to music or audio books for commuting entertainment.

Majority of NY Times columnists agree JD Vance won debate: 'Much more forceful speaker',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/majority-ny-times-columnists-agree-jd-vance-won-debate-forceful-speaker,2024-10-02T14:38:02Z,"GOP, Democrat, and Independent voters react in real-time to Ohio Senator JD Vance's claims that he and former President Trump care about the environment during Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

Beware Kamala's 'fair share' lie on taxes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/beware-kamalas-fair-share-lie-taxes,2024-10-02T09:14:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris tries to articulate her economic plans, it is clear that she intends to continue to spend more money, and in doing so, also wants to raise taxes, at least for some Americans.

Her attempt at an explanation includes one tired refrain, a carry-over from the Biden-Harris agenda: the wealthy aren't paying their fair share and we need to get them to pay more.

What the wealthy pay in taxes cannot be characterized as fair, but not in the way that Harris explains.

According to Treasury data, federal income taxes account for about half of government revenue. Of those federal income taxes, per the Tax Foundation, about half of taxpayers paid around 98% of that total.

IRS MIGHT TAKE MORE OF YOUR MONEY UNDER KAMALA HARRIS

As you dig into the numbers, they become even more ""unfair.""

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation's data from 2021 showed that the top 1% of earners made 26.3% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), yet they paid 45.8% of federal income taxes. One percent of the people paying almost 46% of taxes is definitely not fair, but Harris wants more.

When the data is expanded, the top 10% of earners had 52.6% of AGI, but paid 75.8% of federal income taxes.

The bottom 50% of earners had 10.4% of AGI, but only paid just more than 2.3% of federal income taxes.

HERE'S WHAT KAMALA HARRIS' TAX ARMAGEDDON WILL COST YOU AND THE US ECONOMY

And, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of U.S. households pay no federal income taxes at all.

Those who pay abundantly for the federal government and its ""services"" are berated by Harris and friends that they aren't paying enough, which is then voted into being by the people who carry little to none of the federal income tax burden. That sounds... unfair.

What is also unfair is the creep of tax collections and overspending.

For FY 2024, the U.S. government is expected to take in, primarily from taxes, almost $5.1 trillion. That's an increase of around 47% from five years ago. It's a staggering amount, larger than the GDP of every country in the world, other than the U.S. and China. Yet, it's still not enough and the government plans to run a more than $2 trillion deficit on top of that. That's... unfair.

And, while we are talking about unfair taxes, let's not forget that the massive inflation that the Biden-Harris agenda unleashed upon all Americans, stealing their purchasing power, making the cost of everyday living a struggle, and putting the ability to invest and get ahead out of reach. As famed economist Milton Friedman once said, ""Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation."" That sounds... unfair.

The government spends too much, and it takes too much, particularly from those who have been successful, painting achievement and success as a punishable offense and government dependence as a virtue. That doesn't sound American, that sounds socialist at best.

Yet, Harris will say that those who have done well need to be further penalized, while continuing to overspend and devalue the earnings of all Americans. And that's before layering on any of her ultra-destructive proposals on top of raising income taxes, which include higher capital gains taxes, unrealized gains taxes, and other economically illiterate and ruinous policies.

When it comes to the government, what is unfair is how much they are taxing productive Americans, how many Americans have no skin in the game, and how much government spending is creating a fiscal train wreck.

Calling out that unfairness needs to be done over and over again."
Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Conservative social media reactions pour in declaring winner of VP debate: 'This was a massacre',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservative-social-media-reactions-pour-in-declaring-winner-vp-debate-massacre,2024-10-02T08:11:16Z,"A panel of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents give a show of hands in support of either JD Vance or Tim Walz after Tuesday nights Vice Presidential Debate.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION'

""Very proud of JD for a stellar performance tonight,"" former presidential candidate Vivek Ramasawmy posted on X. ""And my condolences to Tim Walz - it was unkind for them to put him in this position.""

""JD Vance won big and demonstrated why he was a fantastic pick by President Trump,"" Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X. ""He skillfully contrasted Trump's record of peace and prosperity with Kamala's record of disaster.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""
Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Now they know more, and on the basis of Tuesday night's performance, Vance might have won over a few folks. With the race a dead heat, everything matters."
"Vance rips Walz on economy, says he's forced to 'pretend' Trump didn't lower inflation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-rips-walz-economy-says-hes-forced-pretend-trump-didnt-lower-inflation,2024-10-02T02:26:25Z,"Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports the latest on the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance ripped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the Democratic Party's economic record, remarking Walz has a ""tough job"" simultaneously defending Vice President Kamala Harris' ""atrocious economic record"" while attacking former President Donald Trump on the economy.

""Honestly, Tim, I think he's got a tough job here because you've got to play Whac-A-Mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did,"" Vance said Tuesday evening during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Vance was responding after Walz slammed the GOP ticket as one that protects billionaires with tax cuts and pledging that he's a ""union guy"" who wants to keep jobs in the U.S.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

Vance continued by saying Walz has to juggle defending Vice President Kamala Harris' economic record while slamming Trump.

""And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries and housing unaffordable for American citizens,"" Vance continued.

""I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt, so that she could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense economic principles.""

The economy is a top voter concern this election cycle, ranking alongside issues such as the immigration crisis, abortion and national security.

""I hope we have a conversation on health care then, senator,"" Walz said as Vance wrapped up his points on the economy.

""Please,"" Vance responded.

The debate marks the first time the pair have squared off against one another, and will likely be the only vice presidential debate this cycle."

NEW YORK CITY - With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there's a lot on the line in the vice presidential debate.

While debates between the running mates are the undercard of a White House race and have rarely moved the need much in the past, when Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats' nominee, face-off on Tuesday, there will be heightened stakes.

Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., accused Vice President Kamala Harris of breaking the economy during a heated exchange on ""The Breakfast Club,"" where he sparred with hosts over her role in handling the current inflation plaguing the U.S.

A discussion on Tuesday's episode of the show devolved into a fiery exchange between the lawmaker and the hosts after he blamed Harris for the failed economic policies of the Biden administration.

""I would argue we're not really thriving right now. This inflation, which by the way was brought to us by Kamala Harris, has really slowed people down from being able to excel,"" Donalds said.

VP HARRIS' TIE-BREAKER VOTES IN THE SENATE WERE KEY TO INFLATION-BOOSTING BIDEN POLICIES: EXPERT

""By Kamala?"" host Charlamagne Tha God replied. ""She's vice president. There's still a president.""

""Oh Charlamagne,"" Byron said, reminding listeners that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act in 2021.

""She broke the tie that started this inflation that has hurt so many people in our country,"" Donalds said.

Guest-host Angela Rye dismissed Byron's argument as ""not true.""

""You sure you want to go there?"" the Florida Republican shot back, pulling out a pamphlet of ""facts"" from his suit jacket to back up his claim as Rye tried to speak over him.

Donalds argued that experts anticipated ""massive inflation"" if the American Rescue Plan was passed.

""That's what happened,"" he said.

""The problem we have in our economy today is that prices have gone up massively, wages adjusted for inflation is down, people's pocketbooks are hurting,"" he continued.

Donalds asked co-host DJ Envy, whether he would hire someone who broke a house to fix more houses.

Donalds posted a clip of the exchange on X later Tuesday, writing ""Democrat economists warned her it would cause inflation. And it did...It caused 20+% inflation. It created a cost-of-living crisis. It crushed hardworking Americans. Kamala broke our economy.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Biden in the past has called assertions that the American Rescue Plan's substantial spending might have been a cause of the skyrocketing inflation ""bizarre,"" waving away the accusation.

GOP leader says Vance 'absolutely prepared' for VP debate showdown with Walz,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-leader-says-vance-absolutely-prepared-vp-debate-showdown-walz,2024-10-01T15:50:59Z,"NEW YORK - Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley is confident that Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is ""absolutely prepared"" for Tuesday night's vice presidential debate showdown.

Vance, former President Trump's running mate on the GOP 2024 ticket, will face off in New York City with Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota in the one and only debate between the two running mates.

""You look at everything he's done since he was named as the candidate. He's been preparing, he's been talking with the press, he's been out there, he's been moving around and talking to the American voters. So, he's very ready to have this conversation,"" Whatley emphasized in a Fox News Digital interview hours ahead of the debate.

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep told Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor was in debate camp ahead of the showdown to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters, ""She wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error White House race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there will be heightened stakes at the running mate debate, which is traditionally seen as a second-tier event in the presidential campaign.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head match-up between the principal candidates and this is the last meet-up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

Most political pundits said Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

And there's a precedent from 12 years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Whatley, the former RNC general counsel and former North Carolina GOP chair who's a close ally of Trump, told Fox Digital that Vance's debate mission is to ""deliver the message"" to voters across the country.

Whatley argued that ""if you look at the Democrats, they don't just have messenger problems, they have message problems. The polices that they're pushing right now are not popular with the American people.... I think on every single one of these issues, the Republican ticket is the ticket of strength, the ticket of common sense, and I feel really great about where we're going into tonight.""

The RNC chair also said that when it comes to Vance's game plan for the debate, ""I think he's going to talk about the issues that the voters care about and those are the issues like inflation, like the southern border, like prices at the grocery store and at the gas pump. That's really what people care about. That's what we're going to talk about.""

Part of the Harris campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

For weeks, they've painted Walz as a regular guy who will be facing off with the Ivy League-trained Vance. What they don't mention is that Walz won six House races and two gubernatorial elections.

The Trump campaign's playing the same game.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well-prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

But Trump seemed to undercut this campaign's argument, charging in an interview with Kellyanne Conway's Fox Nation program ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne"" that Vance is ""going up against a moron. A total moron, how she picked him is unbelievable.""

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable."
'Economy way better under Trump': Black voters share if they were better off 4 years ago,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/economy-way-better-under-trump-black-voters-share-were-better-off-4-years-ago,2024-10-01T09:09:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

""I want be biased, but I want to say I think its time for history to be made. I just think that its going to be a woman president,"" Detroit resident Mandela said.

""Trump. Them [stimulus checks] was fire tho,"" east side Detroit resident Keandre said. ""Definitely, when Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower."""
Jimmy Carter becomes first president to turn 100,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jimmy-carter-becomes-first-president-turn-100,2024-10-01T08:11:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Democrat President Carter turns 100 years old on Tuesday, earning himself the distinction of being the first president to ever live for an entire century.

Carter, the nation's 39th president, has been a man of several firsts. He was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital, was the first Naval Academy graduate to become president, and he was the first president to make a formal state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa, among other firsts. Now, Carter is the first U.S. president in history to make it to 100 years old.

Carter remains under home hospice care in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, where he has lived since the culmination of his presidency in 1981. This upcoming February marks two years in hospice for the former president who has outlived his wife, Rosalynn. She died last year at age 96.

JIMMY CARTER'S GRANDSON SAYS FORMER PRESIDENT IS 'COMING TO THE END'

""It's funny, President Carter has accomplished so much and rarely ever fails. But the one thing that he's not been good at is hospice,"" said Jill Stuckey, a family friend of the Carters for more than 30 years and the superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Park in Plains. ""He keeps living, and we are so thrilled about that fact. So, if he was to not be good at anything, we're glad it's hospice.""

When asked what Stuckey thought differentiated Carter from other past presidents who have lived into old age, she said it was ""tenacity.""

""He and Mrs. Carter were concerned about living as long as they possibly could, being as healthy as they possibly could, so they could help as many people as they possibly could,"" Stuckey told Fox News Digital. ""They have eaten right every single meal. They have exercised every single day. They are just relentless in taking care of themselves so they can live as long as they possibly can to take care of others. And that's what President Carter is proving today, that all those things make a difference.""

JIMMY CARTER'S FAMILY REVEALS HOW PRESIDENT FELT ABOUT BIDEN QUITTING, WHICH DNC SPEAKER STOLE THE SHOW

Stuckey said that events commemorating Carter's milestone 100th birthday have been going on in Plains since Saturday, when the town held its annual peanut festival.

""We celebrate peanut harvest season here in Plains, and it happens to coincide with President Carter's birthday every year, so we kind of combine them,"" Stuckey said.

She also indicated that Tuesday, on Carter's birthday, several other events commemorating his birthday will take place in Plains, including a naturalization ceremony for 100 new citizens at Plains High School, where both Jimmy and Rosalynn attended.

After the ceremony, there will be a flyover to honor the former president, organized with the help of Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro. In the late afternoon, Plains will also host a ribbon-cutting ceremony for new statues dedicated to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

Meanwhile, in celebration of Carter's birthday, volunteers in St. Paul, Minnesota, gathered to build 30 new homes over five days. Participants reportedly included country music stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood.

""You're one of the most influential statesmen in our history,"" President Biden said in a video released ahead of Carter's birthday on Tuesday.

Over the weekend, Grand Ole Opry member and country music legend Charlie McCoy played a special rendition of ""Georgia On My Mind"" to honor the former president.

WHY JIMMY CARTER IS THE FATHER OF THE POST-PRESIDENCY, SAW THE POWER OF HIS STATUS

""I remember the first time I saw him, and I was in awe, and the feeling's always been there. You can be around presidents all the time, but the first time is the most meaningful,"" said Cathie Skoog, a former member of the White House Communications Agency. ""He didn't care what people thought. He did what he felt was right for the country.""

Carter's presidency was marked by efforts to preserve the environment, advance human rights and propel the American education system to new heights. Carter overhauled the civil service system, deregulated the airline industry to spur competition, and created the Energy and Education departments. It was also Carter's administration that required both seat belts and airbags in cars.

However, Carter's presidency was also marked by trials, including high inflation, an energy crisis and failed negotiations to win the release of dozens of American hostages taken captive in Iran. Carter's Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, eventually resigned in protest of the administration's handling of the hostage crisis.

Amid the Iranian Revolution going on at the time, oil prices in the U.S. rose substantially. In July 1979, Carter blamed Americans discouraged by soaring inflation and the energy crisis for losing confidence in the country.

""The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us,"" Carter said in his speech. ""For the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people do not even vote. The productivity of American workers is actually dropping, and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world.""

""We must face the truth, and then we can change our course,"" he continued. ""We simply must have faith in each other, faith in our ability to govern ourselves and faith in the future of this nation. Restoring that faith and that confidence to America is now the most important task we face."""

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 72 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August last month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

"We Have Reached Peak Energy Emissions, But We Should Not Celebrate",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sverrealvik/2024/10/08/we-have-reached-peak-energy-emissions-but-we-should-not-celebrate/,2024-10-08T23:23:59Z,"2024 is likely to be the year of peak energy emissions. We are on the cusp of downturn in emissions that is different to anything we have seen in post-industrial times. It is not the same as the short term blips seen during the financial crisis of 2008 or the COVID-19 pandemic (remember the promises of the ""new normal""?), when a sudden decline in travel and economic output led to a temporary drop in emissions. In broader terms, emissions have been rising since the industrial revolution and we are now at the beginning of the reversal of that trend.

In the context of modern human history, this is a historic moment.

Viewed through the lens of the Paris Agreement, the picture is bleaker. Energy related emissions will fall by about half by the middle of the century, this is a long way short of the net zero needed. According to DNV's Energy Transition Outlook, we forecast the planet will warm by 2.2 degrees by the end of century and in addition to the devastating consequences for humanity, climate change is also likely to become the leading cause of biodiversity loss.

Looking at the causes of peak energy emissions can help us understand how we got here and how we can decarbonize even quicker.

The most impactful technologies of the energy transition are solar and batteries. Solar installations grew 80% last year, which is even faster than we predicted. To put this into a wider context, annual solar installations were only 1 GW in 2004 and rose to 100 GW in 2019 and surged to 400 GW in 2023. Likewise, battery costs plunged 14% last year making 24-hour solar and electric vehicles more affordable.

This led to solar being a cheaper form of electricity generation compared to coal in most parts of the world, whilst the growth of EVs stunted the uptake to oil. This may sound far fetched if you are reading this in from back of a diesel taxi in Frankfurt or looking at the nodding head of a pumpjack in Texas, but it is in China where these trends are particularly strong. China accounted for 58% of global solar installations and 63% of new EV purchases last year. The scaling of green technology in China has a particularly profound impact on the global energy transition also because it is the world's largest emitter.

But already here we can see a reason for the energy transition not going as fast as it could. China has established itself as the leading manufacturer and exporter of many of the clean technologies essential to the energy transition. Yet, with national and energy security and protecting local industries and jobs on their minds, many governments are reluctant to import goods from China, making the energy transition slower and more expensive.

And whilst the cost of solar and batteries are falling fast, the same cannot be said for hydrogen. Hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives are needed to decarbonize sectors which are hard to electrify, such as deep-sea shipping and aviation. When we last year modelled a pathway to reaching net zero by 2050, we found that hydrogen would need to meet about 14% of the world's energy needs by the middle of the century. In this year's Outlook, we forecast that number to be just four percent.

Four percent is still a significant number - it equates to trillions of dollars in capital expenditures in hydrogen production and billions of dollars in pipeline construction. But this is only a small percentage of what is required. As it stands, the markets and regulatory framework is just not conducive to scaling hydrogen. To make this happen, the government will have to use the entire policy toolbox, including incentives, mandates - and carbon pricing.

There is a growing mismatch between what is required to accelerate the energy transition and the priorities of governments. Money is flowing towards military and national security spending rather than reaching net zero. Politicians are reluctant to make bold decisions on energy infrastructure with tax payers cash, when households have been buffeted by years of high inflation.

Despite a recent pivot away from net zero goals in many countries, it has not stopped some policymakers from introducing significant legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. With the 1.5 degree target out of the window, we need a refocused and globally coordinated policy push to decarbonize our energy mix even faster."
3 Top Stocks To Buy Now After The Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-stocks-to-buy-now-after-fed-rate-cut/,2024-10-08T21:13:42Z,"The Federal Reserve committee inaugurated the much-anticipated interest rate cut cycle in mid-September, slashing half-a-percentage point off its benchmark rates without waiting to hit its actual 2% inflation target. The objective of the bigger-than-expected rate cut was to avert a recession, when a weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm Rule-a historical recession indicator that has a consistent 100% (well, almost) accuracy rate for every recession since the early 1970s. This gives rise to a few questions like:

The Federal Reserve launched its interest rate cut cycle on September 18, by aggressively slashing 50 basis points off benchmark rates, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill their reserve requirements. Banks are mandated by law to hold a reserve equal to a specific percentage of their deposits, referred to as the reserve requirement to ensure that bank is capable of meeting sudden withdrawals.

This is the first rate cut in four years since the Fed's emergency response to pandemic shutdowns in March 2020. Another half-percentage point reduction before this year-end is likely in the cards with an additional percentage-point cut anticipated in 2025.

The Fed raised interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023, to ease inflation that surged to the highest levels in more than four decades. In June 2022, inflation in the U.S. reached a whopping 9.1%, as prices and demand soared amid pandemic-disrupted supply constraints and unprecedented government stimulus programs that pumped about $5 trillion into the economy. When inflation shoots up, the Fed Reserve typically steps in to cool the inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing more expensive. This brings down spending and demand thereby inflation.

The corollary to rising interest rates is an increase in borrowing costs for businesses as well, which in turn triggers cost-cutting, slowdown in expansion initiatives, layoffs and lesser new hires. This leads to an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in September, up from 3.8% in the same month last year. A rise in unemployment rate alongside a slowdown in hiring has renewed recession concerns.

With the half-a-percentage cut, the Fed is hoping for a soft landing, a scenario in which the economy slows sufficiently to reduce inflation without entering a recession. The Fed's mandate is to restore price stability, while trying not to increase unemployment, even as its 2% inflation target appears within reach. Experts opine that a soft landing is plausible but far from guaranteed.

The current inflation rate is 2.5%, the lowest since February 2021, and lower than the long-term average of 3.28%. The fact that the Fed did not wait until the 2% inflation target was hit clearly shows where its priorities lie now-to avoid a recession.

Historically accurate and reliable recession indicators like the Sahm Rule are now facing skepticism because the pandemic has disrupted normal business activity and complicated forecasting efforts. The Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, states that a recession may happen when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more when compared to its low during the previous 12 months. The Sahm Rule has maintained an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 100% for every recession since the early 1970s. The only exception occurred in November 1976, when the rule was triggered without a corresponding or subsequent recession.

The Sahm Rule reading was 0.53% for July when the unemployment rate hit 4.3%. However, the rule's inventor Sahm herself rebutted the surge of catastrophic narratives, stating that ""I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession."" in an interview with Fortune. However, she also added later ""I think the recession odds, given what we're seeing in the labor market, are increasing."" While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was slightly dismissive of the Sahm Rule as more of a ""statistical regularity"" than an ""economic rule."" Sahm believes the rule shouldn't be dismissed as it's been very accurate over time and noted that ""recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.""

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped from 4.3% in July to 4.2% in August and 4.1% in September showing improvements ahead of the upcoming elections in November. In September, the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs exceeding estimates for 150,000 new jobs. The upbeat September jobs report should silence concerns about an impending disaster at least for now.

Nevertheless, unemployment rates will be a key data point to watch going forward. Any material rise in unemployment and fall in hiring may likely hit consumer spending, which has thus far been resilient because of strong wage gains. It is natural for people to cut back on spending when facing unemployment or the threat of losing a job.

High interest rates incentivize the consumer to save money, while lower interest rates tend to influence the consumer to borrow, spend and invest. Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Fed rate cuts are expected to be most impactful for credit cards that have variable interest rates. The previous Fed rate hike cycle has pushed the variable interest rates on credit cards close to all-time highs of above 21% currently, from around 14.6% in March 2022 when the rate hikes began. As the rate cut cycle unfolds, credit card rates will likely ease below 20%, offering some degree of relief for borrowers.

Mortgage rates for both 15-year and 30-year fixed loans are typically linked to Treasury yields and the overall economy, are likely to decrease slightly but are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the last decade. Currently, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovers around 6.2%. Experts predict these rates will remain between 6% and 6.5%, with the possibility of dipping below 6%. However, elevated home prices may still deter potential home buyers.

Auto loans are fixed with the average rate on a five-year new car loan being 6.8% in the second quarter, sharply higher than the 4% levels at the beginning of rate hikes. While the easing of rates may encourage car buyers who have pushed-out on purchases, the limiting factor could still be higher vehicle prices and lack of incentives for buyers.

The fixed nature of Federal student loan rates also means that a rate cut may have no impact on these borrowers, because these interest rates don't change over the loan term.

Savings rates have benefitted from the rate hike cycle. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers nearly 5% interest, while top interest rates from certificate of deposit (CD) instruments range from 4.00% to 5%. While these interest rates could decline, the opportunity still exists to secure a HYSA or CD before rates drop further.

A research study by Hartford Funds shows that 7 of the 11 Fed rate cutting periods from 1980 to 2024 were accompanied by recessions. While recession is not a desirable condition, how does it impact the stock market? Here are some interesting observations.

An analysis by Hartford Funds of 22 Fed rate-cutting cycles since 1928 revealed that the S&P 500 benchmark index on average outperformed government bonds and corporate bonds in the 12 months after the Fed started cutting interest rates. The average 12-month real return (after adjusting for inflation) from the date of first rate cut for U.S. stocks (represented by the S&P 500 index) has been 11% vs. 5% returns for government bonds and 6% returns for corporate bonds and 2% returns for cash.

The average returns of the stock market in the 22 rate cut cycles is even more impressive considering that in 16 out of 22 cycles the U.S. economy was already in a recession when the rate cuts were initiated or entered a recession within a 12 month period.

During the non-recessionary, rate-cut cycles the stock market returned a solid 17% on average (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut) vs. 2% for government bonds, 4% for corporate bonds and 3% for cash. In the event of a recessionary, rate-cut period, the stock market still returned a positive 8% on average vs. 7% for government and corporate bonds and 2 % for cash (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut.)

While these stock market returns seem solid, investors should remember that this is an average value for 22 rate cut cycles. The stock market suffered heavy losses too during recessionary periods. In 6 out of 22 rate cut cycles, stock market returns fluctuated widely between a negative 10% to negative 45%.

After the much touted ""great rotation"" into small-cap stocks, the focus is shifting to mid-cap stocks, because investors may be looking at a situation where small-caps may still be risky and large caps still too expensive. Until the Fed achieves the targeted soft landing, recession worries will continue to linger at the backdrop. Besides, the longer-for-higher interest rates have also triggered concerns about a slower-than-anticipated Fed rate easing cycle.

With stronger fundamentals (higher profitability and solid balance sheet) vs. small-caps and attractive valuations vs. large-caps, mid-caps seem better positioned to benefit from the present Fed rate cuts. Yet another solid reason for the pivot to mid-caps is the historical outperformance of mid-caps vs. large caps and small caps in the first 3 and 12 months subsequent to the first Fed rate cut. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 mid-cap index has been an outperformer since 1984 vs. the S&P 500 (large-caps) and Russell 2000 (small-caps) in the 3 and 12 months following the first Fed first rate cut. Presently, Goldman Sachs projects a 13% return for the S&P 400 index over the next 12 months.

Elf Beauty qualifies as a high growth beauty company, having grown sales and market share for 22 straight quarters, and averaging at least 20% sales growth per quarter. Over the past five years, Elf has expanded its top one/two positions from across eight segments in the color cosmetics category to 18 segments, which now account for over 80% of its Elf cosmetics sales. The company's ""Holy Grail"" approach centers on creating value versions of prestige products to align with consumer preferences. For reference, the average price point for Elf is about $6.50 vs. around $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetics brands and more than $20 for prestige brands. Elf's recent Bronzing Drops is comparable to a prestige product in the market at a third of the price. This strategy has helped solidify Elf's outperformance in the cosmetics category.

Solid market share gains: Elf Beauty's color cosmetics business continues to be a category outperformer. A 26% growth across track channels in the first quarter vs. a 1% decline for the category, has helped ELF grow its cosmetics market share to 12.3% presently. This represents a more than 2x increase from 5.7% market share in the same quarter three years ago. ELF expects to double its cosmetics market share again in a few years.

Shelf-space gains with Walmart, top share with Target, Opportunities at groceries, drug stores: With Target, a long-standing customer, Elf Cosmetics is the number one brand for six quarters in a row with its share rising from 13% to 21%. A 50% shelf space gain from 8 feet to 12 feet at Walmart is commendable, but still underpenetrated vs. legacy brands that have a 16 feet to 20 feet shelf space. The opportunities for expansion are attractive at Target, Walmart and Alta, alongside growth at grocery and drug stores, where ELF currently has a much smaller footprint.

Maximizing Brand Performance with Retail Partners: Elf proactively refreshes up to 20% of its retail assortment annually, leveraging insights from its digital business and beauty squad loyalty programs. This strategy has doubled its average sales per SKU over the past five years, making it a highly productive brand in terms of dollar sales per foot basis with retailers.

Growing Skincare business: Elf Beauty hopes to replicate the success in its cosmetics business across its skincare segment. For the latest first quarter, Elf SKIN grew 45% in track channels, vs. category growth of 1.4%. Elf SKIN has roughly 2% market share as of the first quarter vs. 14% share for the leading skin care brand. ELF's Naturium acquisition from last year should also help unlock growth in the skin category.

International expansion opportunities: International sales accounted for 16% of ELF's total first-quarter sales, up from 13% a year ago, but is still underpenetrated vs. global peers that have a 70% exposure to international sales. International expansion represents a key growth runway for ELF.

Upbeat Guidance: ELF recently raised guidance for fiscal 2025 (ending on March 31, 2025), now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.36 to $3.41, on sales of $1.28 billion to $1.30 billion, from prior expectations of $3.20 to $3.25 EPS on sales of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. The revised guidance compares more favorably with year-ago EPS of $3.18 on revenues of $1.02 billion.

ELF Stock Sell-off presents opportunity: Despite these positive developments, ELF stock trades way off its 52-week intra-day high of $221.83 reached in early March. After a couple of attempts in late June and mid July to recapture the highs of the year, the stock has fallen sharply amid concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth rates above 20%. However, it still has a Strong Buy rating from 16 Wall Street analysts.

Medpace is a full-service clinical contract research organization providing Phase I-IV clinical development services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Medpace calls itself as a CRO trusted by biotechs with a focus on small to mid-sized biopharma customers that represented more than 95% of its 2023 revenues. With an estimated 5% market share in the small and mid-sized biopharma space, Medpace sees an estimated core addressable biopharma CRO market of $28 billion.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profit: Top line has grown at a nearly 22% CAGR from $704.6 million in 2018 to $1.89 billion in 2023, while net income has grown four-fold from $73.2 million or $1.97/share in 2018 to $282.8 million or $8.88 per share in 2023.

Attractive Free Cash Flow characteristics: Medpace has attractive free cash flow (FCF) characteristics with FCF growing from $138.7 million in 2018 to $396.7 million in 2023. Ebitda-FCF conversion has remained above 100% since 2019.

Upbeat outlook: For 2024, revenue is expected to be between $2.125 billion and $2.175 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 12.7% to 15.3%. Net income is expected to be $361 million to $383 million or $11.24 per share to $11.93 per share and Ebitda to be $430.0 million to $460.0 million.

Concerns over cancellation appear baked into stock price now: While announcing second-quarter earnings results, the company cited some order cancellations that brought its book-to-bill ratio to 1.04 for the quarter vs. prior expectations for 1.2. Medpace also cautioned that the book-to-bill numbers could be flat to slightly higher sequentially in the third quarter. Some analysts downgraded the stock to a Hold/Neutral rating in late September citing weaker bookings growth coupled with cancellations as one of the reasons.

Are the concerns overrated? In the earnings call, Medpace said it does not see a prolonged pullback, or does not view the cancellations as a pattern that's going to continue. Besides, a book-to-bill of 1.04 for one quarter is not earth shattering, because it is still above 1, implying strong demand. Medpace sees the third quarter book-to-bill to be at 1.04 or slightly higher and in the first quarter the number was at 1.2. Also, Backlog as of June 30, 2024 was a solid $2.9 billion, up 13.7% year-on-year, and Medpace expects to convert about $1.585 billion of this backlog to revenue over the next twelve months. Medpace even raised its profit guidance for 2024 to show that it continues to anticipate industry-leading organic revenue growth and profitability despite the challenges in backlog growth. The backlog concerns appear to be priced into the MEDP stock that is already trading well below its mid-July highs of $459.77.

Upcoming catalyst: A key catalyst for the Medpace stock is the upcoming third-quarter earnings report, slated for release on October 21, after market close. Overall the MEDP stock has a moderate buy rating from analysts.

Skechers, dubbed as the comfort footwear giant, is a Fortune 500 company that makes lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. International sales represented more than 60% of its 2023 top line. The comfort footwear maker operates via wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) business segments, with wholesale representing 56% of sales in 2023, and the rest coming from DTC.

Record second-quarter sales: Despite currency and supply chain headwinds, regulatory obstacles in India, and a lackluster 6/18 holiday in China, Skechers delivered record second-quarter sales of $2.16 billion, up 7.2% year over year driven by continued strength in its international DTC business and significant improvement in its domestic wholesale business.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profits: Skechers has grown sales from $5.2 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2023, and earnings per share from $2.25 to $3.49. Fiscal 2024 outlook is even better with sales expected between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion and EPS expected to be $4.08 to $4.18.

Expanding margins: Skechers sells at affordable price points, yet gross margins have remained above 47% since 2019 exceeding 50% in 2023, while operating margins have been mostly in the mid-to-high single digits, with the exception of a drop to 2.9% in 2020. The margin story gets even better in the first half of 2024, with gross margins at 53.7% and operating margin at 11.5%.

One shoe does not fit all but Skechers fits all into one shoe: Considerable thought goes into the design of Skechers footwear to meet the needs of every walk of life. Under a partnership with John Deere, Skechers recently launched a footwear line for agricultural professionals, construction workers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Made of waterproof materials, the footwear line has interesting features like composite toe protection, nano carbon safety and Poron XRD metatarsal protection-Poron XRD being a flexible, lightweight, breathing foam, which hardens when impacted and forms a protective shell around the foot, absorbing up to 90% of the impact energy. Skechers has also integrated its slip-resistant and electrical hazard-rated technologies into the new offering.

Reasonably attractive valuation: Skechers stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 16.2x based on $4.08 eps guidance for 2024 (at the low end of the range). This is lower than its own five-year historical average of 21.2x. If the multiple re-rates to a conservative 19x (at the midpoint of the multiple range), it would still represent about 17% upside from current price levels. The footwear maker's expectations to achieve $10 billion in sales by 2026, also implies 13% upside potential from current stock levels, upon applying the current forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.13x. The stock may have 13%-17% upside potential from current levels.

The U.S. economy is currently not in a recession. The Fed rate easing cycle may likely achieve a soft landing of the economy, although there are no guarantees and historical evidence points otherwise, at least most of the time. Monthly Jobs data will continue to be a critical watch point. Even as recession fears linger, mid-cap stocks could be a preferred investment over large-cap or small-cap stocks, as mid-caps are at the confluence of reasonable valuations and stronger fundamentals. The mid-cap stocks highlighted in the article enjoy profitable growth with upbeat future prospects."
A Legacy Of Patient-Centered Transformation - A Conversation With Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Toby Cosgrove,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrist/2024/10/08/a-legacy-of-patient-centered-transformation--a-conversation-with-cleveland-clinics-dr-toby-cosgrove/,2024-10-08T20:53:32Z,"This week, my longtime friend Dr. Toby Cosgrove and I had the fun of kicking off the Nashville Healthcare Sessions Conference, hosted by the Nashville Health Care Council. Our opening panel was titled, ""Leading the Charge: A Legacy of Patient-Centered Transformation,"" a title we both took issue with since it implied that if we'd already left a legacy - we were old!

Despite this slight, it did give us the opportunity to reminisce on when we first met - 42 years ago at Massachusetts General Hospital when I was Chief Resident in cardiac surgery and Dr. Cosgrove was already an exceptionally talented cardiac surgeon visiting from the Cleveland Clinic. I remember watching in awe from the other side of the operating room table as he deftly sewed the new coronary artery grafts in our heart patient with perfect textbook precision.

Our paths continued to cross over the years as we each took our own journeys to transform healthcare in ways that better served the patient - Toby as the cardiac surgeon turned innovative, data-driven, genius CEO behind the Cleveland Clinic, setting the global standard for quality care in many specialties; me as the transplant surgeon turned national policymaker and now healthcare company innovator. In recent years, we've come together through organizations like the Health Affairs Council on Health Care Spending and Value and the Aspen Institute's Health Strategy Group.

We always have fun picking each other's brains on the healthcare trends we're seeing and our predictions for the future - and this day was no different. In front of a packed audience, I asked Toby, what made the Cleveland Clinic unique when it came to quality?

Without hesitation, Toby shared how, as head of the cardiac surgery department, he and his fellow cardiac surgeons agreed they should let cardiologists know what the outcomes were of the patients referred to them - a feedback loop that often isn't closed in the healthcare continuum. What began as an annual presentation and shared slides progressed to a polished booklet, then to a book of outcomes data across all Clinic departments, which soon became annual outcome and quality data shared with the public. The Cleveland Clinic was committed to being transparent and accountable for their patients' outcomes.

We had a ""tradition of measuring, measuring, measuring,"" Toby explained, because you can't improve without understanding your results.

I completely agreed with Toby. When I stood up the Vanderbilt Multi-Organ Transplant Center over three decades ago, measuring outcomes was absolutely fundamental to our success and survival - it was how we convinced the federal government and later private insurers to cover nascent transplant procedures. We had to demonstrate we had quality outcomes that justified the high cost of the procedures. This relentless commitment to data measurement, quality and innovation is part of the reason Vanderbilt is now the busiest heart transplant center in the world.

But today's healthcare environment has a number of challenges that make commitment to quality hard. Toby pointed to three key issues:

The first is cost: The average hospital margin is 2% and half the hospitals are running in the red. Inflation is hitting our hospital systems hard.

Second is workforce shortage: ""There are two million unfilled healthcare jobs in the United States,"" Toby explained; 500,000 of those are in nursing, while 50,000 are primary care physicians.

The third challenge is the explosion in knowledge: ""There's 1.8 million medical articles written every year,"" he noted, with the total amount of medical knowledge doubling every 73 days. It takes 13 years before empirically proven knowledge becomes the standard of care - so it's nearly impossible for providers to stay at the cutting edge of their field - and for our patients to receive the very latest in care.

Additionally, we touched on cybersecurity, something that we both agreed was top of mind for all health systems. ""I think there were 200 hospitals hacked in the first half of this past year,"" recalled Toby, explaining that most systems wouldn't be prepared for a cyber-attack. ""I don't think you can accomplish cyber security without blockchain,"" I remarked, citing how slow the healthcare industry has been in adopting this technology. ""I don't think you can,"" Toby confirmed.

As we looked to the future and the bright spots in healthcare today - Toby had a few observations.

On the workforce issue, telemedicine has opened up tremendous new capabilities, although its use has backslid too much since Covid. Toby recounted a personal story of being able to quickly diagnose and treat a poison ivy rash on his daughter with an uploaded photo in a telemedicine consult, rather than spending the time and money to take her to an emergency department. ""Hospitals can't be all things to all people,"" Toby remarked, a lesson he said he learned from his service during the Vietnam War. In Saigon, they triaged in a field hospital then moved to the next treatment location based on type of care needed. Today, we should concentrate people with high tech needs in health systems with just that, while less intensive care needs can be met at lower-tech hospitals or outpatient facilities. A poison ivy case, for example, is a great fit for telemedicine instead of a brick-and-mortar facility.

Finally, Toby shared that, ""AI is the salvation for a lot of the things going on in healthcare today."" It will make providers much more efficient. Ambient scribes will reduce physician burnout and improve patient satisfaction as the doctor spends time conversing rather than entering data into a chart. It will also empower healthcare professionals with more knowledge and will be particularly useful with administrative tasks. Globally, AI will be a gamechanger for the health systems of developing countries, helping them leapfrog a long way ahead.

As Bill Gates and others have said, we overestimate technology in the short run and underestimate it in the long run. Toby and I are both excited and optimistic about the future of healthcare in America, and around the world. The opportunity for more high-quality patient-centered care is just beginning."
Pennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Has Less Than 1-Point Lead In Polling Averages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/pennsylvania-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-has-less-than-1-point-lead-in-polling-averages/,2024-10-08T19:37:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in four of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than two points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) to win the White House.

Markets Project Smaller 2024 Interest Rate Cuts On Better Jobs News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/08/markets-project-smaller-2024-interest-rate-cuts-on-better-jobs-news/,2024-10-08T17:17:05Z,"With recent, stronger jobs data, markets expect the remaining anticipated interest rate cuts of 2024 to be 0.25% moves. That's down from expectations that both November and December Federal Open Market Committee meetings could see 0.5% cuts. Fixed income market expectations are tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool.

There was concern that the U.S. unemployment situation could weaken further. However, the Employment Situation Report for September showed clear improvement. Unemployment fell slightly for the second consecutive month to 4.1% and nonfarm payrolls rose 254,000. That's over 200,000 jobs added for the first time since May.

Now, the FOMC will see another jobs report on November 1 before its next meeting on November 6-7 and that data could change things. Inflation numbers will matter too. Nonetheless, for now, U.S. unemployment data is more positive than generally anticipated and inflation continues to trend lower.

This matters because if unemployment were to rise significantly, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates quite rapidly. That would be to try and reduce the risk of a recession. On the most recent data, a steep rise in unemployment is not happening.

Of course, inflation appears to be returning to the FOMC's 2% annual target, so that creates some momentum for less restrictive monetary policy. However, if the jobs market continues to appear robust, then there's perhaps a little less urgency for interest rate cuts.

The remaining scheduled FOMC interest rate decisions of 2024 are on November 7 and December 18. Currently, fixed income markets expect both to result in 0.25% interest rate cuts. That would leave short term interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 or 0.5% lower than current levels. The risk of a slightly larger or smaller interest rate move is balanced, but currently further 0.5% cuts in 2024 are viewed as unlikely just as is the scenario of the FOMC choosing to hold rates steady at either meeting.

In two recent speeches, policymakers have signaled confidence in monetary policy and advocated for a more gradual approach to interest rate cuts.

New York Fed President John Williams said that: ""The current stance of monetary policy is really well positioned to both hopefully keep maintaining the strength that we have in the economy and the labour market, but also continuing to see that inflation comes back to 2 per cent,"" in an interview with the Financial Times on October 7.

St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, said: ""My baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions."" At a speech in New York on October 7.

There is still more key economic data to come before the FOMC's next scheduled meeting on November 6-7. Primarily, that's the jobs report for October and inflation reports for September.

So far, the jobs markets appears to be performing better than expected since the FOMC last met, and inflation continues to trend lower. If that economic outlook continues, then it appears likely the FOMC will cut interest rates at its two remaining meetings of 2024, but only by 0.25% at each, rather than the previously estimated 0.5%."
6 Financial Matters To Discuss With Older Family Members,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cicelyjones/2024/10/08/6-financial-matters-to-discuss-with-older-family-members/,2024-10-08T17:16:50Z,"Discussing money, health, and mortality with loved ones can be incredibly difficult. Despite the discomfort you may feel, these discussions are critical to build trust and ensure the wellbeing of all the generations in your family. These are the six financial matters you should be discussing with your older family members.

Nobody wants to admit that they didn't plan well, but many Americans are ultimately unprepared for retirement. When I speak with young professionals, many express concerns about their aging parents and whether they may need to support them financially, but few understand what that need looks like because they haven't discussed it.

For older family members, particularly ones who may be dependent on you for support if their funds ran out, it's critical to understand their:

Let's say you're looking at an older family member who has $5,000 in monthly expenses, receives a net income of $3,500 from Social Security, and can sustainably take a net income of $1,000 per month from a $300,000 retirement account.

In this case, we're looking at a $500 shortfall every month, which would likely mean they're depleting their retirement account at an unsustainable rate and risking running out of retirement assets altogether. Since it's a smaller issue today, the remaining family may be able to provide that additional $500 per month to extend the life of the retirement assets or work with the older family member to make some budgeting or investment changes today.

Down the road, $1,500 per month in today's dollars might be a much more substantial burden for the family to try to shoulder.

You'll also want to understand if your older family member has any debts, including mortgages, credit card debts, business loans, personal loans, auto loans and student loans. If they do have debts, you'll want to understand their plans for repayment. If the debts are substantial and have high interest rates, they may want to consider debt consolidation or working with a debt specialist.

One of the biggest mistakes I see among the older generations is a failure to invest according to risk tolerance and financial goals. Either investors will hold onto mostly cash and lose substantial purchasing power to inflation, or they will take on way too much risk for someone who needs their assets for income. Inquire about your family member's asset allocation, income goals, and tolerance for risk to determine if their investment portfolios are acting as intended. If there is no coherent plan or things look off, encourage them to speak with a qualified financial professional.

If your loved one is charitably inclined and can easily pay for their own expenses, implementing charitable giving in their plan can create both tax and estate planning efficiencies. Discussing their favorite charities and causes they are passionate about can also lighten the mood and bring you closer during an otherwise heavy conversation.

As we age, our health can often decline, which drives up healthcare expenses. In the United States, individuals become eligible for Medicare when they turn 65 years old. They also have the option to add additional plans beyond the basic coverage to decrease their financial risk if they do become very sick. Inquire about what your family member has in place to be able to plan for potential costs.

Many people over the age of 65 will also have a need for long-term care coverage, which traditional Medicare does not cover. If a person can't do some basic activities of daily living and they need support every day, that care is called long-term care. It can be incredibly expensive, so try to understand if your loved one has insurance to cover this need or sufficient assets to self-insure. Usually, a surplus of about $400,000 in retirement funds will mean they may be able to self-insure.

Lastly, it's good to know if your loved one has any life insurance in place. If it is permanent coverage, the life insurance could be accessible during their life and provide a tax-free benefit to solve for financial issues they may leave behind when they pass, like burial costs, debts, and other expenses.

Lastly, it's critical to understand if your loved one has done estate planning. At a minimum, they need to have a will in place to dictate their final wishes. However, having a will still subjects many assets to probate. Probate is a lengthy and public legal process whereby the courts dictate how assets are dispersed. It can take years. Probate can be avoided by having a trust in place, putting necessary assets in the name of the trust, and correctly designating beneficiaries on all accounts with a direct beneficiary.

As your loved one ages, it may also be necessary to add in healthcare directives to dictate their medical care preferences and even medical or financial powers of attorney to provide support when they may not be able to make decisions for themselves.

Telling you or another trusted member of your family where to find these documents, along with information needed to access accounts, can make a medical or financial crisis easier to endure.

Discussing these financial matters can help ensure that both you and your older family members are better prepared for the future. It can also provide peace of mind knowing that everyone is on the same page regarding financial planning and management."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

Money Market Funds Are Losing Their Luster. Here's What Shines.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeljohnson/2024/10/08/money-market-funds-are-losing-their-luster-heres-what-shines/,2024-10-08T15:38:16Z,"The Fed's September 18th interest rate cut was a long time coming and a symbol of progress on inflation. It's a cause for celebration and a catalyst for re-examining investment strategies you favored during the higher-for-longer interest rate environment. With more rate cuts expected later this year, now's a perfect time to consider changes that could be advantageous to your portfolio.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not an advocate of timing the market, but I am a believer in managing your portfolio to capitalize on changing tradeoffs between risk and reward. Given the declining interest rate environment, it can be a smart move to hold less cash by moving up the risk curve and buying fixed income and equity investments.

With Decreasing Interest Rates, These Investment Options Shine Bright

For example, money is already flowing from money market funds into bond funds, as investors attempt to lock in yields before rates drop further.

Equity funds, particularly those holding dividend paying stocks, are also tempting investors to move out of cash for better returns. If all goes as planned and we avoid a recession, stocks should continue to generate higher returns than bonds over a 5- to-10-year period, and the dividend yields add an element of safety.

Speaking of the stock market, we've seen the dangers of being too growth-oriented over the last few months. Many tech stocks that had a good run-up got hammered - a reminder that the cost of high growth is high volatility. That volatility may be acceptable for younger investors, but I'm encouraging mature clients who want to invest some cash to consider diversifying their tech holdings with consumer staples.

Companies in this sector produce essential products that people use day in and day out. Food producers and manufacturers of household goods may sound like boring investments, especially compared to Nvidia, Alphabet, or Apple, but these large, established companies tend to be far more stable investments. The consumer staples sector provides modest growth, low volatility, reliable profits, and steady dividends, which is why I diversify with them in financial plans for clients in their 50s and 60s.

I can't stress enough the importance of owning a well-diversified portfolio when you've accumulated wealth that you want to preserve. Concentrating your assets amplifies the impact of volatility and changing market conditions, tempting you to move money and trade sectors at the worst possible times.

If you're like most investors, you might think you're well diversified, but you probably aren't, especially if you set up a portfolio two or three years ago. If your portfolio hasn't been rebalanced during that time, it's likely to be dominated by tech stocks. Contrary to popular belief, owning the big index funds doesn't provide enough equity diversification. Think about it: roughly 31% of the value of the S&P 500 Index is composed of stocks in the information technology sector.

At this stage of the economic cycle and in anticipation of more rate decreases, some investors are moving from cash into small and mid-cap stocks. There are two reasons this allocation could be beneficial. First, smaller businesses that want to grow in value will be able to borrow money at lower rates. Second, loans will be more affordable for bigger companies who want to acquire smaller ones.

With interest rate cuts underway, now's a great time to revisit your investment strategies and asset allocation decisions. Declining interest rates might prompt you to move out of cash. Any action you take should be based on your investment goals and personal situation within the context of a solid financial plan."
"Gold ETFs Rise By 18 Tonnes In September, Says World Gold Council",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roystonwild/2024/10/08/gold-etfs-rise-by-18-tonnes-in-september-says-world-gold-council/,2024-10-08T14:29:11Z,"Gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded further net inflows in September, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).

This fresh uplift was thanks to accelerating bullion demand in North America, and meant that funds have enjoyed five straight months of net inflows.

Global ETFs added 18 tonnes of the expensive metal last month, the WGC said, taking total holdings to 3,200 tonnes.

Cumulative inflows were worth $1.4 billion, the council said. This -- combined with a surging gold price -- propelled total assets under administration (AUMs) to $271 billion, a fresh all-time high.

Gold continues to surge as concerns over military action in the Middle East grow and investors prepare for interest rate cuts. The precious metal rose to new record peaks around $2,685 per ounce on September 26.

In North America, ETFs recorded their third successive net monthly inflow. Total holdings rose by 16 tonnes month on month, to 1,624 tonnes.

Fresh inflows were worth around $1.4 billion, which in turn lifted regional AUMs to $137 billion.

The WGC said that ""lower opportunity costs, related to interest rates and the dollar, boosted investor interest in gold ETFs."" It noted that ""the US Fed surprised investors with a cut of 50 basis points at their September gathering, pushing Treasury yields and the dollar down during the month.""

Asia-located funds also enjoyed another monthly net inflow in September to take the streak to 20 months.

ETFs added two tonnes of material, nudging aggregate holdings to 186 tonnes. AUMs rose to $16 billion, a $175 million month-on-month increase.

The WGC said that ""India again saw strong inflows,"" helped in part by strong gold price momentum and elevated geopolitical concerns.

However, ETFs in Europe recorded net outflows last month, the council noted. This was due predominantly to liquidation in the UK as hopes of Bank of England interest cuts receded.

The WGC commented that ""compared to the US Fed's easing efforts, the Bank of England (BoE) was more reserved, leaving rates unchanged at 5% at their September meeting, citing the upside risk of inflation from elevated wage growth.""

European funds lost two tonnes of material, which were worth a total of $245 million. As a consequence, total holdings and AUMs dropped to 1,325 tonnes and $112 billion respectively."
Inflation Reduction Act 2 Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-2-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T14:27:54Z,"In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
This $1 Billion Michigan RIA Shuns Alternatives In Favor Of Dividend Stocks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/this-1-billion-michigan-ria-shuns-alternatives-in-favor-of-dividend-stocks/,2024-10-08T13:51:33Z,"Background: Steinberg graduated from Michigan State University in 1984 with a degree in accounting and began his career specializing in tax preparation and planning at Deloitte. He went back to law school at the University of Michigan and then worked for a couple years as an estate-planning attorney for Honigman, Detroit's largest law firm. In 1993, he started as an advisor with many of his early clients being former colleagues from the law firm. Steinberg eventually started Blue Chip Partners in 2004 and brought on his longtime partner, Daniel Seder, a year later. Today the firm has 33 employees servicing roughly 800 clients.

Building Relationships: Blue Chip Partners has positioned itself to do the whole range of planning for clients -- from investments to taxes to estate planning -- all under one roof, with different subsidiaries of the business to help specialize in each segment. The firm also focuses on educating clients through a very active social media presence and even has its own podcast.

Competitive Edge: Steinberg says excellent employee hiring and retention as a pillar of the firm's success. Prospective hires all take the Caliper Profile assessment, a rigorous personality test designed to predict future job performance. This not only allows the team to hire from outside the business, but also to find 'team players' such as former college athletes, for instance, who understand the importance of working together or not winning every game of a match, says Steinberg.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: Blue Chip uses an independent investment department of which the primary equity portfolio strategy is dividend growth. Instead of an ETF- or mutual fund-heavy model, the team's core approach to equities is investing in companies that have a track record of paying and growing dividends. ""Every time a company raises their dividend we will send clients an email... because clients own individual stocks in their portfolio they have higher risk tolerance,"" says Steinberg. ""These companies have a track record, so in down markets clients are still getting positive emails that they raised their dividend and that helps their confidence."" In terms of asset allocation, Blue Chip generally favors a 70/30 allocation of equities with the rest a mix cash and fixed income. ""We tend to be more plain vanilla on fixed income, with some ETFs and lower cost mutual funds,"" says Steinberg. ""Trying to get too smart with bonds just doesn't work -- that portion of a client's portfolio should be defensive."" When it comes to alternatives, the firm has very limited exposure: ""We have chosen to keep things simple from a client standpoint.""

Investment Outlook: ""Unless one party sweeps the election and gets rid of the filibuster, we're unlikely to see dramatic changes that will have an effect on the market,"" says Steinberg. He and his team remain optimistic about the direction of the economy as inflation is likely to continue to moderate, though they don't anticipate interest rates to come down too quickly. ""Personally, I was surprised they did 50 basis points,"" says Steinberg. ""I thought with the presidential election they would maybe be a bit more conservative.""

Best Advice: ""You're going to have snow storms, but snow melts and things will continue to do well,"" Steinberg often tells clients. He recalls early in his career, he once called up a client to congratulate him for his portfolio losing less than the market during a downturn: ""He told me, 'Never tell a client they're doing well when they are losing money.'"""
Why Did JetBlue Stock Rise 15%?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/why-did-jetblue-stock-rise-15/,2024-10-08T12:09:22Z,"JetBlue stock (NASDAQ: JBLU) currently trades at $7 per share, more than 65% below its peak level of $22 seen in March 2021. In comparison, its peer - United Airlines stock (NASDAQ: UAL) saw its stock decline by around 3% over the same period. JBLU stock was up nearly 15% on Friday, Oct 4, after the reports of Spirit Airlines exploring bankruptcy filing emerged.

Spirit Airlines has been struggling to stay afloat amid losses. The company's reported losses increased from $473 million in 2021 to $677 million in the last twelve months. Now, JetBlue and Frontier Airlines are key competitors to Spirit Airlines, and if Spirit were to go bankrupt, JetBlue and Frontier stand to gain. This was reflected in Friday's uptick for these stocks.

But if we look at a slightly longer term, JBLU stock has performed worse than the broader market each year since 2021. Returns for the stock were -2% in 2021, -54% in 2022, and -14% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could JBLU face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery? After its recent rise, we think JBLU stock now looks overvalued. Even if Spirit were to file for bankruptcy, other airlines will need to invest more to capture the market share. With JetBlue's already high debt level, the company may find it difficult to raise additional funds. Moody's downgraded the ratings for JetBlue to B3 in August, after the company raised more money. Also, the company has spent cash for its operations in the last twelve months.

We estimate JetBlue's Valuation to be $6 per share, slightly below the current levels of $7. Our forecast is based on 0.2x sales for JetBlue, compared to its last eight-quarters average of 0.3x. A slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the near-term headwinds.

Our detailed analysis of JetBlue's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how JBLU stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

JBLU stock declined from nearly $9 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to below $4 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying JBLU stock lost almost 60% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $5 in early 2010, rising over 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

JBLU Fundamentals Over Recent Years

JetBlue's revenues increased sharply from $6.0 billion in 2021 to $9.3 billion in the last twelve months, owing to a solid recovery in travel demand post-pandemic. The company has benefited from increased capacity and higher yields in recent years. Despite higher revenue, the company saw its reported loss expand from $0.57 per share to a loss of $2.79 per share, due to a rise in both fuel and non-fuel expenses.

Does JBLU Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

JetBlue's total debt increased from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $6.0 billion now, while its total cash decreased from $2.8 billion to $1.5 billion over the same period. The company utilized cash of $73 million toward its operating activities in the last twelve months. Given that JBLU stock has lost significant value in recent years, its market capitalization now stands at just over $2.5 billion and its total debt of around $6 billion translates into a very high debt to equity ratio of 240%. The high debt burden is a near-term risk that the company faces.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiment, we believe JetBlue stock has the potential for gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, elevated fuel prices, high debt levels, and the impact from engine inspection remain the key near-term risk factors.

While JBLU stock appears to be fully valued, it is helpful to see how JetBlue Airways' Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
Forbes Daily: Nvidia Overtakes Microsoft As Market Cap Hits $3.19 Trillion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/08/forbes-daily-nvidia-overtakes-microsoft-as-market-cap-hits-319-trillion/,2024-10-08T11:57:16Z,"When inflation spiked in the wake of the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve was ""behind the curve"" in its response, one official from the central bank told Forbes.

Forbes recently spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on the target federal funds rate. The Fed began hiking rates in March 2022, and then raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to over 5% -- the fastest interest rate increase in four decades.

Looking ahead to the second half of the decade, Goolsbee is keeping a close eye on growth in productivity, which he said would support an expanding economy without inflation.

Despite losses for its big tech peers, Nvidia's stock rallied Monday, leading it to eclipse Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia registered its highest market cap since August at $3.19 trillion, trailing only Apple, valued at $3.4 trillion.

Influencers are touting egg donation as a cash cow to millions of followers on the internet. But while social media is helping to destigmatize fertility problems and procedures, some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of content that lures donors with big payouts is doing more harm than good.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered their worst days since early September following two new hurdles for investors that threaten to increase the cost of doing business and cut into profit margins. Crude oil prices and government bond yields, which influence borrowing costs as many loans are benchmarked against Treasury notes, both moved to multiweek highs Monday.

Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz tweeted that he and his wife will make a ""significant"" donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, a notable reversal of his previous support for former President Donald Trump. Still, Horowitz said Harris' campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the ""Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry.""

Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with 60 Minutes on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2035, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

One of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, now appears underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million, which is $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to a Forbes analysis.

The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. Prosecutors asked the company, formerly known as Twitter, to sign a non-disclosure agreement barring them from informing Trump or his associates about the warrant.

As Hurricane Milton, now a Category 4 storm, is slated to make landfall in Florida this week, major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference. Even if you're not traveling through Florida this week, your flight may be impacted, so monitor your airline's app for flight notifications.

The Supreme Court's new term kicked off Monday, and the justices are slated to hear cases on major issues like guns, transgender rights, vaping and environmental impact studies. The nation's highest court is likely to add a number of other key cases to its docket, including former President Donald Trump's criminal cases and challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness relief efforts.

TOPLINE Phoenix Capital Group, founded in 2019, says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently. But its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield-hungry investors.

Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like The Sean Hannity Show and webinars which it holds daily, founder Adam Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, says Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little-known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors.

From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its oil bonds yielding as much as 13%.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The private placement market is booming, offering a fast track for companies to raise capital,"" says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. ""Phoenix Capital Group has tapped into this trend, drawing mom-and-pop investors to its debt with promises of high yields and the opportunity to create 'generational wealth.' Yet, a recent deal between Phoenix and Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street behemoth, suggests that smaller investors might not be getting paid enough interest for the risk they're taking.""

Elon Musk announced his pro-Trump America PAC will pay for each successful referral of a registered swing state voter who signs a petition ""to show support for free speech and the right to bear arms"":

1 million: The number of swing state voters the petition seeks to sign on

$23.5 million: The amount the PAC would pay out if 500,000 signatures came from successful referrals

A lack of response, or ""ghosting,"" can be frustrating in the workplace, especially when it comes from your boss. First, assess whether their absence is out of character, and if so, give them leeway. Ensure your communication is concise and prioritized, establish regular check-ins and keep a detailed record of your communication attempts. If the behavior becomes a chronic issue, consider seeking advice on potential solutions from a mentor or senior leader.

During Sunday night's preseason NBA game between the L.A. Lakers and the Phoenix Suns, LeBron James found himself in a situation that left him wondering, ""'Is this The Matrix or something?' It just didn't feel real,"" he told ESPN. What happened during the game?

A. James sustained a concussion

B. He scored zero points for the first time in his career

Inflation Reduction Act Two Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T11:22:17Z,"This is the fourth article in a series exploring the Inflation Reduction Act's impact after two years. The first summarizes its total impact, the second details historic industry investment, the third tracks a clean manufacturing boom.

In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

A New Energy Era

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

Clean Electricity for Everyone

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

A Clean Power Future

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 8, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-08-24/,2024-10-08T10:58:18Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying teensy interest rates. But it's easy to find rates 10x higher if you know where to look. For instance, online banks and credit unions often pay much higher rates than brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Starbucks Stock: Path To $190,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/starbucks-stock-path-to-190/,2024-10-08T10:09:38Z,"Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is adding a new beverage The Pecan Crunch Oatmilk latte to its lineup, and it has been garnering good reviews. What makes this drink different from other seasonal favorites? This beverage boasts a pecan pie-inspired flavor, evoking the nostalgia of Thanksgiving. It aims to bridge the gap between the everyday routines of the fall season and the festive indulgences of the upcoming holiday season. This beverage has the potential to become a landmark product for the company, illustrating the impact a single, game-changing offering can have on a brand's trajectory. As exemplified by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, etc, have cultivated a devoted following and solidified the company's market position. Starbucks can also replicate this success, establishing a signature offering that resonates with consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and drives business growth.

Could Starbucks stock grow 2x in the next few years from the roughly $97 level it is at currently? Does this sound a bit ridiculous? Consider this - Starbucks' stock was trading at around $126 per share, almost 1.3x the current value in July 2021. We examine a scenario in this note where SBUX stock doubles from current levels, considering three key metrics: revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.

Does SBUX stock look attractive now?

Overall, the performance of SBUX stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and -1% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SBUX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We have revised our Starbucks' Valuation to $97 per share, based on a $3.58 expected EPS and a 27.1x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price.

Snapshot of Current Scenario

Starbucks' Revenues grew from $29 billion in 2021 to $36 billion in 2023 as the company's strength in digital orders helped it rebound quickly from the pandemic setback. The company saw strength in both U.S. business and growth in the International segment during this period. However, the company's sales have been taking a hit in FY 2024 so far. The company's total sales, inclusive of new stores, were down 1% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $9.1 billion in the third quarter (ended June 30), while its global comparable sales declined 3%. Starbucks faced significant external pressures, including eroding consumer confidence, elevated inflation, and disappointing growth in China, which comprises almost one-fifth of the company's business.

How Can An Iconic Product Improve Sales?

A flagship product can potentially boost foot traffic, enhancing comparable sales opportunities. During the recent third quarter ended June, Starbucks' global comparable store sales declined by 3%, primarily driven by a 2% decline in the U.S. and a 7% decline internationally. However, when compared to a similar period before the pandemic (Q3 2019) - when Starbucks was thriving thanks to exponential growth in China, innovation in products, and global coffee alliances with the likes of Nestlé - the company's comparable sales grew 6%, driven by a 7% growth in the Americas and 5% growth in China and Asia Pacific.

An uptick in foot traffic can revitalize customer loyalty for Starbucks, bolstered by its successful rewards program. Starbucks Rewards launched over a decade and a half ago - reported 33.8 million 90-day active rewards members in the U.S. as of June 30, an increase of 7% year-over-year (also up 2% quarter-over-quarter from Q2 2024). Nonetheless, comparative analysis reveals an opportunity for further growth. For perspective, SBUX's peer Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) rewards program, introduced in Q1 2019, has surpassed Starbucks' membership numbers, with 40 million members as of Q2 2024.

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain. It boasts an extensive network of nearly 39,500 global stores, with over 18,000 located in North America. The company's growth momentum remains strong, with 526 net new store openings in Q3 (of which 141 were in North America). For FY 2024, the company has planned a total of 580 new stores added, with renovations planned in more than 800 stores in North America. This strategic expansion is poised to fuel revenue growth, solidifying Starbucks' market position and driving future profitability.

Margins Could Improve Going Forward

Starbucks' net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) fell from levels of over 14% in 2021 to about 10% in 2022 amid increasing operating costs and increased promotional activities. Nevertheless, the company's net margins grew to about 11.5% in 2023 due to sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. At present, the coffee king's Q3 2024 net margins came in at 11.6% (down 90 basis points y-o-y), and earnings per share dropped 6% y-o-y to $0.93. Despite near-term challenges, we remain upbeat on Starbucks' prospects, anticipating a margin rebound to historical levels driven by the company's transformative turnaround strategy. CEO Brian Niccol outlined a US-focused turnaround plan centered on four key areas: barista empowerment for consistent quality, timely delivery of high-quality offerings, revitalizing the community coffee house experience, and highlighting Starbucks' unique story, including its Costa Rican coffee farm and innovation hub.

Consumers are also willing to pay for the products they deem premium, based on Starbucks' high gross margin (~67%) which gives the business room to absorb higher input costs while still being profitable. Starbucks has consistently been able to raise prices throughout the inflationary environment in the U.S. - and most loyal customers still come in despite higher pricing and inflationary pressures - demonstrating the strength of its business.

Impact on Starbucks' Valuation?

The Pecan Crunch latte's financial impact will be directly tied to its availability. While seasonal releases yield quarterly gains, a permanent menu addition would likely foster sustained revenue growth.

If we assume revenue growth of roughly 1.26x between 2023 and 2027 with margins growing from 11.5% in 2023 to about 21% in 2026, a roughly 2x increase, this would mean that its net income could grow from about $4.1 billion in 2023 ($3.58 per share) to about $9.5 billion (about $8.29 per share). Good times make it easier to imagine even better times - and when that happens, investors could begin to see Starbucks in a more favorable light, re-assessing the company's recovery path. For example, if Starbucks' investors assign a multiple of 23x following its stronger growth trajectory, this could translate into a stock price of about $190 per share by the end of 2027, assuming earnings of $8.29 per share. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won't make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, with Starbucks improving its revenues and margins, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. This is a huge business and Starbucks has valuable know-how in a competitive market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand - it just may not be quick and may require patience.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. SBUX Peers shows how Starbucks' stock compares against peers on metrics that matter. You will find other useful comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Mortgage Rates 8 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-08-10-24/,2024-10-08T08:59:49Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.44%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.34% and 4.19% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.39%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.29%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Halifax's latest house price report (published 7 October) reported that the value of the average home was 4.7% higher in September than the previous year, while Nationwide building society's latest report (published 30 September) put annual house price inflation at 3.7%. Both lenders say it's the strongest annual growth they have seen since November 2022.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, also reported five consecutive months of rises. It found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before, although on a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."

That's how much Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by through 2035, according to an estimate released Monday by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- still far smaller than the $7.5 trillion Trump's plan would cost. The organization noted its estimate is subject to a ""wide range of uncertainty,"" and actual figures could range anywhere from not having any impact on the deficit to costing $8.1 trillion at most.

""I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets,"" Harris declared at a September event hosted by the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, pushing back against her opponent Trump's attacks classifying Harris as a ""communist.""

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."
"Travel-Retail Sales Growing At Only Half The Pace Of Passenger Traffic, Says Kearney",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinrozario/2024/10/07/travel-retail-sales-growing-at-only-half-the-pace-of-passenger-traffic-says-kearney/,2024-10-07T23:21:06Z,"In its past glory years, the travel retail channel had it easy: annual passenger traffic grew steadily lifting retail sales at the same, if not higher, growth rates. Domestic retailers looked on in envy. However, in a post-Covid world, this correlation has disappeared.

At last week's Tax Free World Association ((TFWA) exhibition in Cannes, France -- where the movers and shakers in the duty-free world gather annually -- a new report shattered a few industry illusions.

One of them is that China would be a continuous source of high-spending travelers. Post-Covid, this has proved not to be the case despite their numbers rapidly returning to key markets like South Korea. There are several other factors constraining sales.

A new report from Kearney, commissioned by TFWA, shows that last year, passenger volumes grew by 30%, easily outstripping travel retail sales which rose by only 18% (see chart above). According to the global management consulting firm, the retail rise resulted in a global market valued at $72 billion, but last year's numbers also ""broke the mirroring between the two trends (of traffic and sales) for the first time in the industry's history.""

As well as the Chinese spending less, which has hit the Hainan market severely, Kearney says that travel retail's price advantage is facing long-term erosion. ""While enthusiasm for shopping in airports remains strong, behavioral patterns and expectations across generations of customers are evolving under new pressures,"" the firm stated.

Data from m1nd-set, a dedicated travel retail consultancy, indicate an attitudinal evolution from 2019 to 2024 with prices no longer top-of-mind for passengers. Over this period, m1nd-set's traveling consumer surveys show that the relevance of pricing advantage dropped significantly from 30% to just 13%. The same surveys -- using a panel of more than 230,000 shoppers -- point to promotions and value-for-money also decreasing in importance over the same period.

It seems strange that price could become so insignificant that quickly given the cost-of-living crises seen around the world in recent years. However, in July, the IMF left its 2025 growth forecast unchanged at 3.3%, broadly in line with 2024 and last year, which might mean some economic stabilization.

Nevertheless, in airports, price competition is evident. Another travel retail research agency, Pi Insight, ran a price comparison of the gin brand, Bombay Sapphire. Across 14 airports, it found large price variations of between +23% at Istanbul Airport and -29% at London Heathrow using Frankfurt Airport as the index (0%).

Gebr. Heinemann, a retail operator at both Istanbul and Frankfurt airports, told me: ""The price varies across airports as Bombay Sapphire is a global bestseller which is regularly available in promotional offers.""

According to Kearney, price is still a ""crucial concern"" for consumers, especially given ongoing inflationary pressures. In its own survey of 3,700 customers across 10 countries, 30% of respondents cited price as a barrier to purchase and 27% are using price-comparison tools to see if 'deals' are real or not.

As well as challenging price, 29% of respondents cited unsatisfying assortments as a reason not to purchase. The firm's report finds that spending by passengers has been steadily decreasing with average spending in 2023 down to $16 per passenger which is below pre-Covid levels. Between 2009 and 2018 the average was $17.50.

Importantly, younger travelers -- Millennials and Gen Zs -- prioritize unusual experiences over competitive prices and are becoming the largest single demographic. These generations are not being sufficiently addressed by travel retailers according to Kearney which said that they ""continue to place too much of an emphasis on discounted transactions to the detriment of storytelling, innovation, and personalized offers.""

The firm's top solution for greater sales conversion is the rapid adoption of technology, more personalized offers, and collaborative partnerships across the relevant stakeholders in the airport ecosystem.

One of the authors, Vincent Barbat, a partner at Kearney, said: ""The industry needs to move away from being price-centric to being more traveler-centric. The fact that revenues are no longer correlated with air passenger growth is further proof that new consumer dynamics resulting from a rapidly evolving travel retail landscape remain inadequately addressed.

""While technology alone will not guarantee blue skies and future prosperity for the industry, it does hold real promise. Some of its tools will allow for enhanced customer experiences and greater product personalization; the true challenge lies in striking the right balance between high-tech and high-touch, keeping the industry both efficient and human.""

There is consensus around tech: airports have been busy automating and digitalizing every step of the travel journey, for example at Abu Dhabi International. Speeding things up will give passengers more time to shop. More passengers are also tech enthusiasts; 45% say they frequently use in-store tools to enhance their shopping experience. This gives retailers an easy route to drive conversion using AR/VR and eventually AI-powered personal shoppers."
U.S. Equities Surge In Best Election Year Since 1936,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/us-equities-surge-in-best-election-year-since-1936/,2024-10-07T20:24:59Z,"As we approach the final stretch of 2024, much of the nation's focus is on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. But while the political landscape remains uncertain, the markets are painting a different picture. September, traditionally a sluggish month for global equities, delivered an unexpected surge.

The S&P 500 gained 2.02%, marking its strongest September since 2013. This brought its year-to-date return to 22.08%, making 2024 the best presidential election year for stocks in almost 90 years (more on that later).

Bitcoin has been another standout performer. Once viewed with skepticism by traditional investors, the digital currency posted a nearly 8% gain last month, bringing its year-to-date growth to an astonishing 51%. With the Federal Reserve adopting a dovish stance, the U.S. dollar has weakened, prompting investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against inflation and uncertainty.

Election years often bring volatility as markets grapple with the uncertainty surrounding potential changes in leadership, but 2024 has proven to be an outlier. Central bank easing has provided a powerful tailwind, helping to stabilize markets and lift stocks higher, despite lingering concerns over who will occupy the White House next year.

In fact, 2024 is shaping up to be the best presidential election year for stocks in nearly 90 years. By the end of September, the S&P 500 had risen more than 22%, the highest return during an election year since 1936. Investors have embraced the Fed's commitment to looser monetary policy, which has kept market sentiment buoyant despite the political backdrop.

Beneath the surface of these impressive market gains, however, lies a more complex picture of the U.S. economy. It's a tale of two sectors: while services continue to thrive, manufacturing is struggling.

The U.S. services sector -- which accounts for nearly 80% of the country's GDP -- has now expanded for 20 consecutive months. New orders continue to grow, driven by steady consumer demand and a reduction in interest rates, which has made borrowing more affordable for businesses and households alike, according to S&P Global. Despite some moderation from the 14-month high we saw in August, the sector looks strong, providing a foundation for economic stability.

In contrast, the manufacturing sector is showing signs of strain. The end of the third quarter saw manufacturing dip deeper into contraction territory. Slowing demand, both domestically and internationally, has weighed heavily on the sector, and many analysts are pointing to broader economic challenges as the cause. The uncertain outcome of the upcoming election has only added to the unease, as companies hold off on major investments until they have a clearer sense of the country's political direction.

In addition to domestic economic concerns, several external factors threaten to disrupt the positive momentum we've seen in the markets.

Hurricane Helene, for instance, serves as a reminder of the unpredictable risks posed by Mother Nature. The storm caused what could amount to $34 billion in total economic losses, with insured damages expected to exceed $6 billion.

The recent resolution of the dockworker strike at East Coast and Gulf ports -- a potential ""man-made disaster,"" according to President Joe Biden -- is a welcome development, but its impact will likely linger. The strike, which disrupted one of the busiest shipping periods of the year, created a huge backlog of goods waiting to be processed. Major retailers like Walmart, Ikea and Home Depot, which rely heavily on these ports for imported goods, were among the hardest hit.

As operations resume, shipping giants such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have warned that freight costs are likely to rise as a result of the delays. While the strike itself has ended (for now), the fallout could affect supply chains well into the fourth quarter, particularly as retailers ramp up for the holiday season.

Despite these challenges, there's still reason for optimism as we head into the holiday season. Adobe is forecasting a record $240.8 billion in online holiday sales, an 8.4% increase over 2023. Electronics and apparel are expected to be the standout categories, driven by deep discounts as retailers aim to move inventory.

As we move into the final quarter of 2024, there's much to be hopeful about. Central bank easing has provided a strong foundation for market growth, and the holiday season promises to deliver robust consumer spending.

At U.S. Global Investors, we believe in taking a long-term view. While the short-term outlook remains favorable, it's essential to stay diversified and prepared for whatever the future may hold. As always, our focus is on helping investors navigate both the opportunities and challenges ahead."
Dow Suffers Worst Day In A Month As Rising Bond Yields A New Wrench For Investors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/07/dow-suffers-worst-day-in-a-month-as-rising-bond-yields-a-new-wrench-for-investors/,2024-10-07T20:11:19Z,"Stocks tumbled Monday as the market digested new risks complicating the benefits of the much-awaited interest rate cuts on the equity market.

The recent rise in bond yields comes as a relative surprise compared to expectations for the bond market after the Federal Reserve rolled out a big 50 basis-point rate cut Sept. 18. Treasury yields serve as a rough proxy for fixed income investors' expectations for monetary policy, and, considering the consensus view that the Fed will keep bringing interest rates down, climbing government bond yields do not align with that view. The 10-year Treasury yield is often used as the baseline for loans such as mortgages, meaning some borrowing costs are actually higher now than they were prior to the Fed's cut. Bond yields also shot up Friday after the U.S. reported far stronger September job growth than expected. ""The bond market is becoming less skeptical on the soft landing outcome,"" explained Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson in a Monday note to clients.

Though higher bond yields can evoke bad memories for equity investors -- see the 2022 unraveling as the inflation crisis deepened -- it's not necessarily a bad omen for stocks. The 10-year is down a full percentage point over the last year and about 0.4 percentage points over the last six months. And yields are rising because the U.S. economy looks stronger than anticipated, a potential boon for earnings growth, with Wilson noting the increased odds of a soft landing ""should support more cyclical leadership in equities."" Over the weekend, Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin raised their year-end price target for the S&P from 5,600 to 6,000 and its 12-month target from 6,000 to 6,300, indicating 5% and 10% further upside, respectively, citing the ""steady macro outlook.""

""Our job's to be worried about everything,"" Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, told Forbes last week when asked about how new shocks like higher oil prices may impact the trajectory of monetary policy."
Vanguard BrandVoice: 4 Trends Transforming How America Saves For Retirement,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vanguard/2024/10/07/4-trends-transforming-how-america-saves-for-retirement/,2024-10-07T19:03:53Z,"From building your nest egg to navigating financial hurdles, everyone's journey to retirement is unique -- but a clear road map is key to success. This is evident in research conducted by investment management company Vanguard in its comprehensive How America Saves 2024 report, which explores hundreds of retirement contribution plans, thousands of data points and the actions of millions of participants. For the past 23 years, Vanguard has been researching retirement trends and using data to help plan administrators optimize offerings.

The result? Retirement plan designs that are built to weather economic challenges, such as high interest rates and rising inflation. Despite these challenges, 2023 was a year of progress for retirement savings. The report found that 85% of eligible employees were enrolled in a plan, with an average saving rate of 7.4% of income -- an all-time high.

""These trends show the remarkable commitment that sponsors and consultants have made to help employees reach their financial goals,"" says John James, managing director of Vanguard Institutional Investor Group.

Here are four key findings from Vanguard's report that illustrate how thoughtful plan designs built for today's workforce can help employees confidently stay the course while saving for retirement.

Historically, eligible employees had to opt in to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. But now, the report shows more plans are automatically enrolling participants, leading to higher participation rates. Ten years ago, only 35% of plans had a participation rate above 90%, per the report. ""For a variety of reasons -- inertia, procrastination, poor planning -- some employees never enrolled,"" says James. In 2023, 57% of Vanguard plans had a participation rate of 90% or higher.

""With autoenrollment, inertia actually works in employees' favor, because now they're effectively being asked whether they'd like to quit the plan,"" James says.

He adds that plan participants and plan managers are also taking advantage of other automatic options, including automatic increases in deferral rates and investment in target-date funds.

""In the aggregate, these automatic features work well because they reduce the number of decisions that participants must make, decisions that many employees don't feel confident about,"" says James.

Professionally managed allocations, or PMAs, are when participants have their entire account invested in a single target-date fund (TDF), a target-risk fund or a traditional balanced fund, or else managed in an account advisory service. The report shows that in 2023, 66% of participants were invested in a PMA, up from 7% 20 years ago.

James credits this surge to several factors, including the vast majority (96%) of plans offering TDFs. Overall, 64% of all contributions went into TDFs in 2023, an all-time high, says James. The report says an important factor driving the popularity of TDFs is their function as an automatic or default investment strategy, minimizing the need for participants to self-manage their accounts and creating more balanced portfolios for savers. Because allocations are automatically adjusted based on a participant's expected retirement timeline, savers can feel confident while taking a hands-off investing approach.

""TDFs have also done an incredible job of reducing extreme equity allocations, meaning participants with a 0% or 100% equity allocation,"" says James. ""Just 8% of participants had such an extreme allocation in 2023, whereas before TDFs and advice were widely offered, more than a third of participants had a 0% or 100% equity allocation.""

It's a balancing act for employees to manage saving for retirement with other financial goals, says James. Plan participants' holistic financial well-being is now a priority for plan sponsors, and advice is becoming a key component of their efforts.

Recognizing the role advice can play in building financial wellness and confidence, more plan managers included advice opportunities among their offerings. According to the report, 43% of plans offered advice in 2023, providing access to 77% of plan participants.

""A qualified advice program should help participants avoid making investment errors,"" says James. ""For example, behavioral coaching and emotional support, especially during periods of market turmoil, can help participants avoid performance chasing and panic selling.""

Professional guidance included in a plan simplifies investing and helps savers optimize long-term outcomes, he says. Per the report, only 10% of plan participants used advice services in 2023, but James is optimistic this percentage will grow as more plans incorporate advice and more participants know these services are available to them.

An evolving workforce means that retirement plans must meet the needs of all employees, including Gen Z and Millennials, who are becoming a substantial portion of the labor market. ""Our research shows that younger workers are especially benefiting from improved plan designs,"" James says. ""Participation rates of workers ages 25 to 34 have risen from 74% to 83% in the past 10 years.""

The report says plan sponsors are also seeking ways to support retirees within their plans: Sixty-seven percent allowed retirees to take installments and 40% of plans offered partial withdrawals, a significant increase from 27% in 2018.

Not only that, but the deferral rate for workers ages 25 to 34 increased by more than 20%, from 5.5% to 6.7%, between 2014 and 2023. Vanguard plans also provide additional investment avenues, such as making Roth contributions, which younger and higher-income participants tend to use. Over 80% of Vanguard plans had a Roth savings feature and 17% of plan participants took advantage of it, up from 12% in 2019.

Designing Retirement Plans For Success

As retirement plan designs continue to evolve amid a shifting financial landscape and workforce, it's clear that plan sponsors are responding effectively to participants' needs. With tools like automatic enrollment and PMAs, including advice, employees are better positioned to achieve their long-term financial goals.

Plus, plans that contain a robust suite of investment options, such as TDFs and Roth contributions, allow participants to customize their retirement strategy. These innovations, and more to come, are paving the way for stronger saving habits and more secure retirements for all."

The price of gold today, as of 4:50pm, was £2,022.01 per ounce. That's up 0.10% on yesterday's closing price of £2,019.99.

Compared to last week, the price of gold is up 1.55%, and it's up 5.85% from one month ago.

The 52-week gold price high is £2,022.40, while the 52-week gold price low is £1,898.58.

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation."
How The Hospital Industrial Complex Robs Poor Patients,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypipes/2024/10/07/how-the-hospital-industrial-complex-robs-poor-patients/,2024-10-07T16:22:42Z,"Sally Pipes is a scholar and think tank CEO who writes on health care.

Pharmaceutical leader Johnson & Johnson recently unleashed a firestorm in Washington after it proposed a change to how it offers discounted prices on two drugs in a little-known, but enormous, federal program that's hurting the low-income patients it was created to help.

That program, known as the ""340B Drug Pricing Program,"" allows certain hospitals -- and their affiliated clinics and pharmacies -- to access medicines at significantly lower prices offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

To help ensure that 340B discounts are being obtained lawfully and benefit the low-income patients they're intended for, J&J proposed offering such discounts as retroactive rebates -- rather than upfront discounts -- for a subset of 340B hospitals on two of its medicines. This change was intended to help bring much-needed transparency to the 340B program.

Officials at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), who run the program, blew a gasket. HRSA, whose mission is to provide ""equitable health care to the nation's highest-need communities,"" effectively announced that unless J&J backed down, the agency would kick the drug maker out of Medicare and Medicaid.

J&J has now decided to forgo implementation. But the concerns the company raised are wholly appropriate. Because the alleged behavior of many 340B hospitals is well-documented by government oversight agencies, raises patient and taxpayer costs, and boosts hospital profits, the current iteration of 340B ultimately detracts from the stated mission of the program.

One of 340B's most significant problems stems from the interaction of the program with Medicaid, the joint federal-state insurer for poor and indigent Americans. To have their drugs covered by Medicaid, drug makers must offer at least a 23.1% discount off their regular prices.

Federal law doesn't allow for 340B and Medicaid discounts to be paid on the same medicine. But that seems to be what's happening. Many hospitals and federal grantees are buying drugs at a discount, and state Medicaid programs are collecting hefty rebates for the same medicines given to the same patient.

The problem is only going to get worse as the Inflation Reduction Act is fully implemented and price controls, starting with 10 drugs under Medicare Part D in 2026, roll through the system. The IRA pours fuel on the fire with another government-mandated price, where duplication is illegal. For those keeping tabs, HHS is implementing all three programs, but the various hands are not talking to each other -- and not proactively trying to address these issues.

Thanks to the lack of transparency in the program, it's impossible to know just how widespread this double-dipping is. The process of interaction between 340B discounts and Medicaid discounts is opaque, and officials either can't or won't answer the question of how often this abuse occurs.

Hospitals have found new ways to profit off of 340B in recent years. Under the program, hospitals that meet certain criteria (for example, serving a certain percentage of low-income patients) are eligible to buy prescriptions from drug manufacturers at substantial mandatory discounts -- as much as half off. Hospitals can then charge insurers a higher price, pocketing the difference.

Health systems should use these savings to provide more charity care. But a loophole in the law means hospitals don't have to use or prove the money is to help the indigent. In practice, many simply keep the savings for themselves rather than passing them along to uninsured or underinsured patients.

Due to increasing hospital ownership consolidation, numerous facilities with little connection to poor communities have become eligible for 340B discounts. Of the nearly 3,000 hospitals in the program, only 35% are located in medically underserved neighborhoods. In fact, 85% of 340B hospitals make more money from 340B than they provide in total charity care.

Abuse of the 340B program doesn't just divert finite resources away from low-income patients. A study from a Columbia University economist found that the program could actually increase taxpayer costs in the long term ""by increasing provider consolidation, distorting incentives for efficient care, and impacting overall utilization.""

How can this be? For one, 340B incentivizes healthcare facilities to consolidate, leading to less competition and higher patient costs. And when drug makers are forced to hand over improper discounts to hospitals, they may simply raise prices elsewhere to accommodate for the lost revenue.

These distortions have become even more of a concern in recent years, as experts have warned that 340B hospitals could be illegally collecting duplicative discounts for the same medicines. Research firm IQVIA estimated that in 2021, ""manufacturers will be responsible for $20-25 billion in duplicate discounts that may not have been owed.""

Curiously, congressional outrage hasn't been directed at the parties responsible for this continued malfeasance. Instead, a letter from 189 lawmakers took aim at J&J as a menace to poor communities for attempting to make the discount system more transparent and less susceptible to exploitation, even though the behavior that J&J is attempting to root out is plainly illegal.

Yet, with no government enforcement mechanism in place to stop this multi-billion-dollar money grab, it's no wonder why J&J proposed to substitute rebates for up-front discounts to get a better handle on the problem and prevent redundant payments that raise overall costs.

Genuine congressional oversight would entail determining if unlawful double-dipping is going on and whether officials at HRSA, CMS (which oversees Medicaid), and elsewhere are turning a blind eye. Instead, we got political theater free of any real policy substance.

As it stands, the ongoing abuse of 340B and Medicaid discounts is enriching huge hospital conglomerates at the expense of patients, employers, state governments, poor communities, and taxpayers."
What To Expect From September's CPI Inflation Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/07/what-to-expect-from-septembers-cpi-inflation-report/,2024-10-07T16:20:48Z,"Consumer Price Index inflation data to be released on October 10 is expected to provide some support for the Federal Open Market Committee cutting rates in November. However, unemployment data may ultimately matter more for the FOMC's decision making.

All inflation metrics are down over the past 12 months according to the Atlanta Fed's Dashboard that measures a range of inflation metrics. Specifically, headline annual CPI inflation is 2.5% to August 2024 and core CPI, which removes swings in food and energy prices is 3.2%.

Although these figures do not hit the FOMC's 2% inflation goal, inflation is running at a much lower rate than for much of the 2021-2023 period. As a result the FOMC made the first interest rate cut of this cycle in September, recognizing that monetary policy no longer needed to be as restrictive with significant progress on inflation.

Inflation nowcasts from the Cleveland Fed call for reassuring inflation data. They expect 0.1% monthly inflation for headline CPI for September and 0.3% monthly core inflation. Should these forecasts hold, they would provide further reassurance for the FOMC that inflation is now under control. However, some minor concerns remain.

Firstly, shelter costs, which make up a large portion of CPI inflation continue to rise at a relatively fast 5.2% annual rate as of August 2024. Reaching the FOMC's 2% target may require shelter costs to cool from these levels. Secondly, the FOMC continues to monitor for unexpected shocks that could cause inflation to resume. For example, the dockworkers' strike ending with a substantial pay increase recently is the sort of thing the FOMC will be monitoring, to make sure wage-lead inflation doesn't resume.

Inflation was among the more closely watch economic indicators in recent years, given the surge in prices. Now, the FOMC is paying closer attention to the other component of its dual mandate - maintaining full employment. Typically, when the FOMC raises rates abruptly, increases in unemployment result. We've seen that to some degree this cycle with unemployment now at 4.1% for September compared to 3.8% in September 2023. However, so far the increase in unemployment has been sufficiently gradual, so far, to ease fears of a potential recession. Still, jobs data is likely to get more attention than inflation data should inflation continue to ease back towards 2%.

The FOMC next sets interest rates on November 7. Therefore, the October 10 figures will be the last CPI release before that meeting. However, there will be a Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index release on October 31, which may offer further insight on U.S. inflation trends.

It is expected that the FOMC elects to cut interest rates by 0.25% according to the CME FedWatch Tool, with some chance that rates are held steady. Previously, markets anticipated a material chance of a larger 0.5% cut. However, that probability has faded with unexpectedly robust jobs data for September, with the economy adding a higher than expected 254,000 jobs. Should inflation continue to cool, so it is likely that the FOMC continues to cut rates. However, the pace of loosening monetary policy may be more informed by jobs data than inflation figures."
Bad But Well-Intentioned Career Advice From Parents,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/07/bad-but-well-intentioned-career-advice-from-parents/,2024-10-07T15:19:41Z,"We may love our parents, but with any family dynamics, there are bound to be disagreements. While parents may have the best intentions for their kids, their advice can sometimes be outdated.

When you're searching for a new job or attempting to grow your career, one or both of your parents may bombard you with all of their advice and suggestions. They'll inform you that they are older, and, therefore, wiser and know what is best for you.

Unfortunately, they haven't been in the job market for decades, so their guidance may not hold up in the current environment. Nevertheless, it's a foregone conclusion that they'll lecture you on all aspects of the labor market.

You'll wince when they push you toward a safe career, such as becoming a doctor, lawyer or software engineer. Despite the fact that these careers don't appeal to you, they'll talk all about their friends' kids who are wonderfully successful in these occupations.

While these are respectable professions, there are countless other fulfilling and lucrative career options. It can be too much pressure on a young adult to lead a life and career that they are not enthusiastic about or have the ability to excel in.

Moreover, while your parents' advice may come from a place of love and care, it's essential to adapt it to the modern workplace. By critically evaluating different perspectives, you can make informed decisions about your career path.

Parents often say, ""Back in my day, you stayed at an organization for the entire duration of your career. There was none of that jumping around. You made a commitment to the company and you stay there."" They'll tell you, ""Keep your head down, stay out of trouble and you'll do fine.""

This advice may have held up for them, but in today's workforce, nobody is going to just give you a promotion or new job. You have to put yourself out there and seize the opportunity.

You have to get yourself noticed by the right people who can help grow your career. Competition is fiercer today now that more professionals hold four-year degrees compared to during our parents' time. Job security is at greater risk with the emergence of technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence. With the advent of remote work, it may be harder to get noticed by your supervisor now that you lack proximity and access to them in the physical workplace.

Workers no longer feel a sense of loyalty to their company because they have since realized how one-sided the relationship is. The notion that a company is a ""family"" has irrevocably been busted.

For decades, corporations have branded themselves as a big, happy family. However, employees now see it for what it really is: transactional. A family would never fire grandma right before Christmas.

People have caught on to the fact that loyalty comes with a price. In recruiting, there's a concept known as the ""loyalty discount,"" which refers to the compensation of long-term employees. This phenomenon occurs when an individual has been with a company for an extended period, such as 10 or 20 years. Initially, their starting salary may have been comparatively modest. Over time, with annual salary increases typically ranging from 1% to 2%, and factoring in the effects of inflation, these loyal employees often find their compensation considerably under market compared to those who frequently change jobs.

Job-hoppers tend to secure more substantial pay increases, often in the range of 10% to 20% with each career move, resulting in a notable disparity in earnings between long-term employees and those who change employers more frequently.

While that approach might be effective in dating, it doesn't apply to job interviews. If you appear standoffish, cold, distant or aloof, it won't create an air of mystery or intrigue; instead, it will lead interviewers to think you lack interest in the position.

Hiring managers are looking for candidates who genuinely want the job and are enthusiastic about the opportunity. They are not interested in pursuing someone who seems indifferent. If you are coy and unclear about how you feel about the opportunity, and plenty of other applicants are available, they'll just move on. Ultimately, they will avoid hiring someone who behaves as if they are doing you a favor by accepting the position.

Against your parent's advice, if you are interested in a job opportunity, make it clear that you want it. For example, at the end of the interview process, let the hiring manager know, ""I really enjoyed meeting with everyone and the role is a perfect fit for my background. If you are considering putting together an offer -- and I hope that you are -- I'd gladly accept the compensation we discussed.""

By stating this, the hiring manager doesn't have to worry about competing with a counteroffer. There is political capital spent getting an offer approved. At large companies, it has to go through several channels and a bunch of red tape. If a candidate later rejects the offer, it makes the team involved in the hiring process look bad.

In baseball, coaches may say, ""Don't swing at the first pitch."" It translates to ""there may be a better pitch thrown, if you wait a little longer"" or ""don't be too impatient.""

This cliché is also used in job searches. Your parents may admonish you for taking the first offer that's extended to you. Their old-school thinking is that there are so many other jobs available, so it's worthwhile to keep swinging until you get the perfect pitch.

In a tight job market, characterized by layoffs and financial insecurity, it may make sense to lock in the job. Since hiring has significantly slowed down, you may not have the luxury of plentiful choices. Also, to get this one offer, you had to endure over six months of interviews, meeting with 12 people from the company, completing a take-home project and pre-employment psychological assessment. You are invested!

If you believe in your heart that this is the right next step, don't let anyone talk you out of it just because it was the first offer.

While dressing professionally is important, you want to ensure that your interview attire aligns with the company's culture. Different industries have varying expectations for professional attire.

Dressing appropriately for the specific sector or company allows the interviewer to begin envisioning you as part of their team. In some casual work environments, like tech startups, wearing overly formal attire might make you appear too rigid.

Disconnecting from work is essential for your physical and mental health. To avoid falling victim to presenteeism or burnout, you must set clear boundaries to protect your overall well-being.

It is also important to allow yourself time to rest and recover, as you are no good to anybody if you feel run down. This means not checking work emails or taking calls while out of the office, unless urgent. Do not hesitate to delegate tasks to your team, as that is what they are there for.

To avoid burnout, make sure you are using your personal, vacation and sick days to give yourself respite. If your workload is overwhelming, request a meeting with your manager to discuss work-life balance concerns.

Your folks may suggest, ""Networking is just about who you know."" While connections are important, building genuine relationships based on mutual benefit is essential for long-term success.

In their day, they'd attend an event with a sticker on their jacket with their name, company and corporate title. People would shake their sweaty hands and check to see where everyone aligned in the corporate hierarchy. However, professional networking has evolved significantly over the decades, transforming from primarily face-to-face interactions to a blend of in-person and digital connections."
Democratizing Finance: How Web3 Bridges The Gap For The Underbanked,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/07/democratizing-finance-how-web3-bridges-the-gap-for-the-underbanked/,2024-10-07T15:08:01Z,"The global financial landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by rapid advancements in technology. In particular, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies promises to break down traditional barriers to financial services, making them more accessible to individuals and communities that have long been excluded. As of 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide remain unbanked, meaning they have no access to formal banking institutions. Another 1 billion are underbanked, lacking sufficient access to affordable financial products. This exclusion contributes to cycles of poverty, as it limits individuals' ability to save, borrow, or invest. However, decentralized technologies, which utilize blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, offer a new pathway to financial inclusion, providing innovative solutions for these underserved populations.

Web3 technologies, which refer to a decentralized version of the internet built on blockchain, represent a significant departure from traditional centralized financial systems. Instead of entirely relying on intermediaries such as banks or payment processors, Web3 enables peer-to-peer transactions and automated financial services. For the underbanked, this is revolutionary. Access to digital wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and cryptocurrencies means that people can store, transfer, and grow their wealth independently of traditional financial institutions, avoiding high fees and geographical limitations while complying to regulatory compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

Key industry players in this space are already making significant strides toward democratizing finance. Mastercard, in collaboration with MetaMask and Baanx, recently launched a crypto-to-fiat card allowing MetaMask wallet users to spend their cryptocurrency directly in fiat currency at any location accepting Mastercard. This new solution removes the need for intermediaries like exchanges or banks, making it easier for self-custodial wallet users to access funds outside the crypto space. This initiative is a step towards connecting Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, empowering underbanked individuals with instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for everyday purchases.

Another company actively driving financial inclusion through Web3 technologies is CrossFi, founded by Alexander Mamasidikov. It creates decentralized finance (DeFi) tools that aim to democratize access to financial services, empowering everyone to take control of their own financial futures. By building a bridge between traditional banking and DeFi, CrossFi offers a suite of products that allows users to seamlessly manage both fiat and cryptocurrency assets. These innovative products include the world's first non-custodial payment card, enabling users to spend cryptocurrency directly from their Web3 wallets, without the need for a third-party custodian or exchange. For millions of people across various socioeconomic backgrounds who don't have access to conventional banking, this on-chain payment card represents a gateway to the global economy, enabling their access to secure, transparent, and efficient financial services.

""We believe that financial inclusion is not just about offering financial services -- it's about creating accessible, secure, and user-friendly tools that anyone can use, regardless of where they are in the world,"" said Alexander Mamasidikov, founder of CrossFi.

Another player in the Web3 finance space is 1inch, known for its decentralized finance products. The 1inch Wallet and 1inch Card provide users with seamless ways to manage and spend digital assets. The 1inch Card allows for crypto-to-fiat conversion at competitive rates and supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, ensuring that users can make everyday purchases with crypto while benefiting from secure, fast transactions. With features like a physical and virtual card, it empowers individuals to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional financial systems.

However, as with any new financial technology, regulatory frameworks need to be in place to prevent misuse. Fintech companies like CrossFi need to ensure compliance with local regulations by requiring users to pass Know Your Customer (KYC) checks before obtaining their credit cards. These companies work closely with local regulators and banking partners to maintain full compliance across all products, backed by dedicated legal teams that monitor and adhere to the legal requirements of each geography.

""Robust compliance and regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure that web3-powered DeFi innovations operate within the boundaries of the law. Without clear guidelines, we risk creating a system vulnerable to exploitation. That's why, at CrossFi, we prioritize full compliance, leaving no loopholes in our approach. It's crucial for us to adhere to the laws in the different regions we operate, as it ensures trust and long-term sustainability for our users,"" said Mamasidikov.

Beyond payment cards, innovations like stablecoins and decentralized lending platforms are also playing a crucial role in extending financial services to the underbanked. Stablecoins, for instance, are digital currencies pegged to a stable asset such as the U.S. dollar issued by Circle or Hong Kong dollar issued by IDA. These offer a secure and reliable alternative to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies, making them an ideal option for people in regions with unstable currencies or inflationary economies. Additionally, decentralized lending platforms enable individuals to access credit without needing a traditional bank account or credit score, opening up new opportunities for financial empowerment.

Olga Feldmeier, a prominent blockchain expert and CEO of Smart Valor, an AI-powered crypto investment platform, believes that DeFi has the potential to completely reshape the financial landscape by making essential financial services more accessible to all. ""Stablecoins, for example, can serve as a lifeline for people living in countries with hyperinflation, providing them with a way to protect their wealth and participate in the global economy,"" Feldmeier explained.

Mamasidikov also shares a similar view: ""The real power of Web3 in democratizing finance lies in its ability to provide programmable liquidity and trust-less financial instruments. By leveraging decentralized protocols, we can bypass traditional gatekeepers and offer financial services that are not bound by geographic borders or legacy banking infrastructure. In this context, stablecoins represent a breakthrough in providing stability in uncertain economic environments. They allow people to store and transfer value securely and affordably, particularly in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or unreliable.""

The movement towards decentralized finance is still in its early stages, but it holds immense potential for creating a more inclusive financial system. By eliminating intermediaries and providing direct access to financial services, innovative Web3 technologies can empower individuals to take control of their finances, no matter where they are located. In doing so, they are helping to bridge the gap for the underbanked and pave the way for a more equitable global economy.

Ultimately, the democratization of finance through Web3 is not just about technology; it's about creating a fairer, more inclusive system that gives everyone the opportunity to participate in the global economy. The future of finance is decentralized, and it's one where everyone has a seat at the table."
5 Stocks To Own For The 2024 Elections & Beyond!,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenberman/2024/10/07/5-stocks-to-own-for-the-2024-elections--beyond/,2024-10-07T14:10:05Z,"Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut ""party,"" which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year's robust gains

The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren't going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India's middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade

The U.S. economy's relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns

After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections

Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance

Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases

Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities

Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond

2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector's continued leadership and the bull market's broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023.

Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq's extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years.

The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the ""New Golden Age of Stock Picking"" that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that.

But, before diving deep into the Gorilla's top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail!

Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer

Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market's continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros.

August's deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs' (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power.

There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer's pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don't believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist.

The Fed's New Focus: Jobs and Growth

The Fed's fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer.

What's more, inflation is now officially in the Fed's rear-view mirror, and the past few months' trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed's new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years.

Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates.

Let's see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed's easing cycle.

Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead?

Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system's strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector's stability in the face of last year's regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla's main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024.

So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer's gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August's pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon.

Evidence for a ""soft landing"" is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia's war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks.

With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring ""Goldilocks"" conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions.

A Maturing Bull Market

Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a ""slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year."" By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter's grinding and ""boring"" advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don't closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets.

Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla's expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally's base is undeniable.

The odds are that this year's trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November's elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year's increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party!

If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year.

The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies.

Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won't slow down anytime soon.

Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth

AMT's average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry's profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors.

American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge.

Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company's core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters.

Financials and Valuation

American Tower's short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029.

The company's growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years' surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth.

American Tower's valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company's valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently ""underinvested"" due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally.

The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company's substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth.

Technicals and Recent Performance

AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company's fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock's all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year.

Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business.

Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company's recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM's growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story.

Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption

Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI's most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized ""in-house"" productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM's expertise, especially given the company's ""hands-on"" approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years.

IBM's strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company's hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM's latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon's (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth.

IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company's offerings fit well into IBM's strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path.

Financials and Valuation

IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM's operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM's operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company's further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters.

IBM's latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM's debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed's easing cycle.

In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM's business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come.

Technicals and Recent Performance

IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently ""testing"" the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200.

Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company's mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic.

The company's mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company's biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix's video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces.

Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push

For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses.

Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify's customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify's U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts.

Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify's diversification push. These new products could broaden the company's demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company's bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run.

Financials and Valuation

Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers' fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company's increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify's total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a ""cash cow"" would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates.

When it comes to evaluating Spotify's financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company's costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify's optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price.

Spotify's revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022.

Thanks to the past couple of years' positive developments, the company's financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify's valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks.

Technicals and Recent Performance

SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company's cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company's business continues to mature, the stock's sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla's picks while having the most upside potential as well.

Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company's strategic focus since well before going public in 2019.

Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company's platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors.

The company navigated the past couple of years' bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market's weakness for ""bolt-on"" acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space.

Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients

Tradewed defines itself as an ""operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,"" which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb's average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb's, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company's growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients.

For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company's addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential.

The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal.

Financials and Valuation

Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb's profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company's revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more.

Tradeweb's rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions.

Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company's financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company's growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years.

Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock's valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Tradeweb's great execution is reflected in its shares' performance and the company's valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical ""support"" below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock.

Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the

U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber's core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company's ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the ""new economy"" over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the ""unicorn"" status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company.

Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber's revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion.

The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the ""big guns"" of the tech sector. Although Uber's markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed's easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant.

Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength

Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company's strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it's hard to question its strategic vision.

Uber One, the company's membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company's great execution.

Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber's platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver.

According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber's ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won't impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s.

Financials and Valuation

In its early years, profitability was Uber's achilles heel, but since 2018, the company's revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company's ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth.

Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics.

Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company's strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER's strong performance over the past couple of years.

Although the company's debt load is still substantial, Uber's swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company's bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock's market value, with the company's surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER's relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point.

Conclusion

Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the ""boring"" truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s.

Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August's historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index's (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days.

Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it's important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed's painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher.

That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed's tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this ""rotation"" could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level.

This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla's hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential.

Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections.

With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!"
Consumers Fall Into Four Segments Based On Their Affinity For Environmental Sustainability,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2024/10/07/consumers-fall-into-four-segments-based-on-their-affinity-for-environmental-sustainability/,2024-10-07T13:24:58Z,"A year ago, we predicted that the number of green consumers would stay constant in 2024, despite climate chaos and backlash. Despite evidence of accelerated weather-related disasters and a desire among many consumers to act sustainably, we predicted that inflation and the cost of living would heavily influence buying decisions.

New Forrester data bears this out, showing that the share of ""Active Green"" consumers -- those who pay close attention to companies' impact on the environment and overwhelmingly choose eco-friendly items over low-cost or convenient ones -- has held close to steady (it's down 1-2 percentage points in the markets we surveyed).

Though Active Greens are a relatively small segment -- fewer than one in five consumers fall into this category -- our advice to companies is to recognize the cognitive dissonance that many feel when making purchases. Now is the time to innovate to deliver more environmental value for the same price, particularly as environmentally conscious younger consumers gain buying power.

The reality, however, is that there is no single green or sustainable consumer. Values and attitudes vary greatly within the same age group or across different countries. It is critical to base your strategy on nuanced facts and to segment your customer base into distinct groups. We have mapped online adults in Australia, the US, and the Europe-5 markets to four segments that display various levels of affinity for environmental sustainability. Forrester grouped consumers into four segments according to their answers to three questions:

The result? Consumers are evolving into four distinct groups as they realize that their consumption habits affect both the environment and their daily lives:"
Forecasters Predict Tepid Holiday Sales Growth as Consumers Lean In to Austerity,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2024/10/07/forecasters-predict-tepid-holiday-sales-growth-as-consumers-lean-in-to-austerity/,2024-10-07T13:05:56Z,"Consumer sentiment has ticked up, but forecasts for Q4 retail sales see only modest growth as shoppers trim their budgets.

The retail industry begins its annual fourth-quarter dash to the end of its fiscal year (Jan. 30), with the majority of consumers planning to spend the same or less on gifts compared to last year. Overall, industry forecasters predict decelerating sales growth this year, despite a recent rebound in the widely-followed University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment.

Regardless of whether the economy achieves a soft landing or avoids a recession, consumers are still adjusting to the stubbornly high costs of major living expenses, such as housing, cars, and insurance. Across several recent consumer surveys, a common theme emerges -- consumer confidence in the future is rising, but so are credit card debt and financial stress.

In a survey of 1,300 shoppers across the US, Canada, and the UK, 9 out of 10 (a full 90%) said they expect to spend 50% less on holiday gifts this year compared to 2023, according to project44, a logistics technology vendor.

A recent survey by Bankrate, a financial services platform, found that 33% of holiday shoppers plan to spend less this year, and another 43% plan to spend about the same. Consumers are embracing frugality, says Bankrate senior analyst Ted Rossman, because ""multiple years of high inflation and high interest rates have taken a considerable toll.""

The Bankrate survey also found that older generations ""are more likely to feel stretched thin during the holiday season."" A third of Gen X holiday shoppers said gift shopping will strain their budgets, while only one in five Gen Z respondents said the same.

Accounting network PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) reported similar results. Nearly 30% of respondents in its survey expect to spend less this season than last, marking a new high. A quarter of respondents said they will spend more, which -- except for pandemic-era 2020 -- was the lowest PwC has ever recorded.

The National Retail Federation, which has a strong track record for forecasting industry revenue, is projecting full-year fiscal 2025 sales growth of between 2.5% and 3.5%, down from fiscal 2024's final tally of 3.8%. While this might seem like a small number, it's based on a very large industry base.

Beneath the top line, there will be the usual suspects that outperform and those that lose ground or disappear. Walmart is projecting sales growth of up to 4.75% for the current year, and Amazon.com's e-commerce sales are expected to grow by more than 10%.

At the bottom of the list, companies that are perennially struggling include department store brands like Macy's and Neiman Marcus, apparel chains like Express Inc., and big-box hardware stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, along with some surprises like Nike.

One can only wonder how consumers feel about each of these companies' product offerings and why they are winning or losing."
Council Post: The Hidden Impact Of Fees On Inflation -- And What It Means For Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/10/07/the-hidden-impact-of-fees-on-inflation-and-what-it-means-for-businesses/,2024-10-07T13:01:45Z,"Inflation is a complex phenomenon influenced by many factors, from global supply chain disruptions to labor shortages. However, another often overlooked contributor is subtly driving prices higher across various sectors: fees.

These fees can take many forms -- service fees, convenience fees, processing fees -- and while they may seem insignificant in isolation, their cumulative effect can be profound, especially when considered across an entire industry or economy.

Take the facilities management industry, for example, where I operate daily. We see how hidden fees accumulate and significantly increase operational costs. From contract management fees to technology charges, these can sneak into agreements and strain company budgets.

Such fees are often passed down the supply chain, ultimately affecting pricing strategies and inflating costs for consumers. In retail, we've seen similar impacts, where incremental fees are contributing to the rising cost of goods and services.

The Proliferation Of Fees In Modern Business

In recent years, fees have become ubiquitous, tacked onto everything from airline tickets to hotel stays and banking services to utility bills and healthcare services. Companies often justify these fees as necessary to cover the costs of new technology, comply with regulations or provide additional services. However, many of these fees are more about padding the bottom line than covering actual costs.

An example is the rise of swipe fees in the retail sector. When consumers use a credit or debit card to make a purchase, banks and card networks like Visa and Mastercard charge retailers a ""swipe fee"" to process the transaction. The implementation of these fees, which average just over 2% of the transaction, has skyrocketed over the past two decades: Total swipe fees in the U.S. have grown from about $20 billion in 2001 to $172 billion in 2023.

The Ripple Effect On Prices

When companies pass on fees to consumers, the immediate impact is an increase in the price of goods and services. But the ripple effect goes beyond retail consumers.

It also affects the B2B environment, where businesses are not immune to the growing prevalence of hidden fees. As organizations encounter higher costs due to fees in areas like payment processing, shipping and vendor contracts, these costs are often passed along to other businesses in the supply chain, eventually reaching consumers.

In retail and B2B settings, these incremental fees can create a cycle of rising costs. In B2B transactions, where pricing can be complex, fees further complicate the financial landscape, squeezing margins and straining budgets. Whether a company is a direct consumer-facing business or a B2B provider, these rising operational costs can drive inflationary pressures that affect everyone down the line. Ultimately, even cautious and well-informed companies and consumers pay more as these fees accumulate.

Facilities Management: A Case Study In Hidden Fees

In facilities management (FM), fees are a pervasive issue. For example, backend fees -- such as per-work-order charges, implementation fees and support fees for data downloads and tailored reporting -- often add up across multiple service agreements.

At my company, we have encountered these costs frequently, and I think it's clear that a lack of transparency in such contracts can quickly inflate operational expenses. Many companies managing multi-location facilities have found themselves blindsided by unexpected charges that quietly accumulate into significant annual expenses.

Strategies For Transparency And Efficiency

Clients and consumers today are increasingly savvy, often scrutinizing the costs and fees associated with their services. Many seek value and transparency and quickly switch providers if they feel they're being overcharged.

However, when an entire industry collectively adopts practices that involve adding or increasing fees, the options for avoiding these costs become limited. This collective action can lead to widespread cost increases, impacting everyone, regardless of their choices.

Over the years, I have learned that businesses can combat these rising costs through a variety of strategies. Here are a few to consider:

1. Audit existing contracts regularly. Conduct regular audits of contracts to identify hidden fees. Many businesses miss recurring charges because they assume all fees are necessary. An audit helps reveal unnecessary or redundant fees that can be renegotiated or eliminated.

2. Establish clear upfront pricing. Ensure that pricing structures are clear and transparent from the outset, both internally and for clients. By listing all potential costs upfront, businesses can avoid unpleasant surprises later in the process. This practice helps build trust and reinforces long-term client relationships.

3. Consider automation to reduce labor costs. Automating repetitive processes, such as invoice management or payment processing, can reduce the labor costs associated with fee management. At my company, we've integrated platforms that streamline operations, thereby avoiding unnecessary tech and service fees.

4. Negotiate terms with vendors. If a vendor's service fees seem inflated or unnecessary, negotiate for more favorable terms. Explain the impact of hidden fees on your bottom line and leverage volume agreements to secure better terms.

A Broader Perspective

The issue of fees and their contribution to inflation reminds us that the costs we encounter as consumers and businesses are often more complex than they appear. While fees may be justified in some cases, their widespread and sometimes opaque application can have unintended consequences for the broader economy.

Given the above, and with rising costs across sectors, it is more important than ever for businesses to investigate alternative solutions and cost models that reduce or eliminate unnecessary fees. By understanding the role fees play in driving up prices, we can make more informed decisions by advocating for greater transparency, choosing service providers that prioritize efficiency or simply being more aware of the actual costs behind our prices.

In the end, I think controlling inflation isn't just about managing the big-ticket items; it's also about keeping an eye on the small fees that can have a significant impact.

Earnings Kickoff And World Conflicts Highlight The Week,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/07/earnings-kickoff-and-world-conflicts-highlight-the-week/,2024-10-07T12:47:57Z,"Oil Surge And Inflation Fears Threaten Economic Stability And Markets

A stronger than expected jobs report on Friday further eased fears of a slowing economy and allowed markets to stage impressive rallies to end the week. The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%. For the week; however, markets were little changed. That came despite a wide trading range overall. As we head into this week, the expected move in the S&P 500 is 86 points, which means we could see a total trading range even bigger than last week.

It's going to be a data heavy week with much of it being of the qualitative variety. Fed members will be speaking throughout the week but what I think will be most interesting is the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, due out Wednesday. These will be the minutes from the meeting at which the Fed decided to cut rates by half a point. With another Fed meeting not scheduled until November, I think a lot of investors are eager for a closer view into the last meeting and what members were thinking moving forward. I think this is especially true in the wake of Friday's jobs report and the response out of the bond market where we've seen yields on the 10-year note climb back above 4% for the first time since August. Then later in the week, on Thursday and Friday, we'll get the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports.

Also on Friday, we'll kick off earnings season. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are both scheduled to announce earnings and each bank offers a slightly nuanced view into the health of the economy. JP Morgan will likely discuss the health of consumers, spending habits and credit card debt. Wells Fargo often provides a look into the housing sector given their presence in the mortgage market.

As we prepare for a deluge of earnings over the next few weeks, it's worth noting the expectations for the quarter have fallen. At the end of June, estimates for third quarter earnings were a growth rate of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. However, those estimates have since fallen and now stand at 4.2%, according to FactSet. While it is common to see estimates revised downward, these revisions are slightly larger than the average drop of around 3.3%. It's also worth noting that the S&P 500 is currently trading at 21.4x its expected 12-month forward-looking earnings, which is above its historical 10-year average of 18x and 5-year average of 19.5x. In other words, much like we saw at the end of the second quarter, stocks are fundamentally valued at levels above their norm.

The revised earnings growth rates and fundamental valuations may also explain the tempered enthusiasm for company stock purchases by insiders. An article in today's Wall Street Journal says insider purchases by officers and directors were at their lowest level in a decade. While purchases upticked in August and September, they are still below their 10-year average.

In addition to the economic news and earnings, we also have a couple other externalities that could make their way into the market this week. Oil, which was up 1% on Friday and 8% for the week, is something I'll be watching as the world continues to await possible continued escalation between Israel and Iran. Also, back here at home, we are less than thirty days away from the election and I would not be surprised if we see market volatility hold its current level of even increase as the election nears.

A couple individual stocks worth watching today include Chevron and Pfizer. Chevron is selling off some Canadian assets as part of a plan intended to divest between $10 to $15 billion by 2028. That stock is higher by just over 1% in premarket. Shares of Pfizer are higher by nearly 3% in premarket after it was announced that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a $1 billion position in the company.

For today, I am keeping my eye on oil and any news out of the Middle East. I think markets are already bracing for the economic data and upcoming earnings, but the geopolitical situation is the wildcard I'm most focused on. No one is entirely sure what response to expect from Israel and I think that adds a bit of volatility that's more difficult to quantify. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
"Consumers Start Holiday Shopping Early, But High Prices On Essentials Drives Cutbacks",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2024/10/07/consumers-start-holiday-shopping-early-but-high-prices-on-essentials-drives-cutbacks/,2024-10-07T12:31:16Z,"It's not even Halloween yet, but consumers already have Christmas on the brain. They're concerned about how prices of essentials will affect their budgets. In a survey by ESW, 61% said they'll spend more than $600 this holiday season, compared to 48% last year. Of the people who are spending less, about 47% said the high price of food and fuel will lead them to reduce spending.

""Even though global inflation is coming down, many consumers are still feeling stretched due to high essentials costs,"" said Martim Avillez Oliveira, chief revenue officer of ESW, a leader in direct to consumer ecommerce.

According to the survey, 37% of consumers have started their shopping journeys. As expected, Amazon Prime Deal Days and Black Friday are expected to be the biggest deal days of the season, with Cyber Monday coming in third place.

""Black Friday is where consumers plan to spend more money, and focus on deals and value,"" said Oliveira. ""We think global uncertainty isn't healthy for the economy. We're seeing that consumers will spend more, even though price and value was top of mind.""

From an intent perspective, consumers will spend more this holiday season, said Oliveira. Online will continue to grow, which means there are additional opportunities for online retailers to capture market share.

AI is going to be everywhere from physical to digital channels, smoothing store efficiencies and curating online experiences for shoppers. ESW found that 43% of consumers will shop more online.

""Retailers will have to make sure they have different promotions and loyalty schemes,"" Oliveira said. ""It's critical to understand who your customer is. Free shipping is now table stakes. In addition to free shipping, free returns are popular. We'll see free returns and other promotional activity like gifts-with-purchase and product bundles that consumers will expect from their preferred brands.""

ESW unlocks the local DTC channel for retailers. ""If you're a brand and want to capture or trial your product to international audiences, ESW acts as a merchant of record,"" Oliveira said. ""The brand can shift any liabilities and compliance requirements to the merchant of record [ESW].

Shopping cuts across demographic lines. For example, 51% of all consumers said they won't use TikTok for shopping, however, when broken down by age, 65% of millennials and Gen Z combined said they'll use TikTok for inspiration.

What categories will be popular? According to Oliveira, beauty will resonate with consumers, and ""private label will be able to stand out this year and gain more market share just because of the sensitivity and how price-conscious shoppers will be this season.""

In addition to free shipping, Oliveira sees omnichannel as table stakes this holiday season. ""That's a seamless commerce experience,""he said. """"For retailers, finding their most cost-effective routes to get their goods to the consumer will be important. And making sure they plan their inventory and their pools of stock according to where the demand lives, both domesticaally and internationally. From our perspective localizing inventory, making sure you have, for example, the right product, the right sizes and the right promotions, will be key."""
How EPC Firms Are Helping The Energy Sector Do 'More With Less',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/07/how-epc-firms-are-helping-the-energy-sector-do-more-with-less/,2024-10-07T11:40:21Z,"As the energy industry embraces increasing calls for more efficiency, decarbonization and adoption of environmentally friendly business practices, they are increasingly turning to their engineering, procurement, and construction or EPC partners to replicate that in the built environment.

With large scale energy, oil and gas projects being a critical part of their business, EPC companies also appear to be embracing the challenge effectively turning into ""EPCM"" outfits, with the ""M"" incorporating management services as part of their broader client offering.

EPCM contracts now routinely involve sustainability targets, circularity or circular economy tenets and environmentally friendly practices in the construction and procurement value chain, according to research conducted by EY, based on its study 30 leading firms in the segment.

Furthermore, EY also notes that new global regulatory requirements will likely compel EPCM companies to disclose information about their own greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks in tandem with the sponsors of the projects they happen to be working on.

Nobody in the industry has any illusions about the scale of such a challenge. That too in an operating climate that until very recently saw EPCM companies clobbered by high inflation and interest rates whilst facing the constant age-old clamor for on time and on budget energy project delivery.

To manage the turbulence, many turned to technology and digital tools to the point that what once a subtle shift has now become routine.

Artificial intelligence, the industrial internet of things, robotics, construction data analytics, 3D and 4D printing, drones, virtual reality and augmented reality are all playing a vital role in enabling the EPCM segment become more efficient and sustainable across the life-cycle of the project, according to Chris Ashton, CEO of Worley, one of the largest companies operating in the segment.

""These digital tools are disrupting ways of working as they are deployed, leading to a reduction in time on repetitive tasks. And we see the development of digital platforms, the digital accelerant, as critical enablers to create trust amongst stakeholders and drive faster, more efficient project processes to move forward at speed,"" Ashton said.

He also appeared unfazed by the fact that some investments in emerging technologies carries the near-term risk of failure.

""We're regularly investing and are open to fail fast as we learn and pivot if roadblocks appear; leveraging advancements in information technologies; tapping into our global expertise, using standardized tools and processes to reduce costs and increase capital efficiency; and truly working in partnership with our customers to deeply understand their strategic plans for the future.""

According to EY, despite economic head winds, capital flows in construction technology or ConTech came in at just under $5.7 billion in 2022. Further growth is expected when latest data is available early in 2025.

An evolving built environment within the energy sector inevitably requires construction equipment partners to also respond in kind and they are, said Gavin Kerr, Director Global of Services at Mammoet, the world's largest engineered heavy lifting and transport company.

""We own and operate most of the world's largest cranes, and large jacking systems and transporters that are specialized to lift the heaviest loads built by humanity. Recognizing the growing need for efficiency and sustainability in EPCM segment, we recently launched the world's strongest land-based crane - the SK6000.""

It has a maximum capacity of 6,000 tons and can lift components of up to 3,000 tons, roughly the weight of six Airbus A380 super-jumbo aircraft, to a height of 220 meters.

""Such a capacity allows for critical components to be simultaneously built offsite anywhere in the world, before being transported to the actual project site ahead of installation. This potentially allows our EPC customers to build efficiently in larger pieces and shrink their project logistics, integration and mobilization phases in the construction cycle,"" Kerr added.

Ultimately, it is all about helping project developers reach first power generation or first hydrocarbon production sooner.

The evolving climate has resulted in EPCM companies and equipment makers becoming co-drivers of industry change for their project partners. Nowhere is it more visible than at industry trade shows and exhibitions in general, and ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi in particular. Regularly billed as the world's largest energy event of its kind, it attracts nearly 200,000 attendees every year.

Among its over 2,000 exhibitors will be 30 of world's largest EPCM companies and energy construction equipment makers of all shapes and sizes jostling for attention at a 155,000 square foot facility.

How EPCM corporate exhibits, displays and business pitches to world have evolved over the year offer ample proof of ""changing times"" according to Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, an organizer of over 30 global energy events in a typical calendar year including ADIPEC.

""When we look at ADIPEC and go back as recently as ten years ago, it was primarily an oilfield services show. But since then, it has gradually transformed into a broader energy show with many, dare I say most, participants making their displays more cognizant of need to address the energy sector's efficiency and sustainability challenge,"" Hudson said.

""It feels different for us as platform creators. Even as recently as 10 years ago, you'd see very traditional exhibition booths of 100 sq meters with a drill bit here, a lifting equipment display and generator model there. Now it's far more technology driven with often two to three level stands, pods and meeting rooms.

And not only that, the EPCM exhibition boot of today also highlight specific technology and efficiency gains that can be achieved from energy project conception to completion - to produce on one level and generate at another level and how you split within that supply chain at, Hudson added.

""There is a clear reason for this. The major energy companies need to invest heavily in sustainability and decarbonization remains a key ADIPEC theme - something that 12 leading energy CEOs committed to in Abu Dhabi in 2023. The EPCM segment is key if this is to be achieved, and we see firms operating in the sphere adapting to opportunities presented by an evolving climate, something that's reflected in their displays and exhibits.""

Doing 'more with less' - or in other words achieving improved throughput / energy generation, doing so sustainably and whist using less energy - has become imperative for the industry. Therefore, ditching the old way of doing things is both mission critical and commercially logically for the EPCM segment and research strongly points to it, says Worley's CEO Ashton.

""Our thought leadership work with Princeton University Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment shows us that executing projects the same way we always have will not get us to net zero by 2050. In fact, we won't even get halfway. So we must change, and are changing, how we traditionally deliver projects.""

Ashton added that energy project sponsors are balancing strategic investments supporting their move to a lower carbon future and at the same time managing shareholder, investor, and society's environmental and sustainability expectations with the complex capital management, regulatory and jurisdictional frameworks within which they operate.

""Over the past five years, we've seen our customers shift to partner with Worley, to share their strategic plans and work together to drive down costs while delivering projects in new and innovative ways. And by working in partnership with our customers on their vast portfolios of projects, we're delivering real, life-time value across their assets.""

This will in all probability accelerate in a fiercely competitive post-pandemic EPCM market."
"Mortgage Rates Today: October 7, 2024 -- Rates Move Up",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-07-24/,2024-10-07T11:32:12Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.82%, according to Curinos. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.96%, while the average rate on a 30-year jumbo mortgage is 6.87%.

Today, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage is 6.82%, compared to last week when it was 6.67%.

The annual percentage rate (APR) on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.84%. The APR was 6.67% last week. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

With today's interest rate of 6.82%, a 30-year fixed mortgage of $100,000 costs approximately $653 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. Borrowers will pay about $135,077 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 5.96%, higher than it was at this time yesterday. Last week, it was 5.69%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.99%. It was 5.72% this time last week.

At today's interest rate of 5.96%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $842 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $51,515 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.87% -- 0.12 percentage point up from last week. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate had a 52-week APR low of 5.50% and a 52-week high of 10.50%.

A 30-year jumbo mortgage at today's fixed interest rate of 6.87% will cost you $657 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,924.

The first step on your homebuying journey should be to calculate affordability. You'll want to find out how much you can afford based on things like income, debt and savings.

Here are a few important factors that go into home affordability:

The annual percentage rate (APR) represents a loan's interest rate and fees, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. It's essentially the all-in cost of the loan.

The APR is a helpful number because it shows you the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it the entire term.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term.

Conventional home loans are issued by private lenders and typically require good or excellent credit and a minimum 20% down payment to get the best rates. Some lenders offer first-time home buyer loans and grants with relaxed down payment requirements as low as 3%.

For buyers with limited credit or finances, a government-backed loan is usually the better option as the minimum loan requirements are easier to satisfy.

For example, FHA loans can require 3.5% down with a minimum credit score of 580 or at least 10% down with a credit score between 500 and 579. However, upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums can apply for the life of the loan.

Buyers in eligible rural areas with a moderate income or lower may also consider USDA loans. This program doesn't require a down payment, but you pay an upfront and annual guarantee fee for the life of the loan.

If you come from a qualifying military background, VA loans can be your best option. First, you don't need to make a down payment in most situations. Second, borrowers pay a one-time funding fee but don't pay an annual fee as the FHA and USDA loan programs require."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 7, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-07-24/,2024-10-07T11:31:44Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Shopping for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are notorious for paying puny interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts generally pay considerably higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

If you're shopping around for a traditional savings account, high-yield savings account or MMA, you'll want to remember a few key points.

A great interest rate is important, but it's not the only factor that matters when picking an account to hold your savings. Another major consideration is whether the account has a minimum deposit -- and whether you can come up with the cash.

You'll also want to understand the fees. Savings accounts can come with monthly maintenance fees, excess transaction fees (if you ignore limits on withdrawals) and other pesky charges that can bite into your returns.

And before you open an account, look into a financial institution's reputation and safety. You should trust your bank or credit union and feel like you're in good hands. Read the reviews, see what account holders have to say about customer service and learn about how the financial institution responds to consumer questions.

Search for an account that's insured by the FDIC or, in the case of credit unions, the NCUA. Those federal agencies provide up to $250,000 in insurance per depositor and per bank for each account ownership category.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Beyond Meat Stock Has 24% YTD Decline, But Can Sentiment Change?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/beyond-meat-stock-has-24-ytd-decline-but-can-sentiment-change/,2024-10-07T11:07:25Z,"After almost a 24% decline this year, at the current price of around $6 per share, we believe Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ: BYND), a plant-based meat alternative - is fairly priced. BYND stock has dropped from around $8 to $6 year-to-date, largely underperforming the broader indices, with the S&P growing about 20% over the same period. The company has been facing challenging revenue and considerable cash burn for about three years now - thanks to the combination of inflation, pandemic-related shifts in demand, and rising competition. Although it would be premature to declare Beyond Meat's stock as irreparable, the company's current trajectory suggests a challenging outlook with no clear escape from its detrimental cycle.

In Q2 2024, the company's revenue of $93 million was down almost 9% year-over-year (y-o-y), driven by a 14% decrease in the volume of products sold. BYND also saw its revenues decline somewhat moderately in Q2 from an -18% y-o-y decline in Q1, but again this is largely a function of prior-year comps easing as well. BYND scaled back on promotional trade discounts in the recent Q2. Along with price increases on certain products in the U.S., this resulted in a 6.1% increase in its net revenue per pound compared to the year-ago period, which includes a ~21% increase in its U.S. retail channel (largest segment) net revenue per pound. Thanks to this, the revenue declines softened in Q2 and gross margins made a major recovery. However, there are still several headwinds that continue to pressure BYND stock in the future. In the U.S., the company's distribution has maxed out, while inventory levels remain high. Moreover, the company is dealing with low plant utilization and lower product volume. The company also has a substantial amount of debt in its capital structure, which may become a meaningful risk factor in the current high-interest rate environment. BYND has $1.14 billion in debt (due in 2027) on its balance sheet and a limited cash runway of $145 million (down from $194 million at year-end 2023). All said, BYND's most pressing issues still have not been addressed.

Notably, BYND stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were -48% in 2021, -81% in 2022, and -28% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BYND face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Beyond Meat's gross margin turned negative in 2023 and 2022 compared to its positive gross margins of 25% in 2021 and 30% in 2020. It should be noted that the company achieved a 4.9% gross margin in Q1 2024 and showed a substantial improvement to 14.7% in Q2 2024. Price increases have helped in this improvement along with lower cost of goods sold per pound and higher net revenue per pound. In addition, the company's adjusted Q2 EBITDA came in at a loss of $23 million compared to a loss of $41 million in the year-ago period. Beyond Meat was able to bring its operating cash flow losses down to -$47.8 million so far, roughly half of the year-ago loss, driven by the gross margin expansion and reduction in operating expenses from headcount efficiencies.

We forecast Beyond Meat's Revenues to be $326 million for the fiscal year 2024, down 5% y-o-y. We now forecast revenue per share to come in at $5.07. Given the changes to our revenues and RPS forecast, we have revised our Beyond Meat's Valuation to $6 per share, based on a $5.07 expected RPS and a 1.2x P/S multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price. Beyond Meat expects net revenues to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million in FY 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 7% to 1% compared to 2023. The company continues to anticipate operating expenses to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. Also, the company expects further gross margin progress across the balance of the year, reflecting the combined impact of more fully distributed pricing adjustments and continued moderation of promotional spending.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how Beyond Meat's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

September CPI Will Impact Fed Policy And Market Expectations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/06/september-cpi-will-impact-fed-policy-and-market-expectations/,2024-10-06T21:38:58Z,"The September U.S. Consumer Price Index tops this week's economic reports. With year-on-year total and core CPI inflation rates still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, traders and investors will be watching for signs that give the Fed license to cut rates on November 7. The potential that inflation rates are too high presents downside risks to equity markets and commodity prices because elevated inflation rates could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates next month.

This week's September CPI report will be critical for Fed interest rate policy expectations because labor market and inflation data are the Fed's main policy concerns. With the potential to shape Fed policies, which are front and center for financial markets, the CPI report has the potential to impact financial markets from equities and bonds to industrial commodities and the dollar.

Year-on-year total CPI inflation slowed in August to the lowest year-on-year pace since February 2021. Total CPI decelerated to 2.5% from 2.9%, although year-on-year core CPI was unchanged at a relatively high 3.2%. Both total and core year-on-year CPI rates are still elevated and above the Fed's 2% target.

Inflation has been easing slowly, but base effects threaten to keep year-on-year total CPI and core CPI above the Fed's 2% target until the first half of 2025. Nevertheless, year-on-year CPI inflation rates appear likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%.

As the Fed carefully weighs the importance of labor market and inflation data, this week's CPI report will be more critical for Fed policy expectations in the wake of last week's Employment Situation Report -- informally called the jobs report by economists and analysts. September payrolls and unemployment data were much stronger than expected with strong payroll gains of 254,000, upward revisions to payrolls of 72,000, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%.

Following the release of the strong September jobs report, the potential for a 0.5% Fed rate cut on November 7 fell to zero in the CME FedWatch Tool on October 6, while the potential for a 0.25% interest rate cut rose to 97.4% and the chance that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged rose to 2.6%.

Just one week prior, on September 27, the CME FedWatch Tool reflected the chance of a 0.5% Fed interest rate cut on November 7 at 53.3%. Meanwhile, the chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut was 46.7%, and the chance of no changes in interest rate policies was zero. The change in the CME FedWatch Tool expectations reflects just how important the strong September jobs report was for shifting Fed policy expectations.

The CME FedWatch Tool reflects that there is no urgency to cut interest rates due to the strength of the labor market. However, if inflation eases in September, the Fed will have more wiggle room to cut interest rates next month.

If the September CPI report does not show a further easing of year-on-year consumer inflation, expectations that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged on November 7 will likely rise. These dynamics would likely support the dollar but potentially hold mixed to negative implications for equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

However, if the September CPI report shows an easing of year-on-year inflationary pressures from August, the potential for a 0.5% rate cut would likely increase, weighing on the greenback but supporting equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

What do you expect for the September CPI inflation report?"
Q3 In Review: Family Office News Roundup 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/francoisbotha/2024/10/06/q3-in-review-family-office-news-roundup-2024/,2024-10-06T15:43:56Z,"As we move deeper into the latter half of 2024, family offices continue to navigate a complex web of economic, regulatory, and investment challenges. The third quarter of 2024 brought several developments that are reshaping the landscape for ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) and their family offices worldwide. From the intensifying competition between global financial hubs to the rising prominence of alternative investments, here's a roundup of some of the key family-office related items covered in in the news the last quarter based on 300 tracked articles from various news publications.

The race to attract family offices has reached a fever pitch, particularly in Asia. Singapore and Hong Kong, long-standing rivals in the financial sector, are doubling down on their efforts to woo UHNWIs and their family offices.

With central banks continuing to grapple with inflation, interest rate volatility has become a key concern for family offices. This shifting landscape is prompting a reevaluation of investment strategies, with a renewed focus on capital preservation and liquidity.

Many family offices are adjusting their portfolios, showing increased interest in fixed-income securities as rates rise. However, it's crucial to maintain a balanced approach. As one family office advisor put it, ""It's not about timing the market, but about time in the market."".

Diversification remains a cornerstone of family office strategies, but the definition of a ""diverse portfolio"" is evolving. Q3 saw a notable shift towards alternative investments and life insurance policies aimed at preserving wealth across generations.

This trend reflects a broader desire for uncorrelated returns and long-term value creation. However, it's important to note that these investments come with their own set of risks and complexities.

Private banks are increasingly positioning themselves as strategic partners for family offices, offering tailored services that cater to the complex needs of UHNWIs. From bespoke lending products to sophisticated investment advisory services, these institutions are stepping up their game to serve the family office sector.

As family offices expand their global footprint, navigating the complex web of international tax and regulatory requirements has become more critical than ever. This past quarter's news cycle highlighted several developments in tax laws that impact family offices, particularly in regions like Asia and the Middle East.

Q3 2024 has been an eventful quarter for family offices, marked by global shifts in wealth management strategies, regulatory changes, and evolving investment landscapes. As family offices continue to navigate these complexities, it will be interesting to see how they approach growth opportunities while carefully balancing risks in an uncertain economic environment. The ongoing competition for share-of-wealth between financial hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong, coupled with the increasing role of private banks, will likely continue to shape the family office landscape in the months to come."
Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/06/robust-job-gains-remove-recession-fears/,2024-10-06T11:06:04Z,"The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger.

Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000.

The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%.

Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January.

The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks.

Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy.

Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday's market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well.

Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies.

The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday's consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed's CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting.

Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively.

Friday's job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue."
How This Bitcoin Bull Market Cycle Stands Out,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/06/how-this-bitcoin-bull-market-cycle-stands-out/,2024-10-06T06:07:35Z,"As markets enter Q4 2024, investors keenly observe the current bitcoin market cycle, questioning whether it will reflect historical patterns. Typically, halving events every four years dictate these cycles, each marked by sharp supply cuts. However, today's demand and supply forces, regulatory changes, and external market shocks suggest this cycle could be different.

Historically, bitcoin bull market price surges were mostly fueled by a diminishing liquid supply, with coins increasingly held long-term or presumed lost. Bitcoin's circulating supply currently stands at approximately 19.7 million coins, with an estimated 5 million permanently out of circulation.

This leaves about 14.6 million BTC characterized as illiquid -- held in wallets with little to no selling intent. Over 73% of the total supply is now illiquid, reducing the coins available for active trading and hinting at tightening market liquidity similar to periods preceding historic bull runs.

This cycle differs as major holders like Grayscale sell off their bitcoin assets, reacting to competition from lower-fee ETFs.

Despite this increase in short-term liquid supply, the overarching trend sees entities like MicroStrategy and various new ETFs accumulating vast amounts of bitcoin, potentially triggering a supply crunch. The liquidity ratio of bitcoin has dropped below 0.25, signaling that most circulating coins are effectively being removed from the trading pool as institutional and long-term investors increase their holdings.

The wider economic environment, especially movements in the M2 money supply, has historically correlated with bitcoin's price cycles. Recent expansions in M2, following a contraction phase, are perceived by some analysts as potential catalysts for bitcoin's growth in the upcoming months.

Central banks' potentially moving towards more aggressive quantitative easing to mitigate economic slowdowns could enhance bitcoin's appeal as an inflation hedge, potentially accelerating its price appreciation. In addition, the U.S. dollar index's, also known as the DXY, remain a key focus; a large drop could further boost bitcoins growth.

Another factor making this cycle different is the rise in global adoption and interest from nation-states. Countries like El Salvador and regions with economic instability increasingly turn to bitcoin as legal tender or reserve asset. While still in its infancy, this adoption could lead to greater stability and credibility for bitcoin, shifting its market perception from a speculative asset to a legitimate store of value.

Together with geopolitical tensions and financial sanctions, bitcoin is becoming a hedge for inflation and sovereign risk, which may further accelerate its institutional and governmental accumulation. This macro transition towards bitcoin as a global, non-sovereign currency is a fascinating development that suggests a stronger, more resilient market dynamic, making this cycle stand apart from those before it.

Although some experts forecast Q2 2025 as the cycle's peak, the unique conditions of this cycle warrant a cautious outlook.

The continuous increase in illiquid supply supports long-term holding strategies, without a catalyst like increased institutional buying or favorable macroeconomic conditions, the duration of this accumulation phase remains uncertain. Regulation and potential changes in U.S. monetary policy could inject further volatility into the market.

Global liquidity has increased by $10 trillion since the beginning of the year, a development potent enough to purchase all of bitcoin ten times over. This influx in global liquidity has not immediately been reflected in bitcoin's price, which shows the typical lag as these vast sums trickle into various asset classes.

The FTX scandal ironically cut short the last bull run and prevented bitcoin from reaching $100,000. Now, FTX-related payouts could serve as a bullish catalyst for the next cycle, possibly driving bitcoin toward that $100,000 milestone.

For investors, the decision points involve weighing the slow momentum of the current market against the prospects of a more defined uptrend. With big players like Grayscale reducing their holdings and others like ETFs and MicroStrategy increasing their stakes, the timing and strategic positioning will be important.

The fundamental principles of bitcoin's deflationary model and growing institutional interest suggest that despite potential deviations from past patterns, the underlying strengths of bitcoin remain strong. Only time will reveal how this market cycle unfolds, but current indicators suggest a distinct and more pronounced bull run."
Mortgage Rates 5 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-05-10-24/,2024-10-05T19:31:10Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.45%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.47% and 4.20% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.59%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.15%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."

Gold Price Over Time

How to invest in gold

Some investors consider gold to be a safe-haven asset. They rely on the theory that when the prices of shares, bonds and property drop sharply, gold - as a non-correlated asset - may hold its value and could even increase in price as nervous investors rush in to buy.

Investing in gold is also a way to add diversification to your investment portfolio. When you hold a diversified mix of different assets, including gold, varying returns can help protect the overall value of your investments.

For investors looking to gain exposure to gold, there are several options to consider. Each has its pros and cons...

For example, one option is to buy gold in physical form:

Gold bars. Known as bullion, gold bars tend to be a popular choice for buying gold. Bullion is typically sold by gram or ounce. Purity, manufacturer and weight should be stamped on the face of the bar. Gold coins. The Sovereign and Britannia are popular collectables that command a premium over what you would get for the same amount of gold in the form of bullion. Gold jewellery. Like gold coins, you'll probably be paying extra for gold when you buy it in the form of jewellery - a premium that could be anywhere from 20% to 300%, depending on the manufacturer.

Alternatively, it's possible for investors to consider investing in gold indirectly:

Gold shares. Buying the stocks of gold mining or processing companies is another way to invest in the yellow metal. You don't get to own physical gold, but you do get exposure to the rise and fall of the price of gold in the market. Gold funds. There are a range of funds that provide exposure to gold. They may invest in gold stocks, or they may trade gold derivatives in the options and futures markets.

Should you invest in gold?

You might consider investing in gold if you're looking to hedge against risk or diversify an investment portfolio which already contained other assets such as shares, bonds, and cash. Gold would probably not be your first choice to earn long-term capital growth.

The above chart shows how the gold price has performed over the past five years. Remember that past performance provides no guarantee for future returns

Gold prices can be extremely volatile, and that means that gold isn't an entirely stable investment. In fact, you can easily craft a well-diversified investment portfolio entirely without gold.

It should also be noted that gold in its physical form, unlike other investments, does not produce an income or yield.

If you buy physical gold, you also need to consider where you are going to keep it, and whether there will be costs associated with secure storage.

Is gold an inflation hedge?

Studies have found that gold may be an effective way to defend your wealth against inflation, but only over extremely long periods of time, measured in decades or even centuries. A 2022 insight paper from Wisdom Tree looking at the investment case for gold, described the precious metal as ""an excellent store of value"".

Over shorter time periods, the inflation-adjusted price of gold fluctuates dramatically, typically making it a poor near-term hedge for inflation.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Is buying gold better than holding cash?

Inflation reduces the 'real' value of a currency over time. Or, put another way, £50 today buys you less than it did 10 years ago. However, gold can provide a way of protecting the 'real' value of your wealth against inflation.

During a period of high inflation, some investors may revert to buying gold as a real physical asset that holds its value.

Periods of high inflation often correspond with a rise in interest rates and general economic uncertainty. As a result, gold is seen to some as a safe haven and, in theory, increased demand results in a rise in price.

Over the last 20 years, annual inflation has averaged 3% in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. Over the same period, the price of gold has increased by an average of 9% per year (according to the World Gold Council). Whereas the average base rate (a proxy for the interest rate on savings) was 3% over this period, according to the Bank of England.

Adjusting for the inflation rate of 3%, the 'real' value of gold has therefore increased by an average of 6% per year. In comparison, savers would have experienced no 'real' increase in the value of cash held in savings accounts due to the impact of inflation.

That said, there is no guarantee that gold will perform the same way in the future as it has in the past.

Is it a good time to buy gold?

Gold potentially offer investors a safe haven in times of economic and geopolitical volatility. It may also provide a way of preserving wealth in a high inflation environment. As with shares, the price of gold is volatile. However it has delivered an increase in value over the last 30 years. Again, performance going forward is not guaranteed.

Investors should also consider the effect of foreign currency movements when deciding whether to buy gold. Gold is typically denominated in US dollars and, as a result, tends to have an inverse relationship with the US dollar. This means that, if the US dollar strengthens against other currencies, the price of gold can fall.

Looking over the last year, the price of gold in US dollars has decreased by 3% as the US dollar has strengthened against other currencies. However, the price of gold in sterling has increased by 10% due to the weakening of the pound against the dollar.

Overall, it is difficult to assess whether it's a good time to buy gold as its price is dependent on a number of factors. Although a continuation in the current level of economic and political uncertainty may provide a tailwind for gold prices, investors should also be aware of the volatility of this asset.

Does gold drop in value?

Gold is a limited commodity with a relatively static supply, meaning that the price of gold is highly sensitive to changes in demand. A fall in demand will therefore result in a drop in the value of gold.

By way of example, the price of gold fell by over 25% from 2011 to 2013. It also fell from over $2,000 per Troy ounce in mid-2020 to less than $1,700 in early 2021, a fall of 17%.

How is gold price determined?

The price of gold is determined by the level of supply and demand. The daily price is set by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and there are two different types of gold prices:

Fixed: LBMA members meet via conference call twice-daily to agree a price to clear their outstanding client orders. This is typically used for larger gold orders. Spot: this is a 'live' price largely used for buying and selling gold bullion.

Is it profitable to invest in digital gold?

Digital gold (or digigold) is a form of digital currency that allows you to buy fractions of physical gold stored by the seller. Buyers of digital gold will own, and have legal title to, the gold, with the seller acting as custodian.

Digital gold enables buyers to invest by value - say, £25 - rather than by weight (as with a 1 kilogram bar of bullion). Buyers can also invest a lower minimum amount than with the physical asset.

Digital gold also offers a saving in terms of storage and insurance. For example, the Royal Mint charges an annual management fee of 0.5% for its DigiGold products, compared to 1-2% for physical gold.

As buyers own the underlying physical gold, their profit (or loss) will be dependent on the price of gold, as covered in the questions above.

Which types of gold is it possible to invest in?

You can buy physical gold in the form of bullion, coins or jewellery, or invest in digital gold:

Bullion bars: these usually range in weight from one gram to over 10 kilograms. A premium is typically charged above the 'spot price' of the gold to cover manufacturing costs.The cheapest option currently sold by the Royal Mint is the one gram 999.99 fine gold Britannia bullion bar, retailing at £70 Coins: these are available in lower weights than bullion bars. The flagship gold coins in the UK are the Sovereign and Britannia. The Royal Mint is currently charging £122 for a 916.67 Fine Gold Quarter Sovereign 2022. Both coins are legal tender in the UK, and, as such, are free from capital gains tax and VAT for UK resident Jewellery: jewellery, especially antique pieces, is another option. However, you may pay a mark-up of at least 20%, and often far higher, relative to the content of the gold. This covers the labour cost of the design and manufacture and the retail margin Digital gold: this allows you to buy and hold fractions of the physical assets, with lower minimum investment amounts and savings on the storage and insurance costs.

Investors may also want to consider investing in an indirect form of gold, including:

Buying shares in companies that mine, refine and trade gold: However, while the prices of mining company shares correlate to gold prices, their share prices are also impacted by other factors Buying gold and commodity funds: specialist commodities, mining and exchange-traded funds can provide investors with exposure to gold, without the difficulties of trading and storing it in physical form.

Tax Breaks: The There's No Crying In Baseball Edition,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/10/05/tax-breaks-the-theres-no-crying-in-baseball-edition/,2024-10-05T14:08:01Z,"This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter.

My grandfather worked his entire life. By the time he reached what we would consider ""retirement age,"" he was still working. Farming and other manual labor had taken their toll on his body, so in his mid-70s, he would suit up in his uniform as a security guard and work nights at the local hospital. He was gone a lot. But on those hot, sticky summer afternoons in the south, when he had a free moment, he and I would sit and watch baseball on the old TV in the family room (for the record, he was a Cubs fan). Those are some of the most special memories of my life, and I suspect they are why I love baseball to this day.

I'll bet you have a similar story. For many, especially those of us in the U.S., baseball is synonymous with childhood summers and evening games of catch.

Baseball has been on the minds of many folks this week -- and not just because of the World Series. Earlier this week, baseball great Pete Rose died at age 83. I noted (☆) that if you asked ten people what they think about Rose, you'd likely get ten different answers. Rose's resume dazzles on paper -- he still holds several baseball records, including the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890). He racked up multiple awards, including two Golden Gloves (1969 and 1970), Silver Slugger (1981), and World Series MVP (1975). But he had his vices and polarized the baseball community. He admitted to cheating on his taxes -- for which he did jail time -- and betting on baseball. The latter is why he died without seriously being considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Those hot, sticky summers? I spent them in my native state of North Carolina. The stories coming out of western North Carolina -- and neighboring states -- are heartbreaking. Recovery will be slow and expensive. If you can be generous and help, please do (here's how). Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply are good to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

The IRS acted quickly (☆) to announce relief for individuals and businesses affected by the storm, including the entire states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and parts of Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia. These taxpayers now have until May 1, 2025, to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments. That date is particularly noteworthy as it's after the traditional tax filing deadline of April 15, 2025. Additionally, some of the areas hit by Helene were already extended because of Hurricane Debby -- those due dates have also been pushed forward to May 1, 2025.

The recent damage to communities caused by natural disasters has renewed discussions about climate change. According to the United Nations, as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat, leading to climate change. As a result, the world is warming faster than ever in recorded history. As policymakers seek to curb greenhouse gas emissions through taxation, the star of the show has always been carbon dioxide, but methane emissions are a significant challenge that also require attention. So why is it essential to address methane emissions, and what policy tools are we seeing in this area? Tax Notes contributing editor Nana Ama Sarfo tackles this issue in the latest episode of the Tax Notes Talk (transcript available).

Another controversial topic in the tax world is also getting a new look -- whistleblowers. Earlier this year, the annual report to Congress issued by the IRS Whistleblower Office (WBO) suggested more taxpayers than ever (☆) are blowing the whistle on bad tax behavior. The IRS paid whistleblowers 121 awards totaling $88.8 million in 2023 -- those amounts correspond to information that resulted in tax collections of $338 million. That's a significant increase from the total whistleblower awards paid in 2022 when just $37.8 million were distributed.

The WBO has recently announced some significant awards (details on two can be found here). The WBO has also revised its part of the Internal Revenue Manual and provided guidance on when the WBO will ""disaggregate"" claims, i.e., make partial awards. This issue of partial awards has been a significant one. A classic example involves a criminal tax case that has been settled and all dollars collected, but there is an open civil tax matter. The WBO has historically waited for the civil matter to be resolved before paying. Whistleblowers, writes Dean Zerbe, have been in Mudville -- with no joy (a bonus baseball reference).

Much of coming forward with a whistleblower claim -- or defending an action based on such a claim -- relies on having great records. Many people face the dilemma of what to do with old tax returns and supporting paperwork, often wondering when it's safe to discard them. However, determining the right time can be tricky, especially for taxpayers with foreign assets. Those with overseas financial interests must pay particular attention for many reasons, including expanded statutes of limitation that permit an indefinite IRS audit timeline and problems in retrieving records from foreign institutions, which can often be more challenging.

Speaking of records, it's possible that a few could be broken in the coming weeks. I know the extended tax deadline is just days away, but the World Series postseason heats up this weekend. Let's hope your team wins (and hopefully, your team will also be the Phillies).

Most taxpayers opt for the standard deduction -- but not all taxpayers understand why that happens. For most taxpayers, it comes down to numbers.

If your total deductions on Schedule A exceed the standard deduction for your filing status, you can claim that amount instead -- these are your itemized deductions. Itemized deductions include, among other things, the home mortgage interest deduction, medical and dental expenses, taxes paid (including up to $10,000 of state and local income taxes), and charitable gifts. If the total of those deductions exceeds the standard deduction for your filing status, you will (in most cases) want to claim itemized deductions instead of the standard deduction. If the total of those deductions is less than the standard deduction for your filing status, you will want to claim the standard deduction.

If you're not sure whether you'll want to take the standard or the itemized deduction, and the math in your head makes it seem too close to call, run the numbers and see which is the most beneficial. If you're using tax software, that should be pretty simple, ditto if you're using a tax preparer.

As with almost everything tax-related, there are some exceptions. You cannot use the standard deduction if you file as married filing a separate return and your spouse itemizes deductions; you are a nonresident alien or a dual-status alien during the year; or you are filing a tax return for less than 12 months because of a change in your annual accounting method.

The 2017 tax reform changed the game for many taxpayers -- the much larger standard deduction, together with limits on mortgage and SALT deductions and the elimination of other deductions (like unreimbursed job expenses, including the home office deduction for employees), made itemizing deductions less appealing. The overwhelming majority of taxpayers now claim the standard deduction -- for 2021, nearly nine out of ten taxpayers (88.2%) claimed the standard deduction.

For the tax year 2024, the standard deduction is $14,600 for individuals and married couples filing separately, an increase of $750 from 2023. Married couples filing jointly can claim $29,200, a boost of $1,500 from 2023, while heads of household can claim $21,900, an increase of $1,100 from 2023.

You are entitled to a higher standard deduction if you are age 65 or older at the end of the year (for this purpose, you are considered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday). If you are blind on the last day of the year, you are also entitled to a higher standard deduction.

For 2024, the standard deduction amount for an individual who may be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer cannot exceed the greater of $1,300 or the sum of $450, and the individual's earned income (not to exceed the regular standard deduction amount).

I'm buying a house. I am married. How much can each of our parents, three in total, give us in gift money before taxes?

Each year, you can make gifts up to the federal gift tax exclusion amount to as many people as you like without any gift tax consequences. For 2024, that number is $18,000, up from $17,000 in 2023. That means that any person can gift you $18,000 without gift tax consequences -- or they could gift 10 people $18,000 without gift tax consequences.

(The annual exclusion for federal gift tax purposes is predicted to increase to $19,000 in 2025.)

So, doing the math from your question, your three parents can gift you and your spouse a total of $108,000 ($18,000 limit x 3 donors x 2 recipients).

Here's where it gets tricky. If a gift exceeds the $18,000 limit for 2024, most taxpayers don't automatically pay gift tax. Instead, the amount of the gift over the $18,000 limit ""chips away"" at your available federal estate tax exemption -- for 2024, that's $13,610,000 per person.

Let's assume your father gifted you $1,018,000 -- that amount is $1 million over the annual gift tax exclusion. Instead of paying gift tax on the $1 million, your father would file a gift tax return (Form 709) notifying the IRS that his exemption is reduced by $1 million. At death, he would only be able to pass $12,610,000 to his heirs, federal estate tax free (assuming he died in 2024-the federal estate tax exemption can vary from year to year due to inflation and, of course, any changes in the law).

The reality? Most taxpayers are not subject to the federal estate or gift tax.

The IRS has announced that the number of states offering Direct File will double for the 2025 tax filing season to 24. For the next filing season, Direct File will be available in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. That means 62% of Americans will live in states offering Direct File.

In addition to expanding the number of participating states, Direct File will now cover additional types of income, credits, and deductions. It's estimated that more than 30 million taxpayers will be eligible to use Direct File in the 2025 filing season.

With about a month left before the elections, the highly critiqued ""no tax on tips"" proposal promoted by both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is still a talking point. Tax experts appear to hate everything about these proposals -- Steve Rosenthal of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center spoke for many with his list of complaints. ""In tax policy, we evaluate proposed reforms by how well they promote equity, efficiency, and revenue,"" he wrote in a recent piece for Forbes. ""'No taxes on tips' fails all three tests by singling out certain taxpayers for relief but not others similarly situated; distorting compensation arrangements and labor markets; and losing substantial revenue, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in the first 10 years.""

And, one of the worst things about the proposals is how ineffective they would be at actually helping tipped workers. The Budget Lab at Yale University noted in a recent report that ""about 4% of families report tips to the IRS, and those who do are disproportionately young, unmarried, and lower-income. This means that many tipped workers do not pay income tax to begin with and would not benefit from a new deduction.""

A little history, writes Tax Notes' Joseph Thorndike, can illuminate today's rush to exempt tips from taxation. Here's more.

While the official numbers are generally available at the end of the year, estimates suggest that the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and my own Philadelphia Phillies will be subject to the luxury tax for the 2024 season.

By rule, teams that exceed the payroll threshold are subject to the luxury tax -- for 2024, that number is $237 million. The tax is figured on each dollar that payrolls are above the threshold, and the tax rate increases based on the number of consecutive years a club has exceeded the threshold (for the first year, there's a 20% tax on all overages, for the second consecutive year, the tax is 30%, and for the third consecutive year or more, it's 50%).

Tops on the list for the season will likely be the New York Mets, who are paying more money to players no longer on their roster ($70.3 million) than the entire total the A's are paying for players on their team ($60.5 million).

5 Questions For The Fed's Austan Goolsbee -- Including: Did They Move Fast Enough On Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/05/5-questions-for-the-feds-austan-goolsbee-including-did-they-move-fast-enough-on-inflation/,2024-10-05T12:09:41Z,"It's an unusually tense time at the Federal Reserve as Democrats and Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- target the central bank as it starts cutting rates in its most significant monetary policy in decades. Forbes spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, an alternate member on the highly watched Federal Open Market Committee and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama, about how ""super serious"" central bankers feel about becoming a political football ahead of the election, how the Fed is adjusting to easing inflation and growing recession angst, and what he'd change about the ""behind the curve"" policy leading to the worst inflation crisis in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Forbes: Have there been any discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings about pressure from both sides of the political aisle to act in a certain way heading into the election? Context: The FOMC is the U.S. central bank panel that votes on the target federal funds rate, which heavily influences interest rates on loans across the country, impacting inflation, economic growth and unemployment. The Fed is under heightened scrutiny after rolling out the first interest rate cuts since early 2020 last month. The reaction function refers to how a central bank responds to one event, like lowering rates when inflation rises.

When you become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the election business. Everybody takes that super seriously. The things that determine our decisions are: What are the economic conditions and what are the forecasts. What would we need to see to stop raising? What would we need to see to hold? What do we need to see for stuff to come down? We've been laying out the criteria, and now we're just seeing come to pass the stuff that we've been forecasting, and so the reaction function is pretty well established.

Forbes: What are the data points in the labor market that you are paying the closest attention to meeting to meeting? Context: We interviewed Goolsbee two days before the September jobs report surprisingly revealed the strongest job growth since March, decelerating bets on continued aggression from the Fed on lowering rates and throwing another wrench into the central bank shift as borrowing costs look less likely to tumble.

Goolsbee: The unemployment rate, but everybody knows that. A little bit less, the payroll, job employment numbers. There was a time when, if you had asked me ""what's the single most important number?"" I probably would have said that, but not now, with the uncertainty about immigration and the uncertainty about these [revisions to jobs data].

This has been such a strange, unprecedented moment of new firm creation and self employment and different work arrangements. I think that's why we're having such major revisions on these [data points]. All of those things make me put a little bit less weight [on monthly nonfarm payrolls] since there's more of a question mark around [them]. All the measures that we tend to look at as economists to track the labor market - the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed, the employment-to-population ratio of prime age workforce, the quit rate, hiring rate, all of those things, plus the the new unemployment claims - I feel like they're all kind of saying the same thing.

The rate of change is all in the direction of cooling. And if you look in the past, it's quite rare that you see cooling labor markets that just settle into full employment. Usually, when things start to go bad, they keep getting worse. And so that's our challenge now: After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?

Forbes: Let's imagine we have that crystal ball and we're able to look forward to the end of next year. We officially stick the landing, core PCE runs right in that sweet spot of about 2%, and the federal funds rate falls to right around the median forecast around 3%. What risks for the second half of the decade are you most worried about? Context: Core PCE is the Fed's favored inflation metric as it tracks how much Americans spend monthly on goods and services outside of more volatile food and energy categories. Projections shared at the FOMC's latest meeting indicate officials have a median forecast of 3.4% at the end of 2025.

Goolsbee: It's productivity growth.

For productivity growth, the [data] matters the most over the long run, and in the short run, it's one of the most noisy [data points] there is. So that's why it's kind of hard to take that into account in the meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions. We saw wild swings in that over Covid...but in the last year-and-a-half, that growth rate of productivity has been averaging well higher than the trend before Covid.

Is that a sign that technology has changed, or is it AI? Is it something else? Is it hybrid work? Is it the business dynamism that we've had all these startups? Because if the productivity growth rate is going to be higher, even if not permanent [but] for the medium term, then the second half of the decade we're going to have a bunch of discussions like the second half of the 1990s, where there was an extended increase in the productivity growth rate. The implications for the economy are that you can grow faster and have more job growth without inflation in a world like that.

And income, wages are going to go up. Nobody needs to be nervous about wages going up at fast rates, because productivity growth will justify it. To me, that's an overwhelmingly important factor that we're going to have to think about in this second half.

Forbes: You're allowed to time travel back to mid-to-late 2021, right before inflation skyrocketed, and you can change one policy within relative reason. What do you choose? Context: After a decade of sub-3% inflation, prices began rising rapidly in 2021, and consumer price index inflation peaked in June 2022 at a 41-year high of 9.1%. The Fed didn't raise rates, the most common response to inflation, until March 2022, and raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to a two-decade high of over 5% in a 16-month span.

Goolsbee: I think looking back, if you had one thing to change, if you could know that the supply shocks were not going to be transitory in the three or four months sense, you would have started moving earlier.

You would not have been raising with this kind of rapidity that the Fed engaged in, 500 basis points in one year. That's about as fast as it's ever gone up. You would have started earlier but also realistically, I think it's worth considering how much lower you think inflation would be if they had done that. If you could have a crystal ball and have perfect timing and recognize it's not going to be a temporary supply shock lasting three months, it's going to be a temporary supply shock lasting two years, how much less would inflation be?

There were a lot of countries that tried both monetary and fiscal policy a lot of different ways, and, for the most part, they basically had the same inflation experience. It is instructive that there are limits to what the Fed could have done. But if I had one thing to do over - I wasn't on the FOMC at that time - but looking back, they were behind the curve, slow to move.

Forbes: I know you're a big fan of ""The Simpsons"" - what do you think Mr. Burns would want the FOMC to do now? What's the conversation like at Moe's tavern when CNBC comes on after the last FOMC meeting? Context: Goolsbee often references ""The Simpsons,"" the animated comedy which features curmudgeonly nuclear power tycoon Mr. Charles Burns and the pub ""Moe's Tavern,"" where Homer Simpson and his more working class drinking buddies congregate.

Goolsbee: Mr. Burns has, in various episodes, lots of cash, lots of equity and/or lots of bonds. So does he want high rates or low rates? I would like to think Mr. Burns, just out of his own pure self-interest, wants whatever is good for the economy. Financial stability seems like it is the order of the day for him. At Moe's Tavern, there's one of the episodes where they're showing old presidential debates, and Kennedy's like, 'I'd like to express my fondness for Duff beer,' and Richard Nixon's like, 'I would also like to express my fondness for that particular beer,' and it cuts Moe's Tavern. And they're like, 'That guy never drank a Duff in his life!' And I fear that Moe's Tavern, they would not be super enamored of the FOMC, but they should be. We're not the bad guys. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[Goolsbee revised his Burns response in an email: ""Burns is a notorious gold bug that's still complaining that the Coinage Act got rid of the ha'penny in 1857. He's had it out for the Fed since we tipped off authorities in season 9 that he was the one who stole the 1 Trillion dollar bill after WWII.""]"
Perfect Streaks: These 11 Billionaires Have Never Missed The Forbes 400 List,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahyoung/2024/10/05/perfect-streaks-these-11-billionaires-have-never-missed-the-forbes-400-list/,2024-10-05T10:39:03Z,"Making, and staying on, Forbes' ranking of the richest people in America is no easy feat. Only 11 out of 1,739 have made it every single year since inception.

ver the 43 years Forbes has published The Forbes 400, a total of 1,739 moguls, heirs and celebrities have made the ranking of America's richest people. Economic booms, busts, good old fashioned competition -- and, of course, father time -- have ensured that the list has never featured the exact same 400 people two years in a row. A few flashes in the pan only make the grade for a year. Many others spend a decade or two in the ranks before dropping off or passing away. But a lucky few -- the legendary 11 -- have had staying power, managing to earn a spot on The Forbes 400 every year since its 1982 inception.

In all, they are worth an estimated $342.3 billion today, up from $3.8 billion all the way back in 1982 when they first appeared on Forbes' ranking (equivalent to $12.2 billion in today's dollars), meaning they have grown their wealth by some 8,900%, more than double the 4,200% growth of the S&P 500. Their average age is 88.

When Forbes first published The Forbes 400, Warren Buffett was the 52-year-old chairman of a $1.5 billion (assets) Berkshire Hathaway. ""Lives modestly,"" we wrote. ""Estimated net worth: $250 million."" Four decades later, Berkshire's assets have surpassed $1 trillion and Buffett is the fifth-richest person in America, and the wealthiest ""billionaire streaker"" never to miss The Forbes 400. His $150 billion net worth is 187 times his 1982 stash, even after adjusting for inflation. (He'd be even richer but for the fact that he's also America's most generous philanthropist.)

Only 4 of the 11 are self-made. In addition to Buffett, two retail and fashion tycoons earned their way onto the lists thanks to their world-renowned brands: Nike's Phil Knight and Les Wexner, the disgraced L Brands founder behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. The fourth self-made icon is Donald Bren, the richest real estate developer in the nation, whose Irvine Co. owns 129 million square feet of real estate, mostly in Southern California.

The remaining seven all got started with substantial help from their families though all but one were able to turn millions into billions. Among them: the 17th-richest person in America Charles Koch; Leonard and Ron Lauder, sons of Estée Lauder; and media giant Donald Newhouse, whose family has investments in Conde Nast, Warner Bros. Discovery and social news site Reddit.

Four other members of the inaugural 1982 ranking made the list in 2024 but fell off at least once along the way. Star Wars billionaire George Lucas dropped off in 1983 due to a divorce settlement, but rejoined in 1996 during the planning stage of the franchise's prequel trilogy. Former president Donald Trump disappeared from the ranks amid his 1990s bankruptcies, and again in 2021 and 2023, but is back among the top 400 this year thanks, largely, to his Truth Social platform. Oil heir Sid Bass didn't make the cut in 2021, while FedEx founder Fred Smith spent a total of 6 years off the list.

Many of the original 1982 Forbes 400 listees have since died. That includes comedian Bob Hope (d. 2003), who only made the list once; mobster Meyer Lansky (d. 1983); Steve Jobs (d. 2011); and shipping tycoon Daniel Ludwig (d. 1992), the richest person in America in 1982, worth $2 billion ($6.4 billion in today's dollars). Others who made the original minimum net worth of $100 million (equivalent to $320 million today) -- including musician Yoko Ono and heir Timothy Mellon -- have either transferred their fortunes to heirs or were simply overtaken in worth by the likes of tech moguls, social media stars and crypto bulls."
Has The Fed Cut Rates Too Much And Too Soon?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/10/04/has-the-fed-cut-rates-too-much-and-too-soon/,2024-10-04T19:53:12Z,"Winter it seems, across much of Europe, has come early. Two instincts that grow as the evenings darken are the inclination to have a tipple in the evening and to watch a good film. One Danish work that captures both sentiments is 'Druk' or 'Another Round', which won the Oscar for best international film in 2021. I recommend it.

In the film a group of four school teacher friends decide to test the hypothesis of a Norwegian psychologist that humans have a deficiency of alcohol in their blood, and the protagonists undertake an experiment to maintain a 'warm' level of alcohol in their blood. It is an experiment I attempt often, but the real lesson today is with central banking.

It seems that central bankers have decided that in the spirit of 'Druk', the liquidity in the world financial system is not sufficient and have set out to administer near daily injections of cheap money. The number of central banks changing policy (i.e. to negative) is the greatest it has been, apart from the global financial crisis and the COVID period. In September alone there have been 24 rate cuts from central banks around the world.

Chief amongst these has been the 50-basis point cut from the Federal Reserve and the very dramatic, multiple policy moves by China. In short China has cut rates, infused the banking system, made mortgages cheaper and generally tried to spread liquidity over the emerging cracks in China's economy. In the spirit of 'Druk' it is the equivalent of going on a five day bender in order to cure a serious disease.

Nonetheless, the easing in policy from the Fed and China, together with what will likely be a couple of more rate cuts this year from the European Central Bank mean that the world financial system is flush with liquidity. Chinese markets - hitherto the worst performing markets of a major economy - show the impact and importance of liquidity. The market cap of the Hang Seng index has grown by a quarter in less than two weeks. China has overtaken the US in terms of equity market performance to date.

There is no change to fundamentals - I don't see this policy move having a decisive impact on the downward trend in Chinese earnings, but that doesn't matter in the near term - liquidity is coursing through the pipes of the Chinese financial system, and in turn might bring a temporary easing to conditions in the property market.

For all the analysts who devote time to measuring earnings and calibrating valuations, the reality is that in this era of 'quick to please' monetary policy, liquidity matters a lot for asset prices. My rule of thumb in constructing a measure of liquidity would encompass money supply, the state of central bank balance sheets, the key role of the dollar and net issuance of debt by treasuries.

The arcane notion of financial liquidity has attracted enough attention that the Financial Times recently ran an article breaking down its component parts. A couple of top-flight economics consultancies run their own measures of liquidity - such as LongView Economics and Michael Howell at CrossBorder Capital. The latter holds that we are on the cusp of a significant upswing in global liquidity.

If that is true, the implication for markets is 'Druk'- a persistent giddyiness whilst central banks keep rates low and liquidity flush, amidst an acceptable level of GDP and profit growth. Friday's job market figures in the US were very strong, suggesting that in fact there was no need for a large rate cut. This is the kind of macro climate we have seen in the mid and late 1990's, and one that tends to dampen the market implications of turbulent geopolitics.

From the point of view of asset prices, there are a couple of possible trajectories. Historically, the Fed has started to cut interest rates when the price to earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has been close to 10 times (1960's to 1990's). Now, like in 2000, it is in the mid 20's which suggests that extra liquidity now could run asset prices in bubble territory proper, and cultivate the next bout of inflation, something the central banks' bank, the BIS, has warned about (helpfully the BIS has taken a counter view to that of its members ahead of a number of crisis).

For the time being, the upturn in liquidity may be most meaningful for capital markets activity and assets in the private economy. They have been in the doldrums. If the 'Druk' hypothesis is working we should see a rise in IPO activity into 2025, and intensification in private equity deals and a rise in funding activity (beyond AI firms) in venture."
September Jobs Report Obliterates Experts' Projections,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2024/10/04/september-jobs-report-obliterates-experts-projections/,2024-10-04T18:01:30Z,"The American job market continues to forge ahead under a head of steam, forcing even the most cautious prognosticators to ask if it's really that good. Well, truth is, it's better than that.

Once again, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly Jobs Report astonished economists and market observers by revealing that 254,000 jobs were created last month, blowing away predictions of 140,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down from 4.2% to 4.1%. For the 45 consecutive month, the job market outperformed expectations, continued the most robust expansion in history, and even defied possible disruptions usually associated with election year jitters and shenanigans. In short, the American job market is a beautiful thing.

And as usual, it's not limited to the veneer of jobs created and unemployment rate. A look under the hood shows us the following:

While all this is going on, wages continued rising and are now 4.0% above the level 12 month ago. This is not the only good news for the wage earner. At the same time, inflation has cooled to a very manageable 2.5%. The typical worker, then, is up 1.5% over inflation, although that's little consolation after a trip to the supermarket. In other words, had it not been for the rock-solid job market we've come to rely upon, this would be a different conversation.

In sum, the current job market is a sturdy structure, not susceptible to erosion or collapse. In large part, that's due to to smart initiatives like the American Relief Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, smart fiscal policy on the Fed's part, continued enrollment growth in the Affordable Care Act, and - intangible but undeniable - overall confidence on everyone's part."
Why Are Concert Tickets So Expensive? It's Not (Entirely) Ticketmaster's Fault,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/why-are-concert-tickets-so-expensive/,2024-10-04T14:34:44Z,"These days, it seems like snagging affordably priced tickets to a concert should be its own Olympic sport. It wasn't that long ago when Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain was famously shocked to learn some musicians charged $50 or more per ticket; in comparison, Nirvana was only charging about $17. If someone told you today they got a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert for only $50, you'd probably wonder where they found their magic lamp. Which leads to the inevitable question: Why are concert tickets so expensive these days?

To find out why things have changed so much in the live entertainment industry, we spoke to Eric Renner Brown, senior editor at Billboard and a former staff writer and editor at the concert-centric publication Pollstar, as well as Tatiana Cirisano, a senior music industry analyst at MIDiA Research and a former music business reporter at Billboard.

As you might imagine, it's a little complicated, with multiple factors conspiring to raise prices. Some factors, such as inflation, aren't especially surprising, but others are more subtle and involve the way modern day musicians make money right now.

As with other sectors of the economy, inflation has impacted the concert industry, causing the price of supplies to spiral upward. But there's more to it than that, because it largely started during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the global economy slowed down and large public gatherings stopped in 2019 and 2020, many professionals were forced to take a step back from their work when concerts were canceled for health and safety reasons.

""A lot of bus drivers and truck drivers who transport musicians and crews, and, in some cases, semi-trucks full of production equipment for tours -- a lot of those people left the concert business,"" says Brown. ""They went to work in freight trucking, Amazon and other big companies transporting goods because that was still happening during the pandemic.""

Once concerts started up again, however, getting those workers back into the touring business didn't happen right away. With fewer people available to work on tours, wages (and consequently prices) escalated. So if concert producers wanted those goods and services, they had to pay more for them, post-pandemic. That lead directly to higher ticket prices.

Cirisano adds that inflation affects the cost of everything, including the gas to get to tour stops, airfare and hotel accommodations. There's also been a multi-year global supply chain crisis, which impacted many goods and services, including the tour buses themselves.

""There was a point where they were really scarce, so the prices went up,"" says Cirisano. ""If you have to spend more on that as an artist, you end up maybe pricing tickets a little bit higher.""

Big-name artists such as Taylor Swift and Beyoncé don't live directly off the money they make from touring; they have additional income streams like record sales, merchandise, endorsement deals, royalties and more.

But that's not the experience for many smaller artists, who generally rely on touring income as a main source of revenue. That's even more true now than it was a decade or two ago when record sales were higher and streaming wasn't the predominant way for people to consume music. Factor in that many artists were sidelined for a year or two because of the pandemic, and the result is that many musicians need to earn back what they lost during those non-touring years.

""Most artists don't make any meaningful income from streaming, so they have to supplement it with these other things [such as merchandise or live performances],"" Cirisano says. ""For a lot of artists, touring is their bread and butter.""

Moreover, Brown points out that many tours taking place across the U.S. are much bigger productions today than they were in the past. ""When you're looking at these extremely highly produced arena and stadium tours, fans expect a more immersive, multi-faceted concert experience than they might have expected before,"" Brown says.

Having a band play onstage with little-to-no production simply doesn't cut it with modern audiences -- which means that there are extra costs to create a monumental performance -- and that obviously becomes the fans' burden.

While this is a complicated question, Brown says it's a safe bet that the bigger the artist, the more control they have over their business, including ticket prices. Even if the artist doesn't have the final say over the final ticket price, they do have leverage. That said, artists simply don't have control over reseller prices on the secondary market.

Longtime bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Eagles tend to have some of the priciest tickets in the concert business, and fans will typically pay the high costs to see these legendary artists. It's a case of supply and demand, Brown points out.

Back in 2022, ahead of his 2023 U.S. tour, Bruce Springsteen faced controversy over exorbitant dynamic prices -- as much as $5,000 per ticket -- and that's before tickets hit the secondary market. When asked by Rolling Stone about the choice to price that high, Springsteen said he told his team, ""'Hey, we're 73 years old. The guys are there. I want to do what everybody else is doing, my peers.' So that's what happened."" The Boss then explained how ""most of [his] tickets are totally affordable"" but if ""the ticket broker or someone is going to be taking that money, [he thought,] 'Hey, why shouldn't that money go to the guys that are going to be up there sweating three hours a night for it?'""

In the pop world, Taylor Swift tickets could easily set you back four figures if you're seeing her in the U.S. this year. Tickets to her European shows were priced significantly lower. However, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end business analysis, Swift's average ticket price was about $239, the highest in 2023. Beyoncé's average ticket price came in at No. 2, around $209. Interestingly, according to Pollstar's 2024 mid-year report, the publication noted a 9.4% increase in the average ticket price, going from $116.41 to $127.38. The report stated the price hike ""marks only the third year on record with an average ticket price over $100. The 2022 average was $105.55, while the 2019 average topped out at $92.42.""

On the flipside, Ed Sheeran is a major artist who's managed to keep his ticket prices relatively low. Brown cited Sheeran's smaller band as a possible contributing factor to lower ticket costs. Per Pollstar, Sheeran's average ticket price was about $105 in 2023.

Another example is Robert Smith from The Cure. He worked to significantly lower prices, spurning dynamic pricing. Many of the tickets to The Cure's Shows of a Lost World tour in 2023 only cost fans $20 apiece. Smith worked with Ticketmaster after learning fees on the platform doubled the $20 tickets and surprisingly was able to refund fans for part of the service charge.

Web searches for concert tickets can sometimes lead to misleading perceptions of ticket prices. Google ""Taylor Swift tickets,"" for example, and the first few results you see will generally be resale sites on the secondary market, not the primary market. Cirisano notes that Ticketmaster is part of both market types, which can be especially confusing to fans trying to purchase tickets from their website.

""I think that's added to this perception that ticket prices are skyrocketing, when, a lot of the time, it's not actually the original ticket price you're looking at,"" Cirisano explains. ""It's the one that's been marked up by, in many cases, professional resellers who employ bots to buy hundreds, if not thousands, of tickets and resell them at higher prices.""

In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, over an alleged monopoly. According to a press release, ""The lawsuit, which includes a request for structural relief, seeks to restore competition in the live concert industry, provide better choices at lower prices for fans, and open venue doors for working musicians and other performance artists.""

Could this lawsuit be successful? Cirisano believes that the case depends on whether the Justice Department can prove Live Nation is putting artists who do not book through their venue system at a disadvantage. Without that evidence, the suit could be in jeopardy.

Also in May 2024, the so-called Taylor Swift bill was signed into law by Minnesota Governor (and now vice presidential candidate) Tim Walz after the politician was unable to purchase tickets to Swift's tour stop in Minneapolis in 2023. This law, according to The Associated Press, ""will require ticket sellers to disclose all fees up front and prohibit resellers from selling more than one copy of a ticket, among other measures. The law will apply to tickets purchased in Minnesota or other states for concerts or other live events held in Minnesota."" Basically, it will provide stronger protections for digital consumers and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.

The internet is ablaze with memes about Ticketmaster's controversial fees, but where do these fees actually go? Who's benefiting? For starters, the main benefactors are (perhaps surprisingly) the venues themselves.

Some of the fees are going to credit card processing as well. ""What a lot of fans don't realize is that when they're seeing those fees that are added on, a lot of them are not actually going to Ticketmaster,"" Cirisano says. ""It creates this perception like, 'Oh, Ticketmaster is adding all of these fees,' when a lot of those fees are being passed on to others.""

Of course, some of the fees do go directly to Ticketmaster, though the site claims that they are used to improve the platform and services.

Case in point: One way Ticketmaster has tried to improve the users' experiences is to use All-In Pricing for certain shows. (Some states, such as New York, Tennessee and Connecticut mandate the use of All-In Pricing.) All-In Pricing requires Ticketmaster to include all fees as part of the ticket price right up front, so there aren't any surprises when a fan goes to check out. For tickets that don't offer All-In Pricing, Ticketmaster created a feature that lets you toggle to view the total price with fees.

Advocates for All-In Pricing, such as the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), also want an itemized list of fees presented at the time of purchase for better pay transparency.

All-In Pricing can be the make-or-break solution for fans who budget a maximum price of, for example, $100, for a specific concert, then learn at the checkout their final cost will now be $200 with fees. The timer counting down how long they have to make a decision creates added pressure to what may already be a stressful situation. Fans in this predicament are forced to make a choice and it could be between having money for bills or getting to attend their dream concert. Knowing all the facts upfront can lessen the anxiety and make the experience a more relaxing purchase.

Make no mistake: If the next time you go to purchase a concert ticket and have to do a double take when you see the final total, it's not your imagination. Prices have gone up significantly in recent years.

Yes, Ticketmaster and other ticket sellers frontload ticket prices with additional fees that benefit the venue, credit card companies and the ticket sellers themselves. But don't discount the pandemic and all its financial repercussions, along with the need to offset the revenue artists have lost in the transition from CD sales to online streaming. It's no secret that Spotify just doesn't pay the bills for most musicians.

Artists have to adapt to these changes, which can ultimately trickle down to consumers through ticketing platforms. But in the words of Oasis, ""Don't look back in anger"" -- or, at least try not to when you remember a ticket to one of their shows in 2009 was about $50, but a ticket for their 2025 tour starts around $180.

Strong September Jobs Report Reduces Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/04/strong-september-jobs-report-reduces-recession-fears/,2024-10-04T14:03:49Z,"The September jobs report was stronger than expected and is likely to assuage recession risks and fears, driving up hopes for ""soft landing"" or ""no landing"" economic scenarios. This report is likely to reduce the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 0.5% on November 7, but the recent trend of slowing payrolls is still supportive of a 0.25% rate cut. An uncertain presidential election outcome could still push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%.

The Employment Situation report, known to economists and analysts as the jobs report, was strong for September. It showed a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, strong net payroll gains of 254,000, and strong upward revisions to payrolls by 72,000 for the previous two months. This was a much stronger report than economists and analysts had been forecasting, and it reduces the perceived downside risks to the U.S. labor market and economy.

While the jobs report supports the claim that the U.S. labor market is relatively solid, other recent data also reinforce this notion. After all, initial and continuing jobless claims are very low. Continuing claims are at 1.826 million, which is only around 1.1 percent of the labor force. Initial Jobless Claims are also very low, at just 225,000.

Strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showed that there were over 8 million open jobs in August 2024. While this is around 4.2 million fewer open jobs than the U.S. historic high in March 2022 of 12.2 million, 8 million is still around 1 million more open jobs than before the COVID pandemic. With over 6 million more open jobs than people collecting unemployment, it is difficult to expect very large net payroll losses across multiple months anytime soon.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. The September jobs report, August JOLTS data, and recent weekly jobless claims reflect full employment in the U.S. labor market, but consumer prices are not yet low and stable - or at least not yet at the Fed's 2% inflation target. The combination of above-target inflation and a solid labor market could incentivize the Fed to cut interest rates by only 0.25% rather than 0.5% in its next policy decision on November 7.

Of course, we don't yet have September inflation data, and there is also a U.S. election to contend with before the next Fed meeting.

The September CPI and PCE reports will be critical for the November 7 Fed decision. Year-on-year inflation rates are likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year September total CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%. However, it may be the November election outcome - or uncertainty about that outcome by November 7 - that could push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%

A strong September employment report with payrolls well above August levels and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1% is a signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which is likely to support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, this solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it assuages concerns about recession."
Tiny Houses Are Still Too Expensive,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2024/10/04/tiny-houses-are-still-too-expensive/,2024-10-04T13:36:52Z,"Last month I told the tale of two villages, one an improvised solution for shelter for people living outside and the other a tiny house village. The contrast in costs is significant, with the solution of sheds costs several thousand dollars and the tiny house village costing $5 million for just 30 units. Why are tiny house villages so expensive to build and manage? The A-Mark Foundation conducted an important look at tiny houses in Los Angeles asking and answering that question. There, since 2021, 9 villages have been created with a total of 1,217 beds and villages ranging in size from 74 units to 224 units. That is a significant number of people not living on the street, rights of way, or otherwise in the elements, but the average costs are $500,000 per unit. What can be learned about those high costs in Los Angeles and can tiny houses be saved from these high costs?

First of all, what is a tiny house or tiny home village? Generally speaking, it is just what it sounds like, small buildings around 120 square feet that range from prefabricated structures that can be dropped on the ground or in a parking lot to more elaborate built out versions with plumbing and utilities. The tiny houses have the origin in efforts by compassionate activists, often churches, to create fast solutions to immediate shelter needs for people living outside. These structures could often be built on church sites because usually local zoning codes give exemptions from elements of code compliance for religious institutions, giving consideration for these interventions as an expression of freedom of religion protected by the First Amendment.

Businesses have sprung up over the years building and selling small structures, some of them for the purpose of compassionate housing, others touting themselves as a ""solution"" to the housing crisis because they are manufactured off site and can be dropped with minimal construction costs.

The reality is that no matter how cheap these solutions are coming out of a factory or assembled on site from components, site conditions and regulations drive up the price. I wrote a post in 2019, Modular Housing Can Save Time, Money, And Lower Prices, and another one earlier this year, What A Fool Believes: No, Tech Won't Solve Housing Inflation, describing the benefits of manufactured housing solutions and the limits of them; factory production saves time (which is money after all), and local regulatory hurdles, site conditions, utilities and regulations shave off savings from the factory.

The conclusions of the foundation study are very conservative, mostly, I think, because of politics. The A-Mark Foundation gives grants for independent reporting, and The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) refused to answer their questions about costs for the report.

To say out loud, as I do, that regulations and codes are killing savings of improvised housing, would undermine the push for more cash. Those on the left are allergic to the word ""efficient"" believing it means cutting people off that don't bootstrap themselves out of poverty or living on the streets. Those on the right can blindly use the word to mean ""waste,"" implying that these people don't need a tiny home but a sobriety and a job. I get it. But let's face it, these solutions are way too expensive, and that means not enough of them are available. As I say often, efficiency is compassionate.

Los Angeles is no different than any other part of the country. The the price of land, construction materials, plumbing, electricity, and shared facilities are expensive if they are required. The foundation's report found that, ""Some of the biggest construction costs appear to involve grading/paving the sites and installing sewer and power lines. The Pallet shelters themselves, at an average of $4,419 per bed, account for a small portion of the $42,344 average construction cost per bed."" This validates my point, the tiny houses are cheap, but site costs and complying with regulations and including utilities kill that savings.

The answer, I believe, is to revise model building codes promulgated by the International Building Code Council (IBCC), creating a standard of health and safety that prioritizes health and safety but also speed and low costs. States and local jurisdictions should adopt these codes and treat the crisis on the streets for what it is, an emergency just like an earthquake or a hurricane.

Cities simply won't see progress on dealing with the crisis on the streets with big Low Income Housing Tax Credit which require substantial rent payments and screening and are very expensive to build or with sweeps of encampments which just move people around public spaces. The answer is a radical revision of expectations of what a dwelling unit can be and making building and permitting them safely easy and cheap."
Is It A Goldilocks Economy?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/04/is-it-a-goldilocks-economy/,2024-10-04T13:06:32Z,"Temporary Strike Resolution Offers Short-Term Relief For Impacted Industries

Stocks were relatively quiet on Thursday as markets awaited this morning's employment situation report. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Small cap stocks were the biggest movers for the day, falling over 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%.

This morning, the Labor Department released the latest employment report. Forecasts were calling for 147 thousand new jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual numbers were 254 thousand new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. We also saw upward revisions for both July and August, suggesting the economy continues to show strength. We'll get the latest Consumer Price Index late next week and a chance to see if prices are continuing on their trajectory of moderating. Thus far though, the net effect of recent data implies an economy continuing on target for a soft landing. However, there is one potential caveat to that, oil.

On Thursday, oil was up over 5% as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile attack earlier in the week. For the week, crude oil prices are up nearly 10% and that is something with the potential to upset the progress made vis-a-vis inflation. If there is one commodity that has the potential to jumpstart inflation, it is oil. Therefore, in addition to both the humanitarian and geopolitical repercussions, there is the potential for economic upheaval as well. The 200-day moving average for crude oil is right around $75 and that is a level I'll be watching. A close above that could be bullish for those who are long but bearish for inflation.

The other big story on Thursday was the temporary end to the strike at ports along the East Coast. Employers offered workers a pay increase of 62% spread out over six years. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators said this agreement will last until late January as the two sides work on a long-term deal. One of the main sticking points in the negotiations is automation and how that will impact jobs. Seeing as how the strike lasted just three days, any economic impact was likely muted. However, this is an issue we may hear about again come early next year. In the meantime, we're seeing some of the companies that could have been negatively impacted by a prolonged strike trading higher in premarket activity. Shares of Walmart are up 0.5% along with Target, which is trading higher by nearly 1%.

For today, I'm keeping an eye on how the jobs data report is spun and oil. The market's initial reaction to the jobs number has been bullish. Index futures jumped when the report was released. Heading into this morning's report, sentiment was largely in the camp that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet in November. Expectations for that quarter point cut were relatively unchanged after the employment number was released. One other thing I'll be watching today is the VIX. Last Friday, volatility increased right near the end of the day. I believe that was largely due to the situation in the Middle East and investor concern about the potential for increased hostilities over the weekend. Given the state of affairs as of Friday morning, I would not be surprised if we saw a similar situation today. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
The Latest Employment Numbers And The Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2024/10/04/the-latest-employment-numbers-and-the-presidential-election/,2024-10-04T12:44:31Z,"The Employment Situation Report for the month of September was released this morning. It showed what everyone expected: very little change in the unemployment rate. At 4.1%, it was actually slightly lower than that for August (4.2%). One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other. And while there is evidence that Kamala Harris' economic message may be gaining ground on Donald Trump's, a lot can happen in a month.

Everyone will be watching these numbers closely."
What's Happening With News Corp Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/04/whats-happening-with-news-corp-stock/,2024-10-04T11:04:12Z,"After an 8% rise year-to-date, at the current price of around $26 per share, we believe News Corp stock (NASDAQ: NWSA), a global, diversified media and information services company, could see further gains in the longer term. NWSA stock grew from around $25 to $26 during this period, underperforming the broader indices, with the S&P rising about 20% over the same time. For the full year 2024, News Corp's revenues grew 2% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $10 billion while its adjusted profitability grew 43% y-o-y to 70 cents. The results were driven by higher Australian residential revenues at REA Group, improved digital sales at the Book Publishing segment, and continued growth in the professional information business at the Dow Jones segment. The results were partly offset by lower advertising revenues in the News Media segment and lower revenues at Move due to ongoing challenging housing market conditions in the U.S.

The company's segment-wise review presents a largely optimistic picture, albeit with notable exceptions in two operating segments that are exhibiting declining trends: Subscription Video Services (revenue down 1%, EBITDA down 11%) and News Media segment (revenue down 4%, EBITDA down 23%). In the Subscription Video Services segment, higher costs related to Hubbl's launch and escalated sports programming rights expenses, resulting from contractual rate increases, contributed to the decline in profitability. The news media businesses face ongoing print challenges and transition to digital platforms, particularly in the News Corp Australia division.

The increase in NWSA stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 25% in 2021, -18% in 2022, and 36% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NWSA face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Going forward, NWSA expects higher costs due to the supply chain and inflationary pressures. Advertising conditions and visibility remain limited across businesses. Looking at each of the segments, Australian residential new buy listings for July grew 12% as it lapped tougher prior-year comparisons at Digital Real Estate Services. REA's fiscal 2025 prospects have been bolstered by the successful implementation of a 10% price increase for Premier Plus. The company's y-o-y growth trajectory is anticipated to benefit from strong prior-year listing volumes, driven primarily by the Melbourne and Sydney markets. At Dow Jones, the segment is expected to benefit from stronger growth in B2B revenues with the rate of expenses to be moderately higher due to investment in upselling and new products.

We forecast News Corp's Revenues to be $10.4 billion for the fiscal year 2025, up 3% y-o-y. Looking at the bottom line, we now forecast earnings per share to be 87 cents. Given the changes to our revenues and EPS forecast, we have revised News Corp's Valuation to $30 per share, based on a $0.87 expected EPS and a 34.4x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025 - 15% higher than the current market price. That said, the company's stock appears cheap at the current price.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how News Corp's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
How Mining For National Security Will Help Salmon In Central Idaho,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/10/04/how-mining-for-national-security-will-help-salmon-in-central-idaho/,2024-10-04T10:39:43Z,"Thanks to record gold prices, Laurel Sayers and Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of back country salmon streams.

ow frustrating to be a Chinook salmon. You exit the Pacific Ocean into the Columbia River, then migrate up the Snake River to the Salmon River, where hundreds of miles from the ocean in central Idaho you finally reach your ancestral stream, the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River - only for the journey to end in an abandoned mine pit called the ""Glory Hole,"" where your path upstream is blocked by a million tons of mine tailings leaching a ton of arsenic a year into your river.

During World War II the Stibnite mine near Yellow Pine, Idaho (pop: 32) produced 50% of the tungsten and 90% of the antimony vital to the war effort. Antimony, a soft, shiny metalloid, is used in explosives, ammunition and now in semiconductors, solar panels and night vision gear. Mine operators back in the day weren't too worried about the plight of migrating salmon or even the gold ore they produced, much of which they left behind in tailings piles.

After being mothballed in 1997, the site became somewhat of an obsession for geologists and entrepreneurs who recognized how much valuable ore remained. ""We didn't make this mess, but we are willing to be part of the solution,"" says Laurel Sayer, CEO of publicly traded Perpetua Resources Idaho (market cap $600 million) who was working as a conservationist, running the Idaho Land Trust a decade ago when she learned about the Stibnite mine and caught the bug. ""I was so drawn to the opportunity to marry the responsible production of gold and antimony and leave it better than it is today."" (Stibnite is the mineral form of the element antimony, often found in ore containing gold.)

Why care so much? The mine, in the Payette National Forest, could not be in a more remote or rugged location. But its contents are unique to North America, and uniquely vital for national security. That's because in recent decades China has cornered the antimony market, controlling some 90% of global supplies with mines in China and Tajikistan.

""When we don't control the resource, they can manipulate the price,"" says Sayer, 67. In the eight years since she started guiding Perpetua (formerly Midas Gold) through the federal permitting process, antimony prices have nearly doubled - to a record $22,000 a ton after China's announcement in August that it would restrict exports. It was already evident that the U.S. was in vital need of diversifying supply; now getting access to 75,000 tons of antimony reserves at the mine has become a low-key emergency.

But although the U.S. Department of Defense is a big backer of Perpetua's efforts, with $70 million in grants so far, not even the Pentagon can simply order the mine reopened. For eight years Perpetua has labored under the auspices of the National Environmental Policy Act to detail how its new mining operation would clean up the mess of the old one.

Sayers relied on her background working on Capitol Hill to acquire the adequate ""social license"", mostly by utilizing the good neighbor approach. ""In developing the plan we worked backwards,"" she says. ""What do we want it to look like and what do we have to do to get there?"" The vision involved 450 acres of restored wetlands, forests replanted with 65,000 trees and 20 miles of stream reopened to the salmon.

In 2020 the Forest Service released a draft environmental statement for the project, which inspired more than 8,000 public comments, inspiring Perpetua to re-engineer for lower arsenic levels and cooler salmon-friendly temperatures in the river. That led to a supplemental environmental statement in 2022, and another couple years of comments and reconsiderations. This September, Perpetua celebrated receipt of a final environmental statement.

Meanwhile, a year ago the Nez Perce tribe settled its Clean Water Act lawsuit against Perpetua for $5 million in payments. And even before receiving official greenlights (expected by yearend) Perpetua has spent $17 million on conservation work, including moving 325,000 tons of old mine tailings away from waterways.

Naturally, groups like the Save The South Fork Salmon still object to any plan involving open pits and cyanide-based ore leaching. But it's unlikely now for any heckler's veto to block a Pentagon pet project. ""I'm a mom of a veteran soldier in Iraq,"" says Sayer. ""I know what it means to have our soldiers prepared.""

Another force propelling Perpetua is the surge in the price of gold since the pandemic. Even at a record $2,660 per ounce, demand is strong. Costco, which sells 1 oz gold bars via its website, reports that customers have been buying the bars at a rate of $100 million per month. ""Antimony is the enabler, but gold drives the economics,""says Saylor. Over the 15 year initial life of the mine, Perpetua expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits. For goldbugs, this makes Perpetua an alluring long-term, out-of-the-money option on the yellow metal, with a lot more appreciation potential than buying shares in a physical gold ETF, or top miners like Barrick Gold or Franco-Nevada.

Investing in micro-cap Perpetua is not risk-free. Its stock has tripled since February to more than $9, but it has been extremely volatile. From its peak at $15 in August 2020, it fell to under $2 by the end of October 2022. The company has posted cumulative losses of $600 million going back more than a decade, with $400 million spent just getting through the eight-year-long NEPA process. Despite an annual cash-burn of about $20 million, Perpetua has just $10 million in long-term debts. To build out the mine, Perpetua has tapped RBC Capital Markets and Endeavor Financial to arrange financing and is already eyeing a potential $1.8 billion in loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Tax credits for critical materials enshrined in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act promise to offset 10% of antimony production costs.

There's naturally some execution risk here. With the permitting phase nearly complete, Sayers has turned over the reins to new CEO John Cherry who previously ran PolyMet Mining after years at Rio Tinto. He'll oversee a construction phase featuring 650 workers who will be transported in for two-week work stints - like rig hands on a Gulf of Mexico oil platform.

Sayers says measuring success will be easy: ""All you have to do is to see the salmon come back and spawn again."""

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can park some cash? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are infamous for paying paltry interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you score a basic savings account with a rate in that general area, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Oil Surges On Israel-Iran Tensions: OPEC+ Strategy Shifts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2024/10/03/oil-surges-on-israel-iran-tensions-opec-strategy-shifts/,2024-10-03T21:42:38Z,"In the span of 24 hours, President Biden met to discuss an Israeli attack on Iranian facilities causing oil prices to surge while the Saudi oil minister has said prices could drop to as low as $50 per barrel if so-called cheaters within OPEC+ don't stick to agreed-upon production limits, according to delegates in the cartel. Benchmark U.S. crude saw its largest one-day gain in a year, jumping 5.1% to $73.71. The news also impacted U.S. stock indexes negatively. The Saudi oil minister's remarks were interpreted by other producers as a veiled threat that the kingdom is willing to launch a price war to keep its market share if other countries don't abide by the group's agreements.

This stark juxtaposition of geopolitical tensions and internal OPEC+ dynamics underscores the complex forces at play in the global oil market. As the threat of conflict pushes prices up, internal disagreements within OPEC+ threaten to pull them down, creating a volatile environment for oil prices. Daniel Yergin, the legendary authority on energy, geopolitics and the global economy, has consistently shared insights about oil prices. He notes, ""Energy is a strategic commodity, and those who control its production and distribution wield considerable power"" and ""If a war started, the oil price probably would go up until you saw other oil from the extra supplies that are available elsewhere coming into the world, into the market.""

As tensions escalate in the Middle East, with Israel retaliating against Iran's recent launch of 200 missiles (most of which were intercepted or landed in unoccupied areas), the global oil market finds itself on edge. The potential for conflict in this volatile region raises concerns about disruptions to the world's oil supply, with implications that extend far beyond the immediate participants. Iran, a key player in this unfolding drama, contributes significantly to the global oil market. Producing approximately 3.99 million barrels per day, Iran accounts for about 4% of the world's oil supply.

Any disruption to this output could have immediate and far-reaching consequences for global energy markets. Iran's smuggling network is sophisticated; the country's petroleum business is run by the National Iran Oil Company (NIOC), a state monopoly. Its main customer is China -- not the country's large, state-owned firms, which are exposed to Western sanctions, but ""teapot refineries"" that snap up 95% of Iranian supplies. However, the concerns don't stop at Iran's borders. The fear of a wider regional conflict looms large, potentially impacting other major oil-producing nations in the area. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer, contributes a staggering 11% to global supply. Iraq and the United Arab Emirates each account for 4%, while Kuwait adds another 3%. Collectively, these Middle Eastern nations form the backbone of global oil production.

The interconnected nature of the global oil market means that disruptions in one area can quickly ripple across the entire industry. The potential for price volatility extends beyond the immediate term. If a conflict were to escalate and impact multiple producing countries, the effect on oil prices could be much more dramatic. Historical precedents, such as the 1973 oil crisis, serve as stark reminders of how geopolitical events in the Middle East can send shockwaves through the global economy. Furthermore, as Yergin points out, higher prices tend to incentivize increased production from other sources. This market response can help to balance supply and demand over time, though the process is neither immediate nor without its own complexities.

The impact of oil price fluctuations extends far beyond the energy sector. Transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer goods prices are all influenced by the cost of oil. Central banks and policymakers watch oil prices closely, as significant increases can contribute to inflationary pressures and impact economic growth. For oil-importing nations, particularly in the developing world, sustained high oil prices can pose significant challenges to economic stability and growth. Conversely, for oil-exporting countries, including those in the Middle East, higher prices can boost government revenues but may also intensify regional tensions.

For investors looking to capitalize on potential oil price increases, especially if further hostilities break out in the Middle East with direct conflict involving producing nations, two stocks stand out as potentially beneficial: Exxon (ticker: XOM) and Imperial Oil (ticker: IMO). Both of these companies are poised to benefit from higher oil prices and have less exposure to activities in the region than major oil producers operating directly in the Middle East. However, as with all investments, thorough research and consideration of one's individual financial situation and risk tolerance is advised before making any investment decisions."
Gold's Ascent: Why The Bull Market Is Just Getting Started,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobhaber/2024/10/03/golds-ascent-why-the-bull-market-is-just-getting-started/,2024-10-03T17:51:26Z,"In April, I published an article titled The Gold Investing Madness Is Just Getting Started. At that time, gold had broken out of a four-year trading range, reaching an all-time high of around $2,200 per ounce, coinciding with the excitement of college basketball's March Madness. This surge was fueled by foreign central banks buying gold at an unprecedented rate to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. Despite these developments, the Federal Reserve had yet to cut interest rates, the dollar remained strong, and U.S. investors continued selling off their gold ETFs. Given this combination of factors, I believed the ""madness"" was just beginning and that shifts these macro-economic conditions could quickly turn in gold's favor.

Fast forward to today, and gold is trading at around $2,650 per ounce -- a more than 20% increase! What has fueled this next leg higher? The same catalyst that originally broke gold out: foreign central bank buying, which remains robust and perhaps even understated. Additionally, two of the three previous headwinds have now become tailwinds: the Federal Reserve has begun cutting interest rates, and the dollar has started to weaken. Let's dive into each of these factors in more detail.

On the central bank front, the first half of 2024 saw another period of record demand from foreign buyers (source: World Gold Council). This buying has been driven by both adversarial countries like China and Russia, as well as allied nations such as Poland. The National Bank of Poland was the largest buyer in Q2, with gold now comprising 13% of their total reserves. The Reserve Bank of India has added gold every month in 2024, with year-to-date purchases totaling 37 tons -- surpassing their annual totals for both 2022 and 2023. According to BofA Securities, gold is now the second-largest reserve asset globally (16.1% of reserves, compared to the Euro at 15.6%), following the U.S. dollar.

While this activity is impressive, there is reason to believe that much more is on the horizon -- or possibly going unreported. China, previously the largest foreign buyer of gold, paused its purchases in May 2024, with gold still accounting for only 4.9% of the People's Bank of China's total reserves. Even more intriguing are recent reports suggesting that Saudi Arabia has been secretly buying gold in Switzerland. Since early 2022, it is believed that Saudi Arabia has purchased 160 tons of gold. Notably, the Saudi central bank last updated its official gold reserves in 2008, when it held 332 tons of gold. Anecdotes like these make it hard to believe that central bank gold purchasing is anywhere near its end, or that we fully understand the extent of what is happening behind the scenes. With potential underreporting and continued interest from both friendly and adversarial nations, the scope of central bank demand for gold may be far greater than currently recognized.

New tailwinds to the gold thesis include Federal Reserve rate cuts. On Wednesday, September 18th, the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points, an action front run by the market as 2-year interest rates had already dropped from 5% to 3.5% between May and September. It's important to note that the Fed has effectively declared victory over inflation, even though it remains well above the 2% target. At Proficio, we subscribe to some of the top inflation forecasters, many of whom predict inflation could make a run back towards 4%. A Fed cutting interest rates while inflation stays elevated will result in suppressed long-term real rates (interest rates minus inflation), creating a bullish environment for a non-yielding asset like gold.

Another key catalyst driving gold higher has been the significant weakening of the U.S. dollar, a topic I recently covered in an article titled America's Currency Crisis: Declining Global Confidence In The Dollar. To summarize, the U.S. continues to run a growing budget deficit, now approaching $1.9 trillion, alongside an enormous national debt exceeding $35 trillion. Additionally, the U.S. has maintained a trade deficit for over five decades. Combined with escalating geopolitical tensions, these factors have motivated BRICS+ nations to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. What is the perfect alternative, untethered to any country's debt? Gold.

I believe the three catalysts I've highlighted -- central bank buying, Fed interest rate cuts, and a weak dollar -- are all still in their early innings. However, one major catalyst has yet to materialize: retail participation through U.S. ETF gold buying. Despite gold having a market cap of over $17 trillion, sitting at all-time highs, and being uncorrelated with stocks and bonds, it has garnered little attention. A study by State Street Global Advisors and the World Gold Council in Q4 2023 found that a third of financial advisors in North America allocate less than 1% of assets under management (AUM) to gold, while 56% allocate between 1% and 4.9%. As my followers know, my research this year has recommended portfolios hold more than 20% in gold. When retail and institutional investors eventually enter the market -- and I believe they will -- my next article might just be titled ""The Gold Madness is MADNESS.""

Buyers beware: October is typically a challenging month for gold, historically speaking. Since 1968, gold has posted only a slightly positive average return during the month, with a median return in the negative. Add to that the upcoming election and excessive optimism around rate cuts already priced in, and it's possible we could see moments of weakness in gold. In my view, these dips should be seen as opportunities -- stay disciplined and accumulate your gold exposure. Gold bull markets are structural by nature, and we're likely in it for the long haul. As I said back in April, play along -- these are exciting times."
How Americans Think The Election Will Impact Their Personal Finances,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/presidential-election-personal-finance-impact/,2024-10-03T16:32:49Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The economy is the top issue on the minds of voters heading into the 2024 presidential election, and Americans are divided on which candidate will improve their personal finances, according to a Forbes Advisor and Talker Research survey of 2,000 registered voters. Of these, 48% were Democrats, 39% were Republicans and 10% were independents.

For instance, 48% of respondents said Vice President Kamala Harris would deliver a better economy compared to 44% for former President Donald Trump.

However, 52% said their personal finances were healthier four years ago, when Trump was in office, compared to less than a quarter who said they're doing better now during the Biden Administration.

Voters want the eventual winner to focus on bringing down prices; 60% cited inflation as the top priority for the next administration.

A look at the topline figures paint a positive picture of the public's appetite for a potential Harris Administration.

Nearly half (48%) of respondents said the economy would improve under her presidency, compared to 36% who said it would worsen. Another 16% said it wouldn't change.

Meanwhile, 44% said that a Trump Administration would bode well for the nation's economic future, while 42% believed the economy would suffer. A seventh (14%) replied that the economy wouldn't change much in a second Trump Administration.

But when you drill down on the specific issues that affect personal finances, including borrowing costs and the stock market, Americans seemed to have a better appreciation for a Trump victory.

More than half of respondents (52%) said their finances are worse than four years ago, compared to just 23% who think they're better off. Another 20% said they were about the same, while another 5% weren't sure.

Republicans (70%) and independents (65%) were far more likely to think they're finances have gotten worse over the past four years than Democrats (35%).

This finding jibes with a series of data points and sentiment surveys.

For instance, median household income adjusted for inflation was higher in 2019 ($81,210) than in 2023 ($80,610), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Just 31% of Americans believe the economy is getting better, according to Gallup, which is down from 51% at the end of 2019.

High prices continue to plague the American consumer.

Even as the rate of inflation has come down, prices are still growing much faster than the Fed's preferred target of 2%.

The personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out volatile food and energy prices, which is the Fed's preferred gauge, rose by 2.7% in August over the previous 12 months.

That's why 60% respondents in our survey think that easing the cost of living should be the top priority of a future Harris or Trump administration.

The next most important issues, lowering income taxes and creating more jobs, were each selected by just 10% of respondents.

Those results dovetail with what Americans say is impacting their decision this November.When asked to name the two biggest economic issues in the election, nearly three-quarters (74%) identified inflation. The second most popular response was healthcare expenses at just 33%.

This is a bipartisan issue: 79% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats selected inflation as one of their biggest concerns.

Americans are likely taking their vote seriously since 68% of respondents either somewhat or strongly agree that the president has a tangible impact on their financial situation.

Meanwhile, 54% think macroeconomic events, such as inflation or stock market performance, have the biggest impact on their financial health, compared to just 20% who say their personal choices are more important.

That makes sense given the massive events American consumers have faced over the past four years, from pandemic-era business and school closures to stimulus checks to sky-high inflation.

While folks believe that the outcome of the election will impact their personal finances, few will wait for a winner before making financial decisions.

In 2016, while President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was finishing his final year in office, those with a Democratic party identification were optimistic about the economy (+18), according to Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, while Republicans were gloomy (-31).

In 2017, when Obama was replaced by Trump, a Republican, the two sides flipped. Republicans (+46) were now ecstatic, while Democrats (-20) were miserable.

Independents were even-keeled throughout.

Obviously, these voters were viewing events through their partisan lens; people's fortunes didn't radically shift overnight.

This can have real consequences.

A Democratic voter who believed Trump would bring a market collapse missed out on years of stock market gains, for instance.

While your political passions may run hot, don't let them influence how you operate your personal budget.

Of course, big events impact your personal finances. Anyone who has lived through the past four years may have seen wild fluctuations in the value of their home, the interest rate on their high-yield savings account or the annual percentage rate (APR) on their credit card.

Where you run into trouble, though, is believing that these events have a bigger impact on your financial health than your own actions.

Research shows that financial self-efficacy, which is the belief that you're in control of your fate, is key to financial success.

Yes, big stuff happens. But big stuff always happens. The 2000s, for instance, were bookended by two recessions that led to a lost decade for stocks and a housing bubble burst.

You can thrive by learning how to navigate rough waters.

This online survey of 2,000 Americans who are registered to vote was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company Talker Research in accordance with the Market Research Society's code of conduct. Data was collected from September 3 to September 6, 2024. The margin of error is ± 2.2 points with 95% confidence.

After Hurricane Helene devastated much of the southeastern U.S., survivors of the wreckage wrought by the storm are grappling with another issue: How to pay for goods and services. Across much of the region, particularly in the hardest hit areas, credit card networks have been disabled in tandem with power and internet outages. Merchants who managed to open their doors were sometimes demanding that customers use cash only because of an inability to process credit or debit card transactions. [Payments Dive]

The Buying Power of Your Credit Card Points Is Tanking

Inflation is eroding the value of credit card points that are converted to dollars, losing about 20% of their purchasing power since 2018. Airlines and hotels are changing the points needed to redeem flights and rooms to reflect cash prices that have risen with inflation. Experts recommend redeeming points soon after earning them to avoid ""pointsflation"" and suggest using cards with easily transferable points to get the best deals. [The Wall Street Journal]

U.S. Senator Warren Asks Regulator to Impose Growth Curbs on Citi

A prominent Democratic U.S. senator called on a top regulator on Wednesday to impose growth restrictions on Citigroup as the Wall Street bank struggles to fix ongoing regulatory problems. In a letter to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Citi's years-long struggle to fix data, controls and other management problems show it has become ""too big to manage"" and should be curtailed. A prominent bank critic who has previously taken aim at Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and others, Warren cannot force Hsu to take action but her letter can still put pressure on him to be tough on Citi, and draws more attention to the bank's problems.

Mastercard to Buy Swedish Startup That Makes It Easier to Manage and Cancel Subscription Plans

Mastercard said it's agreed to acquire Minna Technologies, a software firm that makes it easier for consumers to manage their subscriptions. The move comes as Mastercard and its primary payment network rival Visa are rapidly attempting to expand beyond their core credit and debit card businesses into technology services, such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and pay-by-bank payments. The payments giant said that the deal, along with other initiatives it's committed to around subscriptions, will allow it to give consumers a way to access all their subscriptions in a single view, whether inside your banking app or a central ""hub."" [CNBC]

UK Banks to Put Four-Day Hold on Suspicious Payments

UK Banks will have the power to pause payments for up to four days to give them more time to investigate fraud, the government has said. Currently, transfers must be processed or declined by the end of the next business day, but the new law will allow an extension of three more days. For years, banks have needed to have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud before being able to investigate but have also faced pressure from customers who want payments to be made instantly. The long-proposed new regulations will come into force at the end of October, later than originally planned. [BBC]

E-payments Are Essential in China, But Still Tricky for Foreign Visitors

China's digital economy has been evolving at a faster pace since the pandemic. Daily tasks like calling a cab or ordering and paying at a restaurant are all done mostly through Alipay and WeChat. According to the Chinese central bank, in 2023 there were 340 trillion yuan ($48 trillion) worth of third-party online payments. Alipay and WeChat make up over 90% of mobile payments. However, it has not been easy for foreigners to sign up for the payment apps. To attract more foreign visitors, cities like Shanghai, aided by the country's central bank, have pushed to make mobile payments more visitor-friendly. Foreigners residing in China must provide passport details and a scan of their passport information page. [Marketplace]

Average Cost of Credit Card Processing Fees

You can give your customers more payment options by accepting credit cards, but you will pay a credit card processing fee to do this. The average credit card processing fee, which will be taken out of a merchant's sales revenue, is in the range of about 1.5% to 3.5%. Merchants can negotiate their card processing fees, and they are not set in stone. [Bankrate]

Baby Boomers Still Have the Highest Credit Limits

A recent Experian survey found that baby boomers have an average credit limit of $41,906, up nearly 4% from the year before and more than three-times the average for Generation Z ($12,899). While it's tempting to be jealous of other people's financial positions, there are some good reasons why baby boomers outpace everyone else with their credit limits. For one, boomers have decades-long credit histories. Lenders love long credit histories, and those who've paid their bills on time have likely earned higher limits. Second, baby boomers generally have a higher credit score than most generations, with an average score of 743. [The Motley Fool]

43% of Americans Have at Least One Unused Gift Card

More than 2 in 5 Americans have at least one gift card, gift voucher or store credit they haven't used. The average amount in unused gift cards, gift vouchers or store credit is $244 per person. More than 1 in 3 Americans have lost money with a gift card misstep. The data shows that 55 percent of households with annual incomes of $100,000+ have at least one unused gift card, more than any other income bracket. The average amount of unused gift cards for this income bracket is $348. This contrasts sharply with households making under $50,000 annually. Just 35 percent of them have unused gift cards with an average value of $180. [Bankrate]

Danish FinTech Cardlay is working with Visa to improve spend management for commercial card issuers. The partnership combines Cardlay's spend management platform with Visa's market position, payment network and data capabilities to offer clients ""fully embedded"" commercial cards and expense management solutions. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has projected that the global value of virtual card transactions will grow from about $2 trillion to $6.8 trillion by 2026, a sign of the growing recognition of their simplicity and security when compared to outdated methods such as paper checks. The research also showed that 55% of companies were using virtual cards more frequently. [PYMNTS]"
Strategic Leasing Is Driving The Future Of Luxury Retail,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/naveenjaggi/2024/10/03/strategic-leasing-is-driving-the-future-of-luxury-retail/,2024-10-03T16:10:54Z,"When it comes to luxury retail, location matters more than ever. From prime corridors like New York's Madison Avenue to the Beverly Hills Triangle, to Class A malls, luxury is back and it's bigger than ever. U.S. luxury sales reached over $75 billion in 2023 -- an 8.9% increase from the previous year, according to the latest JLL Luxury Report. Top-tier brands are claiming their spots and transforming the future of the retail landscape.

But in a market where space is scarce and competition is fierce, what sets one location apart from another? And how can property owners attract and retain these high-end tenants?

Creating spaces that keep luxury stores in place demands a strategic approach to leasing that mirrors the level of high-end service luxury retailers use to meet their own clients' needs. Here's how developers and owners can attract and retain luxury brands by offering targeted leasing strategies that enhance the brand experience and maximize property value.

Inventing a luxury destination, regardless of the location

Despite inflationary pressures, the U.S. luxury market saw significant expansion, with luxury brands leasing over 360,000 square feet of retail space between July 2023 and July 2024.

Nearly half of these new luxury stores opened in high-end malls, and almost a third of new leases exceeded 4,000 square feet. This includes Gucci, which expanded to a 17,500 sq ft boutique in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza, doubling the floor space across two floors. Cartier, Bulgari and Van Cleef & Arpels followed suit, signaling luxury's shift toward larger, more immersive spaces.

Street retail, in particular, accounted for 40.9% of new luxury openings during this time, with nearly 68% in prime corridors. This included Valentino's large opening of a 25,000 sq ft location on New York's Madison Avenue, and Saks Fifth Avenue's 130,000 sq ft opening in the Beverly Hills Triangle.

Seeing these trends, it is important for property owners to position their properties as a luxury destination, separate from mass market stores. Exclusive addresses, separate ""luxury wings"" in upscale malls and other exclusive zones within shopping centers all help signal these brands stand for quality and prestige that can't be found at a lower price point -- or at any other location.

Finding space to expand their footprints

While e-commerce's share of total retail sales has risen to 16% in Q2 2024, it remains below the pandemic high of 16.4% in Q2 2020 - a clear indication that physical stores are central in the consumer shopping experience, as over 80% of retail sales still occur in stores.

Luxury brands recognize the opportunity and are looking to expand their footprints by creating flagship stores that offer unique, elevated customer experiences among similar brands. First-to-market luxury brands like Serapian, Johanna Ortiz and Del Core chose to open flagships on New York's Madison Avenue, with notable openings.

Still, as the demand for prime space has surged, space remains limited. Malls offer a distinct advantage in this area, as even in saturated markets, property owners can relocate smaller tenants to make room for a luxury brand to build out its flagship in prime areas.

Catering to the next generation of luxury shoppers

Retail leasing strategies must also consider the evolving preferences of Gen Z and younger consumers, who are set to account for 70% of global luxury spending by 2030. As Gen Z and younger consumers gear up to dominate luxury spending, retailers and property owners need to evolve. More diverse and digitally savvy than previous generations, this younger demographic isn't just looking for products -- they want exclusivity, personalization, and unique experiences.

The key is understanding these shifting consumer preferences, then identifying and designing spaces to meet them, bridging form and function. For example, property owners can harness the power of their property managers to help their luxury tenants offer pop-up or influencer-driven experiences to engage and create a sense of exclusivity, cultural relevance, and luxury. Malls and luxury shopping centers can subsequently establish creative leasing and merchandizing solutions to help their luxury tenants reach this formable demographic.

Positioning properties for long-term success

Luxury retail is showing no signs of slowing down, and with the right leasing strategies, property owners can capitalize on this growth. Developers and landlords should look to attract high-end tenants, reposition existing spaces, and create experiences that appeal to today's luxury consumers and keep them engaged.

Whether it's expanding a flagship store or merging hospitality with retail, taking a strategic approach will ensure the long-term value of an asset and position a brand as a top destination within an increasingly competitive luxury market."
Signet Jewelers' CEO Gina Drosos Passes Torch To Ex-PetSmart CEO J.K.

PetSmart CEO J.K. Symancyk will fill her very capable shoes at Signet, as it executes a carefully planned leadership succession strategy.

However, PetSmart was caught unawares when Symancyk announced his leaving a day before Signet made its announcement. Now the company's chief executive vice president and chief financial officer Alan Schnaid will serve as interim CEO until a successor is found.

For Symancyk, it will be a major step up in responsibilities, going from overseeing 1,700 pet stores, including 200 in-store PetsHotels boarding facilities as well as a range of pet services to managing Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry with some 2,700 stores under 11 brand banners.

He will also be moving from a private to a public company, though he served two years prior to joining PetSmart in 2018 as CEO of Academy Sports + Outdoors.

And he will be entering an entirely new retail vertical, though he's done that before, going from president of grocery chain Meijer to sporting goods then onto pets.

""I am honored to join Signet as its next CEO and continue advancing the strategy that Gina and the team have established,"" Symancyk said in a statement.

""I am passionate about serving customers and I recognize the emotional connection of Signet's customers when they are making a jewelry purchase. One of the key attributes that drew me to Signet is its purpose-driven and agile culture and focus on putting its team members and customers first,"" he continued.

For Drosos, it will be a bittersweet parting from a company she did so much for and that did so much for her.

""It's always a good thing to go out on a high,"" she shared with me. ""It's not a sudden departure, by any stretch. I've been talking with the board of directors for more than a year to get the timing right and allowing for plenty of time to find a successor. The whole governance around this has been spot on, just the way a good company should do it.""

Drosos has racked up any number of accomplishments under her ""Inspiring Brilliance"" plan, including:

But perhaps Drosos is most proud of the corporate culture she helped build at Signet, including being named by Forbes as one of its ""Best Employers for Women"" and ""Best Employers for Diversity.""

""We've built one of the strongest teams in retail. It's one of innovation, agility, with a results orientation and strong purpose,"" she said adding that critical to the succession plan was finding a leader who would preserve and further build the corporate culture.

""J.K. comes into an environment that will be very welcoming to him, that will stand beside him, learn from him in the areas he knows and also be able to give him the opportunity to learn in areas that are new to him,"" she said.

Symancyk will get a crash course in jewelry retail over the holiday period, by far Signet's prime selling season and Drosos will lend a guiding hand during the transition period through the end of the fiscal year in early February.

Current president Jamie Singleton will continue to manage the company's biggest banners including Kay, Zales, Peoples and Banter by Piercing Pagoda.

Plus with Drosos' retirement, CFO Joan Hilson will take on an expanded role as both chief financial and operating officer, overseeing the supply chain and Signet's digital Blue Nile and James Allen banners, along with her continued responsibilities over Rocksbox, finance, strategy, real estate and the Signet services business, which is expected to contribute over $1 billion to the company in the future.

Through the course of Signet's extended succession planning, it believes it's found the right successor to Drosos to keep the company on its forward course, though Drosos said ""Change is a great accelerator,"" suggesting that Signet is likely to pick up steam in the years ahead.

Regarding Symancyk's appointment, Helen McCluskey, chairperson of Signet's board of directors added in a statement:

""He is a strong leader with more than three decades of experience across the retail industry and proven expertise in driving strategic growth, focusing on the customer, and developing and sustaining high performing leadership teams that deliver results.

""J.K. has overseen the expansion of large-scale businesses with multi-branded portfolios as well as services businesses, and brings important merchandising and operational skills to the role.""

Now PetSmart is in the unenviable position of replacing Symancyk, which will likely take an extended time. While CEO turnover reached an all-time high last year, up from 1,261 CEO exits in 2022 to 1,450 in 2023, according to outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, churn at the CEO level is not necessarily a good thing.

""Long-time and older leaders appear to be stepping down during this period, something we haven't seen since the pandemic,"" the firm's Andrew Challenger said.

Notably, both Drosos and Symancyk reached the nearly seven year tenure mark for outgoing retail CEOs, based on Korn Ferry's analysis. And PetSmart's primary competitor, Petco scooped up Joel Anderson as CEO after he abruptly vacated his CEO role at Five Below earlier this summer.

Given the current headwinds in retail, bruised by rising inflation and declining consumer confidence, plus a pending supply chain crisis from the longshoremen's strike, escalating geopolitical conflicts, the divisive upcoming election and all-round economic uncertainty, promising CEO candidates are likely to stay put in their current jobs. Or, if they've walked away from a previous position, they may be inclined to remain on the side lines until the present uncertainty clears."
The Best Dividend Plays For Fed Rate Cuts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/03/the-best-dividend-plays-for-fed-rate-cuts/,2024-10-03T14:52:20Z,"Now that Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has pivoted towards his ""other mandate,"" we should take a cue from my six-year-old, who yells from the back seat:

""FedEx!""

For years she has been enamored with the FedEx Corp (FDX) logo. Neither her sister nor her parents are sure why, but the affinity is real. See a truck on the road, yell ""FedEx!"" loudly to score the point.

I didn't have the heart to tell her that FedEx disappointed investors with a sanguine outlook a couple of weeks ago. The stock corrected lower, as usually does after earnings.

(Seriously, the best time to buy FedEx lately has been right after the company talks to Wall Street and the suits sell their shares. They rally in between earnings calls.)

FedEx is the type of stock I always watch, waiting for a pullback. It directly benefits from a megatrend, a bull market in e-commerce sales. E-commerce as a percentage of retail sales gained for two decades and then spiked in 2020. After a brief respite, e-comm sales are heading to new all-time highs:

FedEx is increasingly fulfilling e-comm shipments. My in-house FedEx fan recently received her brand-new rainbow basketball via her favorite courier via my order from DICK's Sporting Goods (DKS).

Instead, FedEx got the call and this beautiful roundball -- sans air -- was shoved into a shoebox.

FedEx may be delivering even more rainbow basketballs shoved into shoeboxes thanks to an accommodative Fed. Chair Jay Powell spent the last two years focusing solely on the Fed's key mandate: stable prices. Now, he needs to make an about-face and hit the second mandate -- labor. So long, inflation concerns and hello, accommodation!

With lower rates and quiet QE on the menu, it is time to ask ourselves ""what if"" the economy surprises everyone and the Fed stimulus fuels growth. After all, the economy has been growing since April 2020. Rates are down 50 ""bips"" with more to come. What if we see neither a hard or soft landing but rather no landing at all?

In this scenario. FedEx benefits. In fact its stock price has 40% upside from here just to catch up with its ever-rising dividend.

And our Fed isn't the only dovish central bank! Last week the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced ""stock market support"" plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios.

Yee haw, China! Shares of Chinese firms spiked last week and copper miners popped with them.

Energy prices have, thus far, remained subdued. But this flood of global liquidity is obviously supportive of dividend king Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP ). When energy prices jump, the pipeline stocks that AMLP owns boost their dividends. Just look:

However! If you cleverly own the stock through AMLP, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your sweet dividends received. Which dish an elite 8% as I write today, supported by central banks everywhere."

The bitcoin price has dropped to almost $60,000 per bitcoin, wiping away much of the gains it made following China's bombshell.

Now, after Elon Musk revealed the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, the Tesla billionaire has warned the U.S. heading for bankruptcy after U.S. debt jumped $204 billion in one day.

""America is headed for bankruptcy,"" Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter, linking to a report of U.S. debt surging on October 1.

""Federal debt explodes on 1st day of the new fiscal year, jumping $204 billion to new record of $35.669 trillion, but it gets worse: Treasury also had to draw down its cash balance by $72 billion -- that's over $275 billion in the red for just one day,"" EJ Antoni, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted.

Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered.

U.S. debt interest payments are forecast to hit $870 billion this year, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office earlier this year after runaway inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a never-before-seen clip in the aftermath of huge Covid-era spending and money-printing.

U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures.

Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days -- potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge -- and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024.

Last month, the Fed kicked off its interest rate cutting cycle, taking the market somewhat by surprise with a 50 basis point reduction and fueling expectations of a similar sized cut in November -- described as ""crazy"" by BlackRock's chief executive.

Bitcoin price swings this week come as tensions rise in the Middle East between Israel and its neighbors, with fears growing the regional conflict could spiral to a wider war -- highlighting bitcoin's role as a U.S. dollar and debt hedge.

""Observers of bitcoin prices this week would once again note that it is not a safe haven against geopolitical concerns,"" Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in an emailed note.

""I think this is normal. Gold is a geopolitical hedge. bitcoin is a hedge against [traditional finance] issues such as bank collapses ... or de-dollarisation/U.S. Treasury sustainability issues."""
Community College Trustees Can Bolster Ties To Emerging Tech Hubs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shalinjyotishi/2024/10/03/community-college-trustees-and-ties-with-tech-hubs/,2024-10-03T10:17:01Z,"A variation of this article originally ran for the Association of Community College Trustee's Fall 2024 issue of Trustee Quarterly Magazine.

Industrial policy is back in the United States, and the community college sector is needed more than ever before. There has never been a more important time for community college trustees to understand and support their institutions' contributions to science- and technology-based economic development, emerging technology sectors, and regional innovation ecosystems.

Scientific and technological innovation spurred by federal and private investments in R&D and economic development is catalyzing job creation, augmentation, and elimination nationwide. Community colleges will be critical to reskilling and upskilling incumbent workers, expanding pathways for young people beginning their careers, and meeting employers' labor market needs in a way that also diversifies the workforce and the jobs that will comprise the future of work.

Community colleges have always been pivotal in providing accessible, affordable, and workforce-oriented career preparation in healthcare, skilled trades, manufacturing, and transportation industries. However, all across the country, community colleges are also evolving to meet the workforce needs of the future of work - jobs and industries catalyzed and shaped by emerging technologies.

Today, community colleges have expanded customized training, certificates, associate's degrees, apprenticeships, and even applied baccalaureates (available in 24 states) tailored to opening doors to jobs in industries incubated and shaped by artificial intelligence, biotechnology, green energy, and quantum technology -- and, as a result, creating inclusive pathways to careers that define the skilled technical workforce for the jobs of today and tomorrow.

Their role in the innovation economy will only grow due to a massive influx of federal investments from the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act, alongside the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. These bills have catalyzed new funding opportunities and the need for community college partnerships, job training, and sector strategy around emerging technology fields.

Federal Judge Halts California's New Anti-Deepfakes Law -- Musk Says Its 'Score One' For Free Speech

Notably, CHIPS created the first new arm at the U.S. National Science Foundation in over thirty years-the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships Directorate. Under the new division, NSF has significantly expanded funding for community colleges in emerging technology fields, building on the successes of NSF's Advanced Technological Education program, which has been in operation since 1994.

CHIPS also created new opportunities for community colleges at the U.S. Economic Development Administration, such as through the Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs or ""Tech Hubs"" program.

More than fifty community colleges are partners across the thirty-one Tech Hub designees which will receive more than half a billion dollars in funding to create jobs and companies around technologies of the future, like quantum, semiconductors and personalized medicine.

The more trustees understand these science and tech-focused industrial policy investments and how their states and economies can leverage the funds, the better positioned they will be to help realize the promise of the innovation economy for students.

New America's Future of Work and Innovation Economy is dedicated to the study and support of community colleges in technology-based economic development and for job training in evolving and advanced technology sectors.

This spring, I provided an overview of these new programs in a recent podcast episode for the Association of Community College Trustees. This story, which builds on article that appeared in the association's magazine, further explores how trustees could connect their institutions to emerging industries.

Why trustees are critical for the community college in the innovation economy

While presidents, deans, workforce leaders, and faculty all have critical roles in unlocking equitable pathways to good jobs resulting from R&D investments, trustees have an especially important role to play.

First, as stewards of an institution, trustees can partner with a president and leadership to take a ""forest view"" of the college's offerings and their alignment with the region's economic development goals and, trustees might be elected, political appointees, or otherwise have political, business, and community ties that could help reinforce their colleges' tether to the needs of their local economy.

Second, trustees offer colleges stability in a time of turbulence. Presidential turnover and retention are becoming a growing problem for all higher education institutions, including community colleges. According to an analysis by the American Council on Education in 2023, presidential turnover has reached its highest level since the association began tracking such data in 2006.

Generational transitions will also impact college leadership. According to a recent survey from the American Association of Community Colleges, more than half of sitting community college leaders indicate they plan to transition out of their position within the next five years, and one-third expect to retire in that timeframe.

Faculty and staff, too, are in a period of transition. A 2022 survey from the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources found that more than half of surveyed higher education workers plan to leave their roles. An EAB analysis has found that community colleges have faced a 13% staff decline from 2020-2022.

That leaves trustees among the last lines of defense to help a college take a long-term perspective. That viewpoint is especially valuable when considering technology-based economic development predicated on investments in emerging technology sectors and the innovation economy. Silicon Valley wasn't built in a day, and neither will new innovation hubs catalyzed by federal investments, the AI revolution, or other future technology-driven paradigm shifts.

Trustees have a critical role to play in understanding, supporting, and advocating for their institution's role in job training relating to emerging technologies and to excel as partners in ""regional innovation ecosystems"" and technology-based economic development to grow and retain high-paying jobs.

What trustees and colleges can do: Three case studies

We interviewed trustees of three community colleges on the leading edge as workforce partners for the innovation economy - MiraCosta College in California, Miami Dade College in Florida, and Harper College in Illinois. Our conversations focused on the college's work and what trustees could do to support their college's role in regional innovation ecosystems.

First, I spoke with Frank Merchant, a MiraCosta trustee since 2015, to learn about a capacity-building effort MiraCosta undertook to better prepare the college for the future of work.

Situated in the southern California biotechnology hub, MiraCosta College is a recognized leader in education for the future of work. For example, in 2022, MiraCosta launched the nation's first community college baccalaureate in biomanufacturing to meet the workforce needs of Fortune 500 biotechnology giants like Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. But MiraCosta's foresight has less to do with chance and more with strategy. MiraCosta was one of the first grantees of NSF's CHIPS-enabled new Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT) program, which it is using to scale internships and apprenticeships in the biomanufacturing and microelectronics sector. But MiraCosta's success has less to do with chance and more to do with strategy.

In 2019, MiraCosta College partnered with the Institute for the Future, a Palo Alto-based non-profit, to undertake an institution-wide training in ""futurist thinking"" methods. The president, members of its Board of Trustees, top administrators, students, faculty, and staff took part in a series of trainings on ""futurist thinking"" methods, meant to help them foresee long-term trends and assess the possible implications for the institution, students, and neighboring communities. The college used institutional immersion to take an entirely new long-view approach to its strategic planning and operating process.

Not everyone at the institution was bought into the trendy-sounding training. ""You have to convince people that the futures process thinking is not the flavor of the day but your savior. It was key that I and other trustees go through this entire training process to let everyone in the institution know that this is important,"" Merchant told me.

Merchant recommended trustees explore similar training approaches that help institutionalize a proactive approach to the innovation economy - emphasizing the value of data to drive decision-making. ""Proactive expansion of offerings across these emerging technology areas is something that board members can support.""

Next, I spoke with Roberto Alonso, a trustee of Miami Dade College. Miami Dade is one of the nation's leading community colleges in AI education, becoming one of the only institutions to offer credit and non-credit certificates, associate's degrees, and bachelor's degrees in applied AI. In 2021, the college named Antonio Delgado its first Vice President of Innovation and Technology Partnerships, who has gone on to serve as the first 2-year representative on NSF's Computer and Information Sciences Directorate Advisory Committee.

In 2024, Miami Dade was recently awarded a $2.8 million grant from the NSF to partner with Houston Community College and Maricopa Community College District to launch a consortium dedicated to scaling and improving AI education at 2-year institutions.

Trustee Alonso emphasized the importance of trustees in ensuring that their institutions not only meet employer demands but also prioritize ethics across emerging technology training. ""We are democracy's colleges. We are an institution that gives access to all students. If we don't give students the knowledge they need to use AI in a positive way, we won't be tackling the biggest need,"" Alonso told me. Alonso encouraged trustees to consider how their institution can foster technologists in the public interest. Miami Dade is a member of New America's Public Interest Technology Network, which cultivates tech professionals who are ethics-savvy.

Trustee Alonso, who also serves as a Miami-Dade County School Board member, encouraged fellow trustees to tether their institutions' work in regional innovation ecosystems to their local communities through their own relationships. While 70% of Miami Dade's booming AI enrollment is above 26 and 30% above 41, Miami Dade offers an AI summer camp for high school students to immerse in the college's applied AI curriculum at no cost. Additionally, Mr. Delgado, himself as the college's tech workforce leader, serves as a senior advisor for tech talent development to the Mayor of the City of Miami to foster town-gown relationships.

Lastly, I spoke with William ""Bill"" Kelley, Board Chair of William Rainey Harper College, located outside Chicago, Illinois. Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker has envisioned Illinois as a ""global quantum capital"" and recently Nestled in the heart of a booming quantum science and technology hub, buoyed by a recent half-a-billion dollar investment in quantum technology. Harper is well-aligned with the tech-enabled future of its region's economic development strategy.

In fall 2022, Harper launched the Innovation Accelerator, a new collaborative unit designed to focus specifically on emerging technology workforce training. Writing for the American Association of Community Colleges, Harper President Avis Proctor described how the accelerator is developing accelerated career pathways in cybersecurity, quantum computing, and cloud-computing.

""Under Dr. Proctor's leadership, we set aside $900,000 from our HEERF [Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund] funding to creat the Innovation Accelerator,"" Kelley told me. ""We complemented that funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, NSF, and other agencies.""

Harper was one of the first grantees of NSF's new CHIPS-enabled Enabling Partnerships to Increase Innovation Capacity (EPIIC) grant funding program which it is using to work with a consortia of 2-year and 4-year institutions to improve employer partnerships in quantum fields. Trustee Kelley recommends trustees look at how the entire institution can support its tech goals. Harper engaged its philosophy program to support its ethics course in AI. ""We had to reach out to different departments for how to work better together as well as the college's foundation,"" Kelley told me.

Policy to Empower Community Colleges

Trustees Kelley, Alonso, and Merchant aren't alone as college leaders supporting their institution's evolution to address the future of work, but they are among the early adopters. All three trustees emphasized the need for federal and state governments to better recognize the need and value of community colleges in the innovation economy. Policy innovations such as allowing community college baccalaureates, funding apprenticeship and quality short-term training, and funding upstart costs all came up as needs.

Federally, Congress has only appropriated a portion of the funding of the CHIPS & Science Act authorizations. In July 2024, four community college presidents, including the presidents of MiraCosta and Harper College, joined New America to publicly call on Congress to fully appropriate funding for NSF. NSF encountered a budget cut in March, hamstringing its support of community colleges. ""Getting the other half of the loaf would be huge for the next wave,"" Kelley quipped.

As the U.S. government advances the vision of CHIPS and a bipartisan approach to industrial policy, community colleges will be critical to a successful and equitable innovation economy."
"Latino-Owned Business Revenues Grow, But Inflation Hurts Earnings",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rohitarora/2024/10/02/latino-owned-business-revenues-grow-but-inflation-hurts-earnings/,2024-10-02T21:47:00Z,"Revenues, credit scores and age-of-business of Latino-owned businesses all increased during the past 12 months, but expenses also rose, due to inflation.

Biz2Credit's annual Latino-Owned Business Study found that while revenues of Latino-owned companies increased (+11.6%), expenses rose more (+ 22.7%), resulting in lower earnings in 2023-24 than in 2022-23 (-$41.1K).

The analysis, released each year during Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15 - Oct. 15) examined the performance of small to midsized companies in the U.S. from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024. It looked at financial indicators including annual revenue, operating expenses, age of business, and credit scores of both Latino-owned and non-Latino-owned companies.

Revenues for small businesses rose overall, largely because of inflation. Earnings were down overall, but the average drop for Latino-owned businesses was not as sharp as for non-Latino-owned businesses. Earnings performance of Latino-owned firms outperformed the others.

1. The average annual revenue of Latino-owned businesses increased by 11.6% from $601,636 in 2022-23 to $671,360 in 2023-24. Meanwhile, the average annual revenue for non-Latino Businesses increased by 11.5% from $667,204 in 2022-23 to $744,027 in 2023-24.

2. Average earnings (Annual Revenue - Operating Expenses) for Latino-owned businesses dropped from $113,268 in 2022-23 to $72,168 in 2023-24, a drop of $41,100. Meanwhile, non-Latino-owned businesses declined from $159,365 to $94,237, a drop of $65,128. Overall, earnings across all businesses decreased by 40% year over year.

3. Operating expenses for Latino-owned firms increased by 22.7% from $488,368 in 2022-23 to $599,192 in 2023-24, resulting in earnings decrease of 36.3% for Latino firms. Meanwhile, operating costs for non-Latino-owned companies increased 28% from $507,849 in 2022-23 to $649,790 in 2023-24, resulting in a 40.9% drop in earnings.

4. The average personal (FICO) credit score* for Latino owned business increased from 641 in 2022-23 to 647 in 2023-24. In comparison, the personal credit score for non-Latino-owned business increased from 648 to 659 during the same timeframe.

7. The percentage of financing applications submitted by Latino-owned businesses, relative to the total number of submitted applications, increased slightly from 14.8% in 2022-23 to 15% in 2023-24. In 2024, financing applications by Latino-owned businesses increased 14.13% (year-over-year) compared to 2023. That surpassed applications by non-Latino owned businesses, which grew 12.78% year-over-year.

8. The funding rate for Latino-owned businesses stands at 32%, slightly higher than the 31% rate for non-Latino-owned businesses. The average funded amounts were $62,371 for Latino-owned businesses and $76,503 for non-Latino-owned firms.

9. Construction accounted for the largest industry category of Latino-owned companies examined in the study, followed by Other Services (except Public Administration), Accommodation and Food Services, Retail Trade, and Transportation and Warehousing.

10. By state, nearly one-quarter (24%) of funding requests from Latino-owned firms came from Florida, followed closely by California (19.4%), and then Texas, New York, and New Jersey.

The numbers prove that inflationary pressures significantly hurt the earnings of all small businesses in the last year, and Latino-owned firms were not immune. Profits for Latino-owned firms seeking business financing were down 36% on average, as a result.

Many factors combined, including increased labor costs, rising fuel prices, and overall inflation. Rents continue to climb dramatically, especially for businesses located in cities. Meanwhile, insurance costs have skyrocketed. Rising costs of labor, rent, and insurance are unavoidable, and there unfortunately does not seem to be an end in teh near future. They are significantly hurting small businesses.

Further, high interest rates also pinched companies that borrowed money for working capital or expansion. The good news is that the growth rate of inflation has been easing a bit, and the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates, thus bringing down the cost of capital.

Impact of Latino-owned businesses on the U.S. Economy

The U.S. is home to over 63 million Latinos, accounting for roughly 19% of the nation's population. Latinos contribute a staggering $3.2 trillion to the economy and own nearly 5 million businesses that collectively generate more than $800 billion annually, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI).

Further, Latino entrepreneurs are starting businesses at more than twice the rate of the general U.S. population. This increase has led to a higher proportion of new businesses being owned by immigrants overall. In 2023, immigrants were responsible for 36% of new business launches, up from 25% in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Latino immigrants significantly outpace other groups in business ownership, and they comprise 52% of all Latino-owned businesses. In contrast, only 7% of white-owned employer businesses are immigrant-owned, according to the SLEI. Further, Latino-owned businesses are set to revolutionize the U.S. economy, as Latinos are projected to make up 29% of the population by 2050 and contribute a staggering $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy, according to JPMorgan Chase.

As the Latino population grows, it becomes more and more of an indicator of the health of the U.S. economy. Business owners are hopeful that with inflation starting to ease, their revenues may again be on the upswing."
How CMOs Can Work With Influencers And Preserve Brand Safety,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/02/how-cmos-can-work-with-influencers-and-preserve-brand-safety/,2024-10-02T16:26:34Z,"What is human authorship? A decade ago, that was a straightforward and easy question to answer. In the days of generative AI, the definition is becoming much murkier.

Board game designer Jason Allen used AI image generator Midjourney to create an elaborate illustration of women wearing Victorian dresses and space helmets, attending a futuristic looking royal court, writes Forbes' Rashi Shrivastava. The image was not something the AI platform conjured from a simple prompt, though. Allen says he spent more than 100 hours giving it specific information to create the image he wanted. But when Allen tried to copyright the image, the U.S. Copyright Office denied his application because it lacked ""human authorship."" After reconsideration of the application was again rejected by the office, Allen sued the Copyright Office, asking a federal court to decide if it could be copyrighted.

At the heart of this case is a question of what creative, as a noun, truly means. Are the questions and indicators that prompted a computer system creative, or is something creative when only human hands and eyes have directly manipulated it? Midjourney and other AI platforms did not respond to Forbes' requests for comment, but Midjourney's website states that artists own what they create, but it also reserves the right to reproduce,license and distribute works created on the platform.

This lawsuit is also an interesting turnabout for AI companies, many of which are dealing with copyright litigation of their own. Authors, journalists, musicians, photographers and artists have sued big AI companies in the last year, arguing that the AI companies are illegally taking their copyrighted works to train their systems. The input, the creators argue, is all copyrighted.

Whether the output is copyrighted hasn't been discussed much until now. This litigation may not force AI platforms to reckon with that issue, since it only involves the Copyright Office. But it's a reckoning that is coming at some point. Some experts have said that copyright protections of data are the most important thing to regulate: There need to be rules governing who can use what and how, and ensuring that owners of copyrights can be paid.

As more brands use influencer marketing, there are more hazards to brand safety. I talked to Kevin King and Nicholas Spiro, chief revenue officer and chief product officer of the agency Viral Nation, about what CMOs should think about before starting to work with influencers. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

While inflation is finally trending down and the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates last month, these trends aren't fully recognized in consumer prices and wages yet. As a result, consumer confidence continues to weaken, with many Americans saying jobs are ""hard to get."" That attitude extends to what consumers spend. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that the National Retail Federation saw a 5% drop in back-to-school spending, which was at $39 billion this year. There was a 7% decline in back-to-college spending, which tallied $87 billion. And NRF predicts a 5% decline in Halloween spending -- from $12.2 billion last year to $11.6 billion this year. Census Department retail figures show that non-food-service sales only advanced 1.5% last month. That could be because of the still-high prices. A Bankrate study found that prices are 21.2% more expensive today than in February 2020.

This all puts more pressure on the upcoming holiday season. Predictions for holiday spending are beginning to trickle out, but there are a lot of question marks in the air, including a massive port workers' strike that began Tuesday and has crippled all shipping container cargo on the East Coast.

The NCAA's NIL policy, allowing student athletes to be paid for use of their names, images and likenesses, is extremely complex in practice. These complexities came to the forefront last week when UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka announced he was leaving the university's undefeated football team because of a $100,000 NIL payment he said he was promised, but never received. Sluka's agent has said the payment was offered to him verbally by an assistant coach. The payment in question would have come from an NIL collective, which is a nonprofit affiliated with a school that pools funds from donors, fans and businesses to pay student athletes for things like appearances.

The issue of payments from NIL collectives is already under legal scrutiny following an NCAA investigation into whether an $8 million payment from a NIL collective affiliated with the University of Tennessee for a high school recruit violated a rule barring NIL deals to attract students to certain schools. Attorneys general from Tennessee and Virginia filed for a temporary restraining order to stop enforcement of the rule, which was granted. Even though there does not seem to be proof of a concrete agreement in Sluka's case, it draws more attention to payments from NIL collectives -- especially because it's been criticized as an apparent state of permanent free agency, something that even professional athletes can't have.

Kate Spade New York has always represented luxury commercial fashion, but its clothing was only for relatively small sizes. The brand had some styles in XXL, but its size chart had a maximum waist circumference of 36 inches, less than the 39-inch waist of the average American woman. A new collaboration with online plus-size fashion brand Eloquii is extending Kate Spade to that market, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The Kate Spade looks, which are sold online and will be showcased in Kate Spade stores in New York and Los Angeles, have so far been a hit with customers, Eloquii founder and brand lead Julie Carnevale told Danziger. The clothes in this collaboration, which will continue at least through Valentine's Day, are not just larger versions of Kate Spade's main clothing lines, and are custom designed for plus-sized customers, featuring fabrics, patterns and cuts that are popular with Eloquii customers.

As Americans spend more time on social media, brands often want to partner with influencers who can showcase their products -- but it's hard to know if those influencers are 100% the type of people brands want to associate with. Marketing agency Viral Nation has technology that helps determine and maintain brand safety in today's world of social media voices. I talked to the company's Chief Revenue Officer Kevin King and Chief Product Officer Nicholas Spiro about the issue of brand safety. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity.

What are companies looking for today in terms of brand safety with their influencers?

King: Brands are recognizing they've got blind spots in the way that they approach brand safety. Going back to the rise of social, every brand was monitoring media. They probably had a corporate and public affairs group that was monitoring what the government was doing, but nobody was doing social media monitoring. It was a blind spot in brands' overall safety and reputational approach. Flash forward to today, every brand's starting to realize they've got a huge blind spot in the influencer space. There weren't really tools for influencer monitoring.

No two brands are the same in what their red lines are. They are obviously concerned about political leanings. In some cases, they're concerned about gun usage. In some cases, they're concerned about foul language or drug use. There is definitely a common suite of things that brands are starting to pay attention to in their monitoring.

Spiro: Broadly, we see quasi-low adoption of influencer marketing. Not that many brands have tried it. One of the biggest blockers for CMOs that understand the power is brand safety. They want to know that this is safe before they establish a relationship. Brand safety on the platforms can take a few different aspects, but often it's content adjacency. You don't want an ad to appear next to risky content. It's even more in the influencer space, because that's a true brand partnership. You've actually thought about them as a representative of yours, you've signed some sort of agreement, they're your partner. The escalations you might see are actually even riskier for brands.

Have there been many situations where brands were unpleasantly surprised by something that happened in an influencer partnership?

King: It's settling down a little bit. The influencers that are interested in partnering with brands have gotten much better at being cognizant of the world. They're being more careful on their end in a lot of cases. Overall, the space is getting safer as the influencers are starting to recognize where those guardrails are naturally from watching it.

On the brand side, though, I do see a lot of unpleasant surprises. It's because of that blind spot on influencers. You might look at somebody's Instagram feed from last week and it looks great and you want to partner with them, and you miss that when they were in college, they posted a whole lot of really negative stuff. The speed that surfaces is astonishing. It happens within hours. The social communities will make that connection really darn fast.

Spiro: The years of history [are] only increasing. [The year] 2008 was the hallmark in social media. Let's pretend you're sitting there in 2017. That's only nine years of history. At that point, it would be easier for them to scrub it. The whole memory of social media is going to be so much longer, so this in my mind is an increasing need. I think we'll all come back and think, wow, this was actually just the beginning of this, to the point when entire lifetimes have a social media history, which introduces all sorts of risk vectors.

What advice would you give to a CMO who is struggling with the whole concept of influencers and brand safety?

King: Every brand has a suite of tools that they're leveraging to make intelligent decisions. It's not just specific to brand safety. It's on measurement, their brand score, perception, sentiment, everything else. In a lot of cases, those tools and technologies that companies are using to make those evaluations don't evolve as fast as the social or influencer space is moving. Brands are still using a suite of tools that was maybe relevant some years ago, and hasn't picked up with the speed of change. They've got to really be constantly reevaluating those tools in their arsenal. Some of those tools sit in PR. Some of those tools sit in marketing. Some of those tools sit in HR. Some of those tools are sitting in corporate and public affairs. They're not bringing all those data sets together. If I was a CMO, I'd be cognizant of what are the current suite of tools available to me within my organization, and then where do I have blind spots that I can supplement that with to get a holistic picture?

Spiro: Understand that your reputation is one of your greatest assets, and it can be gone in an instant. I know it can be hard to wrap your mind around because it's not revenue, it's not immediacy, but there's that risk element.

Brands are trying to do it with their thumbs. They're trying to just scroll through a couple feeds, and that's not really feasible without the use of technology. There's a big-level-of-effort play. When you leverage technology, you're replacing a workflow of humans that are doing it worse, covering less, costing you a ton of money, because it's all these people and lawyers trying to somehow understand the background of an influencer.

"High-End Fashion No More Durable Than Fast Fashion, Report Discovers",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookerobertsislam/2024/10/02/high-end-fashion-no-more-durable-than-fast-fashion-report-discovers/,2024-10-02T14:18:14Z,"Fifty years old and founded by Associated British Foods, the Primark fashion brand aims to provide affordable clothing choices for everyone. With 70,000 employees and 450 stores in 17 countries, the brand's accessibly-priced fashion once earned it the nickname 'Primarni' in the 2000s-a time when it featured alongside high-end fashion brands in British Vogue, Grazia, and other fashion publications. Now, glossy magazines are steering clear, as are most journalists-particularly sustainability ones.

Since then, Primark and other 'value-led' brands have felt the sharp end of social and environmental criticism as climate change and supply chain tragedies have thrust them into the spotlight, tarnishing them in a way that luxury brands falling foul of the same crimes hasn't (the most recent of such double standards being farmer exploitation by cashmere brand Loro Piana, whose jumpers retail for as much as $9000).

Yes, 'fast fashion' has become fashion's sustainability scapegoat, with luxury fashion brands pointing the finger and calling it the industry's culprit, including Antoine, son of billionaire LVMH-owner Bernard Arnault, who famously declared on stage at fashion's premier Sustainability Summit that luxury goods are ""sustainable by nature."" LVMH's emissions prove otherwise, but nevertheless, luxury brands have traded on the line that their expensive goods are of higher quality and last for longer compared to affordable 'disposable' fashion. Inconveniently for Arnault, new research by the Environmental Charity Hubbub, in partnership with the University of Leeds, conclusively refutes that.

In 2022, Hubbub and the School of Design at the University of Leeds designed a study funded by Primark to explore the relationship between garment durability and price. The study was built from existing durability guidelines in The Clothing Longevity Protocol by the UK-based NGO Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Circular Business Models. The research entitled Worn Out: Is Price an Accurate Indicator for Clothing Durability included performance testing, including textile abrasion, seam strength, fading, and shrinkage, combined with repeated washing and drying cycles in domestic washing machines to assess how the garments were affected by laundry. An iterative process for analysis of the results throughout the testing cycles was used to show how likely it would be for the owner to reject, return, or stop wearing a garment.

Alex Robinson, CEO of Hubbub, explained that ""the tests were developed independently and analyzed 65 clothing items across three categories [t-shirts, jeans, and hoodies]"". The items were segmented in price intervals of £10 ($13) for the jeans and hoodies and £5 ($6.70) for the t-shirts. Robinson explained that Primark's involvement extended only to ""what would be investigated in the research,"" and the study itself was designed, implemented, analyzed, and reported without Primark's involvement. So, what were the results?

For womenswear denim jeans, the most expensive products tested ($160 - $200) performed best and were ranked most durable. However, one product costing between $121 - $160 performed very poorly. The jeans priced between $30- $40 and $15 - $30 performed very well and were ranked second and third. Overall, the test results showed little difference in durability performance between the most expensive and the two lower-priced products, making up the top three rankings, even though the price difference was as much as $134 (£100) between the first and third garments.

Similar results were seen in the t-shirt tests, where two of the top three performing t-shirts for women and men were lower priced, costing under $6.70 or $6.70 - $13.30. ""There isn't a correlation between price and durability,"" explained Robinson, adding that another interesting finding had been consumer attitudes to clothing prices: ""Consumer polling showed not only do people believe that more expensive clothes are better quality, but that they are more likely to look after more expensive clothes."" Robinson concludes that ""a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs and may contribute to durability,"" meaning we maintain expensive clothes carefully, giving the false impression they are inherently better quality. ""This [research] proves all clothes deserve to be cared for,"" irrespective of price, says Robinson.

How did the research findings inform Primark's new durability framework, published this week, and what does the false 'low price, low utility' consumer belief mean for Primark as a 'low price' retailer?

Primark's durability framework is part of the Primark Cares Strategy, which spans products, planet, and people. The durability framework helps fulfill their commitment to extend the garment lifespan and facilitate care and repair, keeping clothing in use and out of landfill for longer.

WRAP lent its support to the framework, and its Director of Collaboration and Change said of their research, ""We found that extending the life of clothing by an extra nine months reduces carbon, waste, and water footprints by as much as 30%-each"" underlining a key rationale behind Primark's efforts; the brand, after all, has committed to Science Based Targets, including halving its emissions across the entire value chain by 2030. Despite the link between clothing care and extending its lifespan, the fashion industry has no universal standards for clothing durability, hence Primark's establishment of its brand-specific framework.

Since January this year, Primark's durability framework has been implemented with all its suppliers, adding around seven days to the production time due to extra testing. The framework includes physical testing and repeated washing (up to 45 times) that simulates domestic washing to ensure that the results reflect how clothing performs throughout its lifetime. Primark says some clothing items meet the required standard after testing and don't need any improvements, while others may need small tweaks, such as zip adjustments. They say the changes don't always mean producing a more durable product is more expensive.

Product Longevity and Partnerships Lead at Primark Cares, Vicki Swain, says the Primark team is ""now building a database of machine washable clothes statistics and working towards which [ones] to change"" to give optimal care advice to consumers and extend the life of each product. ""Over 50% of [Primark's sales] volume is 'basics' -- meaning everyday essential clothing -- including t-shirts, socks, joggers, underwear and hoodies,"" Swain explained, highlighting the importance of longevity in products worn regularly. Simultaneously, this statistic illustrates that half of Primark's sales are unrelated to 'trend-led' or seasonal fashion, calling into question popular commentary that assumes Primark is synonymous with disposable 'fast-fashion.' When probed, Primark revealed that ""More than half of our stock is perennial items always in stock, 365 days per year,"" meaning no inbuilt obsolescence. They add: ""Our market knowledge and operating model means we typically have very little unsold stock. Anything left is resold or reused via our charity partner. We also have a zero landfill policy"".

Lynne Walker, Director of Primark Cares, says, ""We are taking [sustainability] very seriously, and we are changing [our business]."" ""There is an element of future-proofing in relation to incoming European legislation, and we will be compliant."" Walker alludes to increased textile product regulation, including the new Ecodesign for Sustainable Product Regulation (ESPR) and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations. Regarding the latter, brands will pay a fee for each product sold on the market to offset the cost of waste handling when those garments are discarded.

Such EPR schemes can include an ecomodulation opportunity, whereby brands pay fewer fees if their products are more durable and made of lower-impact or recyclable materials, for example. Walker says Primark's new durability framework is part of the preparation for this new regulation but is also necessary to maintain the brand's 'license to operate' in the age of climate change and increased consumer concern about clothing's environmental impacts.

Walker says, ""Previously, it's been up to brands to [subjectively] pick and choose what tests to incorporate' regarding the durability of their products"" due to the absence of industry standards. Primark is a member of the Textiles 2030 initiative in the UK, a voluntary scheme with signatory brands committing to environmental targets and progress on the Textiles 2030 Circularity Roadmap. Bur Walker cautions: ""[Although] Textiles 2030 is about setting guidelines, it's not quick enough"". With the European ESPR already entered into law this year and digital product passports (containing product impact, care, and repair data) to follow, the UK's 2030 ambitions are somewhat off-the-pace for UK brands selling products in Europe.

While Primark has taken the plunge to publish its durability framework and extend the life of products, how might consumers respond? If behavior dictates that inexpensive clothes aren't cared for well, how should consumers be educated on better care practices for all clothes? Robinson believes ""we need a lot more public discussion about the impact and the value of our clothes because there isn't [significant] awareness about how to extend the life of our clothes."" Robinson calls for ""communication with the public and upskilling for simple repairs, bringing that [practice] back into the mainstream."" To that end, Primark has conducted over 50 in-store workshops teaching customers basic repair skills and has established a thriving community in the process.

With consumer attitudes skewed toward caring for expensive items and punishing cheaper ones, should Primark consider raising retail prices? Walker declares the retailer remains staunchly dedicated to offering affordable fashion for all, meaning that price inflation to garner improved garment care isn't on the cards. Primark's very low pricing does remain the elephant in the room when grappling with its environment and ethical sustainability credentials. Brands may produce a $9000 sweater unethically, but can a $5 t-shirt ever be produced ethically and sustainably?

A Primark spokesperson says yes, explaining in writing the elements of its business model that allow for such keen pricing. These areas of leanness include not selling online (and therefore removing the burden of expensive delivery and returns), comparatively tiny marketing budgets (instead relying on their 24 million-strong social media community to share and discuss the product), and placing very large orders with suppliers well in advance to achieve economies of scale, then adding a far lower retail margin for the brand compared to competitors.

Price is clearly not a proxy for quality, and no product can be considered ""sustainable by nature."" However, a challenge remains in shifting consumer perception and behaviors to care for Primark as carefully as it might Prada."
Smart Data Tactics Help Retailers Win In A Challenging Holiday Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2024/10/02/smart-data-tactics-help-retailers-win-in-a-challenging-holiday-season/,2024-10-02T14:04:43Z,"Holiday spending in 2024 is expected to show modest growth, with forecasts predicting increases ranging between 2% and 5% over last year. According to Deloitte, holiday retail sales in 2024 are expected to increase by 2.3-3.3%, which is slower than the 4.3% increase in 2023. This is notably lower than the growth seen in previous years, partly due to economic pressures such as inflation and election-year uncertainties. Consumers are expected to be more price-conscious, with a significant portion planning to delay their shopping until after Halloween and focusing on discounted items.

According to consumer data from Prosper Insights & Analytics, the retail landscape in the U.S. has been on a steady downtrend since the pandemic as Covid subsidies have run out, student loan payments resume, and shoppers grapple with higher credit card rates and lingering inflation effects.

Retailers: Adapt or else. For retailers, the expectation of a modest forecast conjures ghosts of holidays past where a poor showing in December created a hole that they would spend the next year digging out of, or in some unfortunate cases, accelerate a decline in the overall business.

So, in a holiday season that is likely to put many retailers in the red (and not the festive kind), retail chains must not only keep customers from defecting in search of a better deal, but to get them to spend more at their store and not at a competitor's.

To solve this conundrum means finding new ways to innovate, and there is ample room to do so through smarter use of data. To start, retail brands must acknowledge an inconvenient truth: Most of them operate with an outdated view of who their shoppers really are and what affects them most at a particular point in time. Market conditions that shape consumer attitudes are in a state of perpetual flux, and data that is months or even years old fails to reflect the deeper issues facing most consumers nor does it reflect the attitudinal shifts that naturally come with an ever-changing economic landscape.

All these factors can create blind spots for retailers who need a more strategic understanding of who is coming through their doors. Put simply, retail chains need to adopt a new model that goes beyond understanding what consumers buy, but why they buy what they buy and what matters most to them at that point in time.

According to Prosper Insights & Analytics, retail consumers are becoming more pragmatic in their shopping approaches, prioritizing cost savings over store loyalty and focusing on necessities over other forms of spending such as entertainment or travel.

Shoppers have clicked off. In an age where consumers guard their privacy more than ever and attention is increasingly fragmented across a range data-hoarding platforms, the task of wringing insights from consumer buying habits is not always an easy one. Worse, the industry is inundated with errant, fraudulent, or irrelevant data, making it harder for retailers to know which information to trust.

As if things were not difficult enough, data collection in more states is becoming stricter, with increased consumer protection laws leaving retailers with fewer places to mine meaningful shopper data beyond purchase histories and what is left of online tracking.

On a brighter note, reliable, high-quality customer data is out there, but without a compass, it is easy for Santa to get lost in the blizzard.

The art of looking forward, not backward. To uncover what's driving customer behaviors this holiday season, some innovative retailers are embracing what insiders refer to as ""zero-party"" and ""first-party"" data, which can deliver a richer view into what drives customer buying decisions.

Unlike data that is scraped from various sources, zero-party data is information provided willingly by customers during online account setups or through independent market research using questionnaires and light surveys. These surveys capture previously undiscovered attributes that yield clues about what motivates shoppers and how they act on these motivations. The big hurdle for retailers is how to turn this data into insights, insights into action, and action into results. The secret may just lie in how the data is applied.

When independent survey data is gathered that captures consumer preferences and behaviors, it can be compared against first-party databases to reveal subsets of lookalike shoppers for which a retailer may have been unaware. Rich, long-standing surveys that ask the right questions are the first part of this holiday recipe.

Understanding the specific motivations of these new audiences - or new twists on existing audiences - allows retailers to develop better, more targeted promotions that not only get shoppers off the couch, but get them in the store, spending more of their tight holiday dollars. Surprisingly, few retailers know how to take this extra step.

Dynata, a leading provider of insights, activation and measurement data, recognizes that many retailers struggle to turn segmentation data into effective media strategies.

According to Brad Brockhaug, Chief Commercial Officer at Dynata, ""This approach gives retail brands a clear path to identifying and activating new audiences, allowing them to successfully bridge the market-research-to-activation gap, building loyalty and connecting with their customers in more meaningful ways at an unprecedented speed.""

Scale new audiences to growth. The advantage here is that retail chains now have a way to apply these fresh insights by activating the media buys that can scale a specific message to a specific target audience. This is typically done across massive ad networks capable of reaching millions of shoppers. These ads can include tailored offers and promotions that resonate with new buyers they wish to attract.

Rather than just looking at past behaviors, Dynata empowers its clients to predict and solve future problems. By tapping into zero-party and first-party data, they help brands uncover new insights about customer motivations and behaviors that might otherwise go unnoticed. This consumer insights data offers a deeper understanding of what drives purchasing decisions.

Predicting the future. This new approach to discovering audience preferences and motivations gives retailers a powerful tool when preparing for the future. Continually refreshed behavioral data that reflects the latest consumer attitudes can be a much better predictor and influencer of where future trends are heading. When executed against timely research and scaled through advertising, insights can be gathered as late as Thanksgiving and still give retailers a powerful way to attract new shoppers. Now that sounds like a holiday gift any retailer would be happy to open."
Shaping Wealth: Experiential Investing Redefines The Luxury Standard,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carrierubinstein/2024/10/02/shaping-wealth-experiential-investing-redefines-the-luxury-standard/,2024-10-02T14:04:30Z,"In an age where innovation leads the way, maximizing opportunities is essential. As flexibility becomes the new luxury, a fresh way of experiencing luxury emerges, paving an innovative path that honors history by bringing back old values and valuables to a contemporary era where they are better appreciated, experienced, and more easily traded.

A unique investment route now taking shape, redefining how we engage with prestigious assets to make them not only cherished but also more profitable.

LUXUS, one of the world's first wealthtech startups specializing in luxury assets, is poised to enhance value and increase liquidity while enriching the immediate quality of investors' lives, making luxury accessible and relevant in a rapidly evolving landscape. It has just announced a $5M seed round led by ATX Venture Partners and joined by Christie's Ventures among other rather strategic investors to launch 'Thoroughbreds' and Pioneer Experiential Luxury Investing.

The idea was born from a realization of a former Blackstone executive: ""Traditional luxury investments were often dismissed, particularly in the U.S., as niche markets more associated with European wealth says founder Dana Auslander, who through her work in traditional investments noticed a growing disconnect: ""I felt that luxury was overlooked and underappreciated as a viable investment sector in the U.S. Fintech platforms for alternative assets like art, cars, and sports collectibles were thriving, but precious gems and jewelry, often considered 'passion assets,' remained underrepresented. We are here to fill this gap, focusing first on fractional investment opportunities before evolving into a broader model catering to ultra-high-net-worth investors and family offices.""

Her new wealthtech startup initially explored fractional ownership, even registering with the SEC to allow everyday investors access to precious gems. However, they soon found that the retail investor market was shifting. As consumer spending declined due to inflation, fractional ownership models also lost their appeal. ""We realized that the fees were incredibly high and the unit economics, while seemingly efficient, were actually quite the opposite."" This led to a swift pivot toward an accredited investor model that better aligns with the needs of family offices, where investors are both financially sophisticated and typically more familiar with and passionate about luxury experiences.

The wealthtech startup is now poised to expand its portfolio and Auslander is excited ahead of the next investment adventure. Literally. ""One of the most exciting new additions is the Thoroughbreds vertical, which taps into the deeply rooted connections between luxury and the world of horse racing."" ""Thoroughbreds are the ultimate symbol of luxury,"" she explained, pointing to brands like Porsche, Ferrari, and Hermès, which have all used the horse as a symbol of elegance and power.

Financial Returns and Life-Enriching Experiences

Luxury, which has traditionally meant owning rare, high-value assets is now redefined. ""Traditional luxury ownership is very expensive and often limited to purchasing with no real added value beyond the asset itself,"" Auslander explained. ""Now, you're not just buying a piece of jewelry or a rare gem. You're getting the chance to experience luxury in a way that enhances both the cultural and financial value of that asset.""

According to Auslander, this unique weathertech startup provides three main pillars, the 3-E's: Exposure, Education, and Experience. ""We offer exposure to the finest luxury assets at optimal prices, education from top-tier experts to inform purchasing decisions, and curated luxury experiences at globally renowned events like the Kentucky Derby or Royal Ascot. ""We give investors the best of both worlds: financial returns and life-enriching experiences.""

Active Asset Management

One key advantage the startup offers is active asset management. Unlike traditional luxury ownership, where asset value fluctuates on the open market, they collaborate with brands to enhance value over several years. Assets are eventually sold through traditional channels or auctions, delivering significant returns. ""We treat our newest offering, LEAF, the first fund to combine alternative assets with experiences, much like real estate investments, acquiring trophy assets, managing them, and selling after three to seven years,"" Auslander explained. ""This model democratizes access to valuable assets while aligning with the goals of ultra-high-net-worth individuals.""

LUXUS has deliberately cultivated a highly selective community of investors, focusing on accredited family offices and high-net-worth principals. Despite the global desire to own luxury, the company has made a point of not targeting retail investors, citing high customer acquisition costs (CAC) and the unsuitability of niche strategies for a broader audience. ""Our core audience is family offices and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. We believe these investors are not only financially savvy but also inherently drawn to luxury experiences."" The platform's community-building efforts have already led to meaningful connections among its members, with investors traveling together and sharing insights across sectors such as art, luxury, and culture. ""We screen and vet all our investors very carefully. We don't compromise on privacy or quality,"" she emphasized.

The Future of Luxury and Technology

More than luxury investments, Auslander claims it's about enhancing the experience through technology. The platform has developed a user-friendly tech stack that combines investment and experience activities into a seamless, frictionless journey. ""As far as we know, we're the first alternative asset manager to do this,"" Auslander said proudly.

Looking ahead, the company is also developing AI-driven tools to offer more personalized insights and opportunities for investors. ""We're always thinking about how we can improve and innovate. Technology is key to streamlining access to these exclusive assets and experiences.""

Flexibility Is the New Luxury: A Modern Path to Timeless Value

Ultimately, it seems it is more than an investment platform. It represents a broader shift in how people think about luxury and wealth management and how they can play an active role. With the rise of family offices and the transfer of generational wealth, it is now positioned to meet the needs of a new generation of investors, those who value experiences just as much as financial returns. As Auslander put it, ""The investor and the collector are the same person. If we can offer both roles in one platform, we've succeeded."""
Oil Prices Rise Again As Concerns About Middle East Conflict Escalate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/02/oil-prices-rise-again-as-concerns-about-middle-east-conflict-escalate/,2024-10-02T13:27:17Z,"Crude oil prices rose again Wednesday as traders priced in heightened concerns about violence in the Middle East.

Despite the recent bump, oil prices remain far cheaper than they were this summer, with Brent down 14% from its July peak, and far lower than the more than $100 per barrel it stood for much of 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""While the geopolitical risk premium rose on Tuesday...this premium remains moderate,"" explained Goldman Sachs oil strategist Yulia Zhestkova Grigsby in a Wednesday note to clients, adding it's ""likely"" due to an otherwise favorable setup for production.

Crude oil prices most directly make their way to consumers as they heavily influence gasoline prices, but they also can lead to higher prices across the board as higher production costs make their way to final prices of goods. The climb in oil prices may throw a wrench in the Federal Reserve's inflation fight, but the volatile commodity is still well within its normal range of the last year, amid demand concerns from China, the top oil consumer outside of the U.S., and a proposed increase in production from Saudi Arabia, the top oil producer in the Middle East."
Yellen Is Wrong About Financial Regulation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/norbertmichel/2024/10/02/yellen-is-wrong-about-financial-regulation/,2024-10-02T12:48:52Z,"One of the best ways to kill the vibe at any party is to bring up financial market regulation. Few people want to discuss the theory behind it, much less the details of our regulatory framework, and who can blame them?

On the other hand, most policymakers inside the beltway view this regulatory framework as sacred. They're happy to talk about it, but only if you want to expand it.

I'm positive, though, that only a select few members of Congress know many of the details. And if the rest did spend the time to dig in, they would recognize three things: There was no substantive deregulation of financial markets in the last century; regulating to safeguard financial stability was not invented after the 2008 financial crisis; and much of the theory behind the post-2008 regime is little more than wishful thinking.

For those interested, there is a great debate here.

On the establishment side, we have folks like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Even though she claims to have ""focused on financial stability"" throughout her career, she believes it was productive to enact ""new macroprudential policies focused on mitigating systemic risk"" in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

She argues that these regulations have ""strengthened the financial system,"" but she offers no direct evidence. (Yes, many banks have higher capital now versus 2007, but that could have been achieved without passing any new laws, much less the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.) And if those new regulations worked so well, it stands to reason Yellen should not have had to bail out uninsured depositors in three banks that failed in 2023. If that bailout was necessary to save the world from financial catastrophe, those regulations could not have work as advertised.

Yellen also believes in Dodd-Frank's Financial Stability Oversight Council.

For those lucky enough to be unaware, the FSOC is the multi-regulator council that is supposed to reduce future government bailouts by, among other things, identifying threats to financial stability. As hard as it is to believe, Congress decided that even though the United States already had more than 10 financial regulators who failed to even see a financial crisis coming, a good solution was to give those regulators even more responsibility.

Yellen recently argued that the FSOC was necessary to give regulators ""a more holistic view of and approach to risks."" Again, the idea that nobody was regulating systemic risk prior to the creation of FSOC, in a holistic way or any other way, is undeniably false.

Regardless, here's the kind of riveting risk analysis the FSOC produces. It's 2019 annual report stated that ""Firms with high levels of debt may be vulnerable to unexpected financial or economic events that may negatively affect their repayment and refinancing capacity."" Who knew?

And in 2022, with Yellen as Treasury Secretary, the FSOC warned that the commercial real estate market ""faces a more uncertain outlook given elevated inflation, rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and the potential for structural changes in behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

If it really is too much to expect the folks at the Fed and the FDIC to know about this uncertain outlook, Congress has all the evidence it needs to restructure the regulatory framework.

I'm much more aligned with my colleague, Mark Calabria, former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and former FSOC member. In his retrospective 2023 book, Calabria wrote ""This may be the FSOC's real strength, pointing out problems in our financial system for which none of its members bear any authority or responsibility.""

Although I do think the FSOC has been rather useless, I am still highly critical of the theory behind its creation. The last way to prevent large bailouts, for instance, is to have federal regulators pre-identify those firms they believe pose excessive systemic risk.

But that's what the FSOC is supposed to do.

The theory behind the FSOC is that regulators can impose regulations to prevent financial crises. But we already know that premise is false. Worse, we know that government policies tend to be a main contributing factor in virtually all such events throughout history.

That's all bad enough, but if we accept the theory behind the FSOC arrangement, we cannot possibly accept the theory behind the superiority of the free enterprise system.

It may not be so obvious, but the truth is that, if a massive bank were to fail, it would present no greater danger to people's ability to earn a living than the failure of a company like Walmart, Ford, or Home Depot. In each case, we're talking about millions of people's money and their ability to earn more of it.

If we accept the notion that financial firms cannot exist without heavy-handed regulation to prevent calamity, then we must also accept the same for nonfinancial companies.

More broadly, federal regulators should not be empowered to stop people from engaging in financial or economic activities the regulators believe are too risky. As I've argued for years, the mere existence of the FSOC is wholly incompatible with the functioning of a dynamic private capital market. Congress should eliminate it, reduce invasive federal regulation, and stop giving bureaucrats the power to micromanage financial risks."
6.5 Trillion Reasons Why This 6% Dividend Will Soar,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/02/65-trillion-reasons-why-this-6-dividend-will-soar/,2024-10-02T12:48:38Z,"Right now, there's $6.5 trillion in cash sitting on the sidelines -- and a big slice of it is about to drop straight into a select group of dividend stocks.

We're going to ""front run"" that cash wave today -- and set ourselves up for income (I'm talking 6%+ yields here) and gains as this cash wave starts to build.

In a sec, I'll name two dividend-payers sitting right in the path of this freed-up cash. One is a true ""dividend unicorn,"" shelling out an outsized 6% payout that grows. The other has doubled its dividend in just the last five years.

Let's start by breaking down that $6.5 trillion figure: It's the amount of cash in parked money-market funds today.

Here's why a big chunk of it is likely to shake loose: Rates on money-market funds float, and the Fed Funds rate -- which Jay Powell, of course, just started slashing -- has a strong pull on them.

As yields on money-market funds (and savings accounts and the like) fall, more ""new money"" will bypass them and go into dividend stocks instead. Meantime, today's money-market investors will ""stretch"" for higher yields and payout growth. Here again, dividend stocks will be the beneficiaries.

It's already happening:

Above you can see the rapid growth in money-market holdings since the Fed started raising rates in early 2022. Since the second quarter of that year -- or about two years ago -- the total has jumped a staggering 30%, to just over $6.5 trillion.

You can also see (at the top right), that the inflow has slowed. It's no coincidence that's happened as yields on money-market funds like the popular Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor Fund (VMFXX) flatline:

You can see the fund's yield stair-step higher as the Fed hiked rates to 5.25% to 5.5%, then go flat as the Fed held rates from mid-2023 till this month's 50-point cut.

Let me be clear: I'm not saying the entire $6.5 trillion is going to go into stocks.

Plenty of folks will always be drawn by the promise of a guaranteed principal. But even if money-market holdings simply drop back to where they were two years ago, we're talking about $1.5-trillion making a move here.

And that doesn't include new money that bypasses these lower-paying money-market funds. Or any freed-up cash in savings accounts and CDs as they mature.

In fact, this transition is already happening, and in a surprising place, too: riskier high-yield, or ""junk,"" bonds.

Check out these big gains from the corporate-bond closed-end funds (CEFs) we held in my Contrarian Income Report service from November 2023 to now:

These are big moves for bond funds, especially for our two municipal-bond funds, NEA and NAD. These gains happened in lockstep with the slowing flow into money-market funds, and this trade is still working in our favor -- though after these funds' strong runs, I do rate them as ""holds"" today.

While we wait, though, let's dive into those two dividend payers I mentioned earlier.

Our first stock, payment processor Mastercard (MA) is in the pole position not only as more cash moves into stocks but from another shift few people are talking about.

I'm talking about the rising odds we'll not get a soft or hard landing in the economy -- but no landing at all. In that setup, the economy ticks along and inflation comes back.

Not great, I know, and we discussed it in detail last Tuesday. The upshot is that government spending is out of control, outrunning tax receipts by almost $2 trillion.

Give me an extra $2 trillion and I'll show you a strong economy! But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation -- and overwhelm Jay Powell.

This is one reason why those bond funds I mentioned earlier are holds for now. As I said, the trade is still going our way, but we're watching it closely, as any move toward higher rates would hurt bond prices (as rates and bond prices move inversely).

But the other part of this story -- a humming economy -- is great for Mastercard (MA), which takes a slice of each payment that rolls down its network.

And talk about pricing power: The credit-card market is basically controlled by four companies: Visa (V), with a 53% share, Mastercard (MA), at 24%, American Express (AXP), at 20% and Discover Financial Services (DFS).

Mastercard doesn't win many income fans with its tiny 0.5% yield, but payout growth is the story here: This dividend has doubled in the last five years, pulling up the share price with it:

If you've followed me for a while, you know I talk a lot about the ""Dividend Magnet"" -- a stock's tendency to track its payout higher.

You can see it in action here. The current gap between the two is a snapshot of the stock's upside as it ""snaps back"" to the payout. The low payout ratio (Mastercard pays just 21% of free cash flow as dividends) virtually locks in further growth, even if I'm wrong and the economy does slow from here.

Mastercard is a great stock, but let's be honest, it'll take years for its payout growth to inflate the yield on a buy made today. That's where casino landlord Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) comes in.

Before you say it, yes, I know a casino stock might sound like an odd pick to attract money-market-fund investors. But I'm pretty sure a growing 6% dividend won't take long to convince them! And hey, if folks really are migrating to junk bonds from money-market funds, why not a stock like GLPI?

Plus, the stock has lots of strengths that make it far from a gamble (sorry, couldn't resist).

For one, it's diversified across the country, with 65 casinos in 20 states. That's key, because if the job market continues to slow, concerned workers might cancel their Vegas trip, but they'll likely still hit up their local casino.

Second GLPI's tenants are signed under ""triple-net"" leases that provide a stable, predictable income stream.

Moreover, under these leases, the tenant pays the full cost of running and maintaining the company's properties. Which is great news -- can you imagine what this electricity bill looks like?

But the real standout for us income-seekers is that as a real estate investment trust (REIT), GLPI is exempt from corporate taxes so long as it pays out 90% of its profits as dividends. The savings help fund that high payout.

And as mentioned, GLPI has been quick to share its rising cash flow through payout growth -- including special dividends (the spikes and dips in the chart below):

The REIT's regular dividend was cut in the 2020 lockdowns, but that's understandable and the cut was modest: just 14%.

And GLPI quickly got back to its winning ways, boosting the payout since. And as with Mastercard, we've got a powerful Dividend Magnet working for us here, too.

More payout hikes are likely. GLPI's revenue rose 6.7% in the latest quarter, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, the key REIT profitability metric) rose 5.6%. The company also pays an estimated 81% of the midpoint of its forecast 2024 AFFO as dividends, a reasonable amount for a REIT."
Wars And Strikes Put Market On Edge,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/02/wars-and-strikes-put-market-on-edge/,2024-10-02T12:40:53Z,"Jerome Powell Hints At Smaller Rate Cuts Amid Rising Uncertainty

Stocks got off to an auspicious start for October as tensions in the Middle East ratcheted higher and a dockworkers' strike injected and extra dose of volatility. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%. Small cap stocks were also hit with the Russell 2000 dropping 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the best performing industry, but it too was down 0.4%.

Tuesday morning began with a mixture of economic news that showed prices moderating further but a higher than forecast number of job openings in the most recent JOLTs report. However, markets barely had time to digest that data before escalating hostilities in the Middle East took center stage when Iran launched a barrage of missiles aimed at Israel. While damage was limited, the increasing hostilities sent November crude oil futures higher by as much as 5% before settling down some and closing up nearly 4%. Israel has vowed retaliation against Iran and the question now becomes, just how bad the situation will become. In premarket, oil is trading higher by more than 3%.

At the same time, back here at homes, workers from the International Longshoremen Association (ILA) went on strike shutting down ports along the East and Gulf Coasts. According to The Wall Street Journal the ILA unloads around 60%, or $588 billion, of all containerized trade that comes through those coastal ports. Ports will often shut down for things such as hurricanes and therefore, a day or two of closures would have a nominal impact on the economy. However, as the strike lingers, estimates range widely for just what an extended work stoppage would mean.

For markets, I think the most concerning aspect of an extended strike and conflict in the Middle East is the potential for it to reintroduce inflation at a time where it seems like the Fed may have actually achieved a soft landing. In his remarks Monday, Jerome Powell talked about further rate cuts but suggested they may not be as aggressive as September's half-point cut. Currently, the CME Fed Watch Tool is assigning a 63% probability of a quarter-point cut in November and 37% chance of a half-point. This is something I'm keeping my eye on.

Some individual stocks I'm watching include Humana. That stock is down in premarket trading by 24% as membership in high-rating Medicare plans is expected to fall. Apple is lower by 0.5% after analyst downgrades. Meantime, Home Depot is higher following an increased price target of $455 from Piper Sandler. That is up from $387. The narrative here is that with interest rates lower, homeowners will look at making repairs prior to putting their homes on the market. If that does turn out to be the case, I'll be interested to see if other companies such as Lowe's also see upgrades. Finally, shares of Nike are down 7% in premarket following their earnings. Revenues fell 10% and profits were down 28% year-over-year. The company also was unwilling to offer a full year forecast after recently replacing their CEO.

For today, markets will likely be preoccupied with the situation in the Middle East, and the slightly stronger than expected ADP payroll number. The conflict between Israel and Iran is very much in danger of becoming more widespread as we await the next move. Between China's slowing economy and resultant stimulus measures, a strike that could reignite inflation, the upcoming U.S. election, wars on multiple fronts, earnings season just over a week away and wide-ranging speculation as to the state of our own economy, it should come as no surprise that volatility is increasing. The VIX is trading near 19.5 in premarket and with Friday's employment report looming, I would not be surprised to see it hold here or potentially even increase. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."

Like many, I have watched in horror as countless friends in my former home of North Carolina have been unable to reach their loved ones.

Hurricane Helene wiped out communities and infrastructure in the Southeast, claiming more than 160 lives as one of the 10 deadliest storms in U.S. history, according to USA Today. AccuWeather estimates the damage will range between $95 billion and $110 billion.

It will be a long recovery, and the region is in need of support. To make sure your assistance gets to those who need it, be sure to check the credentials of potential organizations and use caution when donating to individuals to avoid any potential scams.

A few charities accepting Helene-specific donations include: the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen and Airbnb.org, which helps people find a temporary place to stay.

Alice Walton, America's richest woman, just reported her largest known charitable gift to date, including $249 million to help fund a new medical school in her name in her family's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Forbes estimates that Walton, the only daughter of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton, has now given away $1.5 billion in her lifetime, making her one of the 30 biggest lifetime givers nationwide.

Iran fired rockets at Israel Tuesday, the Israeli military said, potentially escalating the war in the Middle East as Iran took responsibility for the attack and warned it is only a ""first wave."" In a statement read on state television, Iran said the attack was retaliation for the killings of multiple Hezbollah leaders, according to the Associated Press.

Aerospace and defense stocks reached all-time highs, a grim market reaction to the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Defense stocks typically see gains during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts.

Fred Thiel, the CEO of major bitcoin miner MARA, spoke with Forbes about how it is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, as well as U.S. politics and the outlook for the crypto mining industry. He says that retail investors give small competitors too much credit for AI plays that will not pay off for years.

Since porn entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky purchased OnlyFans in 2018, it has gone from being a little-known U.K.-based company to earning $485 million in profits on $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023. Its popularity unleashed a massive payday for Radvinsky, who debuted on this year's Forbes 400 list with an estimated net worth of $3.8 billion.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has long ranked as either the richest or second-richest person on the annual Forbes 400 list, but even with his $107 billion fortune, he dropped to No. 9 this year, down from No. 6 a year ago. A major reason for his fall in the rankings is his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates, his wife of 27 years.

Less than 2,500 people live in the small town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, but it's also home to several rare mines for ultra-pure quartz critical to semiconductor production. Operations have been shut down for more than five days due to impacts from Hurricane Helene, according to the News & Observer, but even when mines can reopen, extensive damage to surrounding roads and rail lines is expected to disrupt global supply chains.

In his latest feud with a government official, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken issue with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch date delays and fines related to alleged SpaceX violations, escalating to direct attacks on agency administrator Michael Whitaker. The dustup could preview how Musk might tackle government efficiency while working in a possible Trump Administration, an idea the former president has floated.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, faced off in a mostly polite yet policy-heavy vice presidential debate Tuesday night. But one of the more tense moments was a heated back-and-forth related to the false claims Vance spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, leading CBS News to cut Vance and Walz's mics.

MORE: Forbes recently looked at how the two candidates compare on assets like real estate, pensions, salaries and more. Vance's earnings from his bestseller Hillbilly Elegy helped him amass an estimated $10 million compared to former public school teacher Walz's wealth of about $1 million.

A massive dockworker strike that began Tuesday comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, but experts are split on whether it will have a major impact on the economy. The strike could cost the U.S. economy between $3 billion and $4.5 billion daily, according to estimates from Jefferies and JPMorgan, but significant fallout would only occur if the strike lasts more than the ""base case"" of a ""few days,"" Bank of America analysts led by Nathan Gee noted.

TOPLINE Palantir, which builds software to help other businesses gather, manage and analyze their data, at first with secretive government agencies like the CIA and now also with commercial customers, had a banner year.

Palantir took off, with annual revenue increasing more than 20% over the last year to $2.5 billion, and it flipped the switch on profitability -- going from a net loss of $50 million in June 2023 to net income of $400 million a year later. The record year was capped by its addition to the S&P 500 in September.

The company's growth is in part because many of its data software products meshed with the wave of AI hype.

No surprise then that shares are up 134% over the past year, making Palantir the most expensive stock in the S&P in terms of revenue multiples -- more so even than chip design darling Nvidia. Palantir's meteoric rise has earned CEO Alex Karp a spot on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time, worth an estimated $3.6 billion, thanks to his Palantir stake and $1 billion or so in cash from stock sales as of September 1, the day we finalized net worths for our list.

But should it be that expensive, trading at a market valuation that's 36 times its annual revenue? Analysts aren't sure: only five of the 20 that cover Palantir give the company a ""buy"" rating, with the remainder split between hold and sell ratings.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria drew a parallel between the company and Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, when the EV company was trading at all-time highs in 2021. ""Tesla for a very long period of time traded well above any valuation or comparable metric that you could point to. The reason was people were really excited about the mission and about the prospects.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400, the definitive ranking of America's richest people, is important because enormous wealth comes with immense power, and the public should know who is doing what with their power,"" says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu.

""As such, Karp's addition to The Forbes 400 and Palantir's too-high valuation show that what he and his company stand for -- Western values, American defense and artificial intelligence -- are especially relevant in today's economic, cultural and geopolitical landscape. It's worth watching what happens with the ever-controversial, ever-secretive (despite being publicly traded!) firm in the coming months and years.""

LGBTQ+ people who undergo ""conversion therapy"" are more likely to experience poor mental health than those who haven't, a new study found. While scientifically discredited, the practice is still prevalent in some states:

149: The number of participants studied who had experienced conversion therapy aimed at altering their sexual orientation

23: The number of states that ban conversion therapy for minors, including Washington D.C.

1,320: The number of conversion therapy practices across 48 states and Washington, D.C., according to 2023 research from the Trevor Project

A slew of new retirement rules and changes to tax law will affect almost everyone. For instance, starting in 2026, employees 50 and older who are deemed 'high-earning' will only be able to make catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. And if you have money left over in a 529 college savings plan, a law went into effect this year allowing penalty-free rollovers from 529 plans to a Roth IRA.

"Mortgage Rates Today: October 2, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-02-24/,2024-10-02T11:59:00Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Today, the mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.70%, according to Curinos, while the average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.74%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.73%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) inched up to 6.70% from 6.65% yesterday. One week ago, the 30-year fixed was 6.68%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.71%. This time last week, it was 6.67%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At today's interest rate of 6.70%, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000 will pay $645 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. In total interest, you'd pay $132,181 over the life of the loan.

Today's 15-year mortgage (fixed-rate) is 5.74%, up 0.03 percentage point from the previous week. The same time last week, the 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.71%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.77%. It was 5.72% a week earlier.

A 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage with today's interest rate of 5.74% will cost $830 per month in principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage (not including taxes and insurance). In this scenario, borrowers would pay approximately $49,368 in total interest.

On a 30-year jumbo, the average interest rate is 6.73%, lower than it was at this time last week. The average rate was 6.74% at this time last week.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.73% will pay $647 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,855 and you'd pay around $997,627 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy -- including its interest rate hikes, which it's using to restrain inflation -- is the primary factor that's pushing long-term mortgage rates higher. The state of the economy and housing market also affects mortgage rates. As for what interest rate the lender might offer you, this depends on your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and credit score, both of which indicate your risk as a borrower.

Related: Mortgage Rate Forecast & Trends For 2024

Shop around and talk to various lenders to get a sense of each company's mortgage loan offerings and services. Don't go with the first lender quote you receive; instead, compare the best mortgage rate quotes to get a deal. In particular, consider what fees they charge, what fees they're willing to waive and what closing assistance they might provide. Make sure any special offers or discounts don't come at the cost of a higher mortgage rate.

Be sure to apply with each lender within a 45-day window. During this window, you can have multiple lenders pull your credit history without additional impact on your credit score.

Mortgage rates remain elevated, and the nation's housing supply remains limited. The low inventory is preventing house prices from dropping. Meanwhile, the combination of high mortgage rates and appreciated home values will continue to present an obstacle for many prospective homebuyers seeking affordable housing.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term."
"Gen Z: They Highly Value ""Values,"" But It's No Dealbreaker",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliadhar/2024/10/02/gen-z-they-highly-value-values-but-its-no-dealbreaker/,2024-10-02T11:49:50Z,"Gen Z, the 69.3 million U.S. teenagers and young adults who are expected to make up nearly a third of the U.S. workforce by 2030, may be the most idealistic generation since the Baby Boomers.

You remember the boomers, don't you? They're the workplace veterans who've been retiring at a rate of about 10,000 a day for the past several years. Gen Zers, in many cases, are filling their slots -- though the youngest Gen Zers are still in middle school.

The boomers have left their mark, not only on the workplace, but on society as well. They played a major role in the civil rights battles of the 1960s, spearheaded efforts to end the Vietnam War, and helped create the environmental movement, which spawned Earth Day in 1970 and, more recently, raised awareness of climate change, ""forever chemicals,"" and other concerns.

They also clashed with authorities on campus and elsewhere, often in defense of free speech, and they mainstreamed protest songs as folk music. Shy they weren't.

Now, fast forward to today's Gen Zers -- the boomers' grandkids -- who are equally passionate about certain issues: climate, diversity, equality, peace, sustainability.

But be cautious: because Gen Z itself is hardly a monolith. And many Gen Zers, still in their early teens, lack the knowledge and maturity to make informed decisions.

So, when I discuss what's valued most by Gen Z, it's important to note that I'm focusing on the working-age cohort, those 18 and older.

Many of these Gen Zers have expectations that were unusual in their grandparents' day: They want their employers to embrace their values, even when their employers have large, diverse customer bases and workforces that are divided on the issues that energize Gen Z.

One of the indisputable facts of life is that it's much easier to be idealistic when there's little or no cost -- when jobs are plentiful, for example, and the number of people seeking jobs is far less so.

This was the case after the pandemic when many Gen Zers were first entering the labor market. At the end of January 2022, for example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 11.3 million U.S. job openings. The number of unemployed individuals looking for work at the time, BLS reported separately, was just 6.5 million. In that kind of labor market, job candidates can be choosy about where they work.

And many were. Nearly half (44%) of Gen Zers indicated in one recent survey that they'd turned down job opportunities because they didn't align with their personal ethics or beliefs; 46% said they had changed jobs, or planned to, due to ""environmental impact concerns.""

As one Gen Z colleague told us, ""I think of company ethics as a minimum standard to meet ... to even consider applying.""

And climate and the environment are hardly Gen Z's only concerns. As another Zer commented: ""When choosing where to work, I looked at leadership: Is the leadership diverse? Do I see women? POC [People of Color]? What are their pipelines, support systems, mentorship?""

So, values count.

They count to the organizations hiring Gen Zers as well. As Ashley Grice, CEO of BCG Brighthouse, told me, ""When corporate values are embedded in the culture of an organization like muscle memory"" the organization is better able to ""unite towards one vision, a single set of strategies, a consistent set of messages.

""Embedded values act as guardrails that help us row in the same direction ... [and] facilitate mindful, quicker, and consistent decision-making, even in highly decentralized organizations."" Just as important, she reminded me, they give Gen Zers -- ""a generation trained in the art of working from an independent space and unabashed about expressing its point of view"" -- clear guidelines to consider, even as they seek kudos and hurrahs from their YouTube followers, Facebook and TikTok friends, and LinkedIn connections. Because virtually everything that happens in a Gen Zer's life is often on display on social media.

Consequently, many Gen Zers feel a heightened responsibility to ensure their choices are ethically defensible.

Fortunately, Gen Zers are not alone in their concern about values. Many (perhaps most) CEOs share similar concerns, and often similar values.

An insightful interview last December on Simon Sinek's ""A Bit of Optimism"" podcast drives the point home. Sinek's guest was Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, a company whose employee roster -- some 2.1 million worldwide, 1.6 million in the U.S. -- is larger than the populations of many countries.

McMillon has been with the company full time since 1991, but worked in a Walmart warehouse before that -- when he was a teenager.

Without putting it in so many words, McMillon made the point that company values evolve over time. Walmart's great leap forward occurred in 2005, when then CEO Harold Lee Scott Jr. mobilized the retail giant to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. ""Okay,"" Scott asked his team afterwards (which included McMillon by then), ""what would it take for us to be that company every day?"" McMillon's Walmart provides an answer.

McMillon says he has an advantage over many other CEOs because the Walton family ""still owns about half"" the company. ""They have a long-term view. They care about things like values and purpose. When I meet with them, they ask me about things like becoming a regenerative company, working on sustainability. How are our associates doing? Are we paying enough? Talk to me about healthcare."" While other CEOs are worrying about the next quarterly earnings report, McMillon can worry about ""taking care of people and pushing harder.""

There are lessons here for Gen Zers:

· The future is closer than you realize. Look at what McMillon was doing when he was your age.

· Be patient. Change usually occurs gradually. If you want your employer to move in a certain direction, get involved and help make it happen.

· Prioritize. Gen Zers are trying to become financially independent following a difficult inflationary period. A recent Cigna survey identified ""money worries"" as ""a major cause of stress"" among Gen Z. So, while you may be idealistic and issue-oriented, you also need to pay the rent and put food on the table. Perhaps that's why surveys consistently show that Gen Zers rank compensation above other job concerns. That's called prioritizing."
Project 2025 Offers A False Choice: Climate Action Vs. Economic Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/margooge/2024/10/02/project-2025-offers-a-false-choice-climate-action-vs-economic-growth/,2024-10-02T10:14:04Z,"When Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for a future Trump administration, came up in the presidential debate, Donald Trump equivocated, calling some of the ideas ""good"" and others ""bad.""

It's impossible to say exactly what policies a second Trump administration would pursue, but Trump embraced The Heritage Foundation's ""A Mandate for Leadership"" proposal in his first year in office. And in April 2022 he said Heritage was ""going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.""

One of Project 2025's most alarming proposals targets public health as it would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to set and enforce environmental standards. Before EPA was created, our country suffered pollution so bad that rivers caught on fire and our cities were choked by smog. EPA protections have cleaned up our air and water for 50 years and saved countless lives - the Clean Air Act alone prevented an estimated 230,000premature deaths in 2020.

These environmental protections are particularly important for low-income and marginalized communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution and environmental degradation. Biden's EPA climate policies focus on public health and environmental justice by strengthening emissions standards and regulating air pollution, and are on track to save 200,000 lives by 2050.

Rolling back these protections, as Project 2025 proposes, would reverse these gains and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Americans, causing 2,100 early deaths by 2030 by increasing air pollution - nearly as much as the total U.S. military deaths in the Afghanistan war.

Project 2025 targets climate initiatives implemented under the Biden administration. The authors falsely claim that EPA regulations are ""burdensome"" and stifle economic growth, particularly in transportation and energy. But that's not true. EPA policies drive innovation and growth.

In reality, the very rules Project 2025 seeks to dismantle have catalyzed unprecedented economic growth across America. EPA's climate policies -- combined with incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act -- have sparked unprecedented investment, particularly in clean energy and transportation. As of 2024, annual investment in new manufacturing hit $225 billion, a record high even after adjusting for inflation.

The electric vehicle market is a prime example. EPA vehicle tailpipe emissions standards, along with IRA incentives, have spurred $312 billion in EV and battery manufacturing, making the United States a global leader in clean transportation investments. Fueled by the incentives, the U.S. EV market grew 40% in 2023, to 1.4 million units.

These investments have tangible economic impacts, making the shift to clean technologies an engine of job creation and economic revitalization. EV and battery manufacturing has created 195,000 high-paying jobs from factories in Michigan and Ohio to tech development in California, directly boosting local economies in areas hit hardest by the decline of traditional manufacturing.

The IRA's economic benefits are so obvious that in July, 18 Republican Members of Congress wrote the Speaker of the House urging him not to repeal IRA provisions, saying ""energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country.""

Biden administration policies have also supercharged job growth in the renewable energy sector, cutting fossil fuel dependence and reshaping the energy landscape to benefit our environment and economy. The solar industry added nearly 16,000 jobs in 2023 to hit 280,000 total jobs, the highest level in history, and wind turbine service technician is the fastest-growing occupation in America. Meanwhile utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of electricity generation in the U.S., at $27-$29 per megawatt-hour. Compare that to oil and coal products, which along with oil and gas extraction have the highest indirect impact on inflation of any commodity in the U.S. economy

By 2023, renewables accounted for 21% of U.S. electricity generation, outpacing coal, which dropped to 16%. The Biden administration's policies, which include federal tax credits for solar and wind projects, are ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the global clean energy transition.

Clean energy is the future: It's cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels, providing long-term economic benefits that far outweigh the short-term profits of oil, gas, and coal. Failing to recognize this will drive our economy into economic stagnation - Moody's Analytics forecasts Project 2025 would trigger a recession in less than a year. That's not even considering Project 2025's climate change impacts, which would add 4.9 million metric tons of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, about the same as Germany emits every year.

Today, the United States' global economic competitiveness is at stake, more than ever. Following Project 2025's prescription risks the future of EVs, renewable energy, and green jobs. That would cede America's progress on national climate goals and hand over the global energy economy to China and Europe.

Clean energy accounted for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023, and global clean energy investment hit $1.8 trillion last year. America can tap this potential -- unless we let Project 2025 derail our progress.

China is already the world's biggest EV producer with about 60% of global sales and is also the largest EV exporter, accounting for 19% of EU sales. In clean energy, China invested $890 billion in clean energy in 2023, almost as much as total global fossil fuel investment. Falling behind in the clean economic race means losing out on trillions of dollars in future market opportunities and millions of lost jobs in booming industries.

The core environmental argument of Project 2025 -- that we must choose between climate action and economic growth -- is a false choice. It simply doesn't hold up.

Between 1970 and 2019, the Clean Air Act reduced air pollution from vehicles, factories, and other sources by 77%. If Project 2025's authors were correct, those historic environmental gains should have cost grave economic contraction. Instead, during that same time, U.S. GDP grew 285% and job growth rose 223%. By comparison, implementing Project 2025's energy provisions would cost 1.7 million lost jobs by 2030 while imposing $32 billion in new energy costs on American households.

Biden's climate policies are not a burden -- they are the foundation of America's - and the world's - green future. These policies have driven innovation, created jobs, improved public health, and ensured America remains at the forefront of the global clean energy transition.

Project 2025's attempt to dismantle these critical protections and reverse decades of progress is wrong - we cannot afford to turn back the clock on climate action. The economic stakes are too high, the environmental risks too great, and the opportunities for growth and prosperity too vast to ignore. The future belongs to those who invest in clean energy, transportation and manufacturing, innovation, and sustainability.

Biden's climate policies have laid the foundation for that future, and we must embrace it, not scrap it."
Should You Pick CVS Stock At $65?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/02/should-you-pick-cvs-stock-at-65/,2024-10-02T10:05:16Z,"CVS Health stock (NYSE: CVS) currently trades at $65 per share, 37% below its pre-inflation shock high of $102 seen in February 2022. In contrast, its peer - Walgreens stock - is down 78% over this period, amid falling profitability. The decline in CVS stock can also be attributed to its declining profitability, amid higher medical service costs for its Medicare business (Aetna). CVS, in August, cut its 2024 earnings outlook for a third consecutive quarter. For CVS, its medical benefit ratio, which refers to health care costs as a percentage of premium revenues, surged to 90% for the six months period ending June 2024, versus 85.4% in the prior-year period. Owing to the underperformance of its Medicare business, CVS announced the exit of Brian Kane, head of Aetna, and $2 billion in cost cuts. The company is considering strategic review options, including a spin-off of Aetna. [1] CVS acquired Aetna for $70 billion in 2017.

CVS stock was trading at $86 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and is now 24% below that level, compared to 50% gains for the S&P 500 during this period. The performance of CVS stock with respect to the index over the recent years has been quite volatile. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the uncertain geopolitical environment, could CVS face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a strong jump? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $102 means that CVS stock will have to gain 58% from here, and we don't think this will materialize anytime soon. We estimate CVS Health's Valuation to be $66 per share, close to its current market price. Our forecast is based on a 10x P/E multiple for CVS and expected earnings of $6.61 on a per-share and adjusted basis for the full year 2024. The 10x P/E ratio is slightly lower than the stock's 11x average P/E ratio over the last three years. A slight decline in the valuation multiple makes sense in our view, given the fall in profitability.

Our detailed analysis of CVS Health's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

2020 - early 2021: Increase in money supply to cushion the impact of lockdowns led to high demand for goods; producers unable to match up. Early 2021: Shipping snarls and worker shortages from the coronavirus pandemic continue to hurt supply. April 2021: Inflation rates cross 4% and increase rapidly. Early 2022: Energy and food prices spike due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fed begins its rate hike process. June 2022: Inflation levels peak at 9% - the highest level in 40 years. The S&P 500 index declined more than 20% from peak levels. July - September 2022: Fed hikes interest rates aggressively - resulting in an initial recovery in the S&P 500 followed by another sharp decline. October 2022 - July 2023: Fed continues rate hike process; improving market sentiments helps S&P 500 recoup some of its losses. August 2023 - August 2024: Fed has kept interest rates unchanged to quell fears of a recession and keep inflation in check September 2023: Fed cut rates by 50 bps and pointed to more rate cuts going forward

In contrast, here's how CVS stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis

10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index 9/1/2008 - 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08) 3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index 12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008)

CVS and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis

CVS stock saw a 30% decline between October 2007 (pre-crisis peak) and March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It surged post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $23 in early 2010, rising about 28% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

CVS Fundamentals And Financial Position

CVS Health's revenue rose from $292 billion in 2021 to $363 billion in the last twelve months, led by increased prescription volume, pharmacy claims, and drug price inflation. However, the company's operating margin fell from 5.2% in 2021 to 3.4% now, amid a rise in medical costs. Its TTM earnings per share of $5.62 compares with $5.95 in 2021.

Looking at the company's financial position, CVS' total debt rose from $76 billion in 2021 to $84 billion now, while its cash increased from $13 billion to $16 billion over this period. The company also garnered $8 billion in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. CVS' market capitalization stands around $79 billion and a debt levels of $84 billion implies a very high debt-to-equity ratio of around 106%. This indicates that the firm's financial position is not robust.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiment, we believe CVS stock is fairly priced at levels of around $65. If the company decides to split into two separate entities, it may unlock more shareholder value, and drive the stock price higher. Still, its large debt and high medical benefit ratio remains key risks in realizing any significant gains.

While CVS stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how CVS Health's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

2025 Drug Plan Premiums: Under Control But In Flux,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianeomdahl/2024/10/01/2025-drug-plan-premiums-under-control-but-in-flux/,2024-10-01T23:35:32Z,"One of the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act is to lower drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The biggest step toward that goal will be the implementation of the $2,000 cap on Part D out-of-pocket costs starting in January 2025. Nearly 19 million Part D enrollees could save $400 and almost two million with the highest costs could save, on average, $2,500 per year.

Last year, Medicare took a baby step toward that goal by eliminating the 5% coinsurance in the Catastrophic Coverage payment stage. This should save approximately 1.5 million enrollees about $3,100 each this year.

Both these initiatives are saving seniors money. However, the out-of-pocket costs they used to pay do not go away; they just fall to a different payer. Drug plans will now have to pay a much bigger portion of those costs and, in response, plans are making some changes. For example, a comparison of 2023 and 2024 plans found that over one-third increased the enrollee's cost sharing, and monthly premiums in three ZIP codes increased 2%-84%.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service had projected that the average total monthly premium in 2024 would decrease 1.8% and premium stabilization measures would limit the growth of the base beneficiary premium to 6%. So, how was it possible for premiums to increase significantly? Simple answer: The monthly premium that enrollees pay is not addressed in the premium stabilization program. CMS has four different premiums, each with its own purpose, and these all mush together to create the monthly premium.

IRA initiatives, including the $2,000 cap, will save 18.7 million enrollees, on average, $400. Because this is a much more significant impact than elimination of the 5% coinsurance, CMS is rightfully concerned about the variation in premiums between stand-alone Part D plans and MA-PD plans (Medicare Advantage plans that include drug coverage). CMS noted that, ""The resulting premium changes could create disruptive enrollment shifts in the prescription drug plan market during the initial implementation of the IRA benefit improvements."" In other words, the significant increases in premiums for stand-alone Part D plans could lead enrollees to switch to MA-PD plans. (The average monthly plan premium is $18.50, while many plans have no premium.)

In response, CMS is conducting a voluntary premium stabilization demonstration that consists of three elements.

Note these important points about this demonstration.

On October 1, the Medicare Plan Finder revealed the 2025 Part D drug plans. On first glance, it appears the premium increases are somewhat under control but the marketplace is really being tossed around. Here are some findings from my quick scan of 10 ZIP codes around the country.

Although the full impact of the Part D benefit design changes is unknown, drug plan enrollees are in for a crazy ride. I plan to do a deeper dive on the premiums and costs but let this serve as a wake-up call. If you don't check out your plan, you will likely be in for some unpleasant surprises in 2025. For example, those who are have plans that are disappearing will be enrolled automatically in another plan, unless they make a change before December 7. Others face a significant change in premiums.

I was asked recently what everyone should do differently during this most important Open Enrollment Period. My response, ""Study the Annual Notice."" Historically, only three of 10 have paid attention. Let's all try to do a better job."
Defense Stocks Hit All-Time Highs Amid Middle East Escalation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/defense-stocks-hit-all-time-highs-amid-middle-east-escalation/,2024-10-01T19:35:38Z,"In a predictably grim phenomenon tied to outbreaks of global violence, aerospace and defense stocks climbed to record prices in an otherwise down day for the stock market, as Wall Street reacted to the latest escalation in the Middle East by anticipating larger contracts for military suppliers.

5%. That's how much prices for international oil benchmark Brent crude oil rose Tuesday by about 1:15 p.m. EDT, which would have been by far the largest single-day gain of 2024, according to FactSet data. The oil surge moderated quickly, with Brent up less than 1% by 3:15 p.m. EDT.

Defense stocks typically gain during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts, which often grow when allies like Israel and Ukraine are at war. Tuesday's market backdrop evoked unpleasant memories of the setup in late 2021 and 2022, when supply chain issues and military conflict (Russia's invasion of Ukraine) caused global inflation to surge and stocks to fall as central banks rolled out growth-stifling interest rate hikes to slow price increases. But economists largely believe the U.S. port strike won't have the same impact on inflation as the 2021-22 supply chain snags.

Wall Street's fear gauge rose to its highest level in three weeks Tuesday, as the CBOE volatility index (VIX) climbed 10% as traders dealt with new concerns in addition to fears about a potential U.S. economic slowdown. But ""although the VIX is edging higher it remains sufficiently just below 20 to suggest that markets...do not yet envision an all-out military scenario"" in the Middle East, noted LPL Financial's chief global strategist Quincy Krosby in a Tuesday note to clients."
How The Accountant Shortage Impacts CFOs And Financial Hires,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/01/how-the-accountant-shortage-impacts-cfos-and-financial-hires/,2024-10-01T16:48:57Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

Driving technology, embracing of the strategic importance of a company's financial functions and an emphasizing corporate sustainability are all transforming the CFO's job. But they're also reshaping other jobs in a company's financial operations. A new report from EY zooming in on the financial controller's position found that 86% of people in that role expect significant changes in their career in the next five years. The majority of controllers told EY they expect their role to shift from one focused on value protection -- paying attention to internal controls and regulatory compliance -- to one that looks for value creation -- using technology, strategy and data to find new opportunities and recommend new policies.

""The controller of the future will be a trusted partner to the CFO right across the transformation spectrum,"" Mike Verbeck, EY Global deputy vice chair for Assurance, said in the report. ""They will create value in their capacity as analysts, collaborators, innovators, storytellers and leaders of talented teams, as well as in their capacity as accounting and compliance experts.""

The report makes clear that this is seen as a natural evolution of the controller's role, fitting with how most companies utilize their financial teams in the foreseeable future. But it's also clear that the report found technology -- including AI -- gives the controller the ability to pivot toward more of a focus on strategy and opportunity. The report found that nearly nine in 10 controllers already use AI, which is powerful on two fronts. It can do many of the basic tasks controllers spend their time on now, and also leverage data to find powerful insights.

EY suggests that controllers take advantage of the opportunity to look for value-creation opportunities by embracing data and AI and inspiring team members to see themselves as problem solvers. CFOs should empower their controllers, and also provide training in future-focused skills that build on technology use and responsibilities to climb the ranks at a company. And the CFO should also focus on an innovative and transformational spirit in potential new hires to work under the controller.

Regardless of how financial roles are created and recruited, the entire financial sector is struggling to find talent. Many college students today aren't pursuing accounting degrees, and even fewer are becoming CPAs. That makes recruiting for any financial position harder, from junior-level to CFOs. I spoke with Keith Giarman, president of the private equity and principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about how this shortage is impacting things right now. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Unionized port workers on the East Coast began their first strike in more than 45 years at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, stopping trade traffic at ports in Baltimore; Boston; Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami; Houston; Mobile, Alabama; New Orleans; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware. About 45,000 union members represented by the International Longshoremen's Association want a wage increase of 77% and a ban on new automation as part of their new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), the organization that represents shipping companies. West Coast port workers earn over $30,000 a year more than their East Coast counterparts. Union members are refusing to meet with the USMX until their wage demands are met.

The strike could have fast and far-reaching impacts on the U.S. economy, with some analysts projecting it costing $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion a day. If the strike continues for long enough, it could impact consumer prices and the availability of goods. President Biden has urged the two sides to resolve the issue quickly and fairly, sending Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to meet with USMX on Monday. While Biden can defer the strike for 80 days through the Taft-Hartley Act, he said over the weekend he will not ""because it's collective bargaining.""

While West Coast ports remain open, Boeing machinists remain on strike. The 33,000 unionized employees at the aerospace manufacturer's Pacific Northwest facilities rejected Boeing's ""best and final offer"" last week. From the union's social media posts, the sticking point appears to be the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan, which the company did away with in favor of a 401(k) plan in 2014, according to Quartz. It's unclear from media reports what's happening currently with negotiations, but according to KING5, Boeing released a statement Monday saying it is ""committed to resetting our relationship with our represented employees and negotiating in good faith and want to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We are prepared to meet at any time.""

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened last month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Tuesday morning, 38.4% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

The stock market on the whole is responding well, however. The first nine months of 2024 were the S&P 500's best start to a year since 1997, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. The S&P's year-to-date gain is 20.3%, and the other markets have also fared well this year: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12% in the first three quarters of 2024, and the Nasdaq is up 20%. Buoying the markets so far are last month's interest rate cuts -- insurers, home builders and utilities saw some of the best returns in recent months -- and optimism-fueled AI stocks.

Last week, the Chinese government announced several broad measures to boost its economy, which has been sputtering and looks unlikely to meet its government's annual growth target. The multi-pronged effort includes an interest rate cut from China's central bank, a potential capital injection into its biggest banks to increase lending capacity and governmental economic stimulus, reports Forbes' Derek Saul. Chinese stocks traded on U.S. markets rallied on the news and have continued to trade higher.

However, the rally -- and any benefit to China-based businesses -- may be short-lived for those in the U.S. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan Chase strategists said that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, it's likely to slow down. Trump has campaigned on strict trade policies toward China, including a tariff of 60% or more on all Chinese goods, phasing out imports of essential goods and revoking China's most favored nation trade status. Vice President Kamala Harris has said in her campaign that she wants to enact policies that ensure the U.S. keeps its economic foothold above China, but she has not presented anything specific that is as restrictive. Analysts believe Harris will continue the Biden administration's approach of more targeted Chinese economic policies, including limiting imports and exports from high-tech industries.

As the nature of work has changed and new fields related to finance have cropped up, there's been a shortage of accountants on all levels -- especially with fewer young people opting for accounting degrees, and even fewer choosing to work at traditional firms and pursue the CPA path. This has immediate and potential long-term implications for finance departments and CFOs. I talked to Keith Giarman, president of private equity and the principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about what it means. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

It's hard to find the right talent today. What are companies doing to keep the talent they have?

Giarman: A lot of the compensation has gone north. It is a different level skill set that [companies] are asking for. There are a few [qualified employees], and they know that. They know that their price tag and their market value have gone up. Especially in private equity, where they've got a hopefully three-year timeline to improve operations and sell a company, they have to have the absolute best and invest in that role. They're working with the CFO more than the CEO.

For everybody else [in finance], if you accept my logic, there's fewer of them. Whether it's somebody running FP&A or somebody lower down in the organization, you've got to pay up.

That doesn't fix it, though, because people come for more than money. [Companies] have to create great working environments and be more flexible, including remote [work]. As a company, we have the same challenges. We've tried to create an environment for our research and associate staff where we emphasize things like wellness and the things that the younger generation wants to focus on and feel good about in terms of the community they're building around them. If you're not doing those other soft HR things, all the money in the world isn't going to make a difference. They'll stay for a couple of years, and they'll go.

Much of the attention of the accountant shortage is focused on lower-level employees. Are you seeing related challenges with recruiting CFOs?

The answer is a very loud yes, with an exclamation point. The CFOs who will make the cut, where the client will not bend on the requirements, seems like [there are] fewer and fewer as we move along.

It's also dependent on the cycle of the market. CFOs have been in assets in private equities for a while. We're finally starting to see the Fed lower interest rates. There could be some exit liquidity opportunity in a year or two. If more transactions are getting done, there's more folks who have proven themselves: They're able to flourish in these environments and get the job done. We haven't been in that for the last 12 to 24 months.

When we do a CFO search today, something that might've taken 90 days can take 180. There's a timing issue with candidates. There's a compensation issue. There's a flexibility issue in terms of where they are in the investment cycle, too, because if you're going to sell the company in two years, are you going to expect somebody to move their entire family on a plane three hours away?

The good news is at that level, you're thinking about wealth creation and longer-term things that take care of your family and your career. You're even more disposed to the financial element of the opportunity, and you're willing to put in the hard work to get it. If [companies] can make the numbers work and people can see a path to the end zone, there's a better chance you're going to land those bigger fish, and they're going to stick.

What does the future look like for this shortage?

The thing that's going to make it better is selling a bunch of companies, where good people free up. There's $8 trillion of private equity money floating around out there, and a lot of that's in companies that have CFOs that are waiting to exit. [After interest rates drop enough to restart more dealmaking, probably in 2025], that's when you're going to see more IPOs. You're going to see more deals, you're going to see more M&A. The people that are really good, there's going to be more freed up that you can get access to. They're going to be looking for their next great CFO opportunity.

What Is The Consumer Price Index  And How It Impacts Investing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/what-is-cpi-consumer-price-index/,2024-10-01T16:40:33Z,"The Consumer Price Index ""is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services,"" according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which issues the monthly report. In this article, you will learn about how the CPI is put together, the different types of CPIs and the part it plays in investing trends and monetary policy.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average fluctuation over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of what consumers typically buy and use, such as food and beverages, housing, clothing, transportation, medical care and entertainment, and the sales and excise taxes consumers pay. The CPI does not include income or Social Security taxes. Nor does the CPI report investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate and life insurance because those items are not day-to-day consumption expenses.

Because of the ways the CPI data on those items is applied, it affects nearly all Americans.

The CPI has three major uses, according to BLS. They are as an:

The BLS describes the CPI as a ""measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of consumer goods and services."" It also publishes other economic indexes, broken down by region, population and goods, but the one most widely quoted and consequential is the CPI-U, usually called simply the CPI, which covers the purchases of urban consumers and reports each month. A second large survey is the CPI-W, which is a monthly accounting of the average change in the prices that urban wages earners and clerical workers pay for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

To measure data, the BLS continuously collects information to come up with the CPI and other indexes. Its data collectors go in person or work through the Web and with apps to contact thousands of retail stores, service establishments, rental units and doctors' offices, all over the country to compile information about prices on thousands of items used to track and measure price changes in the CPI; it also records prices of some 80,000 items each month representing a ""scientifically selected sample of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services purchased.""

The list of items and services in the CPI basket include the following.

The indexes from BLS have many breakdowns. To better evaluate costs, the BLS presents the CPIs in two ways. They are:

It ""represents all goods and services in the report; in other words, 'the whole shebang,' "" wrote Britannica Money. ""It represents the average inflation rate across the entire economy.""

It ""strips out food and energy prices. Why? Food and energy prices tend to be more volatile than other products in the CPI mix,"" noted Britannica Money. Weather, international prices and geopolitics impact those two product categories. Even some economists at the Federal Reserve choose to leave them out of the equation to come up with a more constituent view on price inflation.

BLS publishes a family of price indexes covering regions and specific industries, which include the four Census regions, nine Census divisions, two sizes of city classes, eight cross-classifications of regions and size-classes and for 23 local areas as well as those for the major groups of consumer expenditures, such as food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communications, and other goods and services for items within each group, and for special categories, such as services. By studying sectors, too, the BLS is able to make educated guesses about the economic state of industries.

It also collects prices for goods and services in 75 urban areas and from about 23,000 retail and service establishments and data on rents from some 50,000 landlords or tenants

The CPI has wide-ranging implications for hundreds of millions Americans and the government, including Congress, the White House and the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve, as well as for Wall Street and investors.

The CPI is used to help adjust income eligibility for levels of government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increase, poverty measures and consumer and commercial rent escalations. ""CPI indexes are used to adjust income eligibility levels for government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increases, poverty measures, and consumer and commercial rent escalations,"" according to the BLS.

According to Cooke Wealth Management LLC, because the CPI gauges inflationary trends, ""it can lead investors to anticipate higher consumer goods and services prices in the future. This expectation can lead to adjustments in investment portfolios, potentially reducing stock market prices due to anticipated reduced purchasing power and demand.""

Dan Raju, CEO of the brokerage platform Tradier, told me that the recent Fed rate cut coupled with CPI movements have led to market volatility and posed a surprise for his traders, who didn't expect an interest rate cut until the inflation rate hit 2%, as suggested by the Fed. ""Lower interest rates typically encourage borrowing and spending, which can lead to increased market activity, but also heightened risk. For our clients, this means a potential for higher returns, but with amplified volatility,"" he added.

The ups and downs of inflation impact the various asset classes differently.

""When the CPI rises and inflation concerns increase, capital often shifts from bonds to stocks or other inflation-resistant assets, such as energy infrastructure, commodities and real estate,"" Jon DuPau, managing director at SuperDex, told me.

""Bonds have an inverse relationship with interest rates, and companies who utilize lending or discretionary spending may experience some uncertainties. Investors reassess the growth potential of companies under inflationary pressure. With CPI considerations, investors may seek safer, more conservative assets as a hedge,"" John Jones, investor advisor representative, at Heritage Financial, told me. Bonds can provide that hedge.

During the early years of the Biden-Harris administration, both the CPI and PPI (Producer Price Index) statistics reported monthly by the U.S. Government were running at nearly 30-year highs,"" Adam Ferrari, CEO of Phoenix Capital Group, noted.

He added that, ""This erosion of value has resulted in elevated home prices, stock market valuations and hard assets like gold and other industrial metals also reaching higher levels. Overall, elevated CPI levels in the U.S. economy has caused investors to seek reprieve in hard assets like real estate, gold or even oil and gas properties.""

""Retreating prices for some commodities are contributing to lower inflation today,"" according to U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Rob Haworth, the bank's senior investment strategy director noted that although food and energy prices rebounded in early 2024 and were ""raising inflation risks,"" prices later in the year leveled off a downturn in the inflation rate.

""The Consumer Price Index in the United States averaged 124.59 points from 1950 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 314.80 points in August of 2024 and a record low of 23.50 points in February of 1950."" according to the tradingeconomics.com from data reported by the BLS.

""Investors must carefully analyze CPI reports, considering that government-released numbers are often revised later, potentially creating credibility issues,"" Chris Hite, regulatory compliance manager at Nurp LLC, the software company that develops algorithmic software for Forex trading, told me.""A nuanced approach is key. Looking beyond headlines to understand core trends is vital. Some assets, like commodities, real estate and inflation-protected securities, can hedge against inflation. However, high inflation and sticky interest rate hikes can negatively impact stocks and bonds.""

The CPI is meant to paint the economic picture in broad strokes, so by its very nature, it doesn't address individual variations. In a post, the economic site Quickonomics addressed what it views as the CPI's four limitations.

They are:

The Federal Reserve Board has long looked for trends in the CPI to help to formulate fiscal and monetary policy and gauge inflation. However, in January 2012, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted PCE [personal consumption expenditures price index] as its primary measure of inflation over CPI.""

James Bullard, former president of the St. Louis Fed, wrote in 2013 that the PCE, issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is a better way to gauge the prices that consumers face and determine inflation rates than the CPI.

Market reactions mean that investors can get spooked by the unexpected, or even the expected, which can be a number of events, including the CPI report. Most recently, in August 2024 when the latest report came out, stocks were ""briefly plunging as much as 743.89 points, before ending with its biggest intraday comeback in almost two years,"" according to MarketWatch. Other times, the CPI has virtually no impact on the market.

When you hear the results of the monthly CPI, you're getting a short-hand version of what's happening in the economy and what the average person is dealing with financially. Of course, the CPI doesn't present a nuanced picture, but it can suggest to you and the U.S. government when prices are static, falling or rising and where to make adjustments."
Could Dock Worker Strike Spike Inflation? Experts Are Split.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/could-dock-worker-strike-spike-inflation-experts-are-split/,2024-10-01T15:08:19Z,"The massive dock worker strike beginning Tuesday comes at an inopportune time for the U.S. economy, as the potential uptick in shipping prices comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, though experts are split on whether the strike will have a major impact on inflation and the economy more broadly.

""The port strike could disrupt the data, essentially creating a smoke screen for the Fed when trying to stick the soft landing,"" wrote Essaye. The strike crucially comes two weeks after the U.S. central bank initiated the first interest rate cuts since March 2020, essentially declaring victory over inflation. The Fed has signaled it intends to continue cutting, meaning its toolkit is far more limited to stifle another inflation outbreak.

How an extended strike impacts retailers as the holiday quarter kicks off. UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan wrote Monday retailers had already adjusted import activity in ""anticipation of supply chain disruption"" from the strike.

The East Coast accounts for 40% of U.S. shipping container volumes and about 5% of global volumes, according to Bank of America. The port-related inflation concerns evoke bad memories of the late 2021 supply chain snarls which came as ports globally dealt with significant backlogs due in part to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers. That contributed to the global inflation crisis, and inflation peaked in 2022 at a 41-year high of more than 9% in the U.S."
Does Baxter Stock Offer Any Room For Growth?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/01/does-baxter-stock-offer-any-room-for-growth/,2024-10-01T12:11:29Z,"Baxter stock (NYSE: BAX), a healthcare company, currently trades at $38 per share, more than 50% lower than the level seen in February 2022. BAX stock has fared worse than its peer - Becton, Dickinson & Company stock, down 7% over this period. BAX stock has been weighed down lately amid falling profit margins and a sale of its Vantive Kidney Care business this year at a price lower than the street estimates. BAX stock was trading at around $60 in early June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and is now 36% below that level, compared to over 50% gains for the S&P 500 during this period.

Notably, BAX stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last three years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the uncertain geopolitical environment, could BAX face a similar situation as it did in recent years and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $83 implies that BAX stock will have to gain around 115% from here, and we don't think that will materialize anytime soon. In fact, we think BAX stock is appropriately priced. It currently trades at 1.4x trailing revenues, aligning with its average P/S ratio of 1.4x over the last six quarters. Notably, the $41 average of analysts price estimate for Baxter also reflects just 5% upside from here.

Our detailed analysis of Baxter's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how BAX stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

BAX stock declined from nearly $28 in August 2008 (pre-crisis peak for Baxter) to $20 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying it lost 26% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $24 in early 2010, rising about 15% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

Baxter Fundamentals Over Recent Years

Baxter's revenue rose from $12.1 billion in 2021 to $14.8 billion in 2023, driven by increased demand for advanced surgery products. In December 2021, Baxter completed the Hillrom acquisition, which added connected care offerings, including Smart Beds and patient monitoring products, to Baxter's existing portfolio of acute, nutritional, renal, hospital, and surgical care products. However, the company's operating margin declined from 11% to 3% between 2021 and 2023. Baxter sold its Vantive Kidney Care business to Carlyle, a private equity investor, for $3.8 billion, lower than the street expectations.

Does Baxter Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

Baxter's total debt decreased from $18.3 billion in 2021 to $13.3 billion now, while its cash decreased from around $3.7 billion to $2.1 billion over the same period. The company also garnered $1.2 billion in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. The company will also receive $3 billion in proceeds from the sale of its Vantive Kidney Care business. The high debt burden is a near-term risk that the company faces. The company's market capitalization has shrunk to $19 billion now, and a debt level of $13 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of 68%.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe Baxter stock is fairly priced, with limited upside potential. The stock could rebound if the profitability improves. Still, a high deb burden remains a key risk factor.

How This Luxury Sake Brand Is Applying French Winemaking Techniques,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelking/2024/10/01/how-this-luxury-sake-brand-is-applying-french-winemaking-techniques/,2024-10-01T11:12:04Z,"While traditional sake blending is used for practical purposes and cost efficiency, the practice of ""assemblage"" focuses on enhancing the qualities of each component.

Heavensake, a luxury sake brand founded in 2017 on the concept of cultural exchange between Japan and France, has been making waves in the sake industry since introducing the concept of assemblage, a winemaking technique that enhances the flavors of individual components in a blend, to the Japanese rice wine.

Led by Régis Camus, an eight-time International Wine Challenge (IWC) Sparkling Winemaker of the Year, Heavensake worked with sake master Naohiko Noguchi while crafting a trio of rare sakes.

""The power of assemblage to enhance and elevate flavors is something that can accelerate their progress by years,"" Camus said via email. ""We're proud to say that we were the first to introduce assemblage to high-end sake, and it's rewarding to see the industry embrace its beauty.""

The collaboration between Camus and some of Japan's top breweries -- including Katsuyama Brewery, Niizawa Brewery and Noguchi -- has been integral to Heavensake's progress. Camus and Noguchi previously worked together to create the Noguchi Prestige sake, a bottle that showcases the potential of assemblage in high-end sake.

""When I met him, it was instantly a mutual respect between two masters,"" Camus said.

Noguchi Prestige, crafted by Camus and Noguchi , will be available in March 2025 for $1,000. The Label Azur Junmai Ginjo by Katsuyama is available now for World Sake Day on October 1, for a suggested retail price of $39. The Label Noir Junmai Daiginjo by Niizawa will be available in November for $92.

The introduction of assemblage to sake-making has been a carefully executed process. Camus described his initial collaboration with Dassai, especially, as a pivotal moment for Heavensake.

""They understood the concept and how it worked in champagne making, but they were unsure how it would translate to the world of sake,"" Camus said, adding that success of this experiment paved the way for further collaborations, leading to the creation of these new, premium sake blends.

Assemblage, as applied in winemaking, focuses on combining different wines to create a final product that is greater than the sum of its parts. Camus uses this approach with sake to bring out unique and vibrant flavors. Unlike traditional sake blending, which is often used for cost efficiency, Camus said assemblage enhances the qualities of each component.

""In sake-making, the challenge was determining how much of an impact assemblage could have,"" he said. ""We start with existing sakes -- typically five to ten different types -- and begin the process of trial and error, much like alchemists.""

Introducing assemblage to an industry steeped in tradition has not been without its challenges. Initially, many sake experts were skeptical about whether the technique could add value to premium sake. Even John Gauntner, a renowned sake expert and co-founder and content editor of the sake-only magazine Sake Today, was doubtful.

""John saw it through the lens of traditional blending, but when he tasted the final product, he was completely astonished,"" Camus recalled, stating that it was this moment that helped turn skeptics into believers.

Heavensake's blends have been designed to elevate the perception of sake on the global stage. The brand has also focused on the visual presentation of its products, partnering with the Arita Porcelain Lab to create artistic ceramic bottles for their limited-edition sakes.

""For us, it's absolutely essential to create harmony between the visual and artistic aspects of the product and the liquid itself,"" Camus said, explaining this attention to detail helps distinguish Heavensake in a market where most sake bottles share similar designs.

Heavensake's expansion into the U.S. market is a critical part of the brand's strategy. Through events, tastings and consumer education, Camus hopes to showcase the versatility and complexity of sake to a broader audience. This educational approach is expected to play a key role in changing the way consumers experience sake.

One key point he emphasizes is the importance of using a wine glass when drinking sake.

""As we embark on this U.S. tour, one of the most important aspects for us to communicate is the use of a wine glass when drinking sake,"" he said about visiting the United States in October.

""By using a wine glass, you can truly appreciate the complexity of the assemblage and all the subtle notes of high-end sake,"" Camus said. The traditional ochoko cups, often used to serve sake, he explained, limit the experience by not allowing drinkers to fully engage with the aroma and flavor.

While sake has generated more interest among U.S. consumers in the last several years, sales recently have suffered. In 2023, Japanese sake exports experienced a notable downturn after 13 consecutive years of growth, driven by global economic factors, including recession and inflation, which affected the two key sake export markets: China and the United States. The total value of sake exports in 2023 was 41.08 billion yen (approximately $275 million, down 13% year-over-year), with a volume of around 29,000 liters (down 19% year-over-year).

Regardless, as the brand looks to the future, Camus is optimistic about the potential for sake to reach a larger international audience.

Camus pointed to the global rise of other spirits, such as tequila, as an example of how targeted marketing and product storytelling can elevate a category.

""The total export value of sake from Japan to the rest of the world is only around $300 million,"" Camus noted. ""Given the beauty and potential of this magnificent drink, that number should be three to five times higher."""
Mortgage Rates 1 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-01-10-24/,2024-10-01T10:02:55Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.58%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.56% and 4.23% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.73%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.99% and 3.71% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.39%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.24%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-the-25-wealthiest-people-in-america/,2024-10-01T10:02:49Z,"was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer's rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list:

One of Sam Walton's eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family's third generation still sit on Walmart's board: Jim's son Steuart Walton (Lukas' first cousin) and Rob's son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman.

""On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,"" Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, ""we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win."" His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023.

Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump's reelection bid.

Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France.

In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he's backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024.

In August, their Mars Inc. announced it's gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg's) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M's and Kind bars. It's the company's biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations.

Yass' fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group -- and Yass' share of profits -- based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna's estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass).

In June, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father's 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA's New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Rob Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings' estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Price"" strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman in early September from L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022.

Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family's charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell's net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively.

Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer -- a phenomenon termed ""Jensanity."" Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since.

The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges.

The Microsoft cofounder's rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he's set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy.

""Damn, I'm fired up!"" exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers' new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion.

Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51

A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin's Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet's sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google's continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months.

More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America's first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett -- the nation's greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving -- donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed.

It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm's shares up 12% to record highs. He's spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion-plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David's media production company.

No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He's $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness.

Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami's ""billionaire bunker"" island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year.

Tesla's self-proclaimed ""technoking"" tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk's new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected."
The Richest Woman In America 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/10/01/the-richest-woman-in-america-2024/,2024-10-01T10:02:35Z,"or the ninth time in a decade, Alice Walton-the only daughter of late Walmart founder Sam Walton-is the richest woman on this year's Forbes 400 ranking of the wealthiest people in America.

With shoppers flocking to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Prices"" to escape high inflation, the retailer's stock is up 41% since the 2023 Forbes 400, pushing the 74-year-old Walton's net worth to an estimated $89.2 billion, up from $66.5 billion. She is $15 billion richer than the second-richest woman in the U.S., Julia Koch -- who inherited 42% of privately held conglomerate Koch, Inc. (formerly known as Koch Industries) from her husband David Koch (d. 2019), and who briefly took Walton's title as America's wealthiest woman in 2022.

Walton, who ranks No. 15 on The Forbes 400 overall, is now within spitting distance of becoming the second-ever female centibillionaire. L'Oréal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who is a citizen of France, joined the $100 billion club in June but fell to around $88 billion on September 4, when Walton briefly surpassed her to become the world's richest woman for the first time since May 2022. (Bettencourt Meyers reclaimed the title on September 26, with an estimated $92.6 billion fortune.)

Despite selling more than $28 billion of Walmart stock over the past decade -- and giving away more than $11 billion of the retailer's shares -- Sam Walton's heirs still own nearly 45% of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth, due to significant stock buybacks that have prevented the family's stake from being diluted. Forbes estimates that three-quarters of the clan's stock is split almost evenly between Alice Walton and her siblings Jim (No. 13 on this year's list, worth an estimated $95.9 billion) and Rob Walton (No. 14, $94.3 billion). Most of the rest of the Walton family fortune belongs to the heirs of their brother John Walton (d. 2005): his widow Christy Walton (No. 48, $16.4 billion) and their son Lukas Walton (No. 25, $33.9 billion).

The youngest of Sam Walton's four children, Alice Walton was 12 years old when her father opened the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962. She worked briefly at the family retailer, as a buyer of children's clothes, after graduating from Trinity University in Texas in 1971, before taking a job in New Orleans as a stockbroker for E.F. Hutton. Walton returned to Bentonville during the 1980s to run investment operations at her family's Arvest Bank, before launching a lending and brokerage shop of her own called Llama with $19.5 million of family money. When Llama shut down in 1998, Walton moved back to Texas and shifted her focus to curating art.

She chaired the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville for a decade, before handing the reins to her nephew Tom Walton's wife, Olivia Walton, in 2021. Alice is credited with founding the museum, which sits on 120 acres and features works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keeffe, after realizing there wasn't anything like it within 300 miles of her family's hometown. Nearly all of the $1.6 billion it cost to open the facility in 2011 came from trusts in the names of her late brother John Walton and mother Helen Walton (d. 2007).

Alice Walton has ramped up her own philanthropy over the past decade, however, pouring more than $5.7 billion into five family charitable foundations that have doled out more than $1.1 billion of her funds to date. That includes an estimated $380 million gifted through the Walton Family Foundation (which her parents founded on Walmart's 25th anniversary in 1987) to organizations focused on education reform, the environment and the region surrounding Bentonville. It also includes more than $375 million that Alice's Art Bridges Foundation has spent acquiring and loaning out works of American art to more than 230 museums across the country -- including the Art Institute of Chicago, the MoMA in New York City and the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. -- since its founding in 2016.

Walton is also seeking accreditation for a new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine in Bentonville that will ""enhance traditional medical education with the arts, humanities, and whole health principles."" If all goes according to plan, the school will enroll its inaugural class of four-year MD candidates in 2025.

""Over the past several years, I've founded new organizations focused on the arts as well as health and well-being,"" Walton said in a press release announcing her retirement as chair of the Crystal Bridges museum in 2021. ""I'd like to focus more fully on my board chair roles at these entities."""
What To Expect For Interest Rates From The November Fed Meeting,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/01/what-to-expect-for-interest-rates-from-the-november-fed-meeting/,2024-10-01T06:52:00Z,"On November 7, the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to again lower interest rates after an initial cut on September 18. Markets currently expect a 0.25% reduction in interest rates to 4.5% to 4.75%. However, a larger 0.5% reduction is possible depending on reported economic data over the coming weeks.

The FOMC will meet November 6-7 announcing its interest rate decision at 2pm E.T. on November 7. It is slightly unusual that the decision will be announced on a Thursday rather than the typical Wednesday. This will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30pm. Economic projections are released at every other meeting, and were last updated on September 18, so they will not be updated at the November FOMC meeting. Minutes of the meeting, offering greater color on the decision making process, are then typically scheduled to be released 3 weeks later.

The FOMC is currently appears to be dialing back restrictive monetary policy as inflation is now clearly within sight of their 2% target, and the labor market has seen broadly rising unemployment over the past 12 months, albeit from low levels.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index showed 2.2% annual inflation to August 2024, or 2.7% with food and energy price trends excluded. That's down significantly from the peak levels of 7% in summer 2022, which prompted the FOMC to raise rates aggressively. In addition, even at the best of times, the FOMC has been unable to hold inflation precisely at 2%. As such, deviations of around one percent from target are historically quite typical.

The unemployment rate is 4.2% for August 2024. That's up from around 3.5% for much of last year. Unemployment still remains at low levels by historical standards and the FOMC has expressed confidence in the job market, seeing a return to greater balance, rather than the start of ongoing weakening. Nonetheless, even relatively small rises in unemployment have often bought recessions historically.

As Powell said on September 18. ""We know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even.""

As always the FOMC will watch incoming data closely before their next meeting. Perhaps the most significant of many reports will be two jobs reports on October 4 and November 1. Here the FOMC is generally comfortable with some cooling in the jobs market, but is looking to avoid a more abrupt rise in unemployment that could signal a recession.

For inflation, key data points will come with the Consumer Price Index for September on October 10, and the PCE inflation release also for September on October 31. The broad expectation here is that inflation should continue to trend toward 2% and won't bring cause for alarm. However, jobs data may prove more significant in shaping the FOMC's thinking. If there is a further rise in unemployment, then the FOMC may be prompted to make larger interest rate cuts to counter recession risk.

It is highly likely that short-term interest rates are cut again on November 7, according to fixed income markets. Yet, it is unclear how large the cut will be, with a 0.25% cut viewed as more likely than 0.5%. However, there's ample time for that to change. More fundamentally, markets are assessing how low interest rates will ultimately go. Currently, short-term interest rates could be around 3% by late 2025, but markets project a broad range of outcomes, implying that anything from 2% to 4% is possible."
From Climate Purist To Climate Pragmatist: The Case Of Kamala Harris,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakashdolsak/2024/09/30/from-climate-purist-to-climate-pragmatist-the-case-of-kamala-harris/,2024-10-01T03:25:01Z,"How should we assess whether a politician is pro-climate, anti-climate, or somewhere in between? We probably look at what they say and what they do. If so, we might be witnessing a climate policy convergence between Democrats and Republicans, much more than what is typically acknowledged. This means that some liberals are no longer climate purists and some conservatives are no longer climate skeptics. They are becoming climate pragmatists.

The rise of climate pragmatism is visible in different forms. Some liberals recognize the tension between decarbonization on the one hand and jobs, inflation, and energy security on the other. Consequently, they have softened the rhetoric on ending reliance on fossil fuels. At the same time, conservatives recognize the inevitable shift away from fossil fuels because solar and wind are economically competitive. Seeing the writing on the wall, they are supporting climate-friendly industries.

While climate pragmatism might reflect political opportunism, we view it as a positive development that negates ""litmus test politics,"" and facilitates policy progress. Kamala Harris of 2024, in a sharp deviation from Kamala Harris of 2016-20, epitomizes the emerging climate pragmatism.

Kamala Harris' Evolving Climate Positions

In 2016, California's Attorney General Kamala Harris sued the Obama administration over permitting hydraulic fracturing. In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. In the 2020 Presidential primaries, Candidate Harris said, ""I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.""

Fast forward to September 2024. In the TV debate with Trump, she supported fracking and even took credit for the largest increase in oil production in history: ""I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking ... We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history...""

Now consider another policy issue: Electric Vehicles (EVs.) In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act, which required ""the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a zero-emission passenger vehicle standard. Specifically, the bill sets a schedule for increasing the percentage of zero-emission vehicles a manufacturer delivers for sale, culminating in a requirement to sell only zero-emission vehicles from 2040 on."" In 2024, she does not support the EV mandate.

Critics might call this opportunism. Instead, we suggest that she is a climate pragmatist who is not bound by ideological litmus tests, and who is open to changing policy positions in response to political imperatives and economic opportunities. She is a politician, not an ideologue -- and this is a good quality if we want policy progress in a polarized world.

Harris is not alone in evolving into a climate pragmatist; she is joined by a growing cadre of Republicans and Democrats.

Republicans and Climate Skepticism

Republicans are supposed to be an anti-climate party. Historically, many have questioned climate science -- and a handful probably continue to do so. They support investments in fossil fuel exploration, extraction, refining, and pipelines. Trump is a vocal supporter of coal. Not a single House or Senate Republican voted for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In recent years, Republican Attorney Generals and Congressional leaders have pursued companies supporting the pro-climate ESG metric alleging that these companies are neglecting their fiduciary duties, or unlawfully colluding to impose liberal agendas.

And yet, Republican Governors are supporting renewable energy. Texas leads the country in utility-scale wind and solar. Indiana's Governor Holcomb is an outspoken champion of renewable energy. Republican Governors (but for South Dakota's Governor Noem) are actively courting EV, solar, and wind manufacturing industries which have received generous federal subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats and Fossil Fuels

Democrats are supposed to be the pro-environment party that seeks vigorous climate action. Many of them sponsored the Green New Deal Resolution in the U.S. House and the Senate. They enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest infusion of federal monies in climate policy.

And yet, the Biden-Harris administration celebrates the rise of America as an energy superpower, driven primarily by fracking. It allowed Alaska's Willow Project despite vocal opposition from environmental groups and Biden's pledge of ""no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period."" It supports the massive investment in LNG pipelines and terminals for exporting fracked gas. Leading Pennsylvania Democrats, Governor Shapiro and Senators Casey and Fetterman do not support a fracking ban either. Alaska's lone House Member, Mary Pelota, a Democrat, claims credit for pressuring the Biden Administration to approve the Willow project. Ohio's Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown wants to overturn the EPA rule that limits greenhouse gas emissions from power plants as well as the vehicle tailpipe emissions rule.

In sum, ideological purity might have become less salient in driving climate policy. Instead, politicians are responding to local/state-level factors, a good development because it bridges the democracy deficit. Democrats from fracking states support fossil fuels. Republicans from a state with wind and solar potential support renewable energy. Hopefully, voters will reward climate pragmatism and policy evolution. They will assess politicians not by what they said in the past, but by what they say now and importantly, what they do. With this yardstick, Democrats and Republicans will have additional incentives to embrace climate pragmatism and work together on climate issues."
Here's How To Help Those Impacted By Hurricane Helene,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/09/30/heres-how-to-help-those-impacted-by-hurricane-helene/,2024-10-01T02:59:24Z,"Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations -- like checking to see that the organization has its paperwork in order -- are good rules to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

Over the weekend, many of my friends were worried about their children, parents, and other loved ones. Hurricane Helene brought flooding rains to parts of the southeast, including western North Carolina-the result was widespread power outages, washed-out roads, and a lack of cell phone service. At least 133 deaths have been attributed to the storm, and days later, hundreds are still searching for their loved ones and millions are without power. It's clear that recovery will be slow.

If you want to know what you can do to help out, here are a few tips:

Cash is king. While you may want to send food and other items, the infrastructure may not support those donations. Many organizations have been clear that cash, or cash equivalent, is preferred. Keep receipts if you intend to claim those donations on your tax return.

Be smart. Be wary of personal solicitations on your doorstep or over the phone. Make sure that gifts made by checks or credit card gifts are secure. And don't send money by text or using apps like Venmo without verifying the organization and contact information. If you don't want to donate online or by text, most organizations have alternatives, like donation forms that you can mail together with a check. Never send cash through the mail.

Check credentials. Check out the credentials of a potential charitable organization before you donate. If you're looking for a tax break, you can always confirm their charitable status through the IRS website using the TEOS Search Tool. You also can confirm your charitable status by calling the IRS (toll-free) at 1.877.829.5500. Keep in mind that churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques are considered de facto charitable organizations and are eligible to receive deductible donations even if they're not on the list (some exceptions apply, so be sure and ask if you're not sure). Forbes also maintains a list of charities -- you can check out our Top Charities 2023 list here.

Use caution when donating to individuals. For federal income tax purposes, you can only deduct contributions to qualified tax-exempt charitable organizations. Donations to individuals are never deductible for tax purposes, even if the individuals are really deserving. If the tax deduction is important to you, consider working with an organization that provides disaster relief (there are some listed below). But there's another, non-tax reason to use caution: money solicited for individuals could be part of a scam (like this one) and even if it's not, the money might not be spent as advertised. Once you hand over the cash, you have no control over its use.

Rely on oldies but goodies. There's nothing wrong with new charitable organizations but there is something to be said for those that have been around for a while. Brand new organizations may not have the facilities in place to offer the most effective relief, or they could be scams. Use caution before handing over your cash.

Pay attention to the rules and keep good records. The rules for charitable giving apply even in extraordinary situations, although sometimes those rules may be tweaked to allow for more generosity. Be sure to document your gifts and get receipts -- the IRS requires that you do so for tax purposes, and having the information available is handy if you want to follow up with another donation. Don't hesitate to ask the charitable organization or your tax professional if you have questions.

If you want to help but aren't sure where to start, tax-exempt charities that have indicated they are accepting Helene-specific donations include:

American Red Cross. To make a financial donation, visit redcross.org, call 1-800-435-7669, mail a donation form, or text REDCROSS to 90999 to donate to American Red Cross Disaster Relief, which helps people affected by disasters such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and tornadoes.

Save the Children. Save the Children is partnering with local organizations in Florida, Tennessee, and South Carolina to meet the needs of children and families affected by the storm. The Children's Emergency Fund will move pre-positioned child-focused supplies -- including hygiene kits, diapers, and baby wipes -- as well as classroom cleaning kits to schools and child care centers.

United Way. Local United Way organizations are accepting donations to help relief efforts. You can donate here.

World Central Kitchen. To help Chef José Andrés feed those impacted by Hurricane Helene, visit WCK's website.

University of North Carolina system. The UNC System is working closely with leaders at Appalachian State University, University of North Carolina Asheville, and Western Carolina University, as well as the North Carolina Arboretum and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (in the interest of disclosure, NCSSM is my alma mater), to provide aid and support in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. To help:

(Please note that these are not endorsements of a specific charity. If you're not a fan of those organizations listed, many other charities would welcome your support.)

As you consider which organizations might make the best use of your gifts, don't forget to consider the impact that your charitable donations might make on your taxes. Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations -- like checking to see that the organization has its paperwork in order -- are good rules to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

If you want to make sure that your charitable donations count for tax purposes, you have to follow a few rules. A tax deduction for charitable giving isn't guaranteed just because you're feeling generous. Here's what you need to know:

Itemize. To claim a charitable deduction on your tax return, you must itemize your deductions.

Choose carefully when donating. Remember, only donations to qualified charitable organizations are deductible.

Get a receipt -- even for cash. As a best practice, always ask for a receipt. Almost any charitable organization will happily offer you one. You don't have to submit this documentation along with your tax return, but you need to be prepared to provide it in case of an audit. Cash donations, no matter the amount, must be substantiated by a bank record such as a canceled check or credit card receipt, clearly annotated with the name of the charity or in writing from the organization. The writing must include the date, the amount, and the organization that received the donation.

Don't overlook payroll deductions. Your employer may participate in a charitable giving program that allows you to make contributions directly from your paycheck. If you make a contribution by payroll deduction, record-keeping requirements require that you retain a pay stub, form W-2, or other document furnished by your employer that shows the total amount withheld as a charitable donation, along with the pledge card that shows the name of the charity. For federal workers, a pledge card with the name of a Combined Federal Campaign will meet these requirements.

Pay attention to the value of any donor incentives. A charitable donation is deductible only to the extent that the donation exceeds the value of any goods or services received in exchange. If you make a donation and receive something in exchange -- anything from a coffee mug to a plated dinner -- you can only deduct the cost of your donation less the value of the item received. If you're not sure of the value of an item or service received after a donation, just ask. Most charitable organizations will do the math for you and document the value of your donation on their thank you letter or receipt.

Consider donating appreciated assets. Donating property that has appreciated in value, like stock, can result in a double benefit. Not only can you deduct the property's fair market value (so long as you've owned it for at least one year), but you will also avoid paying capital gains tax. Normally, appreciated assets are subject to capital gains tax at disposition -- whether by selling or gifting -- but there's an exception for donations to charitable organizations.

Don't forget about retirement assets. Typically, if you want to make a donation from your IRA, you'd have to withdraw those funds, pay the tax, and then make the donation. There is an exception: a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) allows you to roll funds directly from your IRA to a qualified charity. Those amounts can be used to satisfy your required minimum distributions (RMDs) for the year, and the amount donated is excluded from your taxable income -- you won't even have to itemize to do it. The total amount of QCDs that you can exclude from your gross income increased to $105,000 in 2024, up from $100,000 in 2023.

You can't deduct the value of your time. The IRS does not allow a charitable deduction for volunteering your services, even if you can easily put a dollar amount on your time. So if, as an architect, you usually charge $350 per hour and use that time to help a qualified charitable organization, you're allowed a deduction of $0 -- that's not a typo. The same rule applies whether you're a lawyer, doctor, artist, nurse, accountant, or writer at Forbes.

You can deduct expenses related to volunteering. While you can't deduct the value of your time, most out-of-pocket expenses relating to volunteering are deductible so long as they're not reimbursed to you or considered personal. Out-of-pocket charitable expenses that might be deductible include parking fees and tolls; other travel expenses; uniforms or other related clothing worn as part of your charitable service; and supplies used in the performance of your services. For 2024, the rate for mileage driven in service of charitable organizations is just 14 cents per mile. The rate is currently fixed by Congress and is never adjusted for inflation -- which is why it hasn't budged in years, even though gas is more expensive. As with other donations, keep good records for out-of-pocket expenses -- documentation is critical.

Document the value of your gift. Good records are always important when it comes to charitable giving, but even more so when it comes to donations of noncash items. You can generally take a deduction for the item's fair market value -- the price a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller. If you're self-documenting the donation because it's less than $500, be specific, noting the description and condition of the items. If you contribute property worth more than $5,000, you must obtain a written appraisal of the property's fair market value. If you make noncash contributions (generally over $500), you may also be required to fill out one or more parts of Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions.

Limits may apply. The amount you can deduct for charitable contributions is generally limited to no more than 60% of your AGI. Your deduction may be further limited to 50%, 30%, or 20% of your AGI, depending on the type of property you give and the type of organization you give it to.

Contributions are tax-deductible in the year they are made. That means that to make your gifts count during the tax year, they should must be made by December 31. Contributions made by text message are deductible in the year you send the text message if the contribution is charged to your telephone or wireless account. Credit card charges -- even if they're not paid off before the end of the year -- are deductible so long as the amount is captured by year-end. Similarly, checks written and mailed by the end of the year will be deductible for this year even if they aren't cashed in 2023. And, good intentions don't count: making announcements that you intend to donate assets will not qualify for a deduction in the current tax year unless you make good on the pledge during the year.

As of the time this article was published, the IRS had not yet announced tax relief for those impacted by the storm, including extending the time to file for those individuals and businesses expected to file tax returns in October. The tax community expects that this will change and the Forbes tax team will provide an update once it is available."
"Harris' ""Opportunity Economy""  Closes The Economic Gap With Trump",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/30/harris-opportunity-economy--closes-the-economic-gap-with-trump/,2024-10-01T01:18:25Z,"With just over 30 days left until the presidential election, Kamala Harris is emphasizing an ""Opportunity Economy"" as a centerpiece of her campaign. Although Donald Trump held a substantial polling lead over Joe Biden on economic issues, Harris is now virtually even with Trump on economics. What's in her program that's closing the gap?

Harris' economic vision continually emphasizes the middle class -- not the poor, or minorities, or immigrants. They aren't central to her message and policies. Her campaign website says ""she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans."" And the ""Issues"" page on her website leads, in big bold letters, with ""Build An Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs For Families.""

Why ""lower costs for families?"" Because the biggest economic problem faced by Joe Biden -- and still faced by Harris -- is inflation. An August CBS News poll found that ""76% of registered voters said it (inflation) was a major factor in their choice for president."" And in May, an ABC News poll found Trump trusted over Biden on inflation ""by a margin of 14 percentage points.""

Inflation was driven by the Covid-19 pandemic's ""supply shock,"" with disruption to supply chains, the economy, and prices. The inflation rate has been trending downward, with the current rate of 2.5% the lowest since February of 2021. But consumers remain heavily scarred by the pandemic inflation, which reached an annual rate of 9.1% in June of 2022, a rate not seen since the oil shock inflation of the early 1980s.

Harris doesn't duck away from inflation. Her program calls for bringing down housing costs by building more, but also for ""legislation to outlaw new form of price fixing by corporate landlords."" Another major provision would ""take down bad actors and bring down costs,"" calling for the ""first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.""

Economists are skeptical about these policies. Yes, investors buy many homes to rent them out. But the vast majority of housing investors are small local landlords, not big corporations.

And even some Democratic economists don't endorse the attack on price gouging. Jason Furman, chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, says ""this is not sensible policy...there's no upside here, and there is some downside."" But economists like Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts argue that large and powerful firms took advantage of the pandemic shock to raise prices and generate profits beyond covering their costs -- what she calls ""sellers' inflation.""

Of course, Harris is running for president, not leading an economics seminar. And her attacks on price gouging are very popular. A new poll for The Guardian did a blind test of Harris' and Trump's economic ideas, and found Harris had ""four of the top five most popular proposals."" The most popular of twelve policies tested in the poll? A ""federal ban on price-gouging food and groceries.""

That's one reason Harris' has closed the ""trust gap"" with Trump on the economy. A recent Morning Consult poll found Harris and Trump were equally trusted on the economy, a major gain for the Democrats compared with Biden's double-digit polling gaps with Trump.

Harris' economic plan goes well beyond managing prices. She promises to continue (and perhaps expand) Biden's support for US manufacturing, using trade policy (including tariffs) and subsidies to support critical industries like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy. She ties these to other specific policies to lower energy costs and help with the climate crisis.

Although Harris endorses strategic, limited tariffs, she opposes Trump's plan to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 to 20%, and on imports from China by 60% or more. She calls this a ""tax"" on American households, and economists agree with her. Economists at Goldman Sachs, the Peterson Institute, the Tax Foundation, and the Tax Policy Foundation all find Trump's draconian tariffs would slow the economy, penalize households, and cause higher inflation.

Harris also want to focus on care work, both for children and for the elderly, as important for the economy. Better care would help workers -- the vast majority of them women -- better balance care responsibilities and their careers. And it would help the women workers who provide paid care work while suffering inadequate wages and working conditions.

Although commentators criticize Harris for not providing enough detail on her economic policies, her proposals are a model of clarity compared with what Trump offers. The New York Times reports Harris has distributed an 82-page booklet on her proposals, compared to Trump who has ""coughed up a string of four- or five-word slogans promising tax cuts, some of which his advisers cannot fully explain."" '

Harris also is battling complex economic views held by voters. In spite of continued job creation, rising real wages, slowing inflation, and continued GDP growth, consumer confidence is sending mixed signals. September's Survey of Consumers from the University of Michigan rose 3% above August, ""as consumers' expectations for the economy brighten."" But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index suffered its largest drop ""since August 2021"" between August and September.

We're in the home stretch of the election, so don't expect significantly more policy details from Harris. Rather, she will continue emphasizing economic security and opportunity for the middle class, contrasting her optimistic vision against a bleaker and less coherent approach from Donald Trump. So far, that's working in her favor."
